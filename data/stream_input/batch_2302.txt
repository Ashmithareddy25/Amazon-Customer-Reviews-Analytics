B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is so convenient to have on any of your device's, and very accurate! I really like the ease of using, especially on my kindle and Ipad!
B004F1F32A|3.0|A very intense action movie about a real underground problem. Significant drama is added to help you identify with the hero, and you are asked to suspend critical thinking to accept the movie. I did find it entertaining despite knowing how it will end (predictably). Definitely not recommended to watch with your teenage daughter.<br />Could have been more polished, but ok to watch as is. Seems to be good acting, script not as good, possible directorial shortcomings. The action and story combination will distract/shock you from being comfortable.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game as it helps so much to improve my reflex's. I am a 73 year old Grandmother, and am always trying to find games to help along the ageing process.

B00013RC8O|5.0|This film is just how I remember it. For those of you who have seen the re-make, don't waist your time. They removed most of the mystic that the original had by providing background of the lead character as well as giving it a completely different ending.
B0025YKDJC|1.0|I respect the producers of this movie. They did an excellent job of targeting the under educated, those with low IQ levels, and especially people with very short attention spans. If you are remotely intelligent, this film is an insult to creative humor at all levels.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I bought this watch because it was an automatic and it was ridiculously cheap.  Out of the box it ran 15-25 seconds fast per day, which I was okay with.  After a month or so it started running ridiculously fast, like a minute a day (I probably bashed it against something or dropped it), so I took the back off and regulated it (google regulating a seiko 5 and you will find instructions with pictures that are identical to what you find in this watch).  Regulating the watch was very easy, the only tools I used were scotch tape and a pair of pliers (I couldn't even find my needle noses, so I just got a smallish pair that fit the back of the case).  After guestimating how far I should push the little dial inside the back of the case, I closed it back up.  The watch is now running around 6 seconds fast for the week, under 1 second per day with no wild fluctuations.  I am sure that it was beginners luck with my spot on adjustment, but my point being that the watch is capable of fairly precise time keeping.<br /><br />The quality of the case is so so, the brushed finish shows scratches fairly easily, but the crystal is suprisingly resilient, I've bashed it against several metal surfaces and concrete walls, and so far the crystal itself is flawless.  It's probably also the smallest automatic watch you can find, which is a plus for me, I like the look of the smaller dial on my smaller wrist, a 46mm case usually looks gaudy on the wrist imo.  I'm not a fan of the strap, it had a tendency to fray rather easily and would drag lint and fibers through the sleeves of a fluffy hoodie (rather like weak velcro would), but that is changed easily enough.  The display back is nice (afterall you're buying it because it's a mechanical watch, innit?).<br /><br />It's certainly not the best watch you can buy for $50, but if you are interested in a mechanical watch and you don't want to drop $1,000 plus for a swiss, why not buy this and tinker with it a little.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Ifyou like the idea of an automatic watch, but everything else is out of your price range, you will probably be happy with it.<br />If you want a watch that keeps amazing time in this price range, this is not for you (you want a quartz)<br />If you want a cheap mechanical watch to take the back off of and play with, without having to worry about a second mortgage if you break something inside, THIS IS FOR YOU.

B000JQU4TW|5.0|Oscar Wilde was the person who really understood what aesthetics means. He also was probably a last true adept of the pure beauty. He is witty, humorous, and his language is just ideally perfect. The ideas, however, are powerful and of a very high moral level. But a reader is never bored with them (in opposite to Leo Tolstoy's, who was narcissistic with his own righteness).<br />This is a quote from the book:<br />&#34;But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face. The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions. How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful.&#34;

B007REV4YI|5.0|The Bond series reboot with Daniel Craig has transformed what had become a tired, silly franchise into a grown-up, complex, and deeply satisfying collection of films (OK, Quantum of Solace could have been better, but it was still better than anything that came along after Goldfinger). Skyfall takes the franchise a step further, delivering a movie experience that pays off big in every way: a compelling, complex, story, stunning visuals, and action sequences that never, ever descend into the cartoonishness that became the hallmark of the worst of the pre-Craig films. Skyfall rocks.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started watching this after two episodes.<br />I was so hooked, that I got season 1 and 2 as well!<br /><br />I can't wait foe season 4!!
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I like it a lot. I recommend this tv show to all the liberal people because it describe very accurately  how society is with some topics. Thanks
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I would rather pay a higher price and have the AP complete rather than be nickeled and dimed after the purchase.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|These days cpu's are no longer measured buy frequency alone( ghz ).  I am not a masters degree expert, but currently this cpu can handle any task at all.  There are 8 core cpu's out ther but top of the line is top of the line.  Now as in the present you can have a supercomputer custom built for you and put in you bedroom; of course you would have no room to sleep.  Back to top of the line this is it and they work HARD so if a world record of 7.0 ghz is not enough FINISH BUILDING YOUR COMPUTER THEN SE IF IT IS NOT, because this cpu is B.A.D.  p.s. I love amazon.

B000UZNRS2|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  The villains were all too real in their evil intentions.  Stories like this remind me how much I loathe politics.  I look forward to reading more of Mr. Baldacci's works.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Movie exceeded expectations, well printed case with embossed cover sleeve.<br />Rapid delivery to Australia, only concern was different regional code meant it could be played on dvd device but was unrecognised by my Xbox 360.<br />Well budgetted production, excellent plot and enjoyable to review again and again

B00821OX98|5.0|love this show hope they keep it up.<br /><br />I guess they want 12 more words so here they are lol.
B003UESJF6|5.0|If you're on the I-net you can almost find out everything you want to know about a movie. And I think the only people buying this DVD are folks who already love the film. But if you at least want an opinion, I'll tell you what I thought:<br /><br />I found this movie charming, sweet, funny, and not scary (like some kids' animated films can be) unless someone gets freaked out by the one scene with the skull on the floor.  But even that was silly.<br /><br />Megamind became evil because he was always sort of rejected at school.  And everything he did to try and help or be a good guy always went badly.  He finally decided that the only thing he was good at was being bad.  But, apparently, he was not too great at that either since he always lost in the end.  His... er... unique sidekick, Minion (a fish in a bowl connected to a giant robot gorilla body) is as lovable as poor Megamind.<br /><br />I am writing this review to try and be helpful, but I've found that everyone's taste in movies is like their taste in food: What one person absolutely loves, another may find impossible to swallow.  By no means is Megamind hard to swallow (although I did find myself &#34;choking&#34; on the movie, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs), and I cannot imagine anyone not liking this movie, but you just never know.<br /><br />If anyone remembers the Disney film, The Little Mermaid, you must remember Ursula the Witch. Remember how scary she was? I had brought my 3-year-old to see a happy little movie and was incredibly surprised that they put such a scary image in an otherwise delightful and harmless movie. You won't get surprised like that by this film. However, if your child might be freaked out by little flying robots with steel chompers (Megamind's pets) just be warned. They only appear for a few seconds 2 or 3 times in the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great sequel to the first temple run! And it more of an adventure! I recommend this game to anyone

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Story kept you interested. Couldn't put  it down. The last book was a strange twist and seemed far fetched for a 17  year old girl.
0375869026|1.0|I purchased this book and began reading it to my son because &#34;everybody was raving about it&#34;.  It teaches a lesson, but is poorly written and is not very good.  After about the first 50 pages, I stopped reading it to my son and finished the book myself.  I decidedI wasn't going to finish reading it to him because I don't believe in wasting valuable time spent with him reading something of this caliber.  I was horribly disappointed.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|Good only good or that I should say. I mean GOOD kickoff to the first book in a great 3,4, or 5 books.

B005LAIHR2|1.0|Watching Rock of Ages one is quickly reminded of the old existential teaser which stipulates that if you put an infinite number of monkeys in front of an infinite number of typewriters eventually one of the eager little simeons will type Shakespeare. Or, more plausibly, if these same monkeys are subjected to a free screening of Rock of Ages they will eventually run amok, rise against their masters and fitfully create their own Planet of the Apes sequel in order to redress such unremitting cruelty.  Rock of Ages is not just a bad film, it is an excruciatingly bad film with a rationale for being made that in my present state of disbelief, I cannot even fathom. From the first frames, where a Greyhound busload of Midwestern farmers spontaneously break out into a chorus of Night Ranger's cloying anthem Sister Christian, my jaw never left the floor. Fast-forward through the hackneyed Def Leppard meets Oklahoma, girl meets boy homage to 1980' s Hair Bands and you have an MTV inspired clusterf__k of Rock Me Like a Hurricane proportions.  And finally, overlay this mess with an Oscar-caliber cast (Paul Giamatti, Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta Jones, Bryan Cranston and a highly opiated Tom Cruise channeling Axl Rose) who all look like principals in a hostage video ready to fire their agents. All in all, see it if you must but like those monkeys at the keyboard, after 10 minutes of this mind numbing dreck you might find yourself burning every copy of this dystopian disaster that you can get your hands on.

B00AQ2KLEM|5.0|love the finale numbers best, but these musicals always pull out the stops - of course my favorite is from Breakfast Club which really goes to show - remaking songs sometimes does work and they're even better.
B00722Y1EK|2.0|Someone wrote a slam against anyone giving this product a less than 5-star review. It sounded like a defensive post from the creator of Cool Tool. This product is far too complicated for the normal user. The setup required is extensive and there is not nearly enough built in documentation to explain all the setting. What you end up with is a tiny, obscure, and hard to read graph with symbols and colors that are near meaningless. I am sure that the most dedicated and advanced users can make sense of this product, but it is anti-intuitive for the vast majority of us. I got the free version and then decided that maybe the paid version would make things clearer. Not so. This was only $1.99, but why waste money on scams like this when there are truly great products out there.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|you get to run over zombies and they jump on your car and there's these fat ones that blow up its just awesome

B00992CF6W|5.0|mindcraft is amazingly. awesome I can't. stop playing it if you love to build or create this is the best game for you
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Not sure if I've been ruined by the high-impact, action-packed movies, but this film bored me to tears.  I had to reboot my brain a few times while watching it.  I kept having to remind myself that I'm watching a movie and should probably pay attention to what was going on, but seriously my college history professor Mr. Bruce was way more entertaining than this film.<br /><br />Sorry Mr. Lewis, you did a great job but this is a snore fest.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I resisted watching this series because I never took the time to watch from the beginning!  I really think they do a good job with it- the characters are engaging and it creates nice plots and twists.  I have been pleasantly surprised- even shocked at how much I have enjoyed Season 1 and 2.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|not much to story  would not have purchased if i knew that this was about such a boring story do not waste your time
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I found this to be a better version of Emma- may not be perfect.  The book is still the best- but at least I didn't get tired of Emma.  She was less snobbish and I got a sense of her immaturity more so than her arrogance! It was entertaining and light! All the characters were done pretty well.  I could say some were better in other versions but as a whole- It was better.  Emma and Mr. Knightly were better suited together- although I do like Jeremy Northam's version too!  Enough- it is worth the viewing!!
B002LL13BQ|5.0|This was an outstanding performane of the actors and the producer.<br />The original set of the metropolitan opera was perfect.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Hats off to the author, a captivating book from start to finish. I would recommend this book to a friend.
1400069807|5.0|Yes, I said fat-burner!  Throughout many parts of Moss' book, I was so infuriated I had to be burning up calories just from the smoke shooting out of my ears!<br /><br />If this book doesn't awaken you to the looming dangers ahead, as I believe is the author's intent, then don't ever say that you weren't fairly warned.  Moss has meticulosly and painstakingly revealed the food industry for what it is:  Capitolism gone wild.  The general health of the public is only of secondary concern.  Furthermore, the author has made it quite clear that the federal government has done little, and most likely will continue to do little, to ever regulate this industry to the benefit of the public at large,  And brother, the public is large and getting larger.<br /><br />I disagree with one reviewer's criticism that Moss fails to put forth any solution.  First, he does not pretend to be a personal trainer, nor a nutritionist, nor a government servant that could act to change existing laws.  Instead, as all good authors do, he educates his reader and lets them decide for themselves.<br /><br />For me, I went out and bought a juicer and loaded up on the tilapia.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it & so do my kids!!! This is a very good recommendation in my opinion if you like games like Temple Run.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|This is a well written book and interesting story. I couldn't put it down. Definitely worth a read. Also enjoyed the audio option.
0740797719|5.0|As an artist learning digital painting, I was excited by this book's clear approach to the various lighting conditions one might be called upon to portray, and to Gurney's insightful comments on palettes.  I have not yet absorbed the whole book, but I can see that it will become a principle reference on my library shelf.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|This is another great hidden object game from Nevosoft. The graphics are so sharp that the game can easily be played on a 7&quot; Kindle Fire. It also toggles between zoom &amp; normal. The story line is cute but a bit schmaltzy. There are mini games throughout but it is not too hard to play them. If you are lookingfor a difficult game,  this is probably not for you!
1423117166|5.0|As an animator who draws, whenever I page through a book on animation, I look for one thing above all else: reproductions of the actual pencil drawings of the animators, and the more the better.  This book is nothing BUT animation drawings, which is as close as you can get to the heart and soul of an animator.  For me it will be an endless source of inspiration.
B005LAJ212|2.0|So much of TV these days is just pretty people in peril, which is why something original like Revenge was so refreshing. Sure, it had the pretty people. Sure, they were in peril. But they weren't in danger of wearing skirts that actually covered their private parts or shoes they could really walk in or who was sleeping with who. No, the pretty people were in danger from a murderous vengeful woman who was going to utterly destroy each and every one of the people who disgraced and murdered her father.<br /><br />Now that's a premise worth a look. Throw in a great cast and wonderful production values and, wow, a show actual worth watching. A miracle!<br /><br />For the first 18 episodes anyway.<br /><br />Then Revenge became what it was trying most not to be: a true soap opera. Who is sleeping with whom? Who is a scuzzy businessman? Who suffers under the family curse? Will Amanda/Emily find true love with Jack?<br /><br />Yawn.<br /><br />To these soap opera elements were added ideas pulled stale from the human nether regions of the writers as a second season loomed and Emily/Amanda was supposed to HAVE her revenge by the end of Season One. Instead the story got muddied up, soap opera tropes reared their ugly heads and Revenge became Dallas 2.0.<br /><br />My wife and I sat though the first season. We will not be watching Season Two. If the show lasts long enough to get back to what it is supposed to be about, we might return for the finale. Otherwise, we're moving on. Bottom line here is that if you're new to the show and are chomping at the bit to see the premise pay off, you will be disappointed. If, on the other hand, you like seeing pretty people in peril from every cliche in the book, then Revenge has what you're looking for.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book so much I was sad to see it end. It does everything a good romantic story should. It makes you cry, laugh, worry about the characters and fill you with the same feelings as the characters. I truly enjoyed this story and will definitely be buying another Nicholas Sparks book very soon!!!!!
B005FFW46S|5.0|As always, Terry Pratchett's excellent grasp of husbandry is well represented in this novel.  So much so that I will be sending my dear, if somewhat clueless future husband, the entire Watch collection for his reference. (p.s. if you can have a future porks warehouse, I should be allowed a future husband).
0486274268|5.0|What a deal !!  If I was still teaching art, I would have bought a class set.  Great for beginners, but with enough info for anyone wanting to make their drawings more interesting & lifelike.  There are 130 pages packed with basic shapes, action poses, caricature, &  perspective.  The the perspective drawings show front, back, & side views.  They are very helpful.  There are over 20 pages on horses & zebras & 20 pages on the cat family.  He also includes deer, rabbits, squirrels, elephants, bears, pigs, camels, giraffes, cows & bulls, kangaroos, & gorillas.  My only disappointment was there were only about 11 pages on dogs & foxes & no pages on wolves.  Very pleased with this book !
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|General PDF utility which is compatible in most part with the product available on the PC.  Like the ease of use.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|This, along with Kremer's earlier recording on Philips, are among my favorite versions of these works.  Kremer's playing has a sense of spontaneity and variety, despite the fact that he has certainly planned every phrase very carefully.  Tempi tend to be on the brisk side, so that one never loses the sense of structure of each movement.<br /><br />The recorded sound is superb, which emphasizes Kremer's rather astringent tone, and his occasional aggressive attacks.  But for me, his tone is all of a piece with his interpretations, and a more classically beautiful violin sound would make this a very different (and to me, less interesting) interpretation.  But this recording will certainly sound better on a better audio system - if you're listening to mass market electronics and cheap speakers (or if your system emphasizes treble), it may well be unlistenable to some ears.
0385342063|5.0|I always enjoy Sophie Kinsella books and this is no exception. This is one of those \\"read in one day\\" books. I coudn't put it down and enjoyed every minute of it.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this game is fantastic.It has the most important stations for taking care of a real horse.I mean I would know I go over to CT every summer to work at my friend's farm.I'd recommend this app to anyone who loves and admires horses or even if you just started taking care of horses and you have know idea what your doing.So yes I do think you should download this app;but hey it's only my opinion.
B0052UYJDC|3.0|This book really isn't what I expected.  I thought it would offer more suggestions on how to live minimally.  I didn't hate it but it wasn't as useful as I thought. I do regret buying it and wish I would have borrowed it from the library.

B00BCZU8WM|1.0|Wow not impressed at all. Only song I loved was Mirrors. Other than that, it sounds like he just loved recording his own voice...like at the end of some of the song ....he would just say the song title over and over. Every song is like 7 min longs..and just noise. No catchy hook...when would you ever play this music? It's not club, or radio friendly, and it's not sexy enough to just have in the background...just a dissapointment.
B004DF3S7A|4.0|It's good.  But not as good as Rod's &#34;As Time Goes By.&#34;  But love the old classics and he does a great job..
B003V1WXKU|4.0|Muy entretenido. Richard Feynman tiene una manera única de ver a la vida y el aprendizaje, un curioso en todo sentido.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was great it had everything it was funny sad tragic and had a silver lining,I can't wait now to see the movie!!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett has always been a good story teller but in the last few years he has become a great story teller combining historical reality with great fiction.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|Let me tell you how good Veronica Mars is.  After finishing up Season 1 at around Midnight, I couldn't help but watch the first couple of episodes of season 2. After that, I was through with season 2 in a day and a half.  Great plot twists and turns, great writing, and sassy and smart dialog.  It'<br />s rare that a sophomore season is as strong as the first, but this one is.  I'd rate them about equal but I could see where individual taste could put one over the other.  My only problem is I waited too long to order season 3 and now have to wait till this afternoon before it arrives.  How will I survive without the gang from Neptune!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show!  My son got me hooked on it and now I can't wait for each new episode!!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|addictive really addictive. keeps you playing for hours. a little anoyed by the money stuff but I get it. if it weren't for that 5 stars.
0061733199|5.0|This book is packed with excellent information.<br />I have been into survival skills all my life. this book has many common sense approaches to survival preparation that I never would have thought of. This book is going in my BUG OUT BAG.<br /><br />thank you
B009K0P10K|5.0|Wow, this show is amazing! Always has my full attention. I hate that I've already caught up to the most recent episode and now I have to wait a whole week to watch the next, but it's so worth it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent read!  Characters are well-developed and misdirection keeps you guessing on how story will unfold.  Will be following this author.
B00BQLSB3A|1.0|Not a bad movie. Just bad of people who buy up limited copies of movies other people wanted and sell them for profit. Stick with your DVD. No movie is worth those prices
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This biography appeared to be an honest and telling description of the life and career of Steve Jobs.  It is a must read for anyone interested in entrepreneurship, leadership, sales, or business management.  It provides insight into the does and don'ts of developing and managing a businesss.
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|Catching up on past missed seasons, always liked show. Can watch it on HD computer screen while I am working.
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|The game play is OK, but it gets somewhat ridiculous having to get so many matches of the three items in addition to clearing the tiles. I do enjoy the game, but I find it aggravating.
B005SAJJHM|4.0|This show ROCKS! Good writing, VERY good delivery, the bad news is, these kids probably have two seasons left before the country gets bored with the show.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the book and I love the movie.  The movie is an excellent visual depiction of the book.  Very well done, I highly recommend it.
B005NK69ZC|5.0|What a wonderful Ellen monologue. You can really imagine her speaking through this book in the style of her stand-up comedy. I'm not sorry that I purchased this.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I find Yahoo products to be troublesome in many respects, and Yahoo Mail is a typical example.  Difficult to understand how to view attachments, and difficult to get rid of junk mail once and for all.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This was a wonderful saga.  One of the discs had quite a few hesitations but they continued after a few moments and the story went on.  This set is a classic which I will cherish and I can't wait until the next saga begins.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|The most incredibly biased and partisan book I've read in years. Confirms that most Nobel Laureates never contribute anything worthwhile after award of the prize. Completely ignores impact of demographics. Self-promoting narcissist.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good story.  Somewhat typical of the times.  Mostly sad but ends well.  It was rather lengthy but still  quite interesting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed this second part of the trilogy. Author did a great job in making these characters lovable and getting her audience to root for their relationship to succeed. Looking forward to reading the final book.
6305922756|5.0|The funniest movie ever made!! The film is great and with a whole movie's worth of extras on the second DVD it's twice the metal laugh fest :)
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|I have always loved Liam Neesan in everything he is in and this is one of his best performances.  Great movie and I will treasure it.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I have been a lot of places with Steve, we've walked the world with the gunslinger, ridden Blain chased aliens, experienced twinners and lobstrosities and I have loved each and every adventure, I have never been disappointed until now.  Normally when you ride with Steve he will start out slow, let you get the lay of the land, then the s*** hits the fan, you deal with whatever it is then you get to coast to a slow and easy stop.  You can get out/off, shake your head and say man what a ride.  Mile 81? Not so much, this is the first book by Steve K. that I don't like, he gave the good start, the easy speed up, went fast and wild for a minute....then splat.....nada...nothing, like he just stopped writing this story and went somewhere.    What kind of story ends with with the bad guy going straight up in the air then.............zip.  Bulls*** to pay anything for this POS, nothing more than a lost leader without anything to buy afterward.  Don't waste your time.
B005LAIIFS|4.0|Liked it ok.  It was a good story of good overcoming evil.  But unfortunately it was a little disappointing.  I had hoped for a lighted hearted story and it was very dark.  Not much like a family movie
0553293397|5.0|A great re-read; it has been so long since I read Asimov, I really was still in suspense.  Old friends and ideas were great to revisit.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Waking Up Married was a fun book to read, especially on vacation. Sure easy to get books free online ,price is right
006224454X|2.0|I give this book 2 stars because I did finish it and enjoyed the first bit of the book.  I really wish I had not wasted my time.  I kept hoping that something would happen that was not predictable.  It did seem so promising at first.  On to the next book.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|Ad-free to me is you don't have to face a sales pitch. this  still tries to sell features and upgrades at every turn and it spoils the experience.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I felt some of the plot twists in this book were pretty predictible. I get that the point of the book is that not everything has a silver lining... but this book was a bit too &#34;life sucks&#34; for me.
B008M721MS|1.0|No clear guide on how to get to the page where you can make calls. When you do find it (it takes a second download) you have a hard time getting and keeping a video connection. We tried this locally and with my son in Korea. We met all the technical requirements and it was not the connection. I found a review on the net that said that Microsoft ruined Skype. Not at all what I expected given my previous experience with Skype.
B0063IH60K|2.0|Don't care for the ads popping up - it's very irritating. Don't think I will be playing this one even if it was FREE.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|missed the actul show time for the Mentalist and wanted to stay with the story line<br /><br />Saw Ads for the two movies on TV  and on Facebook
B00BUL0IHI|3.0|Not that great but a few tracks are OK. What do you expect when the artist does not even like it.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|I honestly think that it's a good game but the reward pop up, . It kinda narrows everything down from a good game to a kinda good game

B0054SMIH6|4.0|Nice Plot and good movie.  Grab some popcorn, chill with with your favorite person and enjoy some entertainment.  I could watch again.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read, the twists and turns were not contrived. My first MIchael Connelly book, I'll read more, I can't believe I haven't read any of his before.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Really makes you think. Great points and situations to helps working moms and at home moms. I would recommend this book to everyone.
0345803493|5.0|When I first saw the book I didn't think it was anything I would ever read. a friend told  me to try it and I was hooked. I finished book one and went straight to book two.<br />In this book we discover more about the childhood of the ever secretive Christian Grey. Anastasia struggles to make a name for herself outside of Christian's shadow which is hard to do in a place where the man is so well known. She also must deal with the past loves of Christian's life and the fact that they might be ready to let him go.<br /><br />I loved this book. It was one of those that I just couldn't put down. If you haven't read the trilogy then I would highly recommend this one
B007BFSYMS|4.0|The app is easy to use and has a nice variety of sounds. I am a very light sleeper and this has really helped.
0547884591|5.0|I picked this book for my future son-in-law who is a chef. He absolutely loved it as well as myself! It was very clear and informative both on food prep, recipes, and many other tasks that you can use. Awesome book and great price!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|this book was so good.  i couldn't put it down.  read it in less than a weekend.  had a great ending.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Usual Lee Childs suspense and quite good. Well worth the reading time invested.  I would recommend it as I truly enjoy Mr Childs' books.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have been sleeping with a very noisy muffin fan (cooling fan from a 1980s-vintage piece of electronics) for years (the steady drone masks random background noises).  The problem I run into is that when I travel the hotels do not always have heat/air fans which you can control to produce the needed drone and this little app should fit the bill perfectly!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was slow at first and it took me awhile to get in to it. Once I did,I couldn't put it down. Have your Kleenex ready like with all Nicholas Sparks books!
0810996596|5.0|Being a collector myself (although my collection is completely surpassed by Kirk's) and a Metallica fan, this book was something I knew I needed to check out. To say Kirk's collection is impressive would be an insult, it's more than impressive. I envy this collection. The book is full of color photos of his entire horror collection, including posters, masks, props and so much other cool stuff. There is also brief explanation's of the merchandise and a lot of other cool stuff thrown in the mix. I recommend this for ANY horror fan or even if your just a fan of Metallica. Awesome book!
B00B69UQJY|2.0|I've been listening to these guys since my high school days and I assume they're in the 50s by now, or damn close to it.  I expect more from people with that sort of life experience than to be spouting off vague, sometimes bleak, sometimes self involved stuff like this.<br /><br />Music for the Masses, Violator, Songs of Faith, Ultra were wonderful because they had a healthy mix of up tempo songs that could be dark (sometimes weren't)and slower songs that could be dark (and sometimes weren't).  This album focuses almost primarily on SLOWER songs (with things that barely resemble melody) that are dark both musically and lyrically.  The end result is bleak, with about 4 songs that could've been a pretty good EP (Heaven, Soft Touch, Soothe My Soul, Should be Higher) thrown in there to show the album at least doesn't deserve 1 star (nice melody on Heaven, great feel and okay lyrics for rock n roll on the other three).end result is bleak, with about 4 songs that could've been a pretty good EP (Heaven, Soft Touch, Soothe My Soul, Should be Higher) thrown in there to show the album at least doesn't deserve 1 star (nice melody on Heaven, great feel and okay rock lyrics on the other three).  It's time to grow up DM, reinvent yourselves one last time.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Practically identical to the controllers included with the playstation 3. What more could you want? The finish is ever so slightly different but barely noticeable.
B00821OX98|3.0|I love shows about aliens but this show doesn't tell a very interesting story. It is very realistic, probably like the way life would be if aliens actually did want to conquer Earth. The real Extra Terrestrials which is what they prefer to be called, would probably have a swifter way of getting rid of all of us. But this show was just a little boring to sit and watch. Not as interesting as V 1 or 2 or Independence day.
0451191153|4.0|I don't wish to spoil the book for anyone, but I will say that Atlas Shrugged does most everything the Fountainhead does, but better. The mass media paperback has a fair price, but the shipping was more than the book's price and took two weeks, which I found lacking.
B00338QENI|4.0|This is not the usual bedtime read. At times I felt like it was a textbook and I would have a lesson plan after. But, overall I was still impressed with the information. I had no idea who Henrietta Lacks was nor anything about He La cells. I did read the book through so it was lively enough to keep me interested. A book that I would recommend to my co-workers because of the interesting subject matter. It's kinda nice to learn something new.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book will change how you feel about yourself and others. It is a simple way to see how people have love tanks and if not filled they can cause emotional pain. It is amazing how you will start to think of others and how you recognize their love languages just by how they talk. It is a way to be a loving person in society and to show the Love of God to others....must read for everyone
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Every time I read this book, I cry. Every page leads you to a new place and she brings you to a new understanding of the world she built and the nature of humanity. The characters build upon themselves until you see a new light.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Friends had been telling me how enjoyable this series is, but I wasn't sure I'd enjoy a period production. I finally decided to watch the 1st episode of season 1 and became hooked. The stories are surrounded by historical events and the characters are well developed. The acting and directing are top notch. I'm almost sorry that I'm about to start season 3, since that means I'll be caught up and will have to start waiting on new episodes.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I rated this movie a Five Star because it is very entertaining and very well produced.  The movie holds your interest from the beginning to the finish.  Clint Eastwood does a wonderful job of portraying a grumpy old man but with a loving heart.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|I like the character, the stories, and will read anything Connelly writes about Harry Bosch.  I would like to see a movie.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|A great movie with extras that provide a behind the screens look at the real people involved in this story.  Highly recommended.
B00785P2QC|2.0|Nice a bit time consuming but that is to be expected from rpg...iron maiden rules!!!<br /> Eba deba dib..that's all folks
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Michael Lewis' research, character development, financial instrument definitions and writing style made this book on what has to be the greatest crime in financial history entirely captivating.<br /><br />I wonder what percentage of the investing public has any idea of the depth of depravity, arrogance and naivete that constituted this sorry era.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If u like minecraft for xbox u will like it on the kindle fire. There was no problems at all.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Impecable presentación, entrega asombrosamente rápida, quedé muy satisfecha. Disfruté ver la serie completa, sin interrupciones. Un regalo que valió la pena hacerme, súper conforme.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome I love it so much that I built a TNT towering building that people can only see the first story. ( it's 11 stories tall)  there are though some boundaries, the world is only a few hundred blocks wide and tall. But it's total awesomeness!!!!! But I still think it should cost less.... :P BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001L3LUE|4.0|I chose because (elements of the book) were mentioned by my therapist. Since I respect his opinion, I thought I'd try to help myself by using MacNamara's trial and tribulations in understanding the thinking behing the V war and how it relates to my psychological problem with unhapiness.<br /><br />bottom line: one grain of sand - on the history on man - sea shore.  Pices non-presperatum.  I'm better now but not as good as I'm going to be.
B00A8307BG|5.0|After listening to Roots And Branches I determined that after all these years, Robin Trower is still growing and florishing. Just when you think someone of his talent as peaked, along comes something like this. Trower has made &#34;Hound Dog&#34; and &#34;The Thrill Has Gone&#34; his own. His original material is as good as the classics on this album. Roots And Branches is definately a must have to any Blues collection.
B008745B32|1.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I am sorry that I purchased it.  I wish I could return it.
B0031TZ8TU|2.0|This book reads more like point notes made rather than any novel particularly of ken follett 's standards.  Very disappointed.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I bought this app because I wanted something simple to scale recipes. This works perfectly for this purpose.  I could do it manually but this is quicker and exact.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|While some of Follett's books are better than others they are all worth the read. Sadly I read faster than he writes.
0525952926|4.0|This was a requested gift and was well liked by the receiver. It was in like new condition. I read a little and was not impressed.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A great read and great movie.  The beginning was very slow but once the ship sank it really got interesting.
B0081L391C|5.0|Schmidt ( Jonah Hilll) and Jenko ( Channing Tatum) are assigned to 21 Jump Street the undercover operation to stop the spread of a new drug through a high school. The result is a funny movie and possible the most funniest I have seen this year. I could not stop laughing and hard. Just go and watch the film and you will rolling with laughter with teary eyes for a long long time as the movie is full of these moments....<br />21 jump Street is a mish mash and reboot of every cop movie that you have watched and enjoyed and raised a notch higher.<br />21 Jump Street echoes the series of the same name and we get Channing Tatum ( the dumb guy) and Jenko as Schmidt  ( the nerd) as park officers who nab a few drug users and are then sent back to get the suppliers who happen to be high school students. Things start becoming increasingly funny when their identities are mixed up at high school and the result is excruciating pain  and tears from laughter. Five stars. 03/22/2013
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is so entertaining and exciting you won't be able to put the book down at night.  Perfect book for kids ages 9-13.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I personally think that the book is delightful and i recommend that you are able to read this book whenever you want to
B00A757EFW|5.0|Bee Oooooo Boop! What is there to say its a classic!!!! Pac- Man is the muchiest little yellow guy I know!
B004EPZ070|4.0|Kate Hudson was perfect for this role, as was Ginnifer, and the guys rocked it. I read the book, so naturally had to see if the movie compared. There were differences but not enough to really complain about. The moral of the story was still there, the character relationships were still there, the draw was still very much there.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has read the book, even to those who have not.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best virtual app I have ever seen. It is amazing when you do competitions,  because the horse and rider look real as they canter around the ring. I would definitely recommend it to any horse lover.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Still the kick ass guys you watched as a kid, just older and perhaps wiser? Loved the action and storyline.
B009K45Y62|5.0|I just love the Cowl! Great movie, love the different viewing options, but I saw it already, so I'm not opening it, lol!!
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Great work of fiction, quiet captivating and well thought over plot. Must read or all ages. Looking forward for te next title.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Great movie! Loved it! The book is fantastic! Hopefully the sequel is made to follow the second book, Something Blue.
0316010669|5.0|I think it's interesting. I am learning psychology, and a student recommended it for me. I haven't start reading yet.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Good movie just what I expected, makes me feel like a child again and made me laugh. What's next?<br />great
B008MEM24S|5.0|We love Phineas and Ferb (and Perry!)<br />It's a different version of Cut the Rope which happens to have Perry in it :-)<br />&#34;It's Agent P!&#34;
B00BCOGM78|5.0|CLUTCH is still evolving, amazing, and rocking everything that is music. The youth of my generation, those of us who know the difference between what music and dance hall toilet scum is, will be able to say that the greatest rock band ever didn't just rock a microphone. They harnessed the power of nuclear energy and bew the stagnant funk out of our ears, the self pity out of our hearts, and the concrete shoes off of our feet. And they left every single diehard fan like me waiting for the next explosion and praying that we were in the blast zone. Clutch is still number 1 and this latest album only solidifies that fact.
B0086700CM|4.0|I personally don't like this game but all the kids seem to like it. SAme concept as Subway Surf but I find the monkeys creepy and you (the one running from the monkeys) not easy to move.<br />Again I don't a kid who isn't playing this game
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love to relax and play this game.  It plays easy but is still a challenge each time.  Well worth the price!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's awesome - who doesn't have this game?<br /><br />It combines 2 of my favs - Star Wars and Angry Birds! Woo Hoo!!!!
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|It is okay for when I can't get to the gym.  Doesn't take too much time and you can pick and choose what exercises you want to do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Everyone in our house loves this game including me. Every kid I know from kindergarten to high school is playin ghtis game. It's fun!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I really like this case it feels nice in your hands and is just overall amazing! I would recommend this product to everyone.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game - not much to think about but keeps youon your toes. I current;y hold the best time of 3 mins 15 secs in our circle of family/friends. The teenagers are always trying to beat my score, no dice. My daughter taunts the older kids to see if they can beat me (the old lady).<br /><br />I usually play this while I wait for my daughter to finish up one of her many activities (dance lessons, music lessons, martial arts, ) and can't tell youhow many times I've had a teenager walk up and ask me if they can play it.<br /><br />good download for free
B003JTHXOK|5.0|An awesome love story with a few twists and turns. Loved the originality, by far one of the best books I've read in a long time!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter loves the Panda games  - she want's to be a vet when she grows up so this particular game hooked her.<br />It's a cute game.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|Simple, wide variety of music. I am not one to always have music on but when I do this works very well go me on my Fire HD
B0058VW36U|4.0|another game my daughter loves. I love that it forces her to think how to solve a problem. Sometimes you can over think it and the thinking of a child comes into play. I have asked my daughter to help me solve a board or two :-)
B005S9EKCW|1.0|The Blu-ray picture is great as are the actors and cinematography.  The script is sung instead of spoken.  It sounds like the actors are having to &#34;sing&#34; their lines without a score!  Because of this, it was difficult to understand what was being &#34;said&#34;.  This is the first DVD I didn't &#34;see thru to the end&#34;.  If only they'd spoken the words -- the Blu-ray was picture was great. The &#34;singing script&#34; really ruined it for me.
B0037XBZZ6|1.0|I paid for the unknown binding and got the new release with movie cover. Highly disliked as this was a present and I specifically went out of my way trying not to find the movie cover version. Very disappointed.
B0084PB97G|1.0|BW is an all time great, I hope he gets paid. This is not anywhere near his extremely high standard. It is great that these guys respect him enough to bring him back into the spotlight. They obviously are very limited talent wise, but all due credit to them. I hope this causes an new generation to go back and check out his long, glorious history. I bought it not to play, but as part of history, such an inspiration as he been to my life, he is 6 months younger than me.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I had been running systems with the old socket 1366 Core i7.  And I finally upgraded one of my systems to a socket 1155 with an Ivy Bridge Core i5.  But that board doesn't support SLI at a full 16X PCI-E 3.0.  It drops the bandwidth down to PCI-E 3.0 at 8X speed. So an upgrade to a socket 2011 board and processor was simply the best choice.<br /><br />I specifically chose this processor because of its fairly high base clock speed.  It means that I don't really feel the need to overclock.  I simply let it go into Turbo Mode (3.8GHz) when I play games.  I have it watercooled and rarely see temperatures higher than 52°C even at full load.  So overall I'm very pleased with this processor.  It was a well thought out purchase and I expect it to last for severl years.
B0000012XC|5.0|(5 of 5 stars)<br /><br />Having listened to several complete sets of Beethoven's piano sonatas and some incomplete sets as well, I have come to the conclusion that Wilhelm Kempff's mono studio recordings from the mid-1950s comprise my overall favorite. This has surprised me as much as anyone; Kempff's musical temperament doesn't match that of the stereotypical Beethoven - the moody, fiery virtuoso so apparent in the `Appassionata' sonata or the 5th symphony. Yet as those of us who have explored his music in depth, there has always been more to Beethoven, whether it be his humor and charm in works such as Op. 31/1 and the 8th symphony, or the searching, introspective way that revealed itself most completely in his late sonatas and quartets. It is these lesser-acknowledged facets of Beethoven's musical personality that Kempff conveys so completely, and they are at the heart of the 32 sonatas.<br /><br />Kempff was not drawn to extreme tempos as are many Beethoven interpreters - his slow movements are often on the fast side and his fast movements are sometimes on the slow side. Yet he is able to give the music its meaning with attention to detail, thoughtful yet subtle phrasing, spontaneity, and a highly expressive tone. This last point is particularly commendable and is something that is perhaps undervalued among our contemporary virtuosi. Kempff seems to mold his piano into several different instruments depending on the needs of the music, achieving a level of tonal variety that is seldom approached among other pianists. Kempff was at his greatest among the lesser-known sonatas. For me, Kempff's recordings of the Op. 10 and 31 trios, Op. 26, Op. 27(#1&2), Op. 28, Op. 78, Op. 79, Op. 81a, Op. 90, Op. 101, and Op. 111 are reference recordings. Others may share that reference status in some cases, but in my opinion none exceed Kempff in these works.<br /><br />On the other hand, one could complain about his approach to some of the more famous sonatas. His `Pathetique'and `Appassionata' sonatas are rather tame by most standards, lacking the pacing and sheer energy to be considered entirely successful. The same could be said of a smattering of other fast movements throughout this collection. By the same token there are slow movements that sometimes don't seem to get the gravity they deserve, like the Andante of the `Pathetique', or even some of the more poetic portions of Op. 109 and 110.<br /><br />Overall though the positives in this set are too significant to be outweighed by these complaints, and complemented by other recordings I have no doubt that Kempff's mono set will find a happy home on many shelves.<br /><br />The sound of these late mono recordings is clear and intimate, if somewhat flat due to its vintage. I prefer it to the brittle sound of Kempff's stereo set recorded a decade later. Furthermore, to my ears the playing in the mono set is more vital and virtuosic. There are a few areas with recording artifacts if you listen very carefully, but I won't point them out lest they detract from your experience. The box set is nicely assembled with liner notes and individually labeled sleeves for the CDs.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|This was a fun movie to watch - the older generation action heroes and they are still going strong.  Will enjoy watching this movie over and over again.
B002SR3T10|4.0|Live performance in an old church setting.  Great music, good accoustics, classic songs, for a good cause.  Wish I could have been there that evening.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|This was a great movie, lots of action that kept you on the edge of your seat, and Daniel Craig is a really good choice for 007.
B001TM14VC|5.0|Suspend your disbelief and go along for the rollicking ride.<br />Great characters, music, and good action.<br />Classic film for its era.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Seems to be a very accurate portrayal of the actual events based upon what I have read in books.  Tactics and weapons seem to be spot on as well.  Really good depiction of the spy work done over a ten year period to eventually bring to justice Americas number one enemy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is easy to become hooked on a series like this.  I couldn't wait for reruns and buying Season 3 was worth every penny!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app! I would pay money for it if it wasn't already free. It's super easy to use and has a lot of options to get creative. It's grand!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love the 3D version as well. Looks great on my 64&#34; TV and the 3D active glasses I bought work perfectly.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. At the college I attended, many of us who took criminal justice classes discussed about how good this movie is. There are some graphic parts so if you get queasy easily, this might not be the best movie for you to watch. This movie almost got implemented into one of my criminal justice classes, so it goes beyond entertainment value.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I found this book just as good as the first and also informative about certain aspects of the second world war that I was unaware.

1616550414|5.0|i love this thing, it's a high quality book for a great price.  i do, however, wish that there was more development history for A Link to the Past in it, as that is my favorite game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very good game especially if you like the bejeweled series. This one actually has more variations then bejeweled. Very awesome!!!

B00008J2PG|5.0|I ordered this movie as a rental from Netflix the first time I saw it. I liked it so much I wanted to add it to my collection so I bought my own copy and another copy as a gift. I think both Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer are tremendous in this movie. Gregory Peck is great in every movie I can remember seeing him in.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it because the buttons are big, and its free. most of all its a calculator yo get it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read all of Tom Clancy's novels. Most of them 5 times each to really get the feel of the characters. Although I really, really<br />enjoyed Threat Vector, there were alot of characters combined. Maybe too much info on each, but well worth the read.<br />  I am getting to see where he is going with Jr. Maybe a couple of more stories before he runs for......
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app was so cool, you get to choose your own reading plan. You don't have to choose a plan, but I liked it better. You can actually choose what kind of bible you want. This was really cool, because it's FREE and it's not a sample is the whole bible.<br />Overall this bible is amazing.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|although I sometimes miss the smell of a book that is very very old, that dusty but in a good way smell, I love having this classic available on my Kindle. I have seen some versions of this book where they have changed the language into modern English and it just isn't the same. this book, just like all the rest of hers, is a pure joy
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This collection was great! Everything was good and came in its rightful place. I have been watching all 8 films over and over since I got it. Whole family loves the collection.
B004LX0D36|5.0|there's just no getting around the romance the trials the tribulations that come from a book written in this era. if you are unfamiliar with some of the words or the context in which they are used it's very easy to learn and it paint a picture so rich. Jane Austen will always be my favorite author. as much as I said this is my favorite book honestly there so many that could be tied as my favorite and they are all by her. if you have never read Sense and Sensibility you have missed out! once you start you can't put it down I guarantee even in your busy life you'll have this book read ino no time, then you can move on to others of hers ;)
B009RH9FR6|2.0|Exactly what I expected.  Got it time.  Definitely a quality product. It took me three days of checking out every case that would fit my Kindle hd 7 before I finally ordered this one.  As soon as I put my tablet in this case I knew I had made the right decision.  Highest quality!  my only complaint is that two days after putting  my Kindle in the case I discovered that the edges of the strap inside the cover was leaving dark, very noticible marks on my 25 dollar screen protector.  These marks do not buff out and they are getting darker.  I can't seem to find a way to contact Amazon to have this problem corrected.  A 3 pack of new screen protectors would solve  this for me....by the 3rd one hopefully the dye will stop bleeding because I really do love the case.  I have pictures, receipts, etc, but no way to contact anyone about it. It sucks having a brand new device with a brand new case but an ugly screen.  Amazon....please help rectify the situation so I can give you the glowing review you deserve.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|there is a reason that so much fuss has been made about Downton Abbey. some of us are familiar with masterpiece classics from our childhood and seeing they've continue the tradition is wonderful. this series has everything - the stark reality of the different classes, war, love..... you will cry, you'll be happy and you will completely fall in love with all of these characters!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Superb cast and story line.  The acting is first rate.  Julianna Margulies deserves all the awards she has received for this series.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|EXCELLENT IT WAS HELL FOR A YOUNG KID BUT SHE ENDURED  I WISH HER ALL THE LUCK IN THE WORLD
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|You could have knocked this Bowie fan over with a powder puff upon learning that that talented gentleman with the angelic voice was releasing a new disc after TEN YEARS of absence from the music scene. Imagine my excitement when the disc was in my manicured little mitts.<br /><br />  The Thin White Emperor of the musical universe released another mind-blower. Another enthralling masterpiece of musical enchantment.<br /><br />THE NEXT DAY was a hypnotic chant, supposedly about a tyrannical ancient monarch. The chorus still sticks in my brain.<br /><br />DIRTY BOYS -- melodic, sexy, and jazzy. A winner all the way<br /><br />THE STARS ARE OUT TONIGHT -- a clever, Tin-Machine-esque ode to celebrity culture.<br /><br />LOVE IS LOST -- Sultry and heartfelt and proof that The Gentleman has still got it.<br /><br />WHERE ARE WE NOW -- a dreamy and enthralling reminiscence of Bowie's stint in Berlin during the '70s<br /><br />VALENTINE'S DAY -- Nothing to do with the holiday, or with sweethearts, this is a stick-in-the-brain ballad of teenage gun violence.<br /><br />IF YOU CAN SEE ME -- A spacey tune with poetic lyrics (a glowing example -- \\"children swarm like thousands of bugs\\") more than a little reminiscent of 1.Outside<br /><br />I'D RATHER BE HIGH -- Anti-war ballad with a faintly psychedelic feel<br /><br />BOSS OF ME -- A standout! Hypnotic melodies and truly poetic lyrics, and Mr. Bowie's exquisite voice. This one would not be out of place on Heathen or Reality.<br /><br />DANCING OUT IN SPACE -- Catchy and danceable and another highlight of the disc.<br /><br />HOW DOES THE GRASS GROW -- Anti-war rocker whose danceworthy tempo contrasts brilliantly with the make-you-think lyrics.<br /><br />YOU WILL SET THE WORLD ON FIRE -- A work of brilliance and enchantment that would be perfectly at home on Bowie's often-overlooked classic NEVER LET ME DOWN<br /><br />YOU FEEL SO LONELY YOU COULD DIE -- Heartfelt and enthralling, one can almost feel Mr. Bowie's pain<br /><br />HEAT -- Majestic, beautiful and dark, reminds one of a cut from 1.Outside<br /><br />SO SHE -- Uptempo love song that kind of sounds like it belongs on Black Tie White Noise. I wonder if the \\"she\\" refered to is the Thin White Emperor's exotically beautiful consort, Iman<br /><br />PLAN -- A riveting, otherworldly instrumental not unlike a selection from Low or Heroes.<br /><br />I'LL TAKE YOU THERE -- An eminently danceable rock-out that is impossible not to start grooving to, even if it's in your chair.<br /><br />This is music to dance by, to romance by, to think by, and mainly, to have your mind blown by. I recommend it highly and it's proof that fans and listeners will still swarm like thousands of bugs toward the brand of musical enchantment that Mr. Bowie provides./>HEAT -- Majestic, beautiful and dark, reminds one of a cut from 1.Outside<br /><br />SO SHE -- Uptempo love song that kind of sounds like it belongs on Black Tie White Noise.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|What a great read, but then I have a particular preference for Wyverns and gave it 5 stars because of that and there seems to be a glut of Vamps, Werevolves, Witches, et al, in the majority of paranormal romances. Dragos is luscious, extremely possessive, nosy, selfish, dictatorial, clueless about certain things in a very funny way, primitive and not knowing what love is completely bewildered towards his feelings for Pia, and loved all of it.<br /><br />This is very bad man and a very, very bad dragon, he used to eat people until he had an epiphany, LOL !!!. Pia is quite likeable and mysterious in that she holds a secret on the type of shifter she is driving Dragos 'lunatic' cause the Fey know her secret and he doesn't. What she turns out to be was a very pleasant suprise. I found the love scenes nicely well done and I think I came away learning a thing or two. And have to add the author is very good on details, whether it's love scene or fighting in a battlefield, I liked that. I have to confess I savored this book and parts made me laughed out loud, I highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic feel..great setup. Good for all ages and step by step directions. No need to use real money... very addicting!
B008C20TDG|5.0|The book is what is says and is very well written and would recommend it to anyone looking to know more about how foods works with our bodies
B005T87QCI|2.0|This game has potenchial but there is not alot of combos as well as hellow a hop or jump is like nessaey for this kid of game  look if your going to do a fihting game ateast have the basic controls.<br /> Aka not worth the money
B004XJ7HSM|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over again.  Great romance story and love the twists and turns in it.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|I am interested in war history and this book written from the animals perspective is, I feel a unique story
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I haven't gone wrong yet with anything written by John Scalzi. This book is hilarious and had me laughing out load from beginning to end. I can't recommend it enough.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|It is too bad that our military has to be involved in situations like this and like Viet Nam. There is no way to win in this political world we live in these days. It will not matter what they do. It will all be undone a month after they leave.
B0049VZ222|5.0|You have to watch it to get it. Phenomenal writers! This show is more than zombies, it's about relationships and humanity. You will leave each episode with something to think about.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Suzanne is a very good story teller with a vivid imagination. I loved how it sucks you in and makes you begin to plan as if it were you there.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is a very fun game! I recommend this game for anyone. Get it, play it, love it! Mice, cats, dog, rockets!
B0091REZMW|3.0|its okay.wish it would regenerate faster..I haven't had any technical problems. it was an easy download. items and words a little too small to see sometimes.
B000000OAN|5.0|This is by far my favorite Queen album ever made and it is still as good today as when I was growing up.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I loved earlier version of this app, but cannot stand the new interface. I wish there was a way to revert this app easily.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Yes, you can play this game without buying diamonds as I have for quite some time now. You just have to be patient. The recent update added more challenges and greatly improved the game. I truly enjoy playing &quot;Mystery Manor&quot;.
B008Y73940|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. However, I don't enjoy being forced to write a certain number of words for a review
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very easy and fun read. Love the twists and surprise ending.<br />Recommend reading this book on the beach this summer.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|it did what i needed it to do and appreciate it very much! thank you, i am still using it!
B00BDZV9M4|2.0|Lil Wayne is my second favorite rapper after Eminem. I loved his last CD and it was full of great tunes. Unfortunately this album is a huge disappointment. There are only two good songs on the album and it lacks any great hits. This is a waste of money.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I like Kids movies, good story and a happy ending.<br />I didn't tell the story line I think you need to find out your self.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Life of Pi should have won movie of the year. I wasn't expecting much when I bought the DVD but I was pleasantly blown away. This is a great movie and I'm actually excited to pop it back into my DVD player just to watch it a couple more times.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the book. From the beginning of book one to the last page of book three. Must read, because you won't put it down.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This is definitely one of the better movies I have seen this past year. Ben Affleck does a great job. This is a movie you will not regret watching.
B00BG5CXGM|4.0|The case is a beautiful one.  Love the color.<br /><br />I had previously been using the Incipio Dual Pro and that back was rubber.  This case has a more smooth back which makes it feel a bit slippery, causing me to have an uneasy feeling when i'm handling it.  I'm sure the feeling will go away in time as I become more accustomed to using the case.<br /><br />The iPhone without a case feels too light and this case gives it just the right amount of extra weight without being bulky.  It's a tight fit, but not too tight like some cases which makes them hard to remove, it's a real perfect fit.  It also has a slight lip that prevents the glass from touching the surface when placed face down.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I just recently discovered Awolnation when I head &#34;Sail&#34; on the radio. I figured I'd grab the album in hoped for one or two more good songs. I was very happy when I played the CD and discovered that I loved more than half of the songs on the album. Can't wait to see what this group does next.
0765325950|5.0|Best book in the series  by far it was action packed. Have been waiting for the last book for about 15  years and it didn't disappoint. Brandon carried on jordans legacy perfectly. So glad to have the end of the story but it is almost a bitter sweet moment.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but I was not impressed. I felt that it moved way too slow and once the story and action started to pick up, it was already over. For such a long movie, this was a disappointment.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is great and is very challenging but the prices for stuff are way to much and should be brought down a lot but other than that great game.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and that's why I decided to check out The Hobbit. Do not listen to all of the haters, if you buy this DVD you will not regret it. It's very well done. Of course this trilogy will not be better than the Lord of the Rings, but it will be close. I can't wait to see the second flick.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the series.I heard so many people say how great the show was and when I finally started watching it, I was hooked. I actually streamed the first season and watched it all in one afternoon. After that I went on Amazon and ordered all 3 seasons. The acting is great, the story provides the perspective the changing times from both the rich and those who serve them. I highly recommend this show to all!
B009AMANH4|2.0|Not sure why so many people love this movie so much. I found it a very slow and very boring movie. Sure, Daniel Day-Lewis does a masterful job of acting as Lincoln, but the movie itself is not very entertaining at all.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|this is a great app to play, by the action and drama.Hope you have fun playing.<br />Like me u will have an amazing blast
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|every timeninplay it I have gotten the next shark then I come back later and I am back at the first level
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Graphismes assez jolies. Ce jeu est assez prenant bien qu'il soit assez repetitif a la longue. Tout de même pas mal pour passer le temps.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great the best bond ever, wonderful. Daniel Craig is fantastic. it took too long to arrive but was worth the wait
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting story.  I liked the first half, but the second half turned so unbelievable, not sure happened with the author. But, I do have say say, the last line in the book by from husband is so classic, it may be my favorite line for a book ending ever. Definitely worth the read as a work of pure fiction.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|We loved this movie - and after watching some of the info on how it was made - we noticed some fun things they worked into the movie from the game that we hadn't caught at first.  It isn't juvenile by any means - there are some scenes that may be a little mature for younger children - but nothing horribly steamy (which is often what I think movies get carried away with).  The girlfriend is shown with some pretty short shorts on one occasion - and is pretty close to the guy - so that stuff is not stuff I just love my teens seeing - but it also wasn't nearly as bad as some other movies that are interesting to older kids, but put too much bad stuff in them.  The language was not horrible either - considering this is a movie about sailers especially!!  The story was interesting - and definitely held our attention - we all watched it a few times.<br /><br />Rihanna is in this movie - and actually plays a character that I really liked quite a bit - though it was not what I might have expected.  This won't be one of the best movies you ever watched, but it's a good one - it was enjoyed by all - our 12 year old loves it, we enjoyed it, and my adult kids enjoyed it.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|Has a great story line but would have liked it to have a bit more content. Overall tho not to bad.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My kids LOVE this movie.  It is fun, with cute songs - that we sometimes can't get out of our head!  Very earth friendly to remind children, and adults, of their impact on the earth.  This movie has been watched multiple times since it was purchased at Christmas 2012.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like Mitch Albom's other books, The Time Keeper is an easy and very enjoyable read!  I do not want it to end!  Thank you, Mitch, for the reminder that our days area gift from our Lord and, therefore, precious!
B002MRRRAA|5.0|pretty good show, afterall, it's nirvana, classic grunge, so little nirvana available that this stuff will become hard to find in years to come.
B005HSL626|5.0|Downloaded this for my son, and he loves it. His dad even plays it daily. I have yet to try it.
1609611543|5.0|Excellent book!!  Really makes you think!! I have started a gluten free way of eating, and so far I feel great. I bought the cookbook too, and there are some great recipes in it!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to view, easy to find your way around, easy to &#34;like&#34;/comment. Have some difficulty with finding my &#34;location&#34; when posting away from home
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|What can one say if you like this kind of movie it is just great and a nice story. Great
B004UID2LC|1.0|It said it was incompatible with my device. I can't rate it based on the inability to use it. Blah
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|great, shoot, shoot and shoot again. What a story to tell about MI6 over the years and to see new younger people in it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the maps, layers, seeing satellite and cloud cover at the same time. Also like the ! for current weather warnings when I log on.
B000065V3H|5.0|Of course the movie is fantastic. If you haven't seen it, you should watch it. I've seen it a million times and still enjoy every moment and laugh a ton. The DVD was a great buy and works perfectly. No complaints out of me! :)
B005IQZB14|4.0|I read this book over a rainy weekend and found it entertaining and well written. I would have possibly liked more detail about the trail itself and her walk but the insights into her life and why she was making the walk were enlightening and of surely more importance to her.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I think this film could mark the first step towards a new era of bond films! I highly recommend it!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Was a great football movie and a great movie over all  the facts where straight  the acting was amazing would definitely watch agian and recommend it for the whole family.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a fun, addicting, and sometimes difficult game. I'm about 30 levels in and I am not board yet. If you like jewel swap games and are looking for one that has a little something extra, this game is for you.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|If you're participating in the management of a business, you and your top-level management team NEED to read this book. Its a long-time classic that if put into practice could change how you spend your time each and every day, and in the end helping you and those working with you and for you into a much happier and less stressful business culture, leading to the best possible results.
0307895475|5.0|Thank God that they make these game guides, there are simply somethings that you either don't want to figure out on you own or have trouble figuring out on your own.  This guide pretty much spells everything out for you so do be aware before delving to deeply, but it also can really get you out of jam when you get into one and helps you avoid some nasty pitfalls of the game or plan ahead for good overall character developement.  With so much going on in the new edtion of Elder Scolls this guide will help you get through every quest your heart desires and it's fairly well organized to find what you need with alphabet index in the back and a complete list of the main and most side quests in the front plus a huge pull out world map that you can use to find every location or see the world's destination at a glance. Really worth it if you want to find every destination and finish every quest available in the game.  You really won't miss much and can help know other ways to play through the game.  One of the better game guides I've used for an RPG.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Even though you complete it , you want to try it again, and again, Great fun, with a helpful hints icon used more than once.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|George - the Best Beatle in the end! No Beatle bio better than this. Heart melts whenever I hear his particular songs.
1451662432|5.0|Enjoyed the book immensly.  While I was familiar with many of the stories, there were new details and elabortions on some.  The reader must remember that Arnold'd recollection and perception are just that.  HIS recollection and perception.  I especially enjoyed the parts of the book that detailed the process of making his films...
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Wow.  I mean there was so much momentum from the first two books and there was &#34;Mockingjay&#34;.  I really disliked this book.  It seemed like it skipped the editing stage.  What happened?  Did Suzanne Collins get so popular from books one and two that she got to veto editing of this book?  It needs needs to be tightened up.  It needs some perspective of someone who's been in battle.  For me it really lack the heart-and-soul the material deserved at this point.  I just don't think the author had the chops to pull off the final act.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love this game- replaced temple run as the new house favorite! Always a contest going on- who can get the most points.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Heck yeah, this story is rolling right along.  I'm invested.  I'm in.  No going back.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I'm writing this review after readying all three books.  I wish I didn't get invested.  I wish I wasn't in.  I wish I could go back.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I downloaded this book not long after it was released, intrigued by Chris Kyle and his story. I started it, but put it down to read other, \\"lighter\\" stories after not being able to initially digest the seriousness of the duties of war. After his sudden passing, I committed to reading this book to its end. Am I ever glad that I did! Mr. Kyle shed light on the war that had to be fought by the dedicated men and women of our military who fought it. They say the American military of WWII was the greatest generation but I truly believe our Patriots who fought for us after 9/11 are the \\"new\\" greatest generation! Thank you Mr. Kyle for laying it all out there with your honesty and humility. You made this woman \\"believe\\" again! May you rest in eternal peace. Thank you Taya for your contributions to this book and for allowing us a small peek into the struggles military spouses endure. I hope you and your children may also find peace as you continue to live your lives without the man you so dearly love and are proud of. I would recommend this book to anyone and almost feel like it should be required reading to history or JROTC students. This book will be on my mind for a long, long time...
B003G4W49C|5.0|I do believe that I can sum up my review of the book Ender's Game with the following paragraph.<br /><br />Wow.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|Boring and poorly cast. Terrible acting cheap production values. None of the actors have been worse in their careeres. Enough said.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed the book.  I purchased this in anticipation of the movies.  The book is far superior to the movie, which is typically true for the book vs movie discussion.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  In my humble opinion, book three almost made me regret purchasing books one and two.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Awesome series.  Evem more awaeome in Blu-Ray.  I didn't think a show about zombies would keep as interested as I am now.  I'm looking forward to the 4th season.
B000YAA68W|5.0|Everything about this movie is brilliant. The art, the music, the story, the humor, the drama. The only problem I have with it is that it lost to &#34;Ratatouille&#34; at the Oscars. There is no justice in the world...
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This was really a great book for me. I couldn't put it down. It was sad and motivational at the same time to me. I felt for the main character and wanted to help him move on. This book gives a good insight to people that have mental setbacks hindering them from living a normal adult life. I have not seen the movie but plan on it. Movies are never as good as the book, but I can't be disappointed. I would recommend this book to anyone. Those people who have struggled with depression or psychological problems themselves, or known or live with someone who has, will greatly appreciate this book.
B009CCBCU4|4.0|No need to break it up.  It could have continued the story.  Interesting reading.  YA book.  Would have liked more detail about daily living
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was kind of disappointing. I expected him to talk more about the actual Near Death Experience. It seemed maybe a fourth of the book was about his NDE, one fourth was about his real life experiences while in a coma, half of the book was his ideals and thoughts afterwards. It was a good book, but I'm glad it wasn't any longer. I would have enjoyed it much more had he spent more time describing his NDE.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Excellent in detail, this book really delved into all the nuances of battle. Horrendous conditions on the battle field, but the devotion each man showed to one another was amazing!
0143038419|5.0|Saw the film first so I was reluctant to read the book but I am so glad I did. It stayed close enough to the film so you weren't constantly going 'it was different in the movie'! The book is more luscious and full bodied (as most books are) yet you can still see Julia Roberts as the lead character (good choice). I won't ruin any more of the book but highly recommend you read it (even if you saw the film).
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I enjoyed the movie cinematography-- an absolutely beautiful &#34;post card&#34; for the planet earth.<br />The story is harsh-- not for the feint of heart. And, none of my family could watch it because of the fate of the animals-- Yes, that is reality and a fact of life, but not everyone is up to that.<br />Do I recommend it: No. Read a picture book, skip the fate of the animals.
B00000DHRX|5.0|Forgot how many songs he sang that I loved. I bought it for the song 'Freedom' but found I loved the whole album. Go down memory lane and pick it up. Everyone may have forgotten about George Michael, except the bad press, but remember what he became famous for in the first place.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|This book is riveting and powerful. Jack Reacher, on a simple subway ride in NY in the middle of the night becomes embroiled in espionage, controversy and world domination. The evil that lurks in men's hearts.... Jack hides from the FBI the NYPD and goes on a person attack of the most evil and corrupt of all organizations to right a wrong and save a soldier's reputation. How Jack Reacher does it? Nothing short of amazing.<br />Lee Child is such a master story teller. Before you know it, you're hooked on his stories and in love with Jack Reacher; the only man still in America who can seek and find justice. Hooray for Child. This is a show stopper.
0802473156|5.0|I recently went on a date and it went well because I could see this person's love language and I responded to it.  She asked me if I read this book, and I said yes, and she was thrilled.
B000MV82H0|1.0|Waste of money. Tried it in every DVD player in the house. It says dvd installed wrong. Very disappointed I didn't even want to give one star!!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I enjoyed the album and thought it was a very good mix of songs. 10 songs was not an issue for me, it seems these days too many artists are cramming there albums. I'm a big Ballard fan and a singer songwriter myself and would have liked two ballards on the album and find that swear words spoil things a bit, showing my age I suppose. I see Bruno as a modern day Michael Jackson and he could fill that void to a large degree if he stays on the right track, he is a very talented artist.<br />Cheers<br />Lou Martin Boldrini
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Funny, witty , always makes me laugh. has become one of my favorite movies to watch. whatever the mood :)
B008OHV5HS|5.0|Great album.<br />I like Damien's vocals, very clean and capable.<br />Good production. Its technical, but easy listening.<br />If you like progressive stuff hard and heavy - don't miss out on this album.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|it seems to work well and functions properly. I have not had any issues with it yet. letting me know how much time I left is nice.

B003L0VJF6|5.0|For an artist of the quality of violinist as is Julia Fischer to undertake the performance of a piano concerto, and to do it so expertly, is extraordinary.  But, once you've made your acquaintance with Julia Fischer, you come to expect greatness in anything that she undertakes to do.<br /><br />Listening to Julia Fischer play the piano is a very happy experience.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed the story even though it was rather devastating.  It really made you think about things you would rather keep secret but, but there is a saying that, &#34;you are only as sick as your secrets, and once they are no longer secrets, you are not sick anymore.&#34;  Defending Jacob brought it home.  If the characters would have been more open, everything might have been avoided.  Great read and fun to discuss with others who have read it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is a fantastic final installment to the epic series by Suzanne Collins. It provides intense suspense, excitement and danger plus a realistic overall feel. This book will leave the reader feeling satisfied with the wrap up of the series.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|If you are a die-hard NIN fan, and are disgruntled about not just the lack of NIN albums in the recent past or on the horizon, but also the direction of music in general, you should get this album now.  Its got Reznor's prints all over it, and it definitely filled the void of NIN-genre music.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book and great movie! They are both very different from each other but still fantastic! Would definitely recommend both!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It wasa great ending. Need another trilogy about her life after. Hope there will  be one in the near future.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I bought an ankor mouse a few weeks back and am finally getting around to writing a review. I will say that it is not without minor discontents, I would have liked the USB cord a little longer, the side mouse buttons are by default programmed to weird keys. But otherwise I have nothign bad to say, Its smooth, precise and comfortable. Flows like a dream!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Fast paced, varying difficulty. The timer adds to the skill level. It is interesting to see how others are doing. Very fun!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game for anyone, but I like it because it gives my mind a real workout! Being older it helps me alot. They say do things that get the mind working and this is GREAT!!!!
B000003TAS|5.0|When I ordered this cassette used I wasn't sure what condition it would be in. I was kind of nervous until the day it actually arrived. It arrived very quickly, too! The condition was good as new. I was so pleased with this purchase because not only was it in perfect condition, but it was inexpensive, too. Great buy!
B00488SU02|5.0|The writing is superb, the acting is phenomenal, and the topic is one that everyone should address, so the film's message is both timely and critical.<br /><br />For a first-timer, the writer did an incredible job,<br /><br />I can't remember the last time a film has made me cry not only once but every single time I watch it.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Very exciting. There are many interesting details of wartime England.  Loved the showdown at the end. Should make another movie of this novel.
B00991TCOG|5.0|When I first heard \\"Crystallize\\" on Pandora.com, I rushed over to see who that was.  I was listening to the Buckethead station at the time, but I typed in her own station to hear more.  Then, I looked her up on youtube...and what a surprise!  Her videos are great, too!  I hope that she can keep up the pace of this first release.  I know that I'm a devoted fan.  I'd love to see her live.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This set is great , if you are a fan of The Godfather saga or not.<br />The film, sound and extras are perfect.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Once again Jack Reacher finds himself in the middle of a very menacing situation. He is picked up in the middle of Nebraska, in the middle of night, and things just get dicier and dicier as you go along. As usual, the readers are informed of all the challenges involved for policing agencies at many different levels, (local police, FBI, Dept. of Homeland Security) in finding out just what is behind a very brutal murder that takes place in a water pumping station, of all places. Of course, Jack eventually meets up, and charms, the woman FBI agent leading their investigation into the case. From there the investigation picks up steam, and the plot twists take place, when some one who was originally thought to have been killed, turns up very much alive, and with another even more shocking surprise I will leave up to the reader to find out. It turns out there is also a shocking terrorist angle to the mystery, as well, but you also come across alot of local characters, and businesses in the sparsely populated Nebraska and Iowa landscape, that really add to the enjoyment as the plot plays out. Of course, Jack Reacher, with his toughness, and dedication to what is right, and military background, and very keen analytical mind, really shine in this novel, and ANY fan of this Jack Reacher series will NOT be disappointed with this fine read.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|TI never disappoints. I love all the great collaboration on this album, as is usual for him.  You won't regret it.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I liked this movie very much I like any movie that Tommy Lee Jones is in because I know it will be a clean movie.
B009GQ57ES|4.0|I really like the creativeness and originality of the album.  Not just the same old same old content.  Very Fresh.
B00847TKSE|5.0|Finally saw this movie, it is great.  It's a feel good movie for both adults and children.  A true story that will grab you as you watch.  \\"Everybody loves Whales\\"  Highly recommend watching. Loved it.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|This game is so cute and fun. If you're bored and need to kill time, this is the perfect app.
B00338QENI|5.0|Amazing storytelling balancing the sometimes dry science of cell research with the engrossing tale of a family plagued by misfortune, and seeking understanding and ultimately peace for their mother, their family and their past.  Really, an amazing novel.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I've read all the Grisham novels.  Based on his previous books, I new THe plot would have one or more changes or reversals.  It was great discovering them and trying to guess the next twist.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and was really able to relate to the main character.  I would reccomend this book to anybody going through a rough time in their lives or anyone who has ever been through a difficult time in their lives.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Such a quality book, totally rethink the way you feel about running/starting a business.<br />Would definitely recommend to anyone thinking about starting something.
B00BYOEMTQ|4.0|As a fan of the LOTR series, I just had to see The Hobbit as well.  I am not a connoisseur of Tolkien, as in I haven't read all the books.  So, some people may totally disregard this review, and that is okay!  I just really enjoyed the backstory to the LOTR series and felt that the story line made the other movies make perfect sense.  It was a little bit slow at points (thus 4 stars), but overall it was a worthy investment of time and money!  Good flick!  Lots of adventure and that's what inspires me the most...leave the Shire!
B004LWZW7O|3.0|This was an interesting movie and I really enjoyed the plot line in the movie. I did not even mind JT being in the movie. I enjoyed what they showed the concept was very well thought out and applied. Live until you are 25 and then you have 1 year of time and you have to earn more and of course everything is paid for with time. I really like that idea.<br />Maybe some spoilers:<br />Now the movie it had a slow start and built a good story around what could not be proved as a murder or a theft there was just no evidence. The time police to me really did not present or maybe they do not have to present any solid reason for doing to JT what they did. He did nothing wrong. All of his action where in reaction to what was being done to him.<br /><br />A problem he was given the 100 odd yrs but he then went on to win a whole lot of more years. So the time police show up and take not only what was given to him but also what he rightfully won. Now I know there would be no movie if this did not happen but I think we could have com up with a better way to get the action moving. That is the major problem that kept this movie from reaching say a Matrix level of WOW. They show how corrupt the time police are right away. Hey we can not prove you killed any one we can not prove you were not given that time freely but we are here and we are just going to take all your time away because we can.<br /><br />Come on you got the workings for a great story but then you make it so simple that is just lays there no twist no pop just flat there it is we take your time and you run to get more. Overall I just liked it but really wanted more out of it but I guess I ran out of TIME.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. i suggest watching from the beginning. So worth watching though, I highly recommend this show and season!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I have no idea how ARGO beat this, or Lincoln, for best picture.  As much as I loved the PBS concert and the stage musical, this was even better.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|this book is just AMAZING. Ive read it so many times and each time i read it im still in love. Wish i could find a travis
B006LSZECO|4.0|But sadly the ending did  not give me the satisfaction I was looking for. But well worth the read anyway.
B008CIUS72|1.0|Did not work for the kendle fire. Waste of money. Wish I could get my money back. Any one else have this problem?
193413712X|4.0|Tinkers is immensely captivating if you have the patience to immerse yourself into the world of imagery Crosby crafted.  While succeeding at providing ample amounts of descriptive language about the wonders of nature, life and death, Tinkers lacks the ability to create momentum for the reader, the type of yearning that page-turners are adept at invoking.<br /><br />If you want a book to read sporadically or is someone who enjoys eloquent prose, this is the book to purchase.  If you are looking for a well-developed story or I-will-finish-this-in-one-sitting book, Tinkers is not the best choice.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's too dark, it goes in to the mind of a weirdo. I finished it only in the hopes that the book would change to a decent story. I was sadly disappointed. No I will never recommend this book.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case for Kindle Fire HD 7, in red, was exactly what I wanted. It fits perfectly, protects my sweet Kindle Fire, and it looks great. I recommend it highly. I always look for customer feedback, so I hope this will help any one thinking about this product.
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|I rather have my 3d movie in full frame. I always hated it in widescreen. but warner bros does that with all there 3d movies. I just like to know why there is no choice for a full screen version.
B008ULM7HU|5.0|I love this cd with a compilation of Duran Duran songs! It is so great!  I love all the songs on it!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is hilarious as always and also has a great perspective on life.  She has great stories about starting out, being a mom that I think a lot of people could relate to.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I really enjoyed this latest installment of the Bond series. I had no idea what to expect and this movie really delivered with a tightly written script and believable performances by all. I highly recommend watching this movie and then watching it again. Absolutely love Craig as Bond. He reminds me Sean Connery; who was also the perfect embodent of James Bond.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Everytime a new season is released it is a gift for my 60-something father...who LOVES IT!  I would watch it myself if I had the time, but right now, waiting for season 3 release!!
078324228X|5.0|I saw this movie on TV one night and didnt get to watch all of it, so I bought it so I could watch it all the way through and OMG!! I'm so glad that I did!! Because this movie is totally worth watching!! Over and Over and Over!! I Love this movie! Great Story and Great actors!! I would highly recommend this movie!I love movies with Denzel Washington in them and he did an excellent job in this one!!
1612130283|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read some reviews about Christian Grey being too perfect so it's not realistic but the wonder in this story comes from the fact that there are seemingly perfect people out there. Getting to know a perfect person (albeit fictional) to see that nobody is perfect is an amazing concept. With an open mind, anyone can enjoy this love story.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Bought this movie for my dad as a gift and he watched it and loved it! He said it was the best movie he had seen in a long time!! You wouldn't go wrong buying this movie!! It's good!! :)

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Nice way to &#34;re-boot&#34; the 007 franchise = go back to the start! Bear in mind this is only the first half.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I usually go nuts for Josh's music.  This one did not appeal as much as usual.  I hope the next one is more to my liking.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This is the second half so make sure to watch part 1 Casino Royale first to get the full story!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|The third installment in this series was a bit of a let down after the first two books.  I thought the story line was choppy and the renunions a big let down.  Overall, disappointed in the ending if the triology.
B008F9E306|5.0|good cd as always he delivers hes music supporting ATL all the way nice job tip,making it happen hustle gang!
B00BI745AA|1.0|Excellent movie and great acting but the worst pixelated movie I have ever watched in HDTV with amazon instant video. Very disappointed and would like a refund!! Could have watched it with xfinity on demand but stayed loyal to amazon and payed for it.
B00B99KJR0|2.0|Ok I got back to Englang on day 81, I was able to get the level but I'm not sure if the game ended or not. No more levels but also nothing saying the game is over. I'm glad the game was free it's not worth paying for. Some other problems are block not clearing even when there were 3 or even 4 in a row costing time and lower score.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|DVD case was in decent condition.  DVD itself worked fine. However, the DVD skipped once. Nothing to complain about for the price!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I loved this movie.  Much better then on stage for you can understand what the actors are saying and the plot.<br />Definitely rent the movie!
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|Movie is much better then I ever thought. Must watch. Also you must get the unrated one.<br /><br />kids should not see unrated version!
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is a fun game we're you can build stuff and play with your friends online there will be a new update in April.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and the story it shared. I don't really have any thing else to say other than you should dad this book.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|I liked the story. I gave it a rating of 4 because it took a while for me to get into the story  unlike other books I've read from this author.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. The life that Erin suffered through made her deserve happiness even more. Powerful and inspiring.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Interesting historical piece.  The manners and customs of the people at that time are so foreign to us now it is similar to reading Pillars of the Earth.  The main problem with the series is the rather unbelievable soap opera manipulations of the plot, especially with the valet and head housemaid.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was a really great book. My sister wanted me to read it so i did and it was great!
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|I've never owned this concert, so I was excited by the new release having always heard that it was great.  The sound quality is excellent for a 1988 recording, and the set list is incredible.  I've never heard anything live from Iron Maiden that didn't sound fantastic, so it's not much of a surprise, but I'm glad they decided to re-release it in CD and DVD formats.  If you're a Maiden fanatic, you couldn't be disappointed with the quality, and if you're a casual fan, it's a near-perfect documentation of their music up through Seventh Son, with songs from almost every album (sadly, nothing from Powerslave).  The songs are performed in typically entrancing fashion, and the ecstatic crowd provides a compelling backdrop to Maiden's world-class music.<br /><br />As a bonus for people who already owned the older version, the CD includes three encore songs that have never been released; Run to the Hills, Running Free, and Sanctuary.  Also cool is that the inlay booklet includes full lyrics for each song and nice concert pics of the band.  Performed nearly 25 years ago, this show displays Maiden at the height of their prowess, though I honestly don't think they've lost a step in all those years.  Their last live album, En Vivo!, which focused on their most recent full-length, was stunning it its own right, but if you love classic Maiden (and who doesn't?), this CD provides 18 tracks of pure ear candy.
0307719219|2.0|I've received the book in the expected time. But the book conditions are really bad; bad paper and the pages are not even cut at the same large. Dont buy it if you want a book in perfect conditions. Anyway, you can read it.
B0013WI0PQ|5.0|I love this movie - the final scenes still bring tears to my eyes. Great music, great acting, wonderful story line. Robin Williams is especially effective at making you dislike him and plays his dramatic roll very well. The other actors do an equally good job. If there is a down side to the movie - I would have liked very much to see more of the reunion scene after the concert - but that is the mark of a good meal - it leaves wanting a little more when you are finished eating. I highly recommend it for all ages though young children may have trouble understanding the story.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|It's fun! Just need to spend a little bit of cash to have some real fun and gets enough troops in combat. Other then that it's not bad for getting it free.
B000286RKW|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time and adding the special features found on this particular DVD make this movie even better. Robert DeNiro and Joe Pesci in a ganster flick.....need I say more..

B008ED6P86|1.0|I am a HUGE MANOWAR fan since 1982.  I have a tattoo of MANOWAR on my right arm.  I have seen the band live probably 12 times both in the US and in Europe, and have met them personally on occasion.  It pains me to say it but this album is horrid.  Yes, the production is poor but that is not the main problem.  The songs themselves would not have made ANY of teh previous albums.  (I liked Gods of War).  This is the first MANOWAR album I have heard (and I have heard them ALL - many times) that lays totally flat, sounds bad, and does not have a single song that I find worthy.  I would not expect many, or any, of these tracks to make it to a live show.  I am still a fan of the band, I always will be, but I need to call it what it is; horrid.
0802473156|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for to give to a friend and it was exactly as described, thank you!
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The packaging, contents and variety (HD, DVD, computer discs) is very good compraed toi the price paid for them. The series in itself is superb, except for the unnecessary need of foul language and nudity. It would have been equally as good without those things.

B008ZOHCKE|5.0|It may seem strange that I'm so excited about this app, but really, its perfect for anyone who likes to write down their ideas, dreams, grocery list, etc. I was getting so annoyed having to use one &quot;notebook&quot; for all my many writings. I love to be able to categorize my work, separating my journal from book chapters, and my dream pages from my grocery list. This app is awesome! I cant wait to use it every day!!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|What was that ...... courageous.  What takes more courage to accomplish than anything else in this life?  Life's tragies can certainly alter the course we take and then the unexpected happens.  We set out with our best foot forward taking steps into the future and trusting God for the outcome.  But ..... will we still trust God when tragedy strikes instantly and permanently?  The greatest loss, I think is to lose someone we love, especially a child.  In this motion picture sudden loss changes the course of a family and those close to them.  All our dreams shattered, numbness sets in and we begin a new chapter one we would rather have skipped.  Suffering and loss are a part of real life.  This movies touched my heart and I felt the emotions of each family member and cried with them.  When and how does one become ready, feel purpose once again and move on without the shadow of the past and the pain incurred at the present.  Will courage be the banner this torn father chooses ...... watch this movie and feel yourself gain prospective and the true meaning of courage unfold.  This was an excellent movie.....a must see.  I'm glad I had the privilege and opportunity to be a part of Courageous.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|at first I hated it, upon making myself accept that bands change, and experiment I find that this is pretty darn good DM cd, I had gave it a bad review because I was disappointed at first, however after playing it a few times over and over I think this is typical Depeche mode with some extra flare, I give DM kudos for not letting the world of crappy music destroy them.<br />keep playing it if you hate it, it grows on you..... don't pass on a good thing.<br />Delta Machine is currently my favorite cd of 2013!<br />and I just can't get enough....
B0015DWJX2|4.0|At first I was concerned about the format of the book being in letters between individuals; however, after getting into the book, I found it very engaging.  The letters added a personal feel to the characters.  I felt like I had found an old box full of letters from another era.  Great book.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved the story line and Ms. Morton's writing style.  I work in the field of adoption and the character's need to know the truth about her identity mirrors that by adoptees, especially those in closed adoptions.
0452289963|5.0|Yes, It is a book to be studied and applied to daily living. I recommend it to those who are searching and want to be the Best you can be
B004UHSB5A|5.0|Another version of the popular game.  I came back to it recently and this one is easy to use and challenging.
B00009NHC5|2.0|Acting was terrible, would not recommend unless you want to be borded to death or make fun of something. Maybe a comedy.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Without Bonus material. Excellent slip-cover case. Simple and cheap.<br />2D version of BD can be viewed by any BluRay player. Just select the 2D feature.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A psychological thriller, suspense and plot twists - a real page turner!  No more info because I don't want to be a 'spoiler'!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Loved it. Cute movie. Kids loved it because they are also 3 little girls too. Cracked up laughter :)<br /><br />Watched over and over... New favorite movie
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The protagonist of the book stumbles out a window and into a series of mishaps that should have led to his death. As he wanders from one adventure to the next, we learn about his past through parallel glimpses of his youth, and then adulthood--a rich and fascinating story that blends elements of humor and history. We see that he's not just an ancient human: He's made contributions and had valuable experiences along the way.
B001IMFHTS|5.0|Love classical music. Great conductor and musicians. I cn not say enough for this selection I do not know why you want more words for this review.
B007REV4YI|5.0|This movie is your typical 007 movie.  Action, plot twist, and beautiful women.  The ending is amazing and the sound track is great.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|Seen them in concert but was hard to understand the words due to the high bass. Loved the songs on the radio and had to order the cd. Listen at home and in car and keep hearing it in my head. Very talented group of young people.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My entire family loved this movie!  Great animation and cute story plot.  A must see for kids of all ages.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|If you've ever lost a rear lens cap or bought a used lens from someone with a missing/questionable cap, this is exactly what you need. The low price point puts this OEM cap in the same range as the competitors. I'd buy again no question.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|This movie is just great fun for the whole family.  The actors are amazing.  It is one of those movies you want to see more than once.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|It was just ok, definitely not as funny as I thought it would be. It was suitable to watch though but only when you can catch it for free.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|While totally different in concept and development (a story within a story), Rothfuss has created a completely realized world that the reader can believe in though &#34;creatures abound, nonetheless.  I did not want the book to end.  My only com plaint - can't wait for the third book.  Hurry up Patrick!
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a great movie that shows the transformation that takes place between a tiger and a boy in survival mode.  Definetaly worth watching!!  This is a movie that can be watched over and over.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Very engaging -- of a life changed, of clinger-on-ers, of being brave, of getting out of your comfort zone....<br />Our book club had a robust discussion on this book!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook to post and follow posts of others and to keep informed.  I have it now on my kindle fire HD.
B00846REIS|3.0|I didn't like what the author had to say about the other trilogy but it was a hot n steamy
0553801473|5.0|She loved it but not happy that the next book is not coming out any time soon.She can't wait for the HBO show!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Another awesome episode from the creaters of the Walking Dead.<br /><br />The Walking Dead should be the Broadcast Networks nickname as they are being<br />left in the dust by AMC and their ilk.
B00BLGDFH2|3.0|a few good tracks but in the days of mp3's, the brilliance of recording on dave's mixing board is lost.  i guess if you have a bad ass home stereo and listen to this on vinyl, the value would be greater.  as an mp3 album, it's kind of boring even given the amount of celebrity on this record.<br /><br />still good though.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Super from , but short.  Recommended for sure.  It is a great story. Easy play. Sucked me in.  Hours of fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turner!!!  I didn't want to put it down. I will definitely read more of her books.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I installed the program and it keeps wanting me to buy it again.  If it would work I would be Happy as of now I would like my money back or a program that works!
0783230079|1.0|AGAIN, THIS MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN GOOD IF IT WASN'T PIRATED SO MANY TIMES.  NOW ALL YOU HAVE IS A BLURR.  PLEASE DO ASK THESE QUESTIONS ANYMORE.  JUST TAKE MY MONEY AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|I am 75 and have always loved his music, my great grandson, who is 21 years old,  is a hugh fan also, His music is timelsess.  Thanks for so much enjoyment.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Fantastic app, however, I wish that you could change the variable when doing squares. Right now just having to be able to square it isn't enough personally.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just cry inside at the end of the book<br />I love it so much I feel like this to sometimes.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have tons of categories in my Pinterest account. I couldn't live without it now. I organize my thoughts, desires, and dreams onto my various boards! I have ideas that I'd like to do and this is where I keep them pinned. Otherwise I may forget and never fulfilled my purposes!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Fantastic movie :)<br />... .. .. .. .. .. .. .<br />Now I know why it's one of the books you read in high school
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is the best app!!!O.M.G .......I RECOMMEND THAT YOU CAN GET IT AND LOVE IT<br />.I HAVE IT on my kindle fire hd,it works great and,Lastly,GET IT!!!!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|This author has produced an excellent series of books that were able to hold my interest and keep me moving to the next one in the series.
B0033QC0WY|5.0|Rien &agrave; redire, tout ici refl&egrave;te une grande interpr&eacute;tation d'un des plus grands interpr&egrave;te de Mahler en maestro Bernstein et les superbes orchestres ici en vedettes. Il ne vous manque que l'int&eacute;grale de Bruno Walter.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It's a must have for your daily routine. Great for remembering things and research. The share feature with my wife rocks.
0061808121|5.0|I have seen the movie, but have not read the book.  I have order an audio CD to read along with the books.  I know the students in the classroom will enjoy this story.  Many have become interested in reading due to the audio CD and they read along with their books.
6305128952|5.0|Loved the movies, was glad I ordered it, great for my movie collection. Great movie for horse lovers- a must see.
0307719219|4.0|This is well worth the effort. As usual, a little longer than need be.I like his approach to economic casues of sucess and failure. Clearly written without and external agenda.
B009P5S11G|3.0|It was good for the gift I gave, she liked it, not for my taste, but the person I bought it was very pleased.
B000RO9VJK|3.0|Very practical and insightful, and full of key business strategies and tactics, a must read book for any entrepreneur who wants to scale his business to new heights
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Gave it as a Christmas present, the person loved it. She seemed to be captivated by it.  I would order a sequel if they had it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love relaxing with this amazing game. The graphics are beautiful, the touch-screen interface is very responsive, and the music is just right. You can rotate the 3D cube easily, making it easy to match designs even if they are on opposite sides of the cube. Another neat thing: when you make a successful match, the little cube-ettes explode into tiny bits. The game offers you the opportunity to time yourself from start to finish -- why anyone would want to turn this relaxing game into a competition is beyond me. Overall, I recommend this game. ETA (Edited to Add): You can turn off the timer. Plus, there are additional ways to play this game.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I assumed both Pi and Richard would survive or there would be no story teller but I was totally surpised by the ending..........Nope, buy your own disc.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book was an amazing story and it took through a family's difficulty . Everyone should read this book. I might sound crazy but I want to shave my head for cancer now and yes I'm a girl.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I judge movies at first by the intensity of early advertising or lack thereof. This one was moderate so I thought I would give it a try after it was released on DVD. I think of the cost of renting as a $5.00 savings or discount off the cost to buy, so I saved $5.00 to start with. I'm a sucker for animal stories and I'm happy to add this one to my collection (the horse lived).
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|it just does not download and I really want to play it with my kids they were so sad when I said &quot;sorry guys but the game will not download
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|VERY GOOD ALBUM!! Dont let the hateful reviews fool you. If youve been a fan of Wayne and listen to him regularly then your going to love this album. I can see someone whos new to Wayne and picked up the cd cause of the hype be dissapointed but it really is a great album. Might have to grow on you but this is going under Waynes belt as another classic!!<br />#YMCMB #IANAHB2
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and surprisingly enough so does my husband ! We can't wait for season 4 just disappointed that we have to wait a year :(
1250006341|5.0|I loved this book. I would recommend it for fans of the show. Insightful comments from the cast & historical details make for a great read.
B0042JH05I|1.0|May I have the attention of you pinheads who produce & direct concert DVDs, some of us don't have ADHD, and would appreciate a concert that isn't directed by a 8-year old who can't leave the camera switcher alone.  Just because you have 20 cameras in the venue, doesn't mean you have to use all 20 in every minute of every song.  This \\"Going Back\\" video is the unfortunate victim of  hacky smash-cut MTV style editing (which might be OK for a 3 minute concept video aimed at hyperactive teens.  But since is a 2-hour live concert, and Phil's demographic is a little more 'mature', you might try the occasional shot that lasts more than 3 seconds once in a while - and a little more artistry with the jib/boom shots.  My initial reaction was to turn it off in disgust.  Then out of morbid curiosity (like rubber-necking at a horrific car wreck) I turned it back on and set a digital timer to beep every 60 seconds, so I could count the number of cuts per minute.  Most of the minutes averaged around 20 smash-cuts per minute - which is RIDICULOUS even for an amateur student film.  I noticed there's no Director credited on this page, no wonder - pitiful work whoever you are.  I come into this video as a Phil Collins fan who likes Motown music, and I found it completely un-watchable.
1250027624|5.0|I loved this book. It has just the right mix of historical facts & details about the world of Downton.
B007AL48UK|3.0|This is not my favorite, but I do generally like all the Mahjong games on the Kindle Fire.  It isn't that easy to make it work.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|One of the three seminal albums by one of the best prog-rock bands of all time.  The other two are Hemispheres and Permanent Waves.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Love the books, I have trouble puting it down, I would certainly recommend this read, it certainly has renewned my love for reading
B0031RS42K|5.0|I love the pace and descriptors in this book - the technology described apparently exists and it blows my mind.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this app just not sure how long I'll play. You have to buy diamonds with real money in order to restore your energy.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Running a Summer Enrichment Program for Middle School students.  This was an informative book!  I am basing the program on the Percy Jackson series of books targeting students who are studying Latin.
B007FQW7LM|5.0|For the money as little as 20 dollars you get the remastered editions with various bonus tracks and BBC recordings.<br />The only gripe Is the booklet that has the LP front of each but not much else as to credits and musicians...as for those I might spring for them to get the various odds and ends left off the remasters but these are the same editions...so this collection is indeed a collection of his first 5 Harvest albums remastered wonderfully and is a great stand alone considering you get the complete original albums. As to the man's uniqueness and versatility of styles from psychedelia, jazzy,blues,folk,reggae, you best decide, RIP Mr. Ayers.<br />Those contemplating this purchase know his background and those he influenced..He remains a high mark of eccentricity and genius.
B002BGA7WM|5.0|I love muse, I love this CD and I love that i can download it and use it in any format I need
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!  It was very exciting - crazy - goofy - lots of twists and turns - perspective from both the husband and wife  throughout the book - couldn't put down - interesting ending!
0316227706|4.0|Underwater dogs is creative, fun, and a &#34;must&#34; for any dog lover out there. Bought this for myself and also for a friend's birthday.<br /><br />So cute, and very high quality photos!
B000CCD0HQ|3.0|A good blues song as far as the first two songs go. Besides, Frank Beard is a personal friend I've known for years.
1452115567|5.0|I really got &#34;into&#34; Maddie via the tumblr blog, and can't wait for the book tour to visit NYC so I can meet the duo in person.<br /><br />But what's really fantastic about this book is the dedication. It's really moving and gives you a clear understanding of the book and what's behind it.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|The Beatles best album ever in history. No other band has been able to reproduce it in any way, shape or form. It will bee this way forever....
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|This show is kind of weak and frustrating. It has that feel that they will just keep pulling crap out of the air when they need it -- oh that guy's one of them, or wait he isn't -- oh he has someone on the inside -- and on and on never reaching an end or conclusion.<br /><br />But Kevin Bacon is in it! Sad that our viewing choices are so poor.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|One of &#34;The Beatles&#34; best of Albums among them all as a matter in fact. The only Beatle I do not care for much anymore is PAUL.
B00AFEY354|5.0|Modern coming of age story.  It was a warm hearted, lovely and enjoyable movie.  The main characters were wonderful.  The movie deals with the dilemma of drugs, mental illness, child molestation, homosexuality, and homophobia in the teenage years however these subjects are treated kindly, with cause and effect explored.  Has a nice ending too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More entertaining than temple run (original). It's a fun way to relax after a hectic day at work. Very intriguing!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Solid Book.... I was reading this as Chris Kyle was killed which made it hard to stomach considering all the parts from his wife and kids.  Good book though and a true American Hero.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app gets you right to the current weather and long term forecast. You can put many destinations. Great for travel.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Great music! Great lyrics! Great artist! Great Message! &#34;America the brave still fears what we don't know. God loves all his children some how forgotten yet we paraphrase a book written 3,500 years ago&#34;.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app is easy to use has great visuals and accurate info. The font is a good size,easy to read.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|Very disappointing. Auther took easy way out on all of the plots.<br />Doubt if I will purchase the final book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This is a very entertaining show.  The great thing about the instant downloads is you don't have to wait to see the next episode.
B001LF3YQK|3.0|This case easily opens and does not close very well. I didn't realize it didn't close and it dried out my baby's wipes. Red sliding circle snaps off easily as well.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I used it on the Fire and it worked great.  I gave the stylus to a friend who uses it on her iPhone and is very satisfied.  I am going to buy another one for my Kindle Paperwhite.  It has 3 tips but I tend to use just the small one as it is the most responsive on the Kindle and iPhone.
B001E6X4W0|5.0|Love this movie, all of it been a fan for so long great charater development, funny entertaining, wow just a dope movie a classic in my eyes.
B00821OX98|4.0|Yes, another end of the world scenario and the aliens are a bit odd but the fact that people come and work together to<br />&#34;survive&#34; means a lot.
B006LSZECO|2.0|That is one messed up story. I grew to despise both the antagonist and protagonist. It was well written, original. Just messed up to think this way of thinking and acting could be!
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|I want to first state how upset I am at Dreamworks subterfuge in their packaging of 3d version. It states up to 8.00 off the Croods movie ticket. That's it. I plopped down 30.00 big ones at Walmart the other day ONLY because of the 8.00 discount. Once home I was astounded to learn that it is only for a KID's ticket. Straight subterfuge slick tricks. WOW. Buyer beware. I would have waited for the price drop and will now be alert for other future releases by Dreamworks. OK enough ranting. The animation is simply superb, the picture amongst the very best CGI animes I have ever see. The True HD 7.1 is astoundingly good. This movie is all about lots and loads of eye candy. The voice talent as well is phenomenal with each actor from Baldwin to Jude Law and other greats really inhabiting their characters. Hugh was really perfect as an outback Bunny. The movie is great for younger viewers, but for adults I personally feel Wreck it Ralf, while simpler to a point, had a bit more heart but that's only my opinion. At the same time Wreck it's premise is much thinner than even this one...e.g. video game character compared to icons of folklore legend and their impact on children (almost everywhere).<br />  Still this is a great buy at 19.99 or less. A true keeper, especially if you have youngsters. Hats off to a terrific animation team and cast and director. Bravo.
B004ZJZQFG|5.0|This movie gives your sub and surround speakers a good work out. The overall story is pretty good. Great movie.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I've been using this app on my kindle for about two weeks now. It works great for my appointments, tasks, and reminders! Very simple and straight forward app and you can't complain about the price.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a very entertaining series. Well written with great characters illustrating the divide as well as the connections between served and the servant classes.  The dialog can be difficult at times do to accents and speed at which Otis delivered.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and can't wait for season 4 to be available to add to my collection...great series..love it
B000FC1K66|5.0|I read approximately 60 percent sporadically not certain I wanted to continue.  Too many philosophical innuendos that seemed to lead nowhere.  Once I had read past the trial, I couldn't put the book.  My judgement of the protagonists took several \\"about faces\\".
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable is longer then the regular one that comes with the Kendle Fire. I like it because it plugs into the PowerFast Accerated charger so it is much easier to handle.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this game.  It is very addictive.  This is a great match three game.  Can't wait to play the next one.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love hungry shark evolution so much maybe you don't like it but I love it.so I am going to give it five stars because I love this game that much.
B009IRVSVQ|3.0|I really liked the first Bruno record, but this time he seemed to miss the mark.  Also the vulgar seemed unnecessary
B0060MYM7O|5.0|A must watched show! Absolutely the best I've ever seen. Not for the young ones it's a rated R series.
B000002OZY|5.0|Read Pete Townsends autobiagraphy so wanted a fresh listen to Tommy.  Nothing like it since and really work a full play when you have time.....very happy it is back in my listening rotation
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This novel blew me away. I loved the character development and how Nicholas Sparks always pleasantly surprises me with the endings.
B008LA7RM0|4.0|I really like it but can't say I love it.<br /><br />I really don't like mono and don't think it was needed
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book. One of my all time favorites. If you are considering reading this book, go for it and feel infinite!
B008PE9GSA|4.0|If you like ZZ you will love La Futura but nothing new here to really get excited about so just love them for who they are
B002NWXRYY|5.0|Though a little cliche in the end, this movie is funny. Great movie. I recommend for any who like romantic comedy.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|I have to admited not everyone likes this type of series.  But for me, it has all I look for in a TV series
B00190OHD6|4.0|I've seen this movie multiple times now. When I think about it, I don't remember how funny it is and think of it as boring, but when I watch it again, it's fun and funny at times. I highly recommend for anyone who likes a good romantic comedy.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Never read a book like this before and i really enjoyed it! The story is captivating and i was reading for hours with out wanting to put it down.<br /><br />a must read!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I love this movie. It's one of those movies you never really want to end, it's just so fun. And it makes you think. I highly recommend for any who enjoy a good adventure and any who are interested in psychology and/or dreams and their psychology. And any who just really like movies. This is one of the best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun to play. I love horsed so it is a perfected game for me to play. would tell all my friends about it
B000TEVIMQ|5.0|These are awesome songs from the past! I would recommend this album to anyone who has ever liked Jethro Tull
6305132984|1.0|I ordered this DVD with special features and 8-page booklet. I got received a disk in a slim tiny case with no special features no booklet and different image on the cover. The disc inside said disc 1 as if there was supposed to be more than one disc. WHAT IS THIS?! I returned it to amazon right away.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|I knew so little about life in North Korea. What an eye opener. Very readable, ver informative, very emotionally wrenching.
B004FEFS5E|4.0|It is an excellent book for learning how to use your dslr and how to take great pictures.  It gives you a solid foundation to learn upon and to explore your creativity.  Picture examples are very fitting with his lessons and after a second read his methods are fully understood and it gives clarity to the picture examples.  Only negative is that at times, not that it should take away from the book, he explains details from a conventional slr point of view.  It isnt too many times but about 2-3 times the context gets muddied.  Overall it is a great read and anyone who wants a better handle on their dslr should read this.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Doesn't work on my Google Nexus.  Apparently doesn't work on a broad array of android platforms.  No warning of this prior to purchase.  Amazon should refund purchase but will not.  Will buy from other sources in the future.  Product is to be avoided.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I haven't read the third book but, oh my goodness I think this is the best of the trilogy. It's much better than the first. (If you didn't quite like the first just as I, then do try reading this one,the second. Trust me,it's quite a read that you'll thirst to take every free second to read.)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The various twists and responsiveness of the play make this game a keeper.  All I want to say is that it is satisfying and time wasting.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Can't wait for The Ghost of Maple Creek 2 .  Loved the storyline and the graphics were great .  Hope the second sequel is as long as the first one .
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|It was too artsy fartsy for me.  Also, it was very slow.  Lastly, the message this film portray's was way too overbearing.  I'm glad I didn't spend the money to see it in the theatre.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game is really fun and unlike most games like this you don't have to stop playing and wait to do something. You can continuously play without having to stop. It has a few bugs on kindle for me but the game is overall totally worth it.
1419553429|2.0|The first 2/3 of this book is verbal based and does a good job. I bought this book because I need work on math I had been getting about 85% percentile on practice GMAT. I was getting stumped on wayy too many questions.<br /><br />This book does a decent job of reviewing key math concepts, but there has not been a single problem I couldn't do in my head. Compared with struggling over even medium difficulty problems on practice tests.<br /><br />Alos in the verbal section there were questions I've seen outside of this book.<br /><br />Never written a review before but had to put the book down and write this one.
B0001I55SS|5.0|Different kind of movie for Disney back then. Wonderful cast and good special effects with the robots floating in air and the double barrel ray guns and the music.Remember this is just a movie by Disney and their view on what might happen to anything going though a black hole, so sit back and enjoy it.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|SOA is a well written show and there's just no words to describe it, you either love it or hate it.
1933492929|5.0|This is a most interesting book. The illustrator, Terryl Whitlatch is a well-known artist who has done much creature design for the entertainment industry, including some for Star Wars (Jar-Jar Binks, for one.) The illustrations shown here include skeletal/musculature drawings of various animals, extant & extinct, such as several dinosaurs, horses, cats big and small, etc. There are also many drawings/paintings of fantasy/science fiction creatures, including hypothetical skeletal drawings  of such animals, as well as a fairly large selection of cartoon animals, including sci-fi/fantasy cartoon creatures. This would be an excellent choice for someone wanting to learn to do creature design for movies/TV shows,or anyone interested in learning to do first-rate drawings/paintings of extinct or living creatures, as well as the many people who enjoy merely seeing such art.
B005LAII94|5.0|savages,really liked the movie. i have always been a fan of oliver stone and he didn't disappoint. thanks again. drum0951
B001FBIPF0|5.0|It does have a crack on the cover, but I took a leap and bought a used cd...I'm lucky<br />it even worked! Listen to it everyday driving to work!
B008OJ291W|5.0|been a huge fan of elo and didn't know this one was out there. glad i purchased it. thanks again drum0951
1401937519|5.0|I am a 64 year old man. Just finished Anita's book this morning. The most accurate way I can commend this book to you is to quote the most powerful human observation I have ever encountered (from Anita's book); &#34;I believe that my cancer was related to my self-identity, and it feels as though it was my body's way of telling me that my soul was grieving for the loss of its own worth - of its identity. If I'd known the truth of who I actually am, I wouldn't have gotten cancer!&#34; Buy this book and read it fearlessly!
B009DJB9HC|5.0|i have the first two bcc and finally purchased this one. this is the best one yet. thanks again drum0951
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A friend of ours recommended we watch this TV series.  We found Season 1 and 2 on Netflix but Season 3 was half way through and was only available here.  It was extremely easy to stream the shows.  I purchased each one via my laptop and connected it to our 57&#34; LED TV.  It streamed smoothly, with no freezing.  The clarity was fine even without any fancy cables.  This is the first time we purchased tv show/movie this way and we would definitely recommend it and do it again.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Someone told me about temple run and I tried it.  IT IS GREAT.  The only thing that I do not like is the fact that you usually have to buy the gems.
B00BHMF578|5.0|An intense and riveting adventure flick that keeps your attention especially knowing it is a real story of heroism and courage.  Definitely worth watching.
B00BHNR1KQ|3.0|I loved Insidious and thought this would be of equal quality. Dont bvet me wrong it had its parts but overall I was left feeling disappointed as it didnt have as many chilling parts as I hoped. Worth a rent for a couple bucks to
B000056HE9|5.0|Granted this movie was filmed in glorious Black & White, but it's still a classic, excellent film that EVERYONE should watch, if not OWN.  Everything about this movie is first rate!  I do wish it had been filmed in color, but that's okay; it helps to date the movie too.  If you've never seen this movie, you should!
B003BLPTB0|3.0|The decorative thread is coming apart on both shoes.  I have had the shoes for only 2 weeks.  I bought a pair years ago, and the threads are still intact today. I probably won't buy another pair.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|Intriguing. Goes beyond typical vampire sagas with strong and well connected characters. Cat has a sense of strength and conviction not to be taken lightly. Romance storyline is hot, but not enough to over power the main story, just as an expected enhancement. Second book keeps me interested for the third to see where the story takes the reader next.<br />Well done!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this app a lot it is way better than the first app I like how there is more twist and turns thin the first one

B007PT1PEY|4.0|There are a lot old English words, but the tales can still be readen in this modern times. I 'm from Holland. Love to read it.
0307887898|4.0|Should be required reading for all entrepreneurs.<br /><br />Would have given it 5 stars, except that the author gets quite repetitive while exploring the subtleties of applying the Lean management techniques. A few templates to get newbies started would have helped.<br /><br />Heavy on theory, light on &#34;how to actually implement&#34;<br /><br />For example the author constantly talks about split testing features without any clear examples.
0385344228|5.0|Defending Jacob is an amazing book.  When a teenage boy is murdered in a park, Andrew Barber as district attorney takes over the investigation.  However, when his own son is accused of the murder, he is forced to drop his prosecutor role and take over his greater roll of defending Jacob.<br /><br />That in itself would be an interesting mystery novel.  Teenage boy kills other teenage boy.  Evidence gathered, courtroom trial.  But this book goes so much further than that.  It makes you think.  What would you do if your child was charged with murder?  How would you deal with it?  Would you be blindly sure of his innocence?  Would you let small doubts creep in?  Would the family fall apart with the stress or become an \\"us against them\\" united group?<br /><br />It is the story of what happens to this family.  How they cope.  What choices they make.  How it affects them, their lives, and what things will never be the same.
B00881VLCE|5.0|AWESOME! I enjoy the option to pick the number of pieces & that I don't need Internet to do the puzzles. Beautiful pictures.
B003KHJJNE|4.0|Since other reviews in this column pay hommage to this release and maestro Casals, I will focus mine on those aspects that, in my opinion, take one star out of the rating, without omitting, of course, the magnificent production values that this Original Jacket collections have had in every single release.  No wonder that by the price some of them are selling, they've become true collector's items.<br /><br />I pressume that Casals tenure with Columbia started after WWII when he was in self-exile from franquist Spain just across the border of his beloved Catalonia, in the small town of Prades (eastern Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es).<br />Having explored his EMI recordings, it is worth admitting that Casals was passing his prime rapidly from 1950 onward, and witnessed in some recordings heard here. The Concerto at the White House, in front of the Kennedys, is more a memento than a true artistic utterance (although the El cant des ocells, warts and all, comes emotionally from the deepest place of the cellist gut).<br /><br />The other point you should take into account is the tendency of the maestro for groaning. No, this is not Glenn Gould singing along; these are guttural noises with no explainable reason. OK, they don't happen enough to dimish the overall apreciation, but it becomes then a matter of tolerance. If you are a perfectionist that likes its music pristine, forget it.<br /><br />Those caveats aside, I do not regret acquiring this set. The sound is pretty good, even for the 1950s (in fact, the less adequate sound comes from the White House's '61 live recital). I also have to mention my surpirse with Schumann's Cello Concerto performance. It has a life that I have not found in any other renderings. Grunts and all, a winner in my book.<br /><br />in summary, if you love the cello, or admire the musicianship of Pau Casals and want to invest in a true collector's item, go for it. At the current prices, it's a winner.
B00BHMF578|4.0|We missed this in the Theatre so rented on line.  Found the movie a bit slow at first but overall we enjoyed it.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|It's not for everyone!  You have to have sort of sick humor and you almost had to of grown up in the 1980's to understand the humor.  Mark Wahlberg is always great!
B00275EHJQ|4.0|Our 2 year old granddaughter is a big Toy Story fan. The 3rd movie was great addition to her collection.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|I know there is a lot of criticism of this book as not being very original etc etc. But as a work of Epic fantasy this one does stand above the majority. There might not be amazingly much new here, but Goodkind is a real storyteller. Things move on at a nice pace and the book gathers momentum towards the end, just like a good book should. The characters are interesting and even though very powerful are not without their faults. Goodkind also creates an interesting magic system in these books.<br />  It's the second book in the Sword of Truth series but could stand alone as there are not that many back story threads from Wizards First Rule. Even though there is a satisfactory conclusion to the book, it's obvious that there is more to come.
B00BI745AA|5.0|Wasn't sure how I was going to like this but after about 30 minutes I really got into the story. By the end I was tearing up. Can't wait to watch it again.

B001HN690O|1.0|Wow, Dreamworks really did a number on the obfuscatory packaging of this.<br />i bought this believing there were two different movies i was buying,<br />not one movie with a subtitle and two differently recorded discs -<br />i am not at all sure why the two discs (what can i do with a blueray disc?) might be useful to me.<br /><br />The way Dreamworks packages this, i was left with the impression that Kung Fu Panda 2 was one movie,<br />and Secrets of the Masters was another.<br />That is the only reason why i bought this version,<br />with the mistaken impression i was getting a better deal.<br />Otherwise i could have bought it for much less.<br /><br />Kung Fu Panda 2 and Secrets of the Masters are the same movie. Don't be misled as i was!<br />Boy, this makes me mad.<br /><br />i would have bought the single disc for much less had i seen through the obfuscation earlier.
B000I5X81K|5.0|Just another one of my favorite male singers.  Would recommend.  I have a lot of Josh's CD, but haven't bought some of his most recent...not for any particular reason though...just haven't.

B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Lack of plot, annoying characters, with a couple laughs mixed in. Not worth the time or money, so save yourself both and keep looking.

B0001ZXM54|5.0|ZZ Top is one of the true &#34;Rock&#34; bands left on the planet. Every singer/band puts out a Greatest hits album. There's always one or two songs that you never heard of. Rancho Texicano truely is a &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; album. 38 songs that will keep you rockin' all night long or in your car, all the way to where you're going.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob is a chilling, yet memorable, novel.  Landay is excellent with character development and a story line that keeps the reader engaged throughout.  As the story unfolds, the reader reflects upon his knowledge about his child.  Andy Barber thought that he knew his son until the onion layers began to foliate.  The court case and following epilogue rock a parent to he core.

B0034G4OYA|4.0|This past Halloween was pretty exciting as far as animated features goes: Frankenweenie, Paranorman, Hotel Transylvania- if a trip to my local Cineplex didn't cost roughly the same as the Gross National Product of Latvia; I imagine there could have been some seriously great memories made with a tub of popcorn and a warm hoodie.  But alas, I digress.  In my case, Hotel Transylvania had to wait for the home release and for the most part, it was quite enjoyable if entirely inappropriate seasonally.<br /><br />Hotel Transylvania is the $85-million dollar, 91-minute PG rated animated film rumored to have been in development for an abnormally long (even for an animated feature) six-years. The end result lavishly uses the CG medium to reflect the direction and style of animator/director Genndy Tartakovsky.  If that means nothing to you, imagine a slightly caricaturized version of the classic movie monsters complete with clich&eacute;s and accents a plenty.<br /><br />While Sony's Image Works division rarely threatens Pixar or DreamWork's supremacy in the computer animated realm, the visuals are solid here with a good deal of background detail present that almost demands multiple viewings so fully absorb.<br /><br />The story, while certainly adequate, sadly never reaches much deeper than the previews alluded: In 1895, Count Dracula builds a resort in Transylvania, hidden away from the humanity, as a place for monsters to crash but also as a sanctuary to raise his daughter Mavis.<br /><br />Fast forward to present day and old Drac is busy inviting friends (among these Frankenstein and his wife Eunice; Wayne and Wanda werewolves; Griffin, the invisible man; Murray, the mummy; Bigfoot, among others) to the hotel so as to celebrate the 118th birthday of Mavis (18 in human years).<br /><br />Just as the party is about to get underway, a dopey 21-year-old human named Jonathan happens to stumble upon the hotel.  Monsters, it turns out, fear humans the way, well, the way humans fear monsters.  Ordinarily the Count would likely kick a wandering human to the curb (possibly short on a few corpuscles) but complicating matters is Mavis, who falls in love with the lad quite unaware that he is in fact a human.<br /><br />Undoubtedly the film's greatest strength lies in its casting: Adam Sandler as Dracula, Andy Samberg as Jonathan, Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as the Invisible Man, Steve Buscemi as Wolfman and on and on.  One really gets the feeling that these guys could be reading random pages from a phonebook and elicit the giggles.  That said, everyone plays really well off each other but never reach the type of comedic crescendo I sort of expected going in.  Most of the humor is actually derived from visual gags (Frankenstein's lower half releases some gas that gets blames on the unsuspecting Mummy, a female skeleton gets caught showering and tries to cover up despite having no physical features to hide and so on).<br /><br />Mark Mothersbaugh's upbeat score is quite appropriate; reminding the viewer in even the darkest moments of the piece that the focal point here is laughter and silliness with love as the backdrop.  The ending of the film does break out into a cheesy musical number that some may find a bit much but in all the audio is right up there with the visuals in terms of propelling the prose along.<br /><br />In all Hotel Transylvania is a success on most every level.  It lacks that Pixar creativity factor that continually results in the studio's showering in awards but it's solid through and through with visual charm that will keep the young ones entertained and enough layered wit for adults to enjoy as well.sters.

B0091REZMW|3.0|I like hidden object games. This is not the worst or best game. It is something different than most of the games for kindle. I prefer more ways to earn diamonds. If you don't purchase coins or diamonds then you have to pause in between playing, but it is doable at no cost. I like the graphics very much.
B005FFW46S|5.0|I have always been a big fan of disc world and Commander vimes is one of my favorite characters. I would recommend this to any Terry pratchett or comedy fan. Keeps you entertained and laughing the whole time!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 23 and while not obese or by any means fat, a little bit heavier than I would want to be for the pool season, and also pretty out of shape. I started off level 1 for one week and I noticed a huge difference . While I haven't lost weight ( I refuse to believe its muscle gain because I haven't been doing it long enough to get that much muscle ) I look better and feel better. I can go up and down my dreadful stairs much better and I feel more confident. I just bought level two and I still love it. While on level 1 i look at the &#34; advanced girl &#34; and could do the moves on the advanced level, in level 2 I have to look at the &#34; weaker girl &#34; and go by that but that's how you push yourself. As far as Jillian goes, I used to be a big fan of biggest loser and have seen her at her worst , manner wise and I was happy with what I got. People want their trainers to be funny and cute and joke around and go on their paste, but that's not how you lose weight. Some people need a little star push and that is what needs to get done. Jillian is honest and as nice as it gets with her. I am beyond happy and can't wait to see more results
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Heard about it.  Have read others like it.  Read reviews about this.<br />On the basis of all that:  three stars.  Would like to get it on Kindle Paperwhite, but have been unsuccessful.<br />Will read it and then rate it.<br />Thanks.<br />Sig Brauch
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have read lots of his books and this one was one of the ones that I can safely say will keep you up late at night. Be warned, you will not be able to put it down.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It will get old like most games you'll download but it's a lot of fun and defiantly worth a download. My kid loves it too. Eating people is oddly satisfying.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Where do I begin, the sound effects and the 1080P HD video is out of this world, I also like the deleted scenes I was able to understand somethings that are hard to follow, like the backstory, unless you watch some of the extra material that comes in the discs. Love the commentary by the Director and the Actors. The only other collection I can compare to this one to as far as quality is probably Star Wars. If you are a Science Fiction fan you wont regret this purchase.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Unable to load on my Kindle - although advertised for Android it alluded to the fact that it was loadable on a Kindle Fire - have been unable to open it on that device.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|The film streamed flawlessly and the quality is frankly jaw dropping given the age of the film. One of my absolute favorite movies felt fresh and new in such gorgeous high definition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the greatest all time books I have read! Love the writer Nicholas Sparks and would recommend this book to EVERYONE!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an easy game that is fun for all ages. The graphics are very nice for a free app.
6303314015|5.0|Good shipping time , product great, and the price wonderful! I would buy from this seller again. The tape runs perfectly without any issues, my 3 year old is pleased! Thank you.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does exactly what it says it does, and it's easy to learn. I have it on my kindle fire and it works fine, so far. I like how it allows you to see the cities that you have chosen as soon as the application pops up.
B00005OMTT|3.0|Guess I was spoiled with MCMXC...whatever.  In my opinion the Greatest Hits didn't measure up to one of the components previously released.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Good anecdotes. Interesting explanations for patterns I've observed. I'd read from him again. Read it if you want to learn how we operate and change.
B0000669JL|4.0|I bought this CD for a full fidelity version of the 4 MP3's I have from the same album.  I was hoping to find a few extra jewels but didn't.  All in all, one of the greats though.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|It came with our Kindle, I have not tried it, mostly becuase I can't pry it out of my daughter's hands!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|That's right. Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, and The Hulk have all led up to this. And it doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />Unlike the individual character movies, half of this one isn't origin story. It's all action. And in doing that, it still wraps up the plot-lines from the other films into one big climax.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I liked it. It had really good advice, but was a bit techy. Still, it is a very good resource for anyone who wants to build their book for Kindle
B000007443|5.0|I'm a drummer an like listening to early Peter Erskine stuff. This is from the 1980s, and sort modern, or new age jazz for it's time.<br />There's plenty of good drumming on this.<br />Also, Michael Brecker tends to get a little out there in his later music, so the early stuff is just fine for me.<br />Mike Marineri is a great vibes player and it really sets the mood for most of this music.<br />I never heard of Eliane Elias until recently but she's a perfect pianist for this.<br />Eddie Gomez is on bass.<br />The music doesn't really bash you over the head, it is kind of ethereal and easy to miss the fact that the chops underneath that propel it along are so good.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really wanted to love this book. i heard so much about it and people consantly talking about it. as an avid reader i couldnt believe all the repetitiveness in the book. every other page is holy crap, holy cow.. he kissed me down there.. so immature.. im 21 and could have came up with better writing than that. now some of the sex scenes were intense but after a while i got bored. the story had alot of potential but it lacks depth in the charachters. it just seem like she made dialogue just to have a story. its sex every other page. If you want a real erotic book with a good story line look up nicole joran, jude deveraux and people like that. their stories are great with just as much intense sex scenes. i want to see if the plot gets better in book two. but at the end of the first book it never did. I still dont know what mr grey does for him to be a billionaire. i would like to know more about the charachters because they all fall flat. i wouldnt recommend it unless you want to read about porn to get tips. even then..
B0055G9L9U|4.0|A bit on the goofy side - well, make that more than a &#34;bit&#34;, but still very entertaining.  Slams pretty much every institution, so be prepared to be insulted.  If you can't laugh at yourself, you're missing out a lot.  Paul is how a good friend ought to be - doesn't sweat the small stuff and knows how to have a good time.
6304711905|4.0|I love this movie.  I haven't watched this particular DVD yet.  I have always loved this one best of the Wyatt Earp movies.  Val Kilmer makes quite the great Doc.  He did a superb job.  I will post an update after I watch this movie to make sure it didn't get scratched.  It seems to me it was a Big Error in the Packaging at the Factory where they made the DVD.  It did not have anything to do with Amazon or their packaging.  I would recommend this movie.  Just a bit upset at the factory people for not doing a better job of the making and packaging of thier product before leaving the factory.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|it was very good movie I thought it could have showed more about booth and them trying to kill stewart
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I was going into this film wary with a little hesitation, because Casino Royale was such a great restart for the series, but Quantum of Solice was good but not great.  I didn't really know what to expect, but I was not disappointed this time.  The story was phenomenal.  The acting brought you into the story and never let go.  The filming locations from running and racing through the streets and roof tops of Istanbul, Turkey to the final battle in the Scottish Highlands where spectacularly shot and played well with the story itself.<br />Daniel Craig once again played Bond outstandingly well.  The Dame Judi Dench as M was, as always,  classy, refined and beautiful. Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Gareth Mallory, the uptight bureaucrat, until you put his back up against a wall and he turns into a real badass.  And lastly what can I say about Javier Bardem's performance as the captured, forgotten, broken and turned evil Silva. He was unforgettable and will go down in infamy with the great Bond villains.<br />I give this film 5 stars and look forward to the next bond film.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|First of all , for everyone complaining about the fifty shades-series,whining that it is not welll-written and it's just crap and blah blah blah. You know what ? stop whining and making a fuzz about it, take it as it is, this is Twilight-fanfiction based series with a lot more &#34;action&#34; going on than the Twilight saga, aimed at teenagers/young adults and adults that like to read braindead entertainment, this is not Jane Austen or War and Peace, stop complaining!<br /><br /> And now over to reviewing the books, I saw these books at the bookstore, and I was looking for something easy to read, maybe something cheezy, and the fifty shades books are perfect. I downloaded a sample to my kindle ,and to my great surprise I found out that I've read the first chapter a couple of years ago as Twilight-fanfiction , and it was fun. It's very entertaining, and a bit more &#34;realistic&#34; than Twilight. I read the three books in record time, lovin' it :D
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fast and challanging pace. graphics well done and easy to see.it is very addictive and I would reccommend it rasily
B0043VDIAG|5.0|It was a coincidence that I heard about this book at all, but I gave it a try and I dont regret it. It's a great story, well written and easy to read at the same time, dont expect something Shakespearean but it's not a teenage novel either. I highly recommend it.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|One of the best action movies of 2012, and I'm glad to own it on Blu-Ray.  The blooper reel alone is worth the price!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hobbit very much! it was funny and theres a lot of action. The movie had the same feel as the Lord of the Rings trilogy that i really enjoyed. Many of the characters reprise there roles and that was really neat. I would recommend this movie to everyone, to Lord of the Rings fans or anyone who likes fantasy to new viewers that want to see what its all about. The only issue i had was that right when it ended i wanted more. Its really a great movie over all. So anyone who's thinking of getting it, Get it! Four thumbs up!
1401223176|4.0|*MINOR SPOILER ALERT*  Good story, not as good as some of the others such as &#34;The Killing Joke&#34; and &#34;Death in the Family&#34;, both of which are referenced in this book.  Be sure to read both of those before reading this.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This is a movie where the trailer is the most funny element.  That, and the bit while the credits are playing -- Melissa McCarthy is always funny, and didn't disappoint this time.  The rest -- even though I love the actors in this film -- ehh.
B001P06GX4|5.0|5 stars. One of the best make-you-think-games that is out there. And when I say think, I don't mean too hard. My young kids love it because it's not complicated.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Extremely well written book. The characters were so believable and easey to root for. I would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|does what it is supposed too.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Maybe not as &#34;obvious&#34; for children as Disney movies but still a great story and visually stunning! Especially when Sandman takes the screen! A must for Movie collectors of this genre!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel.  I didn't realize what a great writer he is. Even though this book has a couple of bizarre elements, it captured my attention. The book centers around the idea &#34;What would happen if you had the ability to go back in time and try to stop the Kennedy assassination?&#34;  I can't give away the story, but is it exciting.  You should read this book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|well written script.  I enjoyed watching the characters especially Maggie Smith's character and her one liners. I was sad that Sybil's character was eliminated.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Another great Angry Birds game. I like the new environment! Never boring. Although available, I do not like the requests to buy power ups. I k ow I can get them, but  would prefer to do it on my terms:-)  STILL a great game!:-)
B009MF56GC|4.0|I have reallly impresions with the film, it have got a lot of shuting parts, adventure , and more. i really like it.
141970642X|5.0|my son loves these books, and this one was no different.  It goes into the lives of the actors, and was a lot of fun to learn about them.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I'm eleven and loved this book definitely read. Differently a five star rating. You must read also a good book for book club.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Thank you, Joss! This was the perfect way to end Firefly and say goodbye to the characters that you've grown to love.
B00004YWAG|5.0|SAVALLS'S STUNNING SEDUCTION!<br /><br />It would be difficult to imagine an early music lover that would not be seduced by the first offering on this disc which is an incredibly lovely sustained work that presents a beautious melody by Heinrich Isaac \\"Fortuna desperata: Nasci, pati mori\\" (Reckless fortune). Indeed I found something interesting and enjoyable in all of the 21 selections: six instrumental and fifteen of varied vocal, vocal/ instrumental with all sorts of combinations; very entertaining!<br /><br />This recording is a mixed bag of music by Reformation Era composers accompanied by a group of somewhat earlier works.  Savall herein includes his top-notch instrumental ensemble, updated to Hesperion XXI.  He combines this with his own vocal group, La Capella Reial.  The results are captivating for Savall's musicians are tops in the field, and their collective talents are a joy to hear. Though Savall has made many recordings of this ilk, he has managed to come up with new pieces not duplicated on any other recordings.  Alla Vox known for the full-bodied smooth sound has again reproduced it with this disc, especially in the Renaissance percussion instruments.<br /><br />Thirty musicians perform in various combinations of voices and/or instruments all of which creates a high interest level for the listener.  There are smaller groups of performers that change with each offering.  Some of the composers are: Juan Del Enzina, Josquin Des Pres, Antonio De Cabazon, Adrian Willaert and Cristobal Morales, to name a just a few. The only selection that includes female voices (sopranos) is Track six a selection by Enzina.  Some of the notable outstanding singers are: CARLOS MENA, PASCAL BERTIN, LAMBERT CLEMENT, FRANCESE GARRIGOSA AND DANIELE CARNOVICH.<br /><br />With all the Renaissance discs on the market one might ask why single out this one?  I purchased it because of the obvious enthusiasm of the performers carefully directed, not just energetic when it is inappropriate, but show deep respect, mystery and nostaligia in their performance. AND, IN ADDITION TO ALL OF THAT, the virtuosity of the participants produce a gorgeous balanced and highly varied sound! And as the song says:  WHO COULD ASK FOR ANYTHING MORE?<br /><br />Good packaging that includes a very informative booklet with the translated text in French, Spanish, German, English and Italian.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover is awsome.  I love how when reading you can stand it up.  Also protects my Kindle very well.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a wonderful, family friendly movie. It just goes to prove that a movie doesn't have to include trash to be excellent. It's packed with down-home warmth, and lots of adventure.
0743270754|5.0|This was a well-written and very informative book.  I highly recommend it to those who want to read more about Lincoln.
0920668372|5.0|I started to read this to our daughter at the pediatrcian's office.  He walked in and said, &#34;This is my favorite book.  Years ago, I went to my daughter's school and chose this book to read.  I couldn't get through it because I started crying.&#34;  I laughed it off...then I ordered the book....and cried.  Awesome book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was much a good read. I kind of figured out was going to happen about half way through it but I still loved it. Definitely a must read.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|The story was a lot different than what I expected from the trailers I'd seen on TV, but it was an exciting adventure and the cinematography was spectacular.  Overall, the movie was excellent and an enjoyable viewing experience.  I was very disappointed though that the Blu-ray disc did not work in my Blu-ray player.  It keeps stopping after the 20th Century Fox logo displays and will not continue to the movie itself.
B00BGIBVRG|5.0|This movie is beyond funny and hits a lot<br />Of real aspects of life love and marriage, I recommend it.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Exciting, fact based movie with lots of attention capturing drama.  Fast moving and well acted throughout.  The Canadians come out as the real heroes of the story by placing themselves in real danger in order to protect the 6 Americans.  The political appointees in the White House come off as kind of spineless when it came to making a decision to save the American hostages.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This was a good book, but the ending could have been less predictable.<br /> I would like to add that this book was free.
0060556501|5.0|I never read these stories as a child, but after seeing the play with the kids, I decided to look for an adapted version for them. This story is similar to the play. The toughest part for me reading this to 3 & 5 year olds is the talk of killing and dying. I know that is the story, I just think its kind if hard for that age. The book is great, the kids love the pictures and always listen attentively.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love the series. I have the first book in paperback. I read the other two on my kindle as free reads. Now I can read them all again on my kindle.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Wonderfully entertaining movie. Highly recommend it. A must see for everyone, kids and adults as well.Worth the price of admission.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|wasn't sure what to expect but glad to have gotten the game. essentially a match game that gets harder as you progress and before you know it you're hooked. great game!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Everything I expected.  Just great! Missed it at the theater, Liked it even better in the comfort of my own home.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|It won't let me play anymore. It keeps freezing on me so I will probably just take the game off my Kindle
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is the greatest book ever written.  This is so easy to use. To go where you want to quickly.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run it is so awesome it is the best in the world temple run is a fun loveable game
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|A truly beautiful story, and the HD quailty is amazing!! I felt like I was there abandon in the ocean with Pi and Richard Parker
B0093BUWGE|5.0|Jose James is like Gil Scott Heron meets Anthony Hamilton meets D'Angelo.  Vocals are liquid love and his band .... audible hugs!
B007N6NGYG|4.0|if you like to cha cha then why not choo choo<br />sometimes there's one and sometimes there's two too<br />you jump and you jive you twist and you turn<br />but make the wrong move and this things gonna burn!!
B004SDEP38|1.0|I tried to make a speech but you can't because it says you need the paid version to do it.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|what I need for day today operations .Not to complicated but complex enough to add invoice totals and figure taxes in numerous city's.
B0056C6XIA|4.0|This gerber multitool is a great toy for me!  My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple!  The sheath is very well designed, with a \\"rubber\\" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off.  My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access.  I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire.  I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months.  The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you.  I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, \\"rough\\" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick!  I've been asked why not just use a lighter.  Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy?  perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this app! its easy to use, it is good to keep your mind clear. we adore this. the only thing,  would be to allot more coins to buy stuff.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game by far is probably the best game I have ever played and I don't like that many games. The fact that you can pretty much make your own dragons and do stuff like that without trying to buy any gold is pretty cool
B009OYSFDM|5.0|I truly enjoy this program! The actors draw you in and after and after a busy day of work; I welcome the relaxation!<br /><br />Silas L. Griffin III
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Really fun game! Very enjoyable and I find myself playing it for long periods of time. in the beginning it may take a while to get going but after that it's fun. I wish their was also Naval Units too since there is also tanks jets etc.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|Love Lil Wayne - have all his releases. Some you only get 3-5 decent efforts which I can live with.<br /><br />This is a total POS - Carter - email me for my address to send my money back.<br /><br />I almost had seizures listening to it ONCE - not again.<br /><br />This IS THE WAR on Women. I am embarrassed  to be a man listening to this.<br /><br />Head out of ASS Lil Wayne!
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I'll admit that after trying every other diet out there, including medifast, I was skeptical at first.  BUT, I have found that this is not so much a physical diet - it is a change of attitude for me.  My attitudes about food and WHY I eat are now clear to me.  It's simple - twice a week I have the self control to eat 500 calories a day - the rest of the week I don't have to think about what I eat, but I do think now before I grab a piece of cake.  I can take it or leave it - it doesn't control me.  I am losing on average 2 pounds per week still.  I know once I get to my healthy weight my body will balance itself out.  Dr. Mosley has provided me the insight and inspired me to have what I need to have something no diet has ever been able to provide me before - a healthy lifestyle I can live with for the rest of my life.  Thank-you Mike Mosley.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|Food collection.<br />I like CD better than &#34;jackets&#34;.<br />They shoukd have nmore interesting CD in their storages.<br />I would like sequal of this series. i
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Yo subway surfers is the best game ever competing with my friends on Facebook is to funny I'm glad to be a member of this game cause I pay it like every day of the week
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Loved the series and have that too.  Movie is ok but has an edginess the series didn't have or really need.  Worth watching but watch the series first.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have been playing this game every day since I purchased it I can't stop. The graphics are great and the quests interesting.  Two problems -researching the rules and slow play because I don't want to pay for diamonds. On the whole- a good to spend time.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game for several hours. great graphics during the game. lots of fun and several different types of play are available. enjoy
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is an easy to read, well-written book that starts with a simple premise that grows into a complex story of faith and love.  It's not a &#34;religious&#34; book - there is no doctrine -  but rather a book that soothes and refreshes the spirit of all who believe there is more to life than random, meaningless, interacting people who live, die and that's it - the end.<br /><br />I won't even summarize the story - you need to read it yourself!  It's that good!  I've read all of Mitch Albom's books and I think this is his finest!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|The first time I read this was when it came out, holding the whole book for hours (because you can't just sit it down). I enjoyed it very much then but I decided to read it again on my Kindle. What a huge improvement! Now I can enlarge the font when my eyes get tired from reading so long or even change font if I want. Oh yeah, the book... well it is STEPHEN KING and it is IT. nothing more needed to say really!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Our daughters enjoy taking care of the horse and training her, but the ads that have started popping up at unexpected times as you try to do things in the game are quite annoying, though not (yet, anyway) anything inappropriate. Better safe than sorry, though, so I'm going to uninstall it. It's a shame; it's a cute app.
B000ID37KO|5.0|I have loved this movie for a very long time now. I had recorded it years ago, but it was in black and white and not the best quality. Amazon Instant Videos was the answer! This movie was in full color, and I was delighted to see such good quality. The only problem that I could see was that the picture was a little choppy from time to time but over all, I would rent this movie from Amazon again. I love Amazon Instant Videos! If anyone is in the mood for a classic horror movie where nature runs amuck, you will be thrilled with &#34;THE BIRDS&#34; from Amazon Instant Videos. Thank you, Amazon, for a wonderful viewing experience!
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This is definitely one of the top 10 albums ever!  I could listen to this one over and over again.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I admire Justin Timberlake's movie performances.  But I'm an old curmudgeon in my musical tastes.  I only &#34;like&#34; this album.  My niece, on the other hand, loves it.
B00A7OJ0DC|2.0|While the movie is great, I'm disappointed in the packaging of a $30+ version of this movie.  4 DVDs with only two disc holders, so there are two discs stacked on each holder.?
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Step 1: Make sure that your speakers and your amplifier are both capable of utilizing banana plugs. Most home theater systems and expensive speakers will have no problem with this, but older equipment that uses red and black tabs that you push back so that you can insert speaker wire won't be compatible.<br /><br />Step 2: Figure out how many banana plugs you need. You'll want 4 for each speaker: one red and one black for each end of the speaker wire. Here we've got 24 connectors so that's perfect for a 5.1 system with two main front speakers, a center speaker, two rears, and a subwoofer.<br /><br />Step 3: Connect each wire to the banana plug using the instructions on the product information page here on Amazon, then insert the plug into the appropriate outlet. You'll find that the plug may not insert fully depending upon the speaker or amplifier, but that's fine so long as it has a solid hold within the outlet.<br /><br />It's unlikely that you'll notice any difference in audio quality, but you're less likely to short out your amplifier by having stray wires from one side touch the other side, and you're more likely to get a solid connection, potentially reducing hum should that be an issue as well as reducing the amplifier workload.<br /><br />These are well-constructed and finely made plugs which get the job done.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Worth every penny. It's fun, exciting a great story line. I couldn't stop playing, if you love supernatural mystery and finding hidden objects then you will love this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a really good book. I did not dislike anything about this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves a good book and likes to read series.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush is the best. What more can I say. This cd is one of their best. They keep on going. Thanks to Neil, Alex and Getty. You're the best.
B00466HM28|5.0|excellent for quick and on the go.<br />kind of limited, but is compact for travel.<br />i wished it came with a travel case.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a great game. you should so get it. you will absolutely love it.even if you don't like mysteries you will love this game.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great quality. Shipped and received quickly promptly. Would recommend to others. Love the walking dead! Gave as Xmas present :)
B00003CX5P|3.0|The talking is so boring. This cannot be star wars. Why George why! Anakin shows NO emotion. They should have ditched him in the first hour.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Love walking dead! Perfect quality. Not issues. Shipped and received quickly. Would recommend to others. Given as present for Xmas.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|How have I missed Derek Trucks for so long?  Now if they will just bring their band out to California to do some west coast performances....
B00005JSGK|5.0|A very entertaining movie. An entirely  different type of character for John Wayne. Wayne and the rest of the cast make this safari adventure into an enjoyable comedy.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Butch Trucks' slide guitar playing on Midnight in Harlem is worth the entire price alone, if truth be known.  The last part of this song is one of the most beautiful slide passages I've ever heard.
B009O2XY12|3.0|started out ok, but I am stuck at the same level,how do the kids to it, but I keep playing
B000001F6N|5.0|shopping on Amazon is so easy<br /><br />I originally purchased Mayall's &#34;Beano&#34; album on 33 rpm vinyl and am now looking back and acquiring more of his music.<br /><br />He is so talented.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|it's good as long as there are no issues with the servers. then good luck getting in and staying in a coop match.
B003QSMC18|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone in the family. It builds the hopes and dreams of all little people and lets adults realize that if they would dream....maybe it could come true.
B008Y6TD5A|1.0|Ridiculous story. Horribly shot film. Completely unbelievable. Unfortunately, I'm a completist (and apparently a masochist) so I have now wasted 2+ hours of my life which I cannot regain! This movie should have been discarded in the trash along with the &#34;elaborate&#34; escape plan.
0307895475|4.0|I love the writing of these guides.  There is cleverness and charm.  This book is a great go to if you get stuck or you want to know what would happen if you back the other side in the War or if you did things in different order.  It made me go back and play things from a different angle and quests I had passed on previously I picked up and was glad I did.
B00005V0X5|5.0|One the great albums ever, came in perfect case and no scratches on the disk good audio quality. But the last song in the album is all censored would buy other album with uncensored song on it.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|I love Jimi, but this disc just seemed like there was something missing.  The tracks are all good, the quality is fine, but for me it's just missing that &#34;oomph&#34; factor.  Still, a good disc.
B000067FP8|5.0|My daughter LOVES the original gremlins movie so this was a must see for her. She thought the movie was so funny and laughed and laughed and laughed. For the little amount I paid for it, and with free shipping, it was a great value and we have already gotten more than our moneys worth. For the adults, it had me chuckling a couple of times but you have to stop and consider when it was made and that it is a sequil...
B0000524CY|5.0|What can I say, they don't make movies like this anymore. Definitely a collectors item. Movie received quickly, well wrapped and was in great condition.
B0047WJ12K|1.0|If you were expecting another Titanic or Catch Me If You Can, or Bourne Identity, save your money. Boo Hiss Boo Hiss Boo Hiss Boo Hiss
034580404X|3.0|This book drags on forever before it gets to anything good. I bought this set for my son cause he had heard from friends of how great it was. He could not stay focused enough in the beginning chapters to read them as quickly as he usually reads other books.
B0041VV03A|1.0|Huh? Bad Bad Bad Poor opening designed to keep viewrs totally confused Huh? Bad Bad Bad Poor opening designed to keep viewers totally confused
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I was giddy stupid when i got this, i actually took off early from work to purchase and watch in aw the KING!! If you are a fan of the King of Pop then this is a must.  Michael Jackson ruled the stage every time he took it but this is his 1st venture on to the stage without his family and he is spectacular!!
B004JUSDVU|3.0|It is good. I think it is interesting the idea of the moving. Good acting and interesting plot. I recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great, compatible with so many programs, great sharing options and the sync has never failed me between my PC, GS3, Kindle Fire and Notebook! I Highly recommend this app for anyone who needs to list, note, share or do just about anything else it offers!<br /><br />-Mat
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Fans of Lord of the Rings will love this book.  I read it in 5 days and it's a large chunk of pages.  Sanderson has a new fan to add to his list.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|The first in this trilogy is one of the best so far in the Batman films. It does not disappoint.
1401940676|5.0|I bought this for my wife and I.  We love it and discuss it frequently.  We shared it with my mother and bought another copy for a friend for her birthday.  Brings up great discussions and Anita is truly inspiring.  I highly recommend.
075669812X|5.0|My son had me order one after we bought one for a friend's birthday.  Pictures and factoids are awesome!  The Ninjago that comes with the book is impossible to find, so the price alone was worth that little guy.
B00BQBNK04|5.0|Love this full soundtrack, the only thing that could make it better: No Russell Crowe and a little lest verbratto from Marius.
B005LAII80|5.0|I was not a huge fan of the original Judge Dredd and I've never read the graphic comic.  But, got this one based on other good reviews.  I loved it, although I can see how some wouldn't.  It's not formulaic in any way and is strictly action, action, action.  Don't expect the typical action-movie light romance thread though and you don't even see the lead actor's face once in the entire movie!  It's pretty bloody but not out of context for the movie.  In short, good popcorn action movie with pretty good 3D.  Will definitely watch it again.
B007Y6DUHI|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is ready to expand their mind about who we are and why we are here
B007N579X6|5.0|We are empty nesters who still enjoy a lot of cartoon movies; we typically look for the ones with humor that adults can enjoy as well as kids.  This is a great one - while the minions offer up the antics that kids love, Steve Carell is deadpan hilarious as the wanna-be bad guy and kept us laughing the whole time.  The 3D is really good and adds quite a bit, in my opinion (I always take the 3D version over 2D if available).  This is definitely one that we will watch over and over.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|fun game to play for hours and good for all ages. I will recommend this game to other peeps for sure
B004APVI1G|5.0|After I got a new 3D projector, I researched some good 3D movies to get - not just for the effects but also good story.  This one had high reviews for both story and 3D.  Thanks for those reviews because this was a great movie - deep story that goes beyond just the normal cartoon good guy-bad guy storyline.  The 3D was spectacular with owls in flight and lots of great depth over ocean, forest, and bleak barren landscape scenes.  Would recommend this one for both a great story for kids and adults and also as something to show off your 3D system.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome its like Super Mario brothers turned Irish... i really like the format and the graphics are great! Super fun must have game!!!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book surprised me with a seemingly solid scientific foundation - I'm not smart enough to know if any of it was actually feasible but it sure sounded like it - so it made it easy for me to suspend my disbelief and not constantly say &#34;oh, come on&#34;!  The book sometimes went too far into the scientific side, I thought, which added length to the story, but probably wasn't absolutely necessary.  The thing that really clicked for me was the lead character - by the end of the book, I was really pulling for him.  He was eminently likeable and handled situations in what seemed like a realistic emotional manner - in short, he acted like I would expect someone to act in that situation.  A really good book that is maybe a few pages too long but worth it overall - I certainly would have paid more than I did to read this book.
B0083I90HU|5.0|What a fantastic book, easily one of my faves of all time now.  Great ending too, not typical ending, not predictable.
B0091REZMW|5.0|awesome game.  good instruction and very easy to use.  I love it thank you!  please come out with more games like this please
0385333846|1.0|Maybe I missed something here, but this book was no good.  A classic?  I think not.<br />The main character does nothing for me.  The idea of the alien abduction?  seriously?
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|I must say I do so enjoy all of the works of Coelho. His writings are well worth the time and effort.
B009346RSS|5.0|OK.<br />So, I ripped out my old Home Theater Stereo system.<br />Mainly because I was the only one who used it and when I wanted to use it, it was never the appropriate time.<br /><br />Here is my new setup.. (all bought via Amazon)<br />* Apple TV<br />* (this) FIIO Thaishan D03K<br />* AudioSource Amp100<br /><br />* Infinity floor standing speakers (not from Amazon)<br /><br />Now,<br />I hid all of the devices behind my TV (inside the TV cabinet)<br />I connected the AppleTV optical output to the FIIO, and then hooked the FIIO RCA output into the AudioSource Amp.<br />I set the amp to be 'Auto-Power-On' mode.  Preset the volume midway.<br />And I am done!<br /><br />Now, using a Mac, iPad, iTouch, or iPhone (which there are plenty in the house),<br />The kids, wife, or myself just dials up some audio source like (mp3's, Pandora, IHeartRadio, etc..) and selects Airplay on their device.<br />Like magic, the music magically starts playing.  (sound from the iTouch to the AppleTV to the FIIO to the Amp.. Amp turns on automatically, and BOOM.. music.<br /><br />Now, everyone loves listening to their music. Volume is controlled via the end-user-device (iTouch).  Couldn't be simpler for the family.<br /><br />No.  I don't have surround sound any more.. but really, we didn't turn it on that much.<br /><br />I am happy.
B003PBB4ME|5.0|This action stabilizer handle is low cost but very durable and I'm glad I purchased it.  I have seen others in person for the same price be at a much lower quality.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|My almost 4 y/o LOVES the Dr. Panda games. This one is pretty neat, you help grow vegetables, fruits or wheat for the locals starting with cleaning dirt, planting seeds, watering, sunshine and gathering. Squish a few bugs here or there so they don't eat your harvest! We will DEFINITELY continue to purchase Dr. Panda games!
B0034G4P1W|5.0|I love claymation movies and this one was one of the best. Kids of all ages would enjoy this movie
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book, not worth all the HYPE though. A good quick read on vacation....with your MAN! Not sure I will read the other 2 books.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We found ourselves rushing through dinner so that we could watch this wonderful show using Netflix.  Great characters and amazing plot. We found ourselves guessing all through the entire series.  Can't wait for season 2.
B0011Z33ES|3.0|Would have like to hear them in italian not english.  Ill look at album better nesxt time .lllalalalal akalala alal
B000OYC3J8|5.0|If you are a white strips fan this has to be in your collection. I bougth it for that very reason and I wasnt disappointed.  They do have to grow on you a bit though.  Nothing jumps right out and grabs you but it gets bettter and better everytime I listen to it.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Again,I loved the second book as much as the first. It was so hard to put it down.  I just wanted to keep on reading to see what would happen with the characters,even when I was upset of what was taking place,I still wanted to know how it would end! I really enjoyed Ken Follett's writing style and how he kept me intrigued throughout the both books. I wish there was another book in this series,because I would be reading that one as well!!!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I didnt know much about the Black Keys until I saw them on the Grammys.  When I saw how much music two guys could get out of basically a guitar and a drum set I was amazed.  I got this CD and I wasnt disappointed.  I actually went back and bought some of thier older CD.  I like this one best out of them all.  Its a great CD.  Well done.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this game is fun,fast and enjoyable.  it is relaxing to play. i would recommend it to my friends and family and have already
B0034JGBM0|5.0|What can you say about Jack White? Very good stuff as always from both him and Meg.  Its a very good representation of thier live work
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I bought the book because of all the hoopla about The Game of Thrones HBO. Upon picking it up, I soon realized that it was a good and fast read. By the time I reaches the end, I was hooked and look forward to reading the remaining 4 novels in the series. It is certainly not for the faint hearted. However, there are champions a plenty and much thought provocations regarding honor, justice, duty and chivalry.
B000JIN3J8|2.0|I thought it would be fun to see all versions of P&P, but this was painful. Couldn't even finish it. The acting is not that great and the script adaptation is terrible.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Well written, exciting, amazing book. One of my favorites. Ken Follett grabs the readers attention and you can't let go. Even at the end, you want more!
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Mr. Martin has yet to disappoint me with any of his writing.  If you like his style, you'll really enjoy this book.  Thumbs up!
0385535147|3.0|It is the usual page turner by John Grisham, but the ending left me not knowing what had really happened.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Bosch is the man I would like to investigate my death, if needed. He has just the right human emotions to go with the detective instincts.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|well written, really gives u a sense of how much power an eating disorder has.<br />She keeps her relationship with Ellen out of it, for the most part, so it's not<br />&#34;look I married the most famous gay woman on earth&#34;, it's about Portia's battle<br />with self image, food, the modeling and film industry, and to some extent, her mother.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Good combination of action and humor.....believable . I especially like the reference back to Tom Clancy novels...about the continuing characters from Clancy.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest.  It has so many good and different ideas. Just browsing the website gives<br />you so many different ideas.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Great product for both seasons.<br />I highly recommend this product.<br />Makes as a great gift for someone or to keep as a collection.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|An exceptional interpretation of a great fantasy series.  A multi-layered and complex political and emotional battle field for great characters.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is a very useful media, however some give too much information. I have received good and bad News, some that should have been given more private.
B009T9P7OC|2.0|I have isolated the problem of my Kindle fire hd shutting down to the homepage after a few minutes using another app or just browsing. I also cannot access the storage function in the settings without the kindle again immediately shutting down to the home page.<br /><br />when the app was removed the problems disappeared and when reinstalled  they returned. I checked  this every way I could, even tried downloading the basic player. Same problems and contacting the support team has proved to be worthless as they have completely ignored me. likewise Amazon is clueless and seems unable to do anything.<br /><br />To bad because this a full featured app if it didn't make the Kindle unstable<br /><br />UPDATE-7/3/2013<br /><br />I have just discovered the most recent version of this app is 3.2.0 while Amazon is still offering the ancient and troubled version 2.1. Amazon claims they can only offer the version the developer sends them and that makes sense. However, Amazon is aware there is a problem in the version they are allowing us to purchase and despite the developer not fixing the problems for the version we buy here but releasing multiple updates since the Amazon available version, the app is still sold on this site.<br /><br />DO NOT PURCHASE THIS APP. Amazon should demand the developer supply them with latest version or else the app should be pulled!!<br /><br />UPDATE-1/17/2014-Have revisited this app and find the necessary work has been done to ensure it is working as it should.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Twenty-two super movie trailer songs for nine bucks. This has to be the best bargain in music today. What's great about this music is I never get tired of it. Yes, I take a break sometimes and when I come come back it's fresh as new. I notice a lot of other reviwers agree with me. If you don't have this album, what are you waiting for.
0399226907|5.0|I bought this for my niece and she loved the story, the look, and size of the book. Worth purchasing if you are looking for children<br />books.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my son and I both love to figure things out! flow free is great to<br />pause and focus. good for confidence building in kids.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Easy to read, never have to wind it, fits great.  I have many watches and this one is now one of my favorites!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After reading the review of the book my expectations were not high. I felt it would turn into one of the series where a writer just couldn't end it and just kept dragging the readers through. This was not the case however. You get to see a complete and fulfilling trilogy come to an end.
B007SGM084|4.0|Great read. It's not all about sex, the story line is good, enthralling, and suspenseful at times. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
B008KL2ITW|4.0|just finished beautiful disaster, and I really enjoyed it.  I had that adrenalin rush after about a third of the way through.<br /><br />at first I though Abby was a bit wet behind the ears, but I'm glad she grew a pair! lol<br /><br />their relationship at first was a bit of a 'REALLY' with the crazy bet thing, and yeah who would sleep in the same bed purely platonic, but it worked.  we got to learn to love both Abby and Travis, slowly.<br /><br />must be honest i didn't see the marriage coming, so glad it did.  can t wait to catch up with them In the next book, and to find out what mare is going to do to them once they get off the plane!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Poorly written and extremely redundant. I found myself skimming the so-called exciting parts because they were so drawn out and made the book a tedious exhausting read.
B004I1K430|5.0|This is a riveting and very cerebral film that's based on fact.  A great story with excellent acting and worth the time to watch.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I am a fan of a lot of jewel/3 match games but this one is not like the rest. You actually have to work a little bit to find your 3 in a row but it is a very addicting game! I have to make myself put it down at night or I will stay up too late when I have to go to work the next day!
B00003CXB2|5.0|While this portrayal of T.E. Lawrence's life uniting various rival Arab tribes against the invading Turks might be overly dramatized, the movie itself is pure enjoyment,.  It was filmed in Iran during the Shah's reign and the scenery, musical theme, acting and script are first class.  This is one to definitely see.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|One of the top Thrash Metal bands of all time (in my opinion) still on the top of their game after all these years. How do dudes this old keep it up? Metallica take note, you suck now compared to these guys.<br /><br />Amazing, amazing, amazing. That's all I have to say.
B0037VNX44|4.0|...I'm glad I did. The lead, Tom Hardy, gives a really powerful performance. He is transformed. Very good acting. Should be more recognized. Quite violent, not many twists and turns. It is simply an action-packed character study of what may or may not be freakin' lunatic.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|This book tells me a different story every time I read it - a timeless classic. I would definitely recommend it to anyone fond of reading works that in turn cause insight.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Wow! My students loved it and wanted more. Suraj and Parker were great through-out this movie! It was truly touching how Suraji quickly realized his needs were more than just physical.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used the trial version for the whole trial period then uninstalled it. After using SwiftKey and then going back to the keyboard that came with my S3, I was continually frustrated with my inability to avoid mistakes. Finally went back and purchased SwiftKey and am completely satisfied.
0143117564|2.0|I bought this for a book club assignment and couldn't get through it...the writing is great and the author is talented, but the subject matter made me uneasy.
B00AEJM6H2|2.0|I am not sure that I really like this game. I will have to try it a little more to see if I will keep it. Thank you
B003I55BIA|5.0|Im not the kind of guy that read this kind of book but it is soooo good. The plot is simple Alex the bad boy falls for Brittany the popular cheerleader and their worlds get turned around. I got my book autographed by Simone and she even came to my school because a kid in my class and wrote her a letter. She was sweet and kind which made reading the book all the more better. Its a story that will move you and you`ll really love it.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Very good knife, a must for wilderness survival, don't go trekking without it, a real bang for your buck. Good knife
B009GXHOW4|5.0|It does everything it says. I now have everything<br />and now I'm not addicted to minecraft thank you for making<br />A good app
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Great read!! The characters are well developed and the historical setting is very accurate and sets up a great back drop for the novel. Can't wait to get to the next book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is fantastic!! It has quickly become one my favorites!! The acting in this show is absolutely incredible. Every time i watch this i'm amazed at the writing abilities and how they can consistently keep the show so interesting.  But be careful its very addicting.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This latest story from Nicholas Sparks depicts a love story that spans lifetimes.  The characters are deep and there are enough background stories to keep the reader interested in the many turns and twists.  I highly recommend it!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Purchased item delivered earlier than ETD.  Good packaging no damage.  3D quality is version is beyond expectation though price for this item is a it high.  However it is  excellent collection.  Can ot waith til 2nd part of movie to release, I heard in 2014.
0345529057|5.0|Since I don't have this on my own book shelf, and I don't remember buying it, I must have bought it as a gift to someone. I have read the first four books a few times, and with the popularity of the HBO show, you can't go wrong...but read before you watch and you will notice so many little details in the show no one else will know about.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just when u think it can't get any better your blown away by a surprising ending. Can't wait to see what's next LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I had to take all the positive and negative reviews of LED ZEPPELIN's CELEBRATION DAY with a grain of salt until I listened to the whole box-set myself and made up my own mind about it.<br /><br />I watched the concert on BLURAY and the rehearsal on DVD, I listened to the CDs, and I had two days to think about them before writing this.<br /><br />The concert on BLURAY was pretty great and surprising--pretty great because of how it sounded, surprising because of how all four members were playing in sync the entire time.<br /><br />The average age of JIMMY PAGE, ROBERT PLANT, and JOHN PAUL JONES in 2007 was 61--more than three decades older than when they were at their peak in the mid-70s. But old age seemed to have no negative effect on their musicianship.<br /><br />PAGE performed quite admirably; he wasn't perfect and I don't think he's ever been perfect live, but he's come close and on CELEBRATION DAY he came close. He was jamming and rocking and, most important, he was feeling it.<br /><br />PLANT still had THAT voice, though slightly coarser or maybe slightly lower on the register, which was expected and completely acceptable given his age.<br /><br />JONES was classy on his bass and keyboards.<br /><br />JASON BONHAM was energetic throughout. I defy you to listen to his drumming with your eyes shut and not think he's his father.<br /><br />The direction of the concert was mediocre, as many here have complained, but this review is not about the editing or the camera work, it is about how the concert sounded and how the band performed, and so my conclusion is that they did a terrific job.<br /><br />In terms of live performances, if HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the band at its high point and THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME was the band in its underwhelming mode, then CELEBRATION DAY is so much closer to the former.<br /><br />Even their rehearsal on the bonus DVD sounded good--sure, PLANT wasn't singing at full throttle because it was just a rehearsal but they were all still performing quite nicely.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'm being too kind here as I'm trying to be fair. If I compare the band's past live performances with their performance on the BLURAY and the bonus DVD, they come so close to their 70s heyday.<br /><br />One reminder though: you have to keep in mind that their average age was 61--they're grandfathers now but grandfathers who have succeeded at providing their fans with a worthy, unforgettable final performance.<br /><br />Now unto the CDs.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's untrue what most of the negative reviews were stating about the sound quality and musicianship. The sound on the CDs was not distorted and PAGE did not sound out of practice. However, JONES was not as prominent on bass as I would have liked. PLANT sounded just fine and BONHAM's drumming was powerful.<br /><br />I would recommend first watching the concert in one go on BLURAY with the volume up and then listening to the CDs. I listened to the CDs on my car CD player and they sounded great.<br /><br />Also, don't judge the music or the sound quality of CELEBRATION DAY by listening to the 30-second samples provided on Amazon. Big mistake.<br /><br />I hope this helped the undecided.
B0076DELIG|5.0|as usual these days, he has done another great job on the Harry Bosch series. Love Harry's character and a really good read!!
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My grandson 1st saw this movie on HBO and watched it over and over. Once it went off the air he was very disappointed so I decided to get it for him for Christmas. He loves it and watches it all the time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like other games but minecraft is the best i wish i could change my skin on it but greatest game ever made it to nether like 80 times a must have
B00957T6X6|5.0|The author paints a very vivid picture of good and evil along with what tends to make people the way they are.  Contrast of the results of privilege as a right versus privilege earned.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I absolutely love this series. The adventure and action is great. I totally recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This is an ideal item for use in charging a Kindle  or connecting it to a computer.  Recommend at least one for every Kindle user.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I admire this man and thank him for all he has done for Americans and bless his family.Very good book.
B00006I53S|4.0|Like the lense, still learning the settings and such. Like the amount of zoom I get with this one, recommend buying new as I recieved with lint in the lense :/ Still an excellent choice for the quality of photo you get with this lense.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I really like it.it has everything I want to look at except for the ads.sometimes the ads are ok.it is very cool
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I love to read, but I had a hard time getting through this one.  I could not recommend it to someone else
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game totally rocks!!!:)I love it,! So addictive and fun you should totally play!!!:)AWESOME!!!!!!!;) I have invited my friends to play and so should you!!try it today and you will like it!!TRUST ME!&lt;3
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie was great!  It is a very funny take on the original tv show.  I was a big fan of the tv show!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I am sure I will like this game when I figure out where I found it. I have played it on computer so know I enjoy.it.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I did not really care for the movie that much at all.  way to much hyp for this one.  would not get it again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game for me and the kids, but the pop up ads as the levels increase are very intrusive and the game has some glitches to work out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is like so awesome.it's way better then temple run. Only my opinion but so yeah this game go hard u should play it
B007CI81IQ|5.0|Clearly written and packed with good things to know, specifics and detail backing up broad ideas and concepts. Different approaches to working against poverty presented, with the need to determine what policies and programs are effective always emphasized.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is so much better than the first  temple run I can even play it all day and all night :D
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book has left me wanting more. I can't wait for  the next one. It does get a bit confusing jumping between characters and places.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This game seems to be neat, but the demo is very short, and it really should have only limited stuff, not two to five minutes per world to do things in it. I really like regular mine craft but I thought this would be better and it seems like it won't be until a cheaper full version comes out. On my iPod I have mine craft pocket edition and it rocks but this game isn't very fun. The controls are confusing and it seems like you will possibly get ripped off if you buy it after getting the demo version because it looks kinda fun but you find out it is really boring in your mind so you don't play it anymore and you wasted ten bucks on it for nothing. This demo needs more time or a better limit that let's players explore, and go for as long as they desire.
B007V65R54|5.0|Even though I have a deep educational background in statistics, that was a long time ago. Nate takes complex issues and makes them understandable. The implications of having inaccurate information are clear.
034580404X|5.0|Great story line. Liked the plot & everything about it. Would recommend to anyone who likes romance, suspense & happy endings.
B000E41MRC|1.0|I watched 5 minutes of this film and then ejected the disc in disgust.  Nowhere in Amazon's product description did it mention that it comes with mandatory English voice commentary that can't be turned off.  Sure, the English subtitles can be turned off but not the voice.  I would not have procured a production of such historical interest if I'd known that it was only possible to watch it with its original soundtrack largely suppressed.  What we're watching is no longer the original movie that the blurb about this product claims it to be!<br /><br />I can't begin to imagine why this isn't mentioned in the product description.  What were they thinking of, for heaven's sake?  It's common enough to release old films with spoken commentary, but it's typically (and in my prior experience, invariably) provided as an additional feature on the disc that you can choose to watch later if you're sufficiently interested after watching the original unedited version.  To provide no other way of seeing the original is ridiculous and infuriating.<br /><br />If anyone knows of a version of this film that I can watch with its original soundtrack intact and unobscured by unwanted commentary, please let me know.
1439190275|5.0|The book explains why a person needs to eat certain foods.  It descibes the benefits of this diet.  It also explains it is a way of life and if a person can't wait to eat high carb foods that the person would not be successful on this diet.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I really like the way this show is written, Julianna Marguiles plays Alicia Florrick in this political/law series which is about a wife who stayed good to her cheating political husband..The show unravels bits and pieces of corruption and scandal which over time will get more in depth I'm sure.. I have only seen up to season 2 but I always ask myself, what's gonna come out next. Julianna Marguiles plays Alicia Florrick who is a very complex character, I think. I am always wondering what she's thinking plus she is not your average woman scorned that is for sure...The show has a vast variety of other celebrities, who are judges, or clients or other attorney's such as Michael J. Fox..It's a show definitely worth checking out..
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|This series is one worth having as it blends a great story, with period fashion, and a certain amount of mystery.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Like Nelson DeMille's sense of humor.  Neat approach to tense drama.  Favorite author.  Saw an article recently about military novels he has written about Viet Nam.  Entertaining.
B000M341QE|4.0|Undercover cops play cat and mouse games until you're not sure who's the good guys and who's the bad!  This is a movie that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It makes me want my horses back. The only downside is how you earn the coins....
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|To dc as t tv Griffiths th she xxx f2f xfdgcvut f2f f2f tvguffdyitvrcyfgxcfhgcfcvg f2f drug dc get CraftedBattle app is a that means this book is awesome!!!!!!!!!!

B000002TWN|4.0|I love this album, the quality was acceptable for such an old compact disc. I will be ordering again, soon
B0053TMP24|5.0|this book had lots of adventure and excitement. i have read the first and third and they just make u feel like u are there fighting to
B005TZFYNE|5.0|great! it was in very good condition and very nice sound quality, no scratches, scuffs, marks, nothing at all that I saw.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Very simple to use even for the not so computer savoy individual. Easily upload all pics & videos stored on phone with one \\"click\\". I also love the how easy it makes it to share other programs with friends.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|This is an upgrade but I had only watched it in the theater until I saw it in HD  on TV, had to buy it. It is worth the money definite upgrade in audio.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Gillian Flynn is a true master of mystery. This book keeps you wondering until the very end. Full of unexpected twists and turns. Loved it!
B008220C56|3.0|Although this movie was beautifully filmed, it was rather strange.  It starts out as if you are in the audience watching a stage play and eventually reverts away from this but periodically goes back to the stage play idea.  To me, it made the story harder to follow.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am beginning to see what all the fuss is about. Evermore is working well to redefine how I take notes. Also, I never have to worry about losing them.
B000000OE7|4.0|VERY PLEASANT MUSIC!<br />Maybe one classic would have been nice, but I still like it a lot!!!!<br /><br />Freddie will be forever!!
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love  this game! And the graphics are great! Will definitely be watching for the next one to be released.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its ok meaning its fun and all but when your new its very expensive. I actually would say I love it overall.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a voracious reader I like long and well written books. Like Kate says in her review Howey's descriptions put you there, in the character's emotions, in their environment. Such a delight to read.
145470246X|5.0|Way too many ideas in this book, I can't wait to get started on most of them.  I have to finish a project first
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|i began to read this book (again) after reading March (sorry, not sure of the author.<br /><br />ok long story short, i love this book! it is one of my all time favorite books. i hope you all enjoy traveling to a different time and see what life was like for the March women!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I always have problems with using Kindle products.  I experience the same problems when I have a new product accessing my books.  I had problems when I upgraded to Kindle Fire.  Now I am experiencing problems with Kindle for my android.  I can not access my books again.  When I talk to a customer service representative, they are condescending and disconnect the conversation.  Today, I was disconnected twice trying to get help.  You would think that they would call back.  I am still waiting.  Customer Service stinks.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I liked the book because it was well written.  I liked the concept of the Fast Diet because it is simple and easy to follow.  I chose to fast Monday, Wednesday and Friday and eat regularly the four days a week.  I found the fasting to be a &#34;non-even.&#34;  I have a normal dinner on Sunday night don't eat again until Monday at 2:00 PM and then have a 600 calorie meal.  Then, I don't eat again until 8;00 AM on Tuesday.  Following this plan I have 6 18 hour fasting period per week and I've lost 11 pounds in three weeks.<br /><br />Chuck B.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Everything was ok besides the point of them not sending me code for the digital copy. When I emailed them to ask for it they said they didn't have any other copies to send me so I'd have to wait. As I guy who has been in retail for 10 years, I know you don't tell one of your customers to wait.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Everyone told me that if like Doctor Who that I had to watch this show and they were right! Awesome.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|This one was pretty good. I never get tired of an easy humorous read. Keep 'em coming! I'm ready for Twenty.
B008RA3X5E|3.0|The options are good ;however, it is entirely relying on a constant connection with the net for weather. The graphics are ok but it could use optional varieties in the other things such as temp. and other such things.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Man oh man! I want sequels, I want movies,I want comics, I want games! I want to jump into this franchise head first and consume everything in this universe! Man o man I couldn't keep my eyes off of my kindle. The wife got upset at times... keep it up!  I have told all my friends
B000053VAF|5.0|One of my all time movies ever seen...loved the cast loved the writing. I wish they would come out with more. I've seen all the Jay and silent Bob movies...and this is by far my favorite...
B004BLTNL6|5.0|I good movie.Camille Keaton turn in a strong performance. (for an actor to give up her body to make the scenes come to life).
B009KHDT0C|3.0|Not what I thought it would be like....I was thinking it would be funnier. The movie loaded great and played nicely.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I purchased this for my sons and they love it. I watched some of it with them and what I saw was very funny...
B0028R3NCU|5.0|It just works. I supposed if you wanted to use it as a USB stick you could just leave a memory card in permanently.
B004G6TCIA|5.0|For years I've only owned the \\"main\\" album; Brain Salad Surgery. However, lately I've been on an album \\"bucket list\\" buying binge, things I may have missed that I feel I need to hear before I'm in the ground. So I picked up \\"Trilogy\\" recently and was extremely happy with it, even considering the complexity of E,L and P's work I found Trilogy to be total instant gratification music to my ears, very addictive. Next up was \\"Tarkus\\". First listen \\"what the hell?\\", second listen \\"this is weird and kinda spooky\\", third listen \\"I can't stop listening to this and it haunts me when I'm not!\\". I highly recommend this.....as with Rush, King Crimson, Yes and Voivod albums- patience is required. Once it hooks you though, look out!!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|The first &#34;diet&#34; that I can follow. The book explains the background and the practice in easy to understand language
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun,  works great on my kindle fire! Its like you have a real horse. You can train,  feed it,  groom it compete in competitions &amp; many more!  I'm sure kids will love it too because I'm 20 !
0345803485|3.0|Not the best book, but was interesting. Not sure I will read any others.<br />Will see if something better comes along.
B00BWJ6JO4|2.0|I was so excited to watch this movie.  The parts that followed the book were good and the parts that didn't were awful.  It made sense to make 3 movies out of LOTR, it was 3 books. But deciding to split this much smaller book into 3 movies was a bad choice and is obviously just for profits.  I watch LOTR often and have the extended versions on blu-ray. I won't even bother purchasing The Hobbit. Yuck. Such a disappointment.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Got this for the Easter basket and we can't wait to see it. Plus it came with two of the funniest hopping eggs like I used to get as a kid.
B004N7WJF0|5.0|For any Scorpions fan this is a must have. There's no better way to show your talent is real than stripping down to acoustic basics. The guitar work is excellent, the vocals need no comment, song choice impeccable.<br />One of my favorites in my vast collection of concert DVD's.<br />If you haven't done so yet, buy this gem.
B00BESCJII|5.0|I liked the movie quite a bit. Well worth the watch and I would even consider buying a physical copy in the future.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This a great product that I would recommend to everyone.I use it all the time because it is so easy to use.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite movies when it comes to sentimental value I think. It doesn't hurt that I genuine newly do enjoy the movie too.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Wonderful true story!  So beautifully done.  Heart-felt and warm! Well worth seeing!  The cast and ensemble of actors were fantastic!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I bought my husband Season 1 for Christmas on a whim because he is a big fan of TV on DVD.  We loved it so much that I pre-ordered Season 2 before we even finished Season 1.<br />For those who have not seen Game of Thrones - this is not a series that is family appropriate due to the graphic nature of some scenes involving sex and violence.
B005HJ6MRO|4.0|The first one I bought did not work - I could not get the network to recognise it despite hours of fiddling.  I eventually concluded that the device was faulty.  Thank goodness for the Amazon no-hassle return procedure!<br /><br />I ordered a second, a couple of weeks later, thinking I would give it another go (an reassured about being able to get a refund again)!<br /><br />Magic - it sorted itself out in seconds with very little human intervention.<br /><br />I have now transferred all my photographs and music to the shared folders - this took a long time, 2 days nearly - but I ma now up and running.  My Cambridge Audio NP30 finds Twonky Media and all my music is available as in the folders I have created in my PC.  I'm not sure whether the NAS system will now update any changes to the source files - we shall see!  Similarly, all my photographs are available on my laptop, including large RAW files which seem to load relatively quickly.

B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is a very original and charming yarn that I couldn't put down.  Ironic that I learned stuff about books by reading it on my Kindle.  Can't wait for RS's next novel!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very exciting and hard to put down. You never know what the next chapter is going to bring. Great read!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This is the first book I have read by this author. I found it good, with had high tension moments, and sometimes hard to put down. However, I found the ending predictable, and would not put it among the best books I have read. I do not plan to buy another book by this author.
B003B02O14|5.0|Don't know how I missed this book. I couldn't put it down. I loved the story but did not expect to end like it did.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Very revealing and really helps you to understand why your past relationships may or may not have worked. I think this is great for singles or married couples.
B00338QENI|5.0|I was very moved by this story. The fact that there is so little rights when it comes to the tissues in our bodies is scary.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I've been reading Nicholas sparks books for over 10 years. This one is great. It has the love story with the right amount of suspense.

B0090XLDKY|5.0|What else can you say about Singing in the Rain other than that of course it is 5 stars! I liked the 60th anniversary edition because it was cheap. I hope Disney releases Mary Poppins again soon!
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Blake Shelton tells a great story through song as always! There's always a song that I can relate to from this artist.
B006UUK612|5.0|Yeah, I was a kid when this came out. Actually I was too young to watch it when it first came out. But, it is filled with so much nostalgia for childhood. Still love the movie and think it is quality stuff!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I enjoyed watching The Secret Garden so much I wanted to read the book. The book is so much better than the movie, now that I have it on my Kindle I will have years of enjoyment reading and rereading this book which is now one of my favoriate books.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|I know they say you can't expect a lot from a 2D movie that has been converted to 3D, but I can't help it.  I enjoyed every second of I, Robot 3D.  I use a projector in our living room for &#34;movie night&#34; so I expect our 3D experience to be big and bold.  I, Robot did not dissappoint.  I suppose if your a professional video critic, you could find technical flaws in the transition from 2D to 3D, but if your just a guy who wants an evening of wall sized, popcorn munching entertainment you can't do much better than this.
B008476HBM|5.0|I fell in love with the movie and when I added Pride and Prejudice to my Kindle I could not put it down, I love the way Jane Austen wrote.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Fun and addictive game. I didnt have any of the problems with face book that other people seemed to have. Good for jusr passing the time, and the kids love it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This was a free download and I put it on my Kindle fire. It tells me my battery status and breaks it down for me. I love this app. There are some advertising but that really doesn't matter to me in the long run. I would recommend this app advertisements and all.

B003D5X3VM|3.0|I bought the second album first and loved it, so Idecided to give this one a try.  Have to say it doesn't compare in my book.  Same vocal and music quality, but the lyrics aren't as inspiring.
B0033H7VI6|1.0|When looking at buying this knife, I like many of you I watched the videos on youtube and read the many reviews online and thought that this was a good knife for the money.....boy was I wrong. While it is indeed a hunk of steel that is sharpened there are many problems with it that even an amatuer bladesmith would not dare and try to push off on a customer.<br /><br />Firstly, the plunge cuts, there is 1/8 inch difference between the left and right hand side plunge cuts, they should be even. Secondly, there are numerous marks on the blade. Rough marks like it was sanded down to 120 grit or so and called good. Not ever where but all over the exposed metal in the handle. Thirdly, the point was not ground evenly so it slightly curves to the left. Fourthly, on the sheath. The retaining strap was sewed on backwards so I have no way of actually use the retaining strap.<br /><br />I can honestly say as someone who has purchased numerous factory seconds from Coldsteel, that not a single one of those blades I purchased was as poor a blade as this one. To say that I will never buy another Scrade/Taylor product again is an understatement. What I though was a lowly $37 for this blade was way too much to pay for what it is.<br /><br />Save your money and buy a Becker it is a far better knife. I hope this review helps some of you not waste your money. If you can get this blade for under $20 with shipping then go for it, anything more and you are been ripped off.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I saw the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34; so the material on the CD was somewhat familiar.  It did seem that the renditions of the songs on the CD were somewhat frosted over with orchestral effects and arrangements and I would have preferred the more personal, unproduced versions.  The lyrics are evocative of Dylan with references to social issues, injustice etc. but the vocal quality was much better than Dylan  (but then what isn't?) and the acoustic guitar playing more polished.  I think it unfortunate that we &#34;discovered&#34; Rodriguez so late but better late than not at all.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I Love this book, it's speaks to the soul & mind. How could someone be so enlightened. Thank GOD for him

B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Amazing picture. Brad Pitt played an awesome role in this film. Action packed from beginning to end. Reminds me of Mel Gibson's Braveheart.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|We love this delightful LEGO set.  It is another wonderful creation by LEGO.  I like the winter scene and having the grandchildren put it together.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Hes a great actor, perfect for his role as a leader. All the characters have a different perspective, some agree, some don't. A very intense TV series! A must see for anyone! Zombies arent my thing, but the plot is not just about that. the need for survival, decisions, the grief process. Judgement calls, all has me hooked on this show. I never was even open minded to seeing this. till I saw it the first time. Had to buy the entire series!
1616550414|5.0|This book is mostly about Skyward Sword but it does give an interesting perspective on the history of the series.  I have very much enjoyed perusing it.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I dont know how I got hooked on this very action and drama packed series. Zombies are &#34;not real&#34;. But if we had some kind of world crisis, this I find most interesting because of the split second decisions for survival as a group. Great filming scenery, acting, plot, and the need for survival for some, not all. Displays the emotional terror and grief processes that would come along in this type of what if, situation. Absolutely hooked!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this game is really fun and can be enjoyed by almost anyone that has fun putting things on paper. great game

0553801473|5.0|Books 3 and 4 of the Ice and Fire saga started driving me nuts.  It seemed like endless plots running in circles with minimal progress, and I started feeling like the old Wendy's lady saying &#34;Where's the Beef?&#34;  I am hoping that George is listening to his fans who are NOT interested in another Robert Jordan &#34;Wheel of Time&#34; -like ad-infinitum series.<br /><br />&#34;Dance with Dragons&#34; was much better, and brought back more of the feel of the first 2 books,  I hope that Book 6 delivers as well.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What to say other than its worth the time and money. Well acted great plot. You'll love it! If not you must have some real issues.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|The art of possibility is a kind remainder of how unexpectedly life can unfold if your willing to let it be. Thought vivid examples, the book give us concrete ways of letting possibilities come into our lives.<br />I would definite recommend this book. There's so much to win out there.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I just saw the movie on HBO, and I have to say, I really enjoyed it. It brought back a lot of memories of growing up in that era. I found myself being able to sing along with pretty much all of the songs, which I found really amusing. I do wish someone would put out a CD with all of these songs, but with the original singers singing them. That would be a blast! I will definitely buy this CD....it will actually be the first CD I have bought for a long time, as opposed to downloading the individual songs on ITunes (which I may still do, just so I can get the original music/singers). It is certainly worth the investment though, for any of you who are still on the fence. Even Russell Brand, whom I despise, did a great job!!!
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game takes me back to my childhood. If you enjoyed space evaders as a kid you will love this game! I got it for free which was a bonus but it's worth just about any price.

B000HBKCDC|5.0|Great artist. Great selection of songs. Wonderfully performed and produced. Perfect for anyone spending a snowy,winters evening with a loved one, or just thinking of, or remembering one.
B00BDZV9M4|1.0|One of the worst hip hop albums of all time... if he doesn't stop it with that sizzurp he going to be dead before he even hits snoop and dre's age. The songs have horrible beats and the people on it aren't even really big names. This CD is really directed towards a female audience. A guy really can't respect this album at all. Whack lyrics, whack beats, talk about a complete failure. Save your money and download it for free somewhere... Surely ain't worth buying!
B0083DJWGO|5.0|This is one of those uncommon books that opens a path beyond conventional thinking for those genuinely open to such exploration. While Taleb set the stage for it with Black Swan, Antifragile is much more demanding. Taleb excavates the philosophical classics with a very delicate trowel and brush to expose some extraordinary and seriously undervalued insights into our not-so-modern social, political, cultural, even technological dilemmas. And he is witty and entertaining as he invokes a couple of characters named Nero Tulip and Fat Tony to demonstrate various arguments.<br /><br />A feature of recent Kindle platforms is that other readers' highlights can be noted. In some recent reading I have noticed quite a few. Not so many in this one. Taleb's approach here doesn't lend itself to quotable bits. The best line in the book is the last one, thanking the reader for finishing it. The glossary, which follows it, is an invitation to go back to page one and try the whole thing again.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|It is ok I don't really think that it is the best ever.but I like it, I hate that you have to buy eggs with gems they are like really hard to get .if you get this game im warning you it takes a long time to get the Dragon eggs  and it wastes your Dragon money for you to buy stuff it is really fun game but if I got it later I would not get the app .if you get it come to my island I have Ben playing for 8 months and I'm only at level 7.

0307596885|5.0|This is such a terrific group of short stories. Even though I could have read 100 pages a day, I purposely kept myself at two stories a day. Each is stand alone, meaning Munro did not relate them to each other in some way as some recent short story collections have done. They are tales of ordinary people living small town Canadian lives, but something happens, which while extraordinary to the characters in each story, aren't very different from the mistakes or everyday drama common to the folks who write to 'agony' columns in the newspaper like Dear Amy. I found them very interesting, even charming, despite the foolish or domestic disaster which overtakes the main character in each. Most tales tell of the kind of life mistakes which are horrifying in the personal sense, but yet are ordinary and common to Western life.<br /><br />I wasn't sure about this collection because many reviewers did not think Munro was up to her usual mark. I've not read many of Munro's previous books, so I really didn't have that reference point. I was bothered by the age of most of the characters - around 80, and many of these stories were remembering events about their WWII civilian life. I felt, frankly, these stories would be boring; i.e., small-town conformity involving 1940-1950 marriages, family life, etc. I should have known better because while indeed most of the stories if very briefly described fit that description, Munro's ability to write verbal spotlights on those everyday activities or the usual family dramas makes them satisfyingly large for the 20 or so pages you read and leaving you wanting to know more. The focus enlarges the importance similar to what happens in cropping a photograph.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading all of the stories but 'Gravel' was a very intense story at the end. It doesn't start like that, but as the story progresses I felt like a bystander watching a puppy wander out onto the freeway. I could see how it was going to be, as the author intended the reader to do, and there I was, gripping the book helpless to stop the inevitable. For me, it was the saddest one.<br /><br />If you like short stories, these are good to read.er to do, and there I was, gripping the book helpless to stop the inevitable. For me, it was the saddest one.<br /><br />If you like short stories, these are good to read.

0061726834|5.0|I felt a quiet rage bubbling the entire time I read Delirium. What circumstance occurred where people thought eliminating affection was a good thing? I don't know why this United States alt-universe happened - perhaps the next books in the series explains more history - but I do know I was angry about this lobotomized society. However, the book is a great YA read. The claustrophobic world of Delirium, while irritating, did not stop my interest in finishing the book. Lena, Hana, Alex and Grace, the most appealing characters in the book, are very easy to like.<br /><br />Teenagers Lena and Hana are a delightful pair and best friends. Every time I picked up the book I wanted to learn more about their lives. Despite this dreadful police state they live in, they can squeeze in moments of time for fun and secrets, especially while bike riding or running, and be themselves. Even under the draconian, controlled society they live, where eventually everyone undergoes a brain surgery which appears to be a perfected lobotomy at 18 and all are immediately paired with a selected mate by the government, these lovely high school girls giggle, hope and have fun in the meantime. But they are 17, and soon they will be 'cured'.<br /><br />All of their lives they've been educated to expect the surgery and marriage to a strange man on graduation from school, which they've been taught is a preferred existence than having choices and emotions, particularly the emotion of love. Love leads to a diseased and painful early death - or so they've been told. All of the townspeople, who are living within an electrified fence with armed guards keeping them inside, move with dulled purpose in their daily tasks,without affection for their children or each other. No one hugs, dances or touches, duty and regimentation are the only rhythms expected of people. For those who have yet to have the operation, still possessing emotions, they live in a capsule of constant fear. There is constant scrutiny and judgement; from the time of waking to returning from school to their parents, conformity is enforced.<br /><br />Lena has felt her entire life the suspicion that she cannot be quite all right. She is living with her aunt and cousins because her father was a sympathizer with the 'invalids' - people who escaped their fenced-in community to live in the woods. Her mother, despite being 'cured' three times, somehow still had emotions and a playful nature. Worst of all, Lena's mother loved her. First Lena's father ran away, then her mother committed suicide when slotted in for a fourth operation. Ever since, Lena has been desperate to fit in and to never be found lacking in conformity.<br /><br />Then, one day, an important day because Lena is being evaluated for how well her thinking has been trained to be like everyone else's, she sees a young man - a gloriously handsome 19-year-old man. Although he bears the mark of being cured, he is very different from the mechanized robots most of the adults appear to be. He laughs.<br /><br />Lena is horribly afraid. From The Book of Shhh description, which she has studied all of her life, she thinks she might have caught the disease Love. Romance readers, start your engines now. The author is a champion love story writer. But the book is about more than this, ultimately.<br /><br />This is a Romance with bite. While it moves at a smooth pace and the language is musical, perfect for describing Lena's world and inner life and cares, she is in a well-lit clean neighborhood of darkness. Children must watch out for each other because their parents do not repair any damage incurred emotionally - there are no soothing caresses for painful moments, only a cold dutiful checking for scrapes and injuries. Thankfully, Lena has Hana. Hana is a bit braver and wilder than Lena, but no matter. They have each other's back. There is the silent little girl Grace, also orphaned, with whom Lena shares her bedroom. Without each other, Lena's aunt Carol's home would be a cold-hearted place, full of cured, married adult relatives. Always being watched and every moment calibrated for sameness, yet Hana and Lena find ways to be a little bit like normal teenagers. Hana leads, Lena follows, and soon Lena unexpectly discovers Hana has been living a secret life of music and fun. Between the handsome boy Alex and Hana, Lena learns her world has been nothing but lies.<br /><br />Warning! There is a cliffhanger ending, which means you must read the rest of the series! You cannot stop at reading Delirium, Book 1, but must go on to Book 2, Pandemonium, to find out if this is going to end happily, or turn out to be more like the ending in Romeo and Juliet - definitely I hope not!s home would be a cold-hearted place, full of cured, married adult relatives.

B00571F26Y|2.0|This book consists of many opinions and anecdotes without any data to rely on. Much of his advice about various food flies in the face of research in the field of glycemic index.  This appears to be another cardiologist cashing in on a diet book. My opinion.....skip it.

B000003CM9|1.0|As much as the Great Hyped Age of the CD was foisted upon hapless consumers, it's amazing how the technology can turn once good music into trash. I can't believe something this bad could be just one person's fault, but the re-mastering of this CD hits an all-time low for me. On vinyl this was a bouquet of fresh, pulsing rhythms and controlled but searing-hot guitar licks, as they say. Now it's a flat, unscented scribble of noise modulating from indifferent to paltry within the context of just one track. &#34;Revival&#34; my pa-toot! Maybe the two-fer with their first album offers better transfers.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|When I first bought this book, I didnt realize that the book was based around a 17 year old girl. I am in my 40's so I wasn't sure I would relate to the book, but once I started this book, I was hooked. There are so many hints in the story line that make you want to continue reading to find out more and more details, and then when the climax actually hits, you are like Wow... that was more than I expected. I have already and will continue to recommend this book to my friends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A carefully developed story with believable characters in a difficult situation.<br />The writer creates a world and the reader feels they are in the world as well.<br />Read this one.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Can't see why everyone loves this book. poorly written and not even close to being revealing into the world of BDSM. So many things wrong with this book I don't know where to start. Don't bother reading
B0024Y7H10|5.0|I'm really impressed with the writing and the connections made to the previous movies. The acting and writing are awesome too! Absolutely worth your time if you're at all a Terminator fan.

B000000H7I|5.0|Suffocation are one of THE death metal innovators as they were the first to really incorporate brutality and heaviness with a very structured and technical song writing approach. This is their debut full length and it is extremely heavy (due to being recorded at Morrisound with Scott Burns at the helm). This is a monster release and debut -and even though it's now 22 years old, it's still solid and earth shattering. I mean are there faster or even \\"heavier\\" bands now, sure maybe. But the Suffos were the originals and given their current release, they still reign heavy and pure. Highly recommended!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Continued outstanding author! Vince Flynn's the best, I've read all of his novels and highly recommend them. They're exciting, informative and fast moving and take you to a different world!

Even after I bought it I had a hard time getting into this book, but I kept reminding myself that it had great reviews and it seems generally well loved. I'm so glad I powered through! This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and after a while I found myself really caring about the fate of these rabbits. Watership Down is masterfully written, and I enthusiastically recommend it.

B0095ZQ36G|4.0|I basically enjoyed the book.  It was well written and kept my attention.  I gave it four stars but feel that 3.5 would have been more accurate.  My major criticism was that the authors were not as subtle as they thought in portraying the German Luftwaffe as chivalrous knights of the air.  This sanitized slant was blatantly obvious from the earliest pages.  Painting the German pilots with such a wide brush and making them seem that it was simply a  matter of \\"duty, honor and country\\" while they killed 70,000 American airmen was a little too disingenuous.  It was a revisionist attempt to re-paint history to self-serve the story.  It was very much akin to the average German citizen after the war claiming that they were not Nazi's and didn't know anything about the camps while they lived next door to the death factories belching our smoke from the crematoriums each day.  The Sgt. Shultz, \\"I see nothing\\" thread running through the book was historically inaccurate and offensive in this regards.

1400049628|5.0|This is a very good book. If you have read any other books by Max Brooks you will love this one. Would also suggest World War Z
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|Granddaughter already 11 months now but I'm writing a late review.  She loves bugs & eyes and enjoyed watching these on her feet!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I liked it because of learning what really goes on in the service, since I have never been there, and how much harder they have to train, block everything out and how strong they become in mind and body. I realize that these are Seals and they are suppose to do things like this, but it shows the real life of a Seal.  They are all very brave and I thank them all.  I would recommend this to anyone that wants to be a Seal or anyone like myself who is curious about what has to be done at times.
B000YKG5L4|5.0|Yes, yes, yes!  20 words to explain why I ordered this or why I like it.  I heard it, went to Amazon & ordered it.  Of course I wanted & of course, I do love it!  THANKS!
0062014536|4.0|....So this trilogy is all about a dystopian society where love is a disease. I was thrilled by the unique idea of this concept and thought it had a lot of potential, but ultimately I think I was a little disappointed by the series.<br /><br />Lets start with some of the highlights though. My favorite part of the series was the superb character development of the main character over the series. She is not the same girl by the end... And it was great watching her grow and change throughout her long (and quite suffering) journey.  I think the best novels focus more on \\"self discovery\\" then just \\"winning the battle\\" (so to speak).  The other characters were good too, but Lena stood out from the crowd by far.<br /><br />I also think the writing was very well done. It wasn't quite Raven Boys or Daughter of Smoke & Bone, but it's better than some of the things I've read recently (I'M LOOKING AT YOU, BEAUTIFUL DISASTER).<br /><br />But on the other hand (-thunk of other shoe dropping-), the series just.... fell a bit flat.  It's hard to really place my finger on where it went wrong, because I almost didn't pick up the second book. I just didn't LOVE the first book, but then I did LOVE the second book. I thought to myself, \\"well maybe this series will just get better with each book and the third book will be this EPIC ending!\\"  So, I excitedly waited for the third book, only to find it almost more disappointing than the first book.  It's not that it wasn't a good ending or even a good series, it's just that it had the potential to be SO MUCH BETTER.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Me and my so went to the movies to see this one and had to rent it on video just to see it again!  Great for kids and adults.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|It's another typical YA romance, but it was a bit of a flop in my opinion.  I won't even bother going into as much detail as I have in my other reviews, but literally the entire book was about a bad boy and a good girl in an agonizingly drawn out struggle to find their happily ever after.  Usually when I pick up a YA romance, there's something \\"unreal\\" about it (i.e. set in the future or paranormal or etc.), but this was just a plain 'ole \\"disastrous\\" college relationship.  It had good moments and decent characters, but I felt like there was a lack of focus and a lot of loose ends.  By \\"lack of focus,\\" I mean that I prefer YA books to have each moment/scene contribute to something later on--i.e. everything have a purpose for being in the book.  This book didn't do that.  On top of that, there were things that could mean something at the end of the book (i.e. Abby's father), but were left completely unresolved<br /><br />I'm not even going to mention the writing.  It had decent moments so it's not Twilight bad, buuuut... it's really not that good.<br /><br />The one good thing I'd say it had going for it was that I did feel some reality behind it.  I've seen my fair share of disastrous college relationships and I could see how this one fit in perfectly with the scheme.  I mean some relationships I've seen are COMPLETELY SCREWED UP.... a lot like the one Abby and Travis had.  Even then it didn't seem completely realistic, because Abby was REALLY stupid and Travis was well kind of psycho.  However, I'm giving the crazy relationship the benefit of the doubt because 1) the author's inspiration had to come from something realistic and 2) as before mentioned, my own experience in watching my friends struggle through a category 5 disaster of relationship.<br /><br />I will agree that it's addictive.  I mean it was addictive to me in part because I kept holding onto hope that the story would improve, but the romance itself is addictive.  You're just like WHY THE HECK ARE THEY TORTURING THEMSELVES and JUST GET TOGETHER AND LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER ALREADY until you realize you've stayed up till 4 am trying to get to the end.<br /><br />So if you're in the mood for an addictive, (a bit) erotic, emotional rollercoaster, then by all means, try this book out.  It's not TERRIBLE, but it's certainly not that great in my opinion.

B000FILW86|5.0|Being a lifelong Cheap Trick fan, I've gone on a roller coaster ride of highs and lows throughout the bands long career.  Rockford is a definite high point.  I'd argue, it's one of the best albums in the bands catalogue. This is about as 'classic' sounding a Cheap Trick album can sound.  Every song is powerful, catchy and upbeat.  This album showcases everything that has made the band so successful.  Don't pass up a treat like this!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|so much fun. i wish you didn't have to pay extra money to progress though. a very cute game. have fun.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is great to use as a game that can be interrupted & then resumed without difficulty.  Easy to see graphics, unfortunately not enough games on it.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great old school fun with a twist. If you love top down shooters this game is for you. Great controls and graphics.
B005WZZRD8|5.0|I highly recommend this CD/DVD combo pack.  Not only do you get all the great music of the Born this Way CD, but you also get the best show ever...the Monster Ball Tour - If you weren't a Lady Gaga fan before this will definitely turn you into one.
B000026OHN|5.0|I own 3 complete recording  of Bach Well-Tempered Clavier.<br />Without slightest hesitation I consider this one far the best.<br />As a matter of fact, I had bought this one as a back-up copy.<br />Certainly, this particular one I'd take on desert island.<br />The price is almost miraculous but I'd be wiling to pay 3x more.<br />Recommend it without any reservation.<br />Happy listening,<br />  V.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love romance books that make me laugh.  This one definitely fit the bill.  The characters were real and easy to relate to.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I just started this game and am still learning it. I've used a lot of coins for solutions so far, but I am completing more on my own now. Very clever, requires strategy, but enough assistance that it is not frustrating and still makes me think. Definitely recommend!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book entered my life as it was crumbling around me. I've never been a person of faith, nor of spirituality but recent events had me seeking answers and comfort. Proof of Heaven has given me hope that we can see our loved ones again, and that hope gets me through each day.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|A laugh out, gut busting, non stop crying all around Great movie, a must see. Great cast and story line.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Don't get the HD version - it's just not worth the money and the time it takes to download. There's no spectacular visuals or stunning scenery in this movie. It's mostly verbal humor between the main characters.<br />If you're in this age bracket and deomographic then you can probably relate to this movie. It covers most GenX issues: Underwater on the mortage, small businesses going under, mid-life crisis and the sandwich generation -looking after both kids and parents. I would think this demographic might be into something harder than just a pot cookie, just putting it out there!<br />[Spoiler alert] What I did like about the movie was that there was no 'happily ever after'. The ends didn't get neatly tied up. We are left with a feeling that everything will be okay, not brilliant, but okay. That the reality is about surviving, and getting by as best as possible. Maybe they did this in case they need to make a sequel, or maybe we'll see a 'sort of' sequel about Jason Segel and his fitness business- Now that might be another funny Judd Apatow movie!
030746363X|4.0|The nature of many of this book's criticisms is so fascinating to me. How could any human who considers themselves rational eschew something useful because it's not quite as useful as its cover claims?<br />There is no program that, drug-free, could produce the amount of muscular gains that this book claims, but the program and diet outlined in this book will come as close as any.<br />The idea that more work is required to build strength than through what amounts to Central Nervous System \\"learning\\" as is outlined in the \\"Effortless Superhuman\\" section is hilarious and unsurprising given the pathetic dogma that is spouted from fitness magazines. If you want to be strong like an athlete, train like an athlete.<br />The slow-carb diet is decent, though it's more than a little misguided to ignore the fact that macros are king.<br />If N. Watson's internet use wasn't exclusive to writing Amazon reviews, I'm sure he could use PubMed or Google to discover that most if not all of the recommended supplements are supported by clinical trials.<br /><br />Is this book the best on any one topic? No. Is it useful? Potentially extraordinarily. Don't be a kid. Don't take everything at face value. You'll learn more and you'll look better.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The movie is set in the early 1900's and portrays I bet what actually happened in the great houses of the times.<br />Product arrived on time and was packed well.
0062060562|5.0|An incredible debut, beautifully written. Wonderful prose, great composition, masterly use of the English language. This novel is like music by Mozart, a perfect piece with not a note out of place. Get ready for a slow burning fuse with a huge bang at the end. S.J.Watson is a name to watch. I can't wait for his next book. Read it now and then tell a friend.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|A fantastic thriller.  Baldacci had me guessing until the very end.  Can't wait for the next episode to come out.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A hugely entertaining book filled with invention, humor and plenty of anxious moments. It presents a humbling array of problems each matched with extraordinary solutions. Weir has written a \\"how to\\" book for Martian survival.

If you're a parent and you end up spending half of your TV time watching kids movies, get this movie! It's got it all - comedy, drama, action, and great graphics!
B009KEN87O|5.0|It was a great free app of the day. Works perfect on my crappy Kyocera hydro,  a great game for any mobile device. I put it on my tablet but the graphics are better suited for small screens.

B006LSZECO|2.0|Self-inflicted rape? Too much!! The writing in the beginning is interesting and evocotive.  It falls off a cliff about 60 pages in.
B000KJT8IG|2.0|The movie itself was great as always, but even though it said BluRay on the disc, mine wasn't a HD BluRay movie.  I checked the settings, but nothing was out of place in the selection.  My BluRay player and my receiver both indicated it as just a digital movie and not HD.  I don't know what to say, I love the movie and had hoped to have it in HD, but I didn't get it.  I just got another regular DVD version of the movie I already own.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use and gives alerts for less than desirable weather conditions, for example, high wind and freezing temperatures.  Its alerts are not limited to life threatening events like the National Weather Service.  It's easy to change the city and find weather all over the world.  I'll definitely use this when traveling and want to know the current temperature without leaving the ship or hotel room.  It will be really great in Europe.  They give the temperature in Celsius.  This will give it to me in Farenhiet (sp?).

B00BU2SIW4|4.0|My first Mode album was Ultra; I was thirteen at the time and totally unfamiliar with their 80's work. It was an instant classic for me, and I still consider it my favorite Depeche Mode cd. But it opened me up to Violator, to their singles from the 80s, and when Sounds of the Universe came out four years ago, I was hyped beyond belief, but ultimately let down. That wasn't classic Mode; that was something reaching towards new modern Mode, but not quite there yet. Dave Gahan was doing a bit more songwriting, and his songs clearly stood out as feeling different than Martin Gore's. There was a disconnect in the works, but thankfully that has been ironed out on the modern classic, Delta Machine.<br /><br />Dark, layered, slower, but still kicking with grooves, the band feels revived after a disappointing last outing. While not as high a water mark as some of their older work -- admittedly a difficult mark to hit for anyone -- Delta Machine is easily the best Mode album in the last decade, and arguably their best since Ultra. Indeed, a lot of the music feels very Ultra-esque, with similar guitar riffs from Songs of Faith and Devotion, and the syth is padded with Violator lust. This is an amalgam of old and new, striving for the freshness of old whilst striding confidently forward with new originality. Gahan's tracks now stand out as powerful, great tracks, and feel cohesive alongside Gore's work instead of contrasting it. Delta Machine is a great listen, a revival of true talent coming out of the woodwork as if to say, \\"This is how electronic music is done.\\" And it's done with strength, style, and skill.

B007XELMO4|5.0|Purchased based on product description.  It has far exceeded my expectations.  Makes hiking with my camera a breeze (regardless of lense size).  No more hanging on to my gear while negotiating tough hiking scenarios or, for that matter, even while walking along a level scenic path.  Great design.

B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Like many other viewers I loved the Ring Trilogy. Was hopping to add the Hobbit to my collection, I will not buy this movie. I borrowed a friends copy to see if I would like it. Where do we start with how bad this movie was. It was such a disappointment in comparison to the other three. You would have thought after the 3 that this one would just blow your mind. As it was the first 85 minutes of it just drug on. I watch videos while I elliptical and I joked that I was almost up to a whole Lord of the Rings on it. Figured the Hobbit would get me there. I struggled to stay engaged during the first 85 minutes. The last 65 minutes was just so painful. I got off the machine just as the dragon opened its eye in disgust. Had to watch the first Lord of The Rings this morning just to get the bad taste out of my mouth and the horribleness of the awful makeup out of my head.<br /><br />Lets start with the makeup on the dwarves can we say horrible and something my 3 year old grandson could have done. The bald one his name escapes me right now he looked like he got out of the makeup chair to early and was left partially undone. The rest of them just looked like cartoon characters with odd hair dos.<br /><br />There was a heavy reliance on CG and man it showed.  The movie labored along at a snails crawl. Maybe they got so caught up in the graphics that they forgot that the audience needs to feel something for the characters for us to feel invested in their survival and that we would want to come back at a later time to see how there fared, meaning go see them at the movies or buy the DVD's.  This one needed a wheelbarrow to help carry it. They could have cut 85 minutes off and made it tighter and maybe not so bloody awful.  I remembered back to my first Lord of The Rings and you bonded with most of the characters right away. The cast was a tight knit group with their own unique personalities. Thank goodness for Gandalf he was the only cohesive bit to the movie. Although it seems he was limited to always saying \\"Run\\" he did have other words but that seems to sum up most of his input.<br /><br />Every time young Bilbo opened his mouth it was to whine about something. I kept hoping they would truss him up and stuff something in his mouth. He had the same expression throughout the movie. The expression on the box and that is what his character was a wooden box. Couldn't feel nor did I care about the plight of any of the other members of this team. There was constant bickering with no cause. Kept hoping it would get better that the last 30 minutes would at least redeem it, no such luck. It was only because of my personal work out goal did I keep watching.<br /><br />I think they covered every way to run and either tumble down the side of a mountain, off a tree off or something else. They spent more time sliding down something. The other creatures just looked so cartoonish and backwards. The beauty and elegance of the other movies from the trilogy were not in this one at all. Yes there were ugly fight scenes and gross monsters but they looked complete the characters were finished. The Hobbit sorely lacked any of the polish that we have come to expect of the others in the Ring trilogy.<br /><br />Not to say that there we not good moments in this movie. There were some cute one liners. And of course the scenery was stunning as ever. Gollum while he's a bit of an acquired taste added some much needed life. HIs eyes were so eloquent when Bilbo was deciding his fate unbeknownst to him. I felt more of a connection to his character than any of the others. The Great Eagles were absolutely amazing. Lets not forget Galadriel elf queen she is absolutely breathtaking as always, ray of light in all that is dark. Some of the new characters were interesting but they just felt like add ons and not complete characters at all.<br /><br />This movie should not have been reduced to moments there was potential for so much. If they are going to drag out this movie into2 more parts I think I will pass. I was so disappointed in the movie that it made me a bit cross all day. I returned it immediately to my friend...Unfortunately they got the brunt of my review verbally.  I had to buy lunch as an apology...I figured writing about it would be more productive so I can move on.  They coasted on this one and I do not feel like investing in what happens next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just can't explain how good it is.  You have to watch it for yourself.<br /><br />I was not thoroughly convinced after the first couple episodes, but my husband and I kept hearing how good it is, so we kept watching (just for something to do every now and again in the evenings).  Well, we blazed through all the seasons that were on Netflix so fast it was ridiculous.  We couldn't stop ourselves!  (And I consider myself pretty anti-tv in general so this is really saying something).<br /><br />It's so good, it hurts.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I liked this book.  I decided to read the series when I found out about the movie was coming out.  I had never heard of this series prior to that.  I'm really glad that I made the decision to read this series.  I had trouble putting this book down, and I lost some sleep while trying to read this series.
0140177191|2.0|The book is a paper back with very small print for a 60 year old to read.So off to the library to get a copy in hard back.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This series was one of the best that I have read in a long time.  Too bad the movies did not live up to the book.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Beautiful creatures was a great love story with twists and turns that leave you wanting more! I immediately bought the second book in the series after finishing this one because I just had to know what happens next! If, by chance, you have seem the movie or are considering watching it - DONT! It's a complete waste of time. read these books instead and you won't be disappointed.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|This is a wonderful \\"sherlock\\" movie with lots of variation on the original.  Great rapport between the Sherlock and Watson.  Terrific casting!  Surprise ending and lots of suspense.  Loved it!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|As someone who has a lot if downtime at work, I find myself playing these games often... I usually lose interest pretty fast and go from game to game, but this one is very fun. I almsot beat it in a few hours so for me the learning curve and controls were easy. The many planes you can unlock are a good touch as it gives you another way to play. All in all a good, entertaining game. And my advice is to use the cluster bomb plane, and master it as I pretty much beat the game with that one type.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ian did it again. Top job. I have read all of the series books and am hoping for more from Mr Rankin.
0061703087|5.0|\\"Prey\\" is an extremely suspenseful book that leaves hints along the way as to what is causing the big mystery. Jack Forman, previously a computer programmer for Xymos, gets a call from his former boss who originally fired him. His boss wants his expertise in programming to \\"help\\" with an experiment occurring at the company's fabrication facility in the Nevada desert. When Jack goes there, he discovers that he is dealing with far more than he bargained for with one of their medical prototypes gone extremely wrong. A microscopic camera originally used to view the inside of the human body was found useful by the United States military. While testing in the Nevada desert, these cameras were blown away easily since they were so light. A few days later, the cameras come back to the base in \\"swarms\\" and cannot be reobtained. Jack finds out that he was called in to find a large mistake in the code written to create the cameras that allows the cameras to continuously innovate themselves. The swarms keep coming back to the base in exponentially increasing numbers and are programmed to be predators that target anything moving, and the scariest part is that the swarms become an extremely deadly danger to anything out in the Nevada desert. Snakes, coyotes, rabbits, and especially people. Jack learns that changing the code would do nothing, so he needs to find a force that would end them forever. The end is not what you expect, because you won't know what to expect! This book constantly keeps you reading and I highly recommend it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't like  knowing too much about a book before getting into it. I like learning and creating my own views of what the author has written. This was the case again with WOOL. I only took the time to review the facts, but not the facts about the plot, the characters, or anything to do with the actually story. For me, I look at ratings (how many, and high high), whether it was a best seller, the genre, and in this case, the interest by Fox and other companies at making the story into a movie. I have to admit, I was very pleased with this book. I am usually not let down with books after I have done my strange research on, and this was quite the same. The difference here was this story was more than entertaining. It was the first time I almost skipped chapters, just to find out what was going to happen next, but the hold the story had on me, kept me in line... (That's actually funny considereing the books) anyhow. Well worth the costs, and time to read. Don't wait, just get it...

0316067601|5.0|Great book. A lil slow in the beginning but it picked up quickly and held my attention. I highly recommend this book.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app solved a problem I had been experiencing. I was not hearing my alarm in the mornings, but I hear this one and I like it's interface.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This starts out very slowly, but just builds and builds in suspense. I was fascinated, could not put it down. This book is like nothing you have ever read before!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game really enjoy it.  .. . . . . . . . .  . . . . . .
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I've read all of the vivid mind paintings in Master Martin's GOT imagination gallery.  I have also been singularly delighted with what has been translated for the visual senses by an equally artistic production.... all is rendered glorious, so far, and I am thoroughly entranced.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have never been one for musicals, but I was blown away when I saw this movie in the theatre.  Everything about it is just beautiful and the cinematography is fantastic.  I'm not sure why it didn't win more Oscars, it definitely deserved it.  I am now an official Hugh Jackman fan -- how talented is he?!!
B007HACDLK|3.0|I read this &#34;on the rebound&#34; of finishing Game of Thrones. The writing is about middle school level and the characters are flat and lack nuance.<br /><br />That being said, the plot is engaging, and even though I hate the writing the book is entertaining. I have to admit, I would probably be tempted to read another one of his novels.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|Love the songs and the music on the show.  Sorry to say the CD is of poor quality.  Doesn't sound as clear.  Voices muffled.  Almost sounds as if soemone taped it instead of being live.  Very disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|...is well done.  It certainly holds our attention from start to finish with only the minimum of hinting beyond what we all know--how we get to the rebellion.  A well-built narrative!
B00BF11STU|3.0|I found it difficult to follow the events and even more difficult to match the script to actual events and news reports from the actual time of the events.  Difficult to identify the characters.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The special effects have a bit of cheese to it, but what makes this show great are the characters, dialogue, and story line. It's a shame it's only 1 season.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|very engaging. my daughter likes the story and finding the stars along the way. my three year old son also likes the interaction
B003XU3MWM|2.0|Subpar flick. The action is sorta there, but the whole premise is lame and I found myself groaning over aspects of the plot, characters, and dialogue. On an a different note, is it me or do the locals all look like they've smeared pigeon poop in their hair?
B005COO1X6|2.0|What happened to the &#34; Carrie's / Cujo's / IT's / Thinner's....... ?  your writing style and mind set may be &#34; not so good&#34;
1612130283|3.0|I don't understand why this is a best seller it's poorly written and unrealistic. I live in Seattle and I was disappointed the author didn't do her research a develop the story better  :/ I agree she wrongly incorporated her own British culture into the book. I was also amazed how similar this is to Twilight minus the vampires. If you're looking for a good book don't pick it up. I give it three stars for the erotica.
1594745692|5.0|The designs on these are to die for. I've been wanting to get back in to tarot and this was the perfect drive to get into that. Very Fallouty.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|it is so inhuman to even think about wiping life gone! I thought I would like it wrong I was!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Of course there was a big hype about the hunger games trilogy. And the price was un-beatable so I couldn't help but buy it. In just a few short days I finished with the first book, and can't wait to start the others.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|How are you supposed to get a decent score when the tile, which is very obviously in play, will not react to your touch, yet the timer works just fine?  The game is freezing while the timer is not. Either thst, or it cannot tell which tiles are active.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  I have heard it was an excellent read and judging by ALL the 5 star reviews...I thought I was in for a thriller of a book.  I am not saying it was all bad but there was many unneeded boring parts.  It was never on the edge of my seat, or gripping as some reviews stated.  As a matter of fact it was the exact opposite.  It was somewhat intriguing but a lot to be desired in this story.  The beginning started off very slow and it did get somewhat better as the book went on but I was glad to get close to the end and the ending just kinda left you hanging.  There was some build up in the story but to only be let down.
020530902X|5.0|Really great book, one that has been around for a long time and I have used for reference in many papers. I like the lay out and style of the book. Recommended by professors.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am very happy and I will  definitely  reread the  book.... on word to book 2! I can't wait!!! Thanks!
B009ANP4F4|5.0|Another Excellent Dance Movie once again.<br />I Love all the Step Up movies. However this one in choreography, vision, creativity, design, etc, will blow your mind away.<br /><br />The dance movie sequence, scenes, and creativity were Excellent. My best three best dance segments are: the museum, the business, and the end.<br /><br />If dancing is your passion then this movie is for you to see. I can't wait to see what they would come up with next.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I purchased the movie through Amazon Instant Video.  The movie was enjoyable and I like using the instant video feature on Amazon.
B0061JPYX2|5.0|sad that she is gone. with that talent she could bring back all the good hits from times past. drugs and alcohol takes another great one from us
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|The movie Total Recall was purchased through Amazon Instant Video and I was happy with it.  I would recommend the movie.
B006RJTEIC|5.0|I figure that's what they will be doing to people my age in the future, bumping us off. Great movie, hope it never comes to pass though.
