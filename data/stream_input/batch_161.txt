B00COYNZJ8|3|Obviously it looks cool. I mean, who doesn't want their car to look like the cockpit of the Falcon?<br /><br />Too bad the quality is wicked cheap. This thing barely survived a Pennsylvania summer. Yeah, Pennsylvania. Not that rough. The color faded extremely fast. Soon after the color went, the shade itself began to break down and flake apart, rendering the product basically useless, not to mention turning the interior of my car into something resembling Hoth.
B00HNMLQAG|5|work well was surprised  to find out I use them
B005G8DBOS|5|Nice decal that can be re applied.
B005PXGXSA|4|Very good!!
B0067UAMIM|4|So far so good. Order was received in just a few days. Very happy with purchase.
B004RLJKPY|3|small and the leather is poor
B00JVHLS3G|1|Cheap and fake item. Will turn yellow and fade. Will not buy again
B000B5QFE4|5|Great product, easy installation and they work!
B000CPI5ZK|1|It did not work. It actually increased my vehicle temperature by over 15F. Using scanguage before using the product my coolant temperature reads 196F, after using this product my coolant temperature jumped to 208F and just yesterday 212F.<br /><br />I am going to flush the system to get rid of this junk.
B00460G0FE|5|Percfect
B00HWIZO6I|5|I bought and used both the cleaner and conditioner for my living room furniture. It was easy to use and the results were awesome. I plan to use this on my leather purse and jacket. The company even sends a email to see how you liked the product and asked if I had any problems or questions. The nice thing was it was a personal email that was actually answered when I responded not some automated  system asking for Amazon reviews. Nice personal touch
B008N2208W|5|Great price and looks great on my car!
B00A8H1N7E|5|Great helmet,
B000K046G4|5|Exactly what I needed.
B00ATQ0M1C|5|This worked great and my Husband was really pleased.
B00BCRM9RM|5|These fit PERFECTLY in my Mazda3. I am a HUGE Ravens fan, so these fit perfectly with my purple car and my fandom. I love that it also comes with the seat belt covers, as I HATE having the seat belt rub my neck. The seat covers come in separate parts, so they fit is really much more snug than the one piece covers. They are difficult to get on, but really worth it, as my seats don't even look like they have cover, looks like the seats are actually purple and black. The only thing I did not utilize was the steering wheel cover, not because of anything to do with the product, I just don't use steering covers. I really am happy that I got the chance to give my honest review in exchange for a discount. I will update in a few months, and see how they hold up!  UPDATED I ended up using the steering wheel cover, as it is really thin and comfy, and not at all bulky to use. Plus, added some pictures.
B000YAL0HI|5|Perfect for my jacked up Ford.
B009VZ5VC2|5|Don't fool with substitutes. This was the same wiper on the Chevy when I bought it new.
B00FSLPFYM|5|There is not much to say here.  The tank comes as shown and as long as its the right part will be installed in minutes.  I had to replace my old one that had a leak in the neck.  I'm not a mechanic and I had the old one off and new one on in under 5 minutes cause I went slow.<br /><br />Installed on 2002 Dodge Ram 1500
B00D1CQVIY|5|Comes with everything you need! Thanks!
B001LA4IXS|5|Looks good and adheres well to glass
B009Y5F714|1|Olympic is incorrectly packaging their products, and this bar will not fit a 97-06 Jeep Wrangler. The bar I received (on two occasions from amazon) contained bars that were intended to fit 07-present Wranglers. I purchased this bar from another seller, and had the same issue. I contacted the seller (A knowledgeable seller of Jeep parts) and they recognized the issue. They had to contact Olympic directly to get the right part. Do not waste your time or money on this. Because of Olympic's error, my vacation plans have been ruined, as I cannot bring my kayaks as I had intended.
B000HBM5TQ|5|none
B006YVWX5E|4|This part fit perfect for my 2003 Mazda 6, It's been in place for a month and so far in great working order.
B007EEVLDU|5|It made my machine run like new.It was a very good purchase and fast. Thank you again.
B000WNV6R6|5|Worked great in the TC88B in my '00 Softail Deuce. Installed a D&D FatCat exhaust.
B000BNKVG4|2|Not satisfied with this product. Should have spent more money and purchased the higher quality mats.  These mats are not as heavy as they look and tend to roll up on the sides.
B000AP8EHG|5|Typical K&N quality, no complaints!
B00BV1T8PK|5|This mirror was a good replacement for the OEM Isuzu NPR mirror, and much cheaper.
B007ZS99NY|1|very difficult to install, does not work for toyota prius V 2014
B0000CBIK5|3|works well
B001FAIA3I|5|great for resting arm
B00DCD5FZW|3|Worked very well
B00029XI4E|5|Needed a replacement horn for the factory original.  Horn looked great out of the package.  It was a tad larger than the original but manageable. The holes did not match but that is not a surprise.  Installation on my boat was easy and the sound was amazingly load.  Highly recommended product.
B00652G4TS|5|[[VIDEOID:f08e1de9679f747c91bfefd8b19cd266]] This is a review of the BlueDriver OBD2 scan tool. I received a free sample for evaluation.<br /><br />There are a lot of imported OBD2 scanners in the marketplace and I've used a couple of them. They were terrible. The apps weren't well designed and the connection to the app was tedious to setup.<br /><br />The BlueDriver was super easy to connect to and begin using. No technical know how at all is necessary. You simply locate the OBD2 plug in your car. It is usually located somewhere under your dashboard near the center console area. It's usually pretty easy to locate since it is used by auto mechanics and therefore is placed in a location that is relatively easy to get to.<br /><br />Vehicles this will work with:<br /> - 1996 and newer vehicles sold in North America.<br /> - vehicles sold in Europe 2001 and newer for petrol vehicles, 2004 and newer for diesel.<br /> - vehicles sold in Australia and New Zealand 2006 and newer.<br /> - For Vehicles sold in other countries, check your vehicle's manual to ensure OBD2 Compliance.<br /><br />First thing is to download the BlueDriver app to your tablet or smartphone. Then you need to connect the sensor into the OBD2 plug in your vehicle. Once you plug the sensor in, an LED lights up to indicate that power is reaching it. Then go to your tablet or smartphone and search your bluetooth menu for the BlueDriver device. Once you've paired it, launch the app enter the VIN number of your vehicle and you can begin to read engine codes, reset your check engine light and observe a host of other engine diagnostic indicators. When the engine is running you can observer the RPM of the engine, check on sensor temperatures, etc.<br /><br />It's really quite amazing how much information is available to you by using this scan tool. I like that I can save reports and the info you can obtain for resolving engine code issues is very helpful. The \\"Live\\" screen can show things like Engine Coolant Temperature and Engine RPM. The app makes it very easy to check and update the BlueDriver firmware if necessary. There is also a slew of very well produced YouTube videos that comprise the \\"User Manual\\" available from within the app.<br /><br />I leave this plugged in all the time. I believe the drain on the battery to be negligible.<br /><br />This does cost more than many of the imported OBD2 readers, but you get what you pay for and I believe this to be superior to most of what else I've seen.<br /><br />Recommended.emperature and Engine RPM.

B00M0TLQ66|5|A whole lot cheaper to buy it here than in the auto parts store. It took a few applications but it ate away all the rust when we let it soak in. Its very much worth the price.
B002XLHUQG|5|Worked great and would recommend.
B0000AY2Z6|5|Just finished my first week long trip on my 16 ft boat with the Endless Breeze. It is July August in Fla. and I can assure you it's HOT. Cabin recording thermometer made it to 103 on two days during the trip, during sleep period low temp was between 77 & 79 degrees F. With fan on lowest setting would run all night with no problem on boats #2 12volt deep cycle batterie. I used a good nylon cord to manage how I hung and aimed the fan. After the weeks good sleep the price of the fan never ran across mind, after all most of the time you get what you pay for, this time I did.
B001NZR0L8|5|seems same as factory
B009IAL5MA|5|Fits well and is comfortable.
B001IDEMPW|5|Mirrors work perfectly and was easy to install myself
B00TEA5PZC|5|Not heavy but very nice and great finish.  Looks awesome on my black Ram 1500.
B000COTX9S|1|it did not fit .
B0085XH58O|3|It serves its purpose. I didn't want to pay for the OEM one but wanted a new emblem. This is just a sticker that sticks to a cheap plastic casing that pops in to the hood. But still looks nice. Worth the cost.
B0002MABGE|4|It's not a bad divider, not a great one--but it works at least on the larger dogs--the little one goes thru it so he thinks he's king pup!! For the price it is good and set-up was easy.
B00PKE6NNY|5|I have used this and the original turtle wax floormat cleaner the original smells better but the ice works way better I keep extra heads cause the plastic tips wearout quick.but it clean ed my oil stain off and other stains that are hard to get out
B00IMUC9YA|3|Very pretty, but was too BIG for my steering wheel! Definitely measure your steering wheel before purchasing. It says it fits wheels 13-15&#34;.
B0054RGL0W|5|Awesome, love it.
B00HZ0LPMK|5|These floor mats are GreatThey fit good in my 08 MustangI would recommend these Floor mats
B00361UVZO|5|Fit perfectly in my husband's new truck.
B001IF2BG2|5|Just as stated, with thebugflector II it took all of 5 min. to install and no metal clips to scratch your hood. I've run it through the delta sonic car wash and no worries. It just looks great!
B00BOFETFC|5|Worked perfectly for designed application on my 2005 Tacoma
B005J6JRMM|1|Coule not use on Nissan rogue 2011 2nd row Middle seat. Product looks great
B006B27O7I|5|I changed the brakes of my 1998 ninja 500 with these.<br />I can't tell if they brakes harder than my previous brakes but they definitely &#34;feel&#34; better.
B000GVBVUG|5|The trailer fit with no issues and it works as expected.
B000LG0B7K|5|Easy to program and works great!
B00HTP8N0I|4|These are short but work good on handlebars.
B00L841RIQ|5|Good
B00TG24GDU|5|Awesome decal in a timely manner!!!
B00144AH5O|4|Good value for the money but plastic hubcaps were broken upon arrival and plastic wheels are too narrow for best use in our situation.
B00LB0OXBA|5|This will keep your hitch connection steady and quiet. And the option to put a padlock is a big plus. Simple design but very functional.
B000GL19WG|5|What can I say?  I'm pretty sure my spark plugs have not gotten stuck in my engine, but I wont know until I try to pull them out to change them. =P  Seriously though, this is the same stuff you get at autozone or O'reilly's.  There was more than enough for my V6, so I can't imagine running out for a standard v8 or even v10.  If you are wondering if this small purchase is necessary for your plug change, I can relay a story about breaking one off in my 95 Camaro, and how it cost over $800 to fix.  Just buy it and use it.
B0064BJM6W|5|As advertised! Installation was very easy, but you need to take your time.
B000C2ZKDI|5|fit my 1995 Dodge Dakota just fine.  No problems with install.
B00BVL7LUY|5|A nice little gadget for anyones tool bag.
B001GN1GLM|5|Ok
B008FCE8IA|4|We have a 2011 Chevy Traverse and bought the package to include the C channel. It took us about 1.5 hours to install only because our parts weren't labeled left and right. If the screws don't tighten in the slider on both sides then just switch the sliders and that will remedy the issue. Overall, it was easy and secure. I recommend this option over the $300 option at the dealer plus who knows how much for installation.
B00OOY12EQ|5|Best device I have found to keep my sunglasses
B003YDY7YK|4|You get what you pay for it. It is good quality, worth the money for the need it meets.
B004T39YX8|5|Very usefull!!!!
B00588T81Q|4|Is like on the picture
B00EDWF1BE|5|Great quality and finish. Easy installation. Adjustable to reduce hood flutter. Great price from Amazon and Rugged Ridge backed warranty can't be beat!
B00XB19J2K|3|thank you
B002RSIK4G|5|Worked well and was easy to use.
B0036R6IT6|4|Put the seat on my Yamaha Wolverine 2008, it fit it workes. Seat leans forward on my wheeler. Not comfortable for sitting. Not the seats fault, it's my rack that leans. If my rack was flat, seat would have straight back. Cushins are stiff and abrasive. Storage is great, both helmets and tools, lunch, one gallon of fuel. And picnic blanket. If it had grab bars for rear passenger would have been much better.
B005N53AM2|5|I love it
B002XLFXHY|5|All the parts and fit of OEM at just over half the cost.
B001FI23D8|5|works perfect..proper connections...everything i've bought for my car has paerformed well...knock on wood!
B006LOEBGS|3|doesn't have as much jet/fluid pressure as I'd like
B0000ATZD5|5|This is the second time I was asked to review the same product. Again,  it worked well for my needs.
B0035B013W|5|It was exactly what I was looking for.
B0006MRRU8|4|Leaked some when first installed but has since stopped, so hoping all is ok.
B00KTHXLIC|5|Works great!!!!!
B001D275WU|5|Excellent value-exact parts I needed-Thanks.Would have cost a fortune at a mercedes garage!
B004GCGXVS|4|It works for now but I needed the electric mirror
B004A2YEFQ|1|wrong part
B00S4RVHDU|3|its ok
B008FP4RBK|3|The handicap part is fine. The second part of the stencil  the box isn't actually big enough to go around  the handicap stencil. So, if you painted blue inside this size box there's barely enough room for the handicap symbol. The box needs to be a true 4' x 4'. Also the edges are pretty thin so overspray is inevitable.  The plastic is fine.  I just think you guys need a bit more product knowledge.
B00H5D47K4|5|great item fast shipper.
B00514BPGI|5|You wouldn't think 3/4 would make a difference but you can really tell when you're riding. Very comfortable position when they are on. Easy to install too
B000M6035O|4|As discribed, quick delivery
B004PX1F9S|5|Did exactly what I wanted it to do.Great product at a great price.I highly recommend it!!!
B000C39C6I|1|Did not work you get what you pay for
B00RGQ1OJW|5|Killer tail bag. Tons of room, especially when expanded, and the included rain fly is super high quality. Love this thing.
B001GHWPJK|3|Tester works okay but it really needs to have some mechanism for calibration.  Without a test spring with a known pressure value to calibrate this tool the best you can hope for is that all the springs read similar.  The product literature states it should be calibrated with a known pre-calibrated spring but if I had a calibrated tester in my tool kit I wouldn't need this one.  I should have bit the bullet and purchased an accurate bench model and been done with it.
B004YWP9AG|4|Looks nice but wire connections are kinda short from bulb to ballast.
B00EZOUPCA|5|Unbelieveable how these LED bulbs have cut down on the heat output from lights in my travel trailer and the light is clear and bright and at least as good quality as before. I ordered more to replace every bulb in the trailer. Well worth the $$.
B00CMY3NRY|1|The corners are very sharp
B00ZCE2Z5W|1|Fire Hazard - DC plug melted from a short in the plug.  I suggest avoiding this product as the components are made as cheaply as possible with no quality control.
B00TKTGNRQ|5|Good quality
B00ECTRBHA|5|Very nice just what I wanted
B000JL760W|5|Exactly as I ordered it.  Would have been nice if it came in a kit with the test strips.  Coolant, Prep, and test strips all together.
B0036VUGWW|5|Really look great and a breeze to install. Amazon shipping super fast
B0048IZX6Q|5|The window motor fit and operates as expected.
B00XV4W686|5|Super bright! On Yaris and getting hyper flash so will have to buy resistors too.
B00N396SHE|5|Works amazing. Added on average 100miles per tank. Burning 90octane with a booster to make it 93 octane. That's on the performance setting. Haven't tried any other settings yet. Added some horsepower and torque for sure. Love that it got rid of my governor chip. Only thing I don't like is having to pull certain fuses to change the setting im using.
B00144I5KS|5|I always wanted one of these attachments, but was too cheap to buy one from the store.  I'm glad I finally purchased one off of Amazon.  It works pretty darn well getting that buffed shine on my clear coat.  So I actually sanded, primed, then painted my a spot repair on my door, then sprayed clear, then wet sanded, and finally used this to achieve a shine.  To most people it looked good as new, to me it shined about 90% as good as the stock Audi paint job.  If it weren't such an old car I would've had it done professionally, but in this case I was able to achieve a good finish with clear coat shine with this buffer hooked up to my cordless.  And it's still working after hours of abuse wet-sanding and buffing.  So if you're worried about durability, don't be.
B000SMZN02|5|this is great tape for what I needed
B005I4JOMI|5|A good fit for my car.
B00RUDX9OY|5|Very nice and half the price!
B003PL3B0W|5|This thing was awesome.  I had cleaned up the stock starter a couple of times with mediocre results and then opted to try this.  I was so glad I did.  The thing never started so nicely.  Lightning fast and crisp cranking.
B008BE02GO|2|Bulbs had nice bright white light, however, one burned out within 2 months.  I would not reccomend due to this.
B00GS8Z7CY|5|good product fits perfect.good price.
B0001UZUW2|3|I think you have to be drinking beer when using it to get really excited about it.  It is OK, but not anything to write home to mom about.
B002UC18SY|5|No issues good product.
B004D5SUIC|5|I've been using Mobil 1 for decades now. This is my go-to oil to keep all my vehicles lubricated. Rather than run that fine oil through some cheap filter I lean toward the more expensive ones thinking that more cost equates with a better filter.<br />All that said, I trust the Mobile 1 brand.<br />A friend of mine owns one of those quick change oil businesses. He collected a bunch of filters and sawed them in half. There is an enormous difference in the construction and therefore the oil filtering ability of an oil filter. Cheap really did equal to a cheaper made filter. Expensive generally equated to a better constructed filter.<br />Researching through the internet lead me to the same conclusion that looking at a bunch of sawed through filters.<br />This filter stood out for construction, and oil filtering ability.
B0009Y2CFS|5|Great gift
B0006V2BRS|5|Pound for Pound..You gotta get this!
B00B9H590E|4|Fits like it should! easy replacement. comes with the plastic clips, nice touch!
B00E63THQA|5|Outstanding product and highly recommend!
B000WEPI4M|4|Fits great in my BMW 3 series (2015). Only slightly annoys the passenger if their sitting with their legs spread out casually. I use this product to keep my wallet, keys, cigs in there, NOT DRINKS. Cup holders are to big and shallow to hold drinks. Other than that no complaints, does exactly what I wanted it to do. Storage for my random accessories I have in the car.
B00VKABDB4|5|I love this os awesome as hell. It has actually been like 2 months that ive had this and its almost completely faded. Laminate them or something? Thatd be swell.
B00E6A4MJ0|5|Just what I expected
B0070Y36G4|2|Will it work on a 95 honda civic
B00Z0KQ3OM|3|Worked very well
B00D3YEGO6|4|This is the second one I've bought. I absolutely love it although after 8 months it looked pretty worn and missing jewels. And I live in Southern California where the weather isn't harsh and I park in my garage. It looks great with the light shining on it! Everyone asked where i got it :)
B0079DGP64|5|Perfect fit. Well built. Exceeded my expectations.
B00KPR031E|5|Fit my RV perfectly.  Very easy to install and work well.  Not super loud, but that is by design since you don't want to disturb the entire campground, but it is certainly loud enough to be heard when sitting around the picnic table or campfire.
B00E9AHU4G|1|Did not get warm at all.  Don't waste your money.
B00AE4U6T2|5|These have already paid for themselves.
B002MQMM4M|5|Great! Bought vehicle spray paint from hobby lobby and it looks like new!!
B00563UJ3Y|5|Highly recommended!! +++++
B00E4FZ8UE|3|Had to remove the clutch lever safety switch because the clutch lever paddle did not properly aligned with the switch plunger.
B006TNDGNK|5|Arrived earilier than expected and works great.
B00JV15KN6|5|Excellent product. Auto part stores don't carry this product for honda automatic transmissions dealers very very expensive. I would recommend this product to anybody.<br />Thank you.
B00APL7OHG|3|These hubcaps are reasonably priced but are thin.  The first one I installed cracked as I pushed it onto the wheel.  In this case you get what you pay for.
B00819AKOS|4|work fine but I don't know their lasting life yet.
B00IWO4K8O|5|Worked perfectly on my golf cart.
B00B6DG50Y|5|Worked perfectly
B001R9UTJ0|5|GREAT PROTECTION TO THE FACE

B00K2MYPMK|5|Replaced white metal post with this plastic one; it is much more durable.
B004M0CZS4|5|Bigger than expected and I love it!! Shipped fast and looks good in my car!
B008PPNEAA|5|Works as advertised
B001KR3K3G|3|My mistake. I should have ordered Anco Contour C-19-OE. The A-19-M is not the correct fit, and lifts at speed.
B005OVINAE|5|Part fits perfectly, no leaks!
B00N07MEOK|2|It was what I was expecting but it had a deep scratch. I don't know if it's damaged stuff they are selling but that's not cool!!
B00EEIZU0O|5|Going to California for vacation, and this will be perfect upon my return to scrapbook!
B0009H51ZS|5|Perfect fit and engine is breathing clean air again! :)
B003NBFKDK|4|I have used this carrier for a camping trip.  I have a large tote which fits nicely within the lip.  In it, I put 3 sleeping bags, stove, two air beds, various other things.  Next to the tote, I put a large cooler and two tents,  On top of everything I put 5 quad chairs and strapped everything down.  It worked out very nicely.  The carrier seems sturdy enough for my purposes, and is lightweight enough to not be a pain to move around the garage.  Assembly was straight forward and simple.  The carrier does tend to see-saw, but I suspect that is the same with most carriers of this style.  This is my first.  I know there are products out there that tighten up the connection into the receiver hitch, but I don't think I need one of those.  At least not yet.  Very happy with the purchase.
B000NVW1LM|1|Did not stop or slow down moderate engine oil leak.
B00C25GRI0|5|Didn't work for the car. But seller communicated
B003NHH6LI|5|Worked perfect. Better than the broom stick I was using before.
B005RR7W9I|5|A+
B00DD9HGSO|4|good part
B000NJ1HIC|2|Doesn't match look like in the picture Quality of leather very poor
B002YI74U0|5|So far it's doing what it says.  We're on a septic and we recently had a clogged drain so I've been extra particular about what I use to go down the drain.  I've changed all of my cleaning products and have switched to this septic tank product.  So far so good .  I already noticed a smell disappear that I thought was coming from my laundry machine but it was actually coming from a drain under the machine leading to the septic.
B002I6XTUM|5|Good quality
B00330KIDS|5|perfect for my tuned BMW 335
B00RTFVGZM|5|After reading some of the negitive reviews I thought twice about giving these a try.  I am so glad I bought them!  I had no problem with the packageing.  Everything was just as described.  they are easy to put together and easy to install.  As far as the smell goes, They are just like any other air freshener I have ever bought.  They smell is strong at first and then quickly goes away.  So, if you are looking for a strong smell that stays for a long time, these are not for you.  But if you want something very attractive for your car and something that will make you smile everytime you look at them,..  BUY THESE!
B000FPXTPS|5|Got it on time, and was what I expected
B00FSG3DTG|3|I am giving this product a 3* because not all units have failed.  The one's that work are very good.  Obviously, the ones that failed deserve 1*.<br />Don't know what the problem is.  But, my problem is consistent with the 250 lum 92111804 bulbs.<br />They will last 60,000 hours!  Not a chance.  How about 3 to 4 months.<br />Failure behavior has been identical for all 3 bulbs.<br />1) First (after 3 to 5 months), I eventually noticed that the brightness of bulbs did not match other bulbs (with identical spec's: Gold Stars 92111804, etc.).  I removed the fixture lens and sure enough, about 4 or 5 individual LED's were not lighting.  I just ignored, as loss of light seemed barely noticeable (for me).<br />2) However, withing several weeks, the bulbs that had lost some of the light emitting diodes, began to flicker.  Bright and very fast flicker.  It was total noticeable and annoying.  This failure sequence was the same for all 3 bulbs.  At first, I thought it possibly might have something to do with the light fixture itself.  What I didn't know.  But, swapping out the 250 lum with 150's fixed problem and no failures since.<br />I have since ordered several new 250 bulbs, as the 150 lum was not sufficient.  So far, so good.<br />Alert/Summary: You may find yourself having to deal with Amazon's Return Policy.  Which I have found to be a miserable experience.
B008K6I1RU|5|Great

B005FL0MBQ|5|Arrived promptly, nice quality and fit perfectly... only limited miles on them thus far... but good stopping power.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I have a full-size pickup, single cab. Fits my windshield beautifully and folds down to a very small size. I can truck it under my bench seat, which is perfect as space in a single cab is very limited.
B006N9FWNW|5|They are installed and doing there Job thanks...
B0018JVEEI|5|Amazing
B00QQWNEEA|1|Too small, doesn't stand out.
B000BC976K|4|These towels aren’t cheap, however they work great. Really good for keep your nice paint in great condition.

B003GEQXU8|5|Love it.
B002OUPFOU|5|Perfect for my boat, Works great.
B00PJATOSU|5|This is a very high quality jacket for the price.  My husband could not believe it was only priced at $100, it could easily compete with jackets double the price or more.  We received the Brown Leather jacket size XL for my husband who normally wears size Large, and it fit him perfectly.  This jacket seems to run a bit small, but it could be because it is styled to be very fitted to the body.  If in doubt you should probably order a size bigger.<br />(For reference, I measured the size XL jacket while laying flat.  Underarm to underarm: 25 inches.  Shoulder to bottom: 27 inches  Shoulder seam to cuff: 27 inches  Shoulder to shoulder seam across the top: 22 inches)<br />Other than it running a bit small I have nothing but good things to say about this jacket.  It is heavy and feels like it would provide good protection, there is extra protection built in to the jacket at the elbows, on the shoulders, and on the back.  The lining is great for warmth but easily zips and velcros in and out as needed.<br />There are pockets everywhere!  Some are simply ventilation pockets, others hold small things like wallet and cell phone or mp3 players, etc.  All the pockets are easily accessible from the front, with one hand while driving if necessary.<br />The leather is not overly stiff, it seems soft enough, although I think this jacket will feel even better once it's broken in a bit.  We also like the color - it is dark brown but from a distance almost looks black.  It's a very attractive jacket.<br />I received a sample of this product for review purposes, and we are very pleased with it.
B009PHD65U|5|Easy to install and has worker perfectly!
B00MWEJD28|5|These were delivered ahead of schedule and they are very thick. Just  had to flatten them overnight as they were rolled up in the package. These are very nice and the price was just as nice!! Another good experience with Amazon.
B00AERMVYC|5|This was a Father's day gift for my husband. He loves it and was very happy with its performance.

B00GYTEC14|4|The 2010 GMC Acadia doesn't have a cabin filter... Apparently... Got this in the mail fast though.  Will be returning.
B0046ID5EK|4|Remote was easy to program and works perfectly
B00DV7FLGW|5|Worked perfectly
B00P929UIW|4|It worked fairly well. The temp and time was fine. The degrees of direction are accurate but the arrow reflecting that direction is either slow to respond or inaccurate. Direction was my most important goal so it is not as useful just having the degrees reported. (like 180 degrees means south.)
B000VKXBK0|5|Part is made well, not for Hondas that are California equipped. I buy and sell Walker at my shop never have complaints compared to some other manufacturers.
B00W8ADB1K|4|Works well and keeps everything organized! Perfect to contain my daughters mess in the back seat!
B000IYNVK4|1|FAN BLADE SHEARD OFF AT MOTOR. PURCHASED NOVEMBER 2014 AND INSTALLED APRIL 2015. COULDN'T TAKE ATLANTA HEAT. LUCKILY NO DAMAGE TO CONDENSER.MOTOR STILL RUNS. FAN BLADE MUST HAVE BEEN DEFECTIVE OR INSTALLED WRONG ON MOTOR.

B00DX8B1UE|5|I put this lift in a 2013 two seater 750 , took a couple hrs. everything went together great ,i did not do any grinding on the lower a-arm which was great. I installed some 30&#34; zillas and rode 50 plus miles on mts. in mud on hardtop with no problems. I am happy with this lift.

B00MB0EXGE|5|Read the reviews , ordered anyway and Im glad I did.<br />It's so cool and beautiful .<br />People love it and give compliments .<br />Yes it came really pink and after a week or two it became less hot punky and more peachy .<br />Who cares??<br />It's less Childish now :-) I dont mind if it's not flashy pink , maybe it happened because of the sun, it doesn't matter it's still beautiful , unique and I get  lots of comments and compliments .<br />It's only $5 , just buy it :-)<br />Enjoy.
B00GE9Y5ZC|4|Nice mud flaps and they integrated with the other protective trim very nicely. The no drill design is a big plus if you actually worry about long term rust protection or use your truck in muddy/ salty environments.<br /><br />The hardest part  if the installation is fitting the flaps with the hardware from your truck. It's a tight fit between the wheel well and tires front and rear. Removing the tire is a pain but it's the easiest way to install the flaps. My floor jack was in storage and I didn't feel like messing with the hassle of the air compressor etc.. so  I ended up using a 1/4 ratchet wrench and stuck a torx bit in the box end for the screws to remove and install them. I'm sure you could use another set up but that worked for me.<br /><br />Otherwise they look good, keep the truck clean and I hope long term they hold up well. The OE mud flaps are a little sharper looking but I'm not comfortable drilling into sheet metal where dirt and water collect.
B0083G3AXC|5|It is perfect for my chair
B001AVVXTK|5|Just needed a cheap set of sprockets & chain for my 2008 TTR 125 LE and this fit the bill.  Sprocket appears to be very well made and seems to be holding up well.
B005TMHF1G|1|Only the front ones works!
B008I7PK1Q|4|This mirror was not black as it looks in the picture. You will have to get it painted to match the vehicle. If you pay more than $35 to get it painted, you're getting ripped off<br />After I got it painted, it was perfect though, it matched the look of the other mirror 100%.
B001DRP9G4|5|As discribed, quick delivery
B00KRNVT82|5|Fast shipping! High quality product and very easy to work with!
B00S70WMME|5|great price and got it fast

B00EKEGRVS|1|About a month in use, the click broke off... :-(
B00CXMN1VS|5|Only took a couple hours to install and now the 8 runs great! Well worth the purchase!
B00HZ873UA|5|Well let me tell ya I was skeptical about this product, and boy am I glad I made the jump because it improves the vehicles performance like no other. Let me start by saying I have a K&N cold air intake, super 40 series cat back system, torque management delete, and now this flashpacq upgrade. The truck screams now with the 91 octane tune. I can't comment on the other tune setting because I haven't tried them nor do I care because let's be honest we all know what we are here to buy this thing for. If u have a 5.7 hemi and don't know about this product, buy it and watch as your tires smoke. Easy install, arrived fast, best bang for your buck. Good luck!
B00WR992RE|5|Leaves a long lasting shine, if u use it right. What I did was; I sprayed some on my tire them I wipe with a micro fiber cloth or a sponge. Then once I did all 4 tires I went back and spray more on tires. Don't wipe just spray and let sit for 10 minutes. Works great...
B00Z8WKP5K|5|I love this helmet,  I bought one for a buddy and another for my dad.  They love this helmet, too. And it's DOT approved! Finally,  I don't look like a d#*k head or mushroom ...I might still look like an A-hole, but that's probably because I am.
B000BUU5YA|5|Much better than the 1 piece adapter supplied with the RV.
B000IZ02VO|4|Perfect fit. I paired them with new rotors and after 5K miles they are doing just fine.
B00CMC3DYY|5|EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED. AND FAST SHIPPING

B000BEZNSO|3|Should be all brass
B001V8UKBO|1|The very first time I used the trailer aid the tires on my fifth wheel wouldn't clear the ground.  When I  changed the position the studs on the bottom pulled out and half the cleats were flattened. Don't expect to much from this. My printer died and couldn't get it returned in time, I quess I will make a planter out of it I gave it one star because I had to
B00BMGU35I|4|I was a bit dissapointed about the size. There are probably the dimensions listed, but they were a lot smaller then I rma honed. I think they should show the real scale size photo sheet that you recieve (unless they already do and I was too stupid to see it), but other then that they are fine. You get three of them which makes up for the size in a sense. Over all I like them.
B00CUNVHEI|1|Bought these just to test them out with a balancer and it DID NOT work. Also if you plan on using these with your vehicle make sure you don't use it if your wheels have sensors.
B00WQ33PAQ|1|Looks like someone printed this off their home computer and put some sticky stuff on it. It's not even cut straight. Unclear image. This isn't like the decals in a PX
B00V43DP9A|5|Awesome little seat, fits my 4 year old daughter perfectly.  Safe, secure, solid.  Instructions are a joke, take your time and study the pictures.
B0013FSRR4|5|Thanks
B00HG0EDGY|5|Delivered on time. Super easy installation, just your basic plug & play. Old ignition coil and CDI box gave out... took forever to start and the throttle response wasn't the best. Then I threw these bad boys on there and it starts first kick & and has phenomenal throttle response. Very pleased
B005N6X9NG|3|Smaller than actual size
B004Z1J5VU|5|Fantastic Strut assembly! Bolted right on to my 96-00 honda civic. Ride was a bit high for about a week, but then it settled to its normal height. You can not beat this deal at this price.
B0042XI3D2|5|THESE LOW PROFILE FUSE MATCH MY CAR NISS MURANO .<br />CHECKED IN ENGINE COMPARTMENT MURANO NEEDS : 10A , 15A , 20A , 30A<br />THESE FUSE ARE PERFECT .

B007FHI3SW|5|Was a life saver .. mind you just had to change switch over the external regulators from the old one to the new one .. but thanks..works perfect
B009DJZCQQ|4|Fast delivery, no issues with the order at all.  The plastic is thinner than the OEM, but I dont anticipate that causing any problems.  A good test will be in the winter with snow and ice building up in the wheel wells.  I would buy it again if needed, ridiculous to pay over $40 for an OEM and then another $20 for shipping.
B006LF67KA|5|Great
B005H7DRQA|5|Great little kit to get you into taking care of leather goods. It also makes a nice little gift for those that have leather shoes that have been crying for some love for a while. Mind the long sentence, please, but it's necessary to drive home the point. It's easy to use this to breathe new life into some old sperry's or lay the foundation for some polish.<br /><br />I buy the larger pack &#34;Lexol 0923 Leather Care Kit with Sponges&#34; cause I have a lot of shoes (and some leather seats!).
B00TUNSOMO|4|A friend of mine just purchased sail boat.  She has it on beautiful lake Michigan and she is a really good sailor.  Of course, her boat was not brand new, so it required some cleaning up.  As we know woman's work is never done, so in addition to planning itineraries for weekend sailing plans and doing the actual sailing, she is also cleaning up the boat.  Anyway, the &#34;sail house&#34; as I call it is spic and span clean and shiny and this helpful cleaning wax will be used once sailing season in Midwest is over and boat is ready for storage over the winter months.<br /><br />So if you have a sail boat, this is a good wax to use.  And if you do not have a sail boat, it makes a good &#34;thank you&#34; gift for your friend that takes you out for a weekend sailing trip.  It also makes a practical sail-warming present (get it --&#34;housewarming/sailwarming&#34;..)
B000CK505S|5|Easy effective way to eliminate old power robing power steering.
B00062ZMDW|5|Great product, just what I needed. Thanks
B002LOP5IA|5|I have wheels on my car that are very hard to clean, and brake dust builds up on them within a week.  I've tried lots of different products from the local stores, and while they worked to get the grime, they didn't fit between the wheel and the brake caliper.  This meant I had to clean my wheels, get in my car, move it 2 feet forward, then clean my wheels again.  This brush is about 5 inches wide, but still does a great job getting into all the spaces, and cut down my wheel cleaning to about 10 min for all 4 wheels.  I just got it, so I'll have to see how the durability is, but it seems to have held up well so far.
B00ABKN6WI|2|Lenses keep falling out. The latches are a poor design! Don't waste your money.
B00APRSI6G|5|it works fine
B00BQHABMS|4|Everything I expected. Good product & price
B0002Q80GS|5|A+
B004IYC5HU|5|Cheaper than our local camping store by about $20. The product was easy to replace and the side wind features works well. We will post on the product next year to let you know how it has held up over time. Installation of the new jack was easy and took less than 15 minutes (once old jack was removed). Make sure to keep plate/screws from old jack to use with this jack.
B00JIHC36K|5|I care about visibility and I run my parking lights whenever my car is on, so I looked for some bright and reliable LEDs and found these. I replaced both the parking lights and the side marker lights and so far a couple of months in they've been going strong. They are extremely visible, even in daylight conditions and never feel too hot if you touch the headlight after operating them for a while. I highly recommend them if you're looking for some bright LEDs.
B00F2VB1TQ|4|excellent quality sheepskinI found the Velcro to be weak and will not hold properly. The sheepskin itself is outstanding give you the comfort that it should.
B007NIYA4Y|5|ty
B00RSOLXFM|4|I bought this being that I had probably a teaspoon of fish juice that went into my floor from some fresh fish fillets that I had in the back seat and the bag leaked, of course the next few days had a musty fish smell and has had the same smell for a week so I received this unit and have had it in the truck for 4 days now being that my cigarette lighter works when truck is off and there may be a slight improvement in odor but I would imagine that every day that goes by my truck should start smelling better anyway just with time. I cannot say there was any noticeable difference, I did check my truck 2 days after I put it in there and it smelled exactly the same. I think my truck is gradually smelling better after 4 days now but I cant say its from the ionizer or being that its been 4 days longer in time. I will update if smell completely goes away. Update: I just changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars being that my truck is odor free now, I do believe this worked being that there us zero smell now, I just think it's a small unit and takes longer. If it got the smell out sooner than 5 days then I'd give it a 5 star.
B00KRXVAH2|5|Oh my goodness this is so cute!  Package arrived vet fast.  Super impressed!
B0068MXNRQ|5|Works perfectly no issues
B00CS7ET9Q|1|It was cheesy and not what I expected.
B000C7WVS0|5|Perfect fit & finish, and now my '98 Cherokee (XJ) has intermittent wipers! Plug-n-play upgrade. Works for all 97-01 XJs, they're prewired for this. Also works on 97-00 Wrangler (TJ), same switch & prewired.
B009WW5TD0|4|This is a perfect fit for the front bumper of my 2008 Mazda 3. My only complaint is that the holder did not come with the nails needed to attach it to the bumper.
B00EFBF5O6|5|This decal is super cute!  As long as you're careful peeling off the backing, the decal will install perfectly.
B001G4Z5J0|4|It was just as advertised, easy to assemble.
B00HYIKEKW|5|I replaced my two handle shower faucit with this one and it works great. No more adjuting the hot and cold, just move it slightly and don't have to touch it again.
B00BFXSVM0|5|I needed a new fender after a small accident. I found this one with the same color as my car. The website has a few different colors and you can choose the one that matches your car. Perfect fit and it matches my car at a reasonable price.
B00PZ7U8M8|2|to big for my 96 Tacoma had to return it
B0031ZDU62|5|Got them fast and cheap!  Thanks
B000GU0P4A|4|Nice little tool, comes in handy.
B008WA8DOK|5|These look great.  Ir really dresses up the truck and protects the factory mirrors.  DON'T use harsh cleaners like they say- they're bad for the factory mirror plastic.
B000AS3D3S|5|It's a Motorcraft oil filter. The name speaks for itself. I can't say much more about it:) Buy Motorcraft if you value your Fords!
B004YTP11G|5|great
B00NGIE1TE|1|Does not fit a 2013 model
B000V2W0GE|5|came fast, worked fine
B00J65IQSS|5|Worked as advertised and did get alot of gunk out of the radiator in my wife's neglected Focus.  It worked so well in fact that the radiator sprung a leak after use, probably because the gunk was plugging a hole.  Not the products fault though, it worked well.
B002BEC1NC|4|ok
B000CSOO6Q|5|Perfect fit in my 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0L. Helped fix some of my idling issues. Took about 5 minutes to install.
B0042TK10E|5|I'm really pleased with this top. I had no trouble installing and currently have the windows stored in the top. Which is such a great feature.

B00DJ5KEF4|5|Xcellent
B001P4KKNM|5|Great grips, just as advertised. Smaller diameter than what I had but after a few rides feel normal. The quality is very apparent. Be careful in drilling the little dimple in your bars that hold the left grip from rotating.
B006R5LND0|5|Every trailer needs this!
B00B77NP3Y|5|Wonderful wheel covers
B000XETMW0|5|Great low profile chaser. Cleaned up the mangled downstream threads on my Subaru.
B000GZOL0O|4|Tricky to install. Not much room for error.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Not real sure what some of these other people did wrong with their cargo bag, but mine was perfect! I did a test run two days before my trip and it worked well. I stuffed it full and drove it from Columbus Ohio to Fayetteville West Virginia, and back. I have a 2015 Nissan Rouge, so the crossbars do not adjust. So the mat and the bag laid over top of the back crossbar, which left a little bit of space behind the back crossbar. The straps took a few seconds to figure out, but were manageable. I added a ratchet strap to the front just for added safety, but it was probably unnecessary. Very pleased with this product. I will try to post some pics soon.
B00XBCSXTO|5|They look great will buy again.
B00JQVS4DE|1|Won't stick to the visor, avoid at all cost
B00ELJMKHM|4|I like the fresh jasmine scent; it was very strong when I first opened the package and on the first few days I left it under the passenger seat of my SUV. After a few (hot summer) days I couldn't smell it anymore, but anyone else who got in my car or was even nearby when I opened the driver's side door could smell it, so I guess it's still working great! It's been a few weeks now and it still smells good to other people, although I don't notice it, I guess I'm just used to it! I also left a stone on top of the cat litter box, and occasionally I can smell jasmine. It seems to help with the litter smell a little.
B00BLAG3D6|5|great item fast shipper.
B00SXKULY4|5|It is the best i put it on my 1996 honda accord. Fits perfect.
B001F212OK|5|It does the job for my Airtail shocks.
B00008BKX5|5|Quick, easy way to carry our kayaks out to the lake.
B00V56U28I|5|I think I agree with all the good ratings posted here and its a perfect catch. Really does it work. I had mine in my toyota vios and I smell it working everytime I drive and I observed that dust is minimize. I had so much allergy before when im inside my car and now its gone. I think its because of Pure-O Ionic. Buy yours and see and feel the difference by yourself.
B009PDBOXU|2|Quite worn key case .battery slot screw loose. Picture looks better than real items.Need a lot of work and new case to reproduce new backup car remote key- reconsider .

B0006IBYOW|5|Does the job!
B004W92GA2|4|Too cute but it is very tiny
B004OHRVPM|5|Great product.
B00UZ4NG3E|5|The only way to go and avoid the high priced dealer filters every 15K
B00Z3MX5PM|5|I love this product,  makes the car really stand out above the rest.
B00XV7PXHO|5|This stuff is A.MAZ.ING. I used it on my leather steel-toe work boots. It repels water and keeps them from getting dried out from being in the sun all day. Most importantly, it is not oily AT ALL. I've tried other products that left a greasy coating, which caused my boots to collect dirt and dust. Getting that layer of grime off was more of a problem for me than anything else. So far, I have had no issues with stickiness.
B00RW7WTQ2|3|The wipers, clean o k. But It wouldn't work on one side. By being frameless  the arm didn't  put enough pressure on the blade to wipe clean so I put the old ones back.
B008OVH2FS|5|great deal
B00S2U6DWO|4|Easy installation once old knob came off. 4 stars for construction because the gunmetal finish is plastic. Also the plastic cover has released its grip at the bottom of the knob.
B006BAQ6Y2|5|awesome-programming worked!!!  You end up having to do your original again if in the car, but if it doesn't work with door closed just open the driver door.  It was th efirst time I was able to get one to program as directed...Really easy turn key 5-8 times and that's it, the locks go off...<br />remember some cars you might have to open driver door while doing it.
B0049DZYL4|5|EXACT FIT
B007VRAH62|5|I mounted it permanently on my 95 Miata. Looks great works great. Oil filled is great since it's under the hood... I also bought the aluminum, not plastic, adapter to go with it. (Mr. Gasket.) The mounting was not as easy as I thought since my old fuel lines were heavy duty and stiff. Fuel line removing tools are a plus. I would buy it again for my next project.
B008697KXC|5|Nice very Nice. Looks pretty and every one likes it too.
B004IZ89YM|5|For my 95 Miata project. Fits perfectly and works great.
B00KQ4ZMX0|5|It was pre-programed and worked instantly, when installed.
B009HC3QYY|5|great OE part for half the price of OEM BMW part
B002XL2XUE|4|Good fit but I think they wont last too long. The vinyl feels a little bit thin
B004VUQ7A2|5|Fit our Odyssey great and function as advertised.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Easy set up - very bright - perfect!
B005HBQ81C|5|Worked just as expected and for the price, good quality. It has a nice thick rubber insert and will stand up to lots of pressure.
B00IO32SW8|5|Came quickly and fit perfectly.
B000BUTD9S|4|seems nice, but I could not use: it was the wrong size.
B00D9C2CDO|4|We drove from PA to FL with this on our van and it held up perfectly. We drove in rain and the inside was perfectly dry. We did have a difficult time attaching and detaching so make sure you have at least 2 people to help with it.
B005FO1WJY|5|Makes it so much easier to back up and to pull into parking slips straighter.
B00JTXIL64|5|Like the rotors car stops on a dime now
B00LOS3HKC|1|Garbage!!!! Does not work with 2008 YZF R6. Readings start at 12 volts then gradually drops until bike starves for current.
B0040D0NZA|1|Not what the type of push on retainer the description made it sound like.
B00NAQUJ34|5|Very nice, worked great with harness.  Wiring perfect length for my Chevy 2500.
B0028R1IIG|5|Nice product.  Looks great on the back window of my car.  Nice to have a piece of art there.
B00HSM1MEG|5|fits my 14' chevy Silverado extended cab perfectly. Great product...
B001W19VT2|5|Works perfectly in my vehicle trunk.  Now my wine bottles and milk don't tip over!
B00AF3SS7O|5|Currently using these on the low beams of a '97 Grand Marquis. These do produce a very white with a touch of blue color and are toe to toe with other similar top of the line bulbs. If you're running a standard bulb and looking for something that's whiter or a bit brighter, try these. If you're looking for a quality bulb, this should fit the bill.
B001447KCM|5|Very strong and stable. I am a little over 200 lbs and it had no problem supporting my weight.
B001FANQJG|2|very hard to align. paint stripped. rusted. tossed in the garbage.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Been using 303 for a couple of years now.  Will never go back.
B00CPPF468|5|I bought this exhaust for my Honda CB500F after returning the Coffman Exhaust because it was deteriorating under normal use.  The Two Brothers exhaust is amazing and well worth the slightly higher price tag.  It sounds much better too - very deep.  I would not hesitate for a second to recommend anyone buy this unit.  Like other reviewers have stated and I agree, now people can hear you on the road which makes riding safer.  It doesn't require any modification in my opinion by way of sound.  One thing that is not apparent from the instructions is that you will be using the bracket that cradles the exhaust on the OUTSIDE of the rubber grommet.  Unlike how the stock exhaust counterpart attaches on each side of the grommet, this unit's mounting is on the right side of the grommet.  You'll notice right away if you've done it incorrectly because it will seem 'impossible' for the cradle/bracket to close.  Also, this seller ships super fast!
B000NW4PQA|5|2006 Saturn direct fit
B0089LSMSE|3|Original, but still a bit pricy.
B004I07IPI|5|What can you say about a rabbits foot? It's handy? What? It was a nice foot.
B000CO7IKO|5|FAST SHIPMENT; ITEM AS DESCRIBED. AAA
B004QEKGAA|5|I needed this so I don't have to take off the ball to attach my ice sled hitch. It works awesome. Can't wait for winter
B00829I0IK|5|This is the OEM unit that you would recieve from Toyota if you chose to purchase a water pump from your dealer. You will notice a ground down spot on the housing where the word &#34;TOYOTA&#34; had previously been. The gasket that comes with this kit is also top quality. You will not be disappointed with this product.
B008B5X5GC|4|One sensor was bad. Others worked fine. Reused one of my old ones.
B000XEGEWG|5|THESE ARE AWESOME!!!  I got a pack of these to use for household cleaning.  I put them in the washer and hang dry (don't add fabric softener.  Great for dusting, and I cut one of these into 3 to use with my swiffer wet-jet- it fits perfectly and sticks to it well.  I just throw in washer when done and they're ready to go!  I use these all over the house, and you can use different colors for different rooms chores- I use blue for floors and green for bathroom- then I know my bathroom clothes will not be used elsewhere!  They are great!
B0002JMF9I|5|The product was delivered on time and at the price advertised and it worked perfectly.  Any one reviewing this product should buy it because the vendor is top line and the product is very good.
B002ZTNVB4|4|Good product if you plan to get really messy, such as wet hobbies like, frequenting the beach, camping, snow skiing. &#60;&#62; Caveats: -  Don’t plan to get into your Stow-N-Go in-floor storage compartments, you will simply tear then up trying to force your way in. -  Super Console Access:  Expect to have someone push down the edge of the matt if you want to open it.  WeatherTech also has great Customer Service MADE IN USA
B002WHABF8|5|Perfect fit for the vehicle...
B000BQSIWK|1|The charger starts off fine but quits charging after 15- 20 minutes but indicates that the battery is charged. If unplugged and restarted it does the same thing. This charger will not charge a battery for more that a short period or raise the voltage more than a volt or two in the time that it runs.<br />I have new Ultima yellow top deep cycle battery - so I know it is not an issue with what I am trying to charge. I have tried it on another battery with the same result. Can you help me? I need a charger that works.
B00P73KWIU|5|As described.
B00CZF5HC4|5|I purchased a single from eBay as a test, and came to Amazon to buy mulitples. Make sure you are paying attention when ordering the *color* of the lights. Make sure you like the color and make sure you order all the same color! I accidentally ordered some different.<br /><br />These are some of the best quality LED replacement fixtures I have found...and for a really decent price.<br /><br />I have purchased (10) of these fixtures so far and am very very happy with the money spent. The color is natural, the brightness very high, and the energy usage is much lower than the old car bulbs that had been installed. I realize the car bulb is easily replaced and cheap, but use a ton of energy and get very hot!<br /><br />I'm going to install a few of these to replace my outside fixtures and see how they hold up to the environment.<br /><br />You will be very please if you purchase these!
B0055MKRGU|4|Works well, but is rather small. I didn't realize it fit in the door recess, not in the middle area. All in all, I like it. Easy to use, easy to empty, easy to keep clean.
B00PC0G07A|4|Great product. not quite wide enough to wrap my Jeep Cherokee steering wheel completely. Need another 1/4&#34; or so for wider steering wheels.
B00FX9U69I|5|This was what my jeep needed!
B0085FP6MY|5|These mirrors are nice. Fast shipping. Great price for what we received.
B00BAZC1SS|1|PINK IS NOT RED.
B00DF4AFRG|5|Fits perfectly and works great.  Solved some of my backfiring issues on my Honda Shadow VT750DC
B0057ZQJ12|5|Well described in listing, just what I expected it to be, fit my hookup situation
B0006302M2|5|I use this for our leather couch! Great product for keeping your leather looking new!
B004O44HMU|5|don't hesitate to  replace that smudgy,  yuk ee old winshield, take off the mirrors, 4 bolts, two screws and you too can see clearly again!  good service fine product,  pretty easy do it yourself project!  thanks
B009EU5ZM0|4|Works well, was a little liquidy but it not really a big deal
B005CDUX5C|5|Just like new, what more could you ask for...
B003TTV972|5|It's a VP racing jug. What more could you want? Maybe a side handle... but other than that its perfect.<br /><br />FYI - It does NOT come with the spout. You will need to order one seperate.
B002X1QV70|5|working great, i got what i expected and needed.
B00ODFO9HI|5|Great cargo net. Used it once so far for a camping trip. Loaded up truck, covered, cinched down-- beautiful. My friends were impressed with  the security it offered. Well made and convenient. Wish it came with additional straps however.
B00IWTJ96M|5|Fits perfectly! First class vendor would highly recommend?
B00MK2P2PY|5|as advertised
B00UOBEYAC|1|DO NOT PURCHASE WITH HEADER!!!! The header didn't even come close to fitting!!! The lower header tubes hit the oil pan and don't line up with the rest of the exhaust there for you can't use the rest of the exhaust pipe except for the axel back and muffler due to non oem flange locations and o2 sensor placement. Now besides the fitment issue the construction of the system from the test pipe back is excellent. The muffler is a little off but nothing that can't be modified to work. I was given a partial refund but that does nothing for my exhaust that I will now have to go to a shop, which I was trying to avoid in the first place, to get with the header fixed or buy a new header and still have to go to a shop to get an extension made. Not happy with this purchase.
B0043RYTNK|3|If you rub too hard, dulls color on seats (black)
B0080PBLPU|5|Great quality ...built well
B0065S6S8Y|5|Next time I'll buy 2 and keep the extra around for emergencies
B00NMWAH9M|5|the only problem was it should have been white and a red helmet came in the box. the box was marked for a white helmet. was not easy to put my scala rider system on it
B00U1L1ADO|4|Turn signal switch works fine.
B00FYNX7AS|4|OK
B00A8PD7HK|5|Excellent. Fast shipping great product.
B002HSSB5E|5|I really like when a product is an exact replacement item, especially when advertised as such.  This starter matches the OEM size and mounting points exactly, making it a direct and easy fit.  I don't expect it to last the 18 years the original one did, but for the price if it lasts 3-4 years it will be well worth it considering what Honda wants for a starter. Good job.
B0047CIN42|2|ok
B000WK4B5I|5|What is there to say, super convenient and easy to use. Only bummer is if you want to use the goggles for snowboarding you have to re-strap it with your factory strap...then back again for your next moto ride.
B00SZK1420|5|There exactly what they said they were
B002ZTK72U|5|Instructions were a little weak but the product is high quality and fit perfectly.
B003VLBPJA|2|It's a stretchy net... with hooks!
B000JK2D06|5|This stuff is amazing!  I just waxed my Rav4 in about 30-45 minutes.  You have to be sure to let it warm up......I put it in a bowl of hot water until I was ready for it.....so that it is liquid, then shake, shake, shake.  Also, put it on very thin.  One drop goes a very long way.  I was able to put the wax on half of my car, and then apply to the other half while I was waiting for the first side to dry.  It wipes right off with no streaking.  I used a small round sponge applicator to apply and then wiped off with a microfiber towel.  So easy and my car looks amazing.
B00RUDWQIO|5|Great mirrors for the price the same exact mirrors at Harley were $100.00 here in Phoenix AZ
B001TI5IIQ|1|Didn't work at all very disappointed
B00186NGHO|5|Easy installation,received in great shape,look great
B000VKTULY|5|Perfect!
B000PGVZ30|5|Outstanding quality. One thing to keep in mind. It would be best to use wire that has the ground wire insulated, otherwise you will need to wrap the ground wire with electrical tape because it travels very close to the hot lead.
B000C2Q24E|5|Nice product,perfect fit...
B00H8ZWN1E|5|Awesome product for the price! I recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable electronic boost controller!
B007Q1MLOO|5|Exactly what I had expected.
B002U6WX0M|5|the flange made it much easier to weld to the pipe
B00A8MZ7IA|5|Great deal on a big bag of microfiber cloths.
B0049J9KCW|5|Ordered this for my 1997 Toyota Camry as my entire exhaust system was severely rusted after 304,000 miles and 18 years of service. Basically, I just unbolted the old exhaust from the manifold ( which had some seriously rusted bolts that took some major force to get off ) and took it off all of the hangers. Then, all I did was re-bolt this catalytic converter on, as well as putting the other Walker resonator & muffler on, and now the car is quieter than ever. My car sounded like a tank before, but now it's so quiet that I can barely hear if it's running. I bought this as well as the Walker 18903 SoundFX muffler, and the Walker Exhaust Resonator and they fit together absolutely beautifully on my Camry. So if you need an exhaust replacement on your Camry, definitely consider buying this piece, as well as the rest, and save a lot of money doing it yourself!<br /><br />Oh, and be sure to buy some bolts for the exhaust/catalytic converter. Only used a gasket on the manifold-to-exhaust/cat part and there are no leaks in the rest of the system, so one probably doesn't need any extra gaskets.<br /><br />Links to other parts for entire exhaust:<br /><br />Resonator Assembly<br />http://www.amazon.com/Walker-48319-Exhaust-Resonator-DF-Assy/dp/B000C91ETA/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1438726365&vehicle=1997-76-1011-269--1-6-5-4851-1775-1-1-1904--2-0&sr=1-1&ymm=1997%3Atoyota%3Acamry&keywords=resonator<br /><br />SoundFX Muffler<br />http://www.amazon.com/Walker-18903-SoundFX-Muffler/dp/B0049J8V2W/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1438726544&vehicle=1997-76-1011-269--1-6-5-4851-1775-1-1-1904--2-0&sr=1-1&ymm=1997%3Atoyota%3Acamry&keywords=muffler

B007HRLGG6|5|great buy
B003LSJJJ6|4|They do fog as will all goggles while riding but they are comfortable and work well
B005O01N8E|5|Worked great . Easy to install
B0019FEM9K|5|Boots performed well and kept my feet nice and dry.  The only drawback that I see is that the soles of these boot are a bit slick when walking.
B002JBDH26|5|Save me a lot and it's metal instead of baked plastic.<br />Odd thing is, Amazon says it doesn't fit my wife's Sequoia, but it does!
B000BQP4J0|4|Very nice, but the lip toward the liftgate sticks up and catches packages, etc. even so, I'm happy I bought it
B00K0TOYJE|5|I ordered this to clamp the cv joint repair kit I ordered but went with a new cv axle instead. Then I needed it to do a tie rod boot and it worked great. Glad I purchased this crimper.
B004HCM9H4|4|Good stuff for in between waxes. easy on easy off.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|A great backup to carry on a motorcycle.
B0031XFGV6|5|good buy ty
B00FM1CKK0|5|I really like this little chandelier, gives that girly touch to my Jeep Wrangler! If you're on the fence, just buy it, it's not like it costs a fortune and you'll be happy you did!
B000C5DIT8|5|Perfect. Fit my 1998 Ford Windstar 3.0l V 6. Had an eng lite on with a PO 133 code. Bank 1 Sens 1 O2 sensor not reading correctly. Ford part.  Ford Part#.
B008MC8JK6|5|Perfect OEM fit. comes with light bulbs and wiring harness.
B003Q3GQYW|5|Quality part
B0064FXCDW|5|Lasted 15 months when on while driving for about 11 months.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Works great at a fraction of the price of other products.
B002HIBMGE|5|Really is a nice helmet.
B0040YQXK8|4|Worked great.. perfect fit
B001EEWBI0|5|Installed it today.  Fit my 2004 Tahoe perfectly.
B006WB3JIQ|5|Work great for my spray bottles.
B000BQW5LK|4|Works great as a pump! Doesn't fit a quart size Motul 300 Gear Lube bottle, but I wasn't surprised by that.
B00CXY32QA|5|Easy to install and worked fine.  Dealer wanted $140 to install.
B003D1SQD6|5|Fit my crosstour.  Would buy again.
B003R2YLLC|5|Perfect!
B0082AOCEK|5|This looks awesome on our truck
B003O79D54|5|Bright enough and my stock KTM 525 can run the large light without changing the charging system. At idle, the bike cannot run both lights, so I only use the lower/larger light.
B00OKOJC3S|5|Perfect fit in my '15 Fiesta Hatchback with the 1.0 Ecoboost option (SFE).  The rear mats could extend under the front seat a few more inches to give better coverage but whatevers.  A huge savings over dealership pricing for the exact same mats.
B00863KYDG|5|Make my dash look a hell of alot better without the cracks.
B00XKQUE16|5|Works well
B00LMHC8D2|3|battery came with different markings but seems to work for now.
B00X9WSNTQ|1|Do not buy, ballasts only lasted 2 months before the started to flicker and quit working.
B004A30UHG|5|Fixed our problem!
B009D3E36W|3|work ok, but in grand retrospect I will pay to have this done next time.
B008Y9K0OU|5|Perfect fit. Still staying on strong with no cracks
B00TYMVQRG|5|I ordered a second pair 8 months later so I use one for working outside and one for driving. I love the side windows, wrap around (dust protection), and the amber lens. I think these are an excellent value for sunglasses under $20. 8 month wear shows minimal scratches.
B0009IK4SG|4|The metal rails of the refills did not fit the clips of the wiper arm; they were too wide. To the best of my knowledge the old wiper arms (and clips) were stock original (1996 Chevy 1500). It was necessary to separate the rubber part of the refill and insert it in the metal rails of the old wipers, then insert this combination through the wiper arm clips and discard the new metal rails. Other than this problem, they appear work just fine.
B006M3IMZY|5|Perfect fit for my car & so glad it saved my carpeted floor in winter. Nonetheless it will serve you better if you drain water (melted ice) every now and then.
B0000AZ53A|5|just what boat needed
B00C564LI4|5|These were used to identify the bedrooms in our cabin.  My husband wrote the name of each room on the plate then we hung them over th doors.  It's perfect - now we can tell family and friends which room they are staying in.  It was a great match for what we needed.
B00977GPA6|3|It's okay and after few months on the sun it's started fading
B003ZJOIB0|5|I purchased this product for a transmission fluid change on a Porsche 996. It worked flawlessly. No spills and it transfers oil fast. I recommend filling the tank with a little extra fluid, then measure the amount needed from the scale on the tank.
B004RCOUP8|5|Great product, very easy to attach and the hose doesn't kink. Nuff said.
B00P9EJGR0|5|Absolutely fabulous.  Lots of grandkids in my car and will be wonderful....NO MORE MUDDY SEATS!!!!
B00Y5LSCXW|5|Exactly what I wanted.<br />Look nice on my wheels!
B00KWNULFO|5|Easy to install and looks great.
B00PILDZ2Q|5|great thanks!
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Super Bright and amazing for the price. I turn these on and it lights up everything in front of me. Very happy with these lights.
B00D8LA0SK|4|It's a good fit and looks nice on the hitch. My only issue was that there is a small imperfection on the face of the Carbon Fiber. You see the imperfection unless you look really closely but when you hold the cover in your hand, it really stands out.
B00DP7NSX6|4|Only reason for 4 instead of 5 was it took a little longer than expected.
B00EF64XZI|1|It has been 4 months since I've been trying to get this thing to activate on the app and still no luck.  I've tried reinstalling the app, using a different phone and still nothing.  The app is faulty and has glitches with activation.  You may be lucky with activating that. I wasn't
B001W9OP86|2|Very thin material, hard to understand how thin unless you feel it yourself which is why they probably sell better online than in person.. Don't expect them to last long.
B00FW1DRZC|5|Great product for great price.
B0036SUYSQ|4|A little bulkier than I expected, but it will make a nice winter rainsuit
B00158SFNK|1|Cords melt, blows all outlet fuses rekentkessly. Might last a week at the most on this truck. Cascadia
B00CJ13A5A|5|Great product, great price
B0001EXKO8|5|Perfect fit great shipping looks killer
B00KPQYV0E|5|First Class spare tire system for getting the spare tire off the back bumper for looks and not dragging the ground every time I pull out of a stores parking lot that has a swell out to the street.
B001GJ3E5C|5|Not for delicate fibers
B00G0P0GHQ|4|Works great
B00KLKR33Q|4|Great condition
B008KM81E2|5|The best wax I have ever used by far!! Love this product and will only buy this from now on!!!
B00TVWFOQS|5|The first order that I received, one of the LEDs was not working correctly, however the seller promptly sent me a new pair the next day. After testing out the new pair, they were better than expected. Before I had the old LED tower bulbs. Those were ok and you could not tell if you were signaling. These, they are obvious that you are signaling. When you have the day time running lights one, it will shine white. Then when you signal, it will only flash Amber to signify that you are signaling.
B00KTJ8D38|4|Great! Just what I needed and the dealer ended up programming for free. Would have been 5 stars but the battery was installed backwards on one of the remotes.
B006LIYZ4M|2|Easy plug and play install, from the time I installed instantly one bulb was only half as bright as the other, had the kit two weeks and burnt up a ballast. The color was accurate to the description but the quality was very poor.
B00IHZ0FNC|5|Good fit, actually fit back in pouch when put away.
B008VN1BLA|1|Bought it Feb 2015, I need to replace it already.. can't believe I can't return it or get my money back!!
B00PKKHQZW|5|installs easily and works very well
B006RYVULG|5|I am very pleased. Great product & they fit my 08 maxima. Thanks Amazon
B00MAI0KUU|1|WOULD NOT PICKUP. LIGHT IS TO DIM. IT DOESN'T PUT OUT THE LIGHT AS ADVERTISED. WHEN I GAVE IT A BAD RAP THE CALLED ME GIVING ME A HARD TIME ABOUT THE RATING, BUT STILL REFUSED TO SEND A RETURN LABEL. IT'S ONLY $20.00 SO I WILL CHALK IT UP TO A BAD EXPERIENCE............
B00Y5GQJ9Q|5|I have a 2005 Nissan Altima 2.5S. I was averaging 27mpg before I installed this device in my intake hosing, and now I am averaging 38mpg. I did not change anything else nor did I change my driving style. Very good item!
B005RJ3GBE|4|OK
B00WDSVEE8|5|Almost perfect. It fits my lenses closely with matching dimensions and is lightweight, though it could have a wider nose bridge. Its flip-up mechanism is sure and tight.<br /><br />I went all over and could only find an ill fitting pair from a street vendor (stores don't carry clip ons, even big sunglass and eyeglass specialty stores) and I appreciate finding it at all and at a reasonable price.
B00DSD7GJE|5|Good quality.  Looks exactly the way it did online.  It's been through quite a few car washes & still hanging on.
B009IF2HMW|5|Worked perfectly on my 2006 Trailblazer 4.6L . Fan speed 4 and 5 had gone and this little piece of kit solves the problem.
B0033C15I8|5|Awesome oem product, and received it early to boot. Awesome seller, totally satisfied!!
B000CK9NGA|5|Quick shipping. Fit my old 97 RAV perfectly.
B00TEFU8HC|5|Worked great!
B00IKEVI86|5|Love them  put them on my 1980xj 650 did had to modify them for my cruise control
B00OBGQUVM|1|Uncomfortable and get dirty quickly
B00KGPB9DQ|5|Had a problem with my original harness and this one solved the problem
B001DH8204|5|Was wondering why my vents smelled like cat pee, which made sense when I saw the condition of my old filter. This was a perfect fit for my 2004 Forester X.
B000C8Y1UK|1|These are junk do not buy these you will be very sorry if you do. You can barely see 10 feet in front of you with the high beams on. I all four of these months ago and just put them in yesterday and I wish I never got them. One star for quick shipping
B00E5OUOCQ|3|The windshield works as advertised. It fits my Mazda CX-5, using the car's shades to hold it up. It folds up compact and does keep my car pretty cool when it's hot outside, but I wish it were a little sturdier. It works good enough for the cost, so I'm still pretty satisfied. May get an upgrade if I come across a better one.
B00KTHVM2O|5|Worked great.  Easy to transfer electronic circuit board from the old one.
B006B7ZJUC|5|This is a very well designed and quality built exhaust. The fit and finish are perfect, I Installed this with help of my wife. This exhaust looks like you could angle the rear section of pipes to come out each side behind the tires or strait out the back like we installed it. You won't find a better exhaust for this price.
B00ECXSZCG|5|Good Quality, material is great and looks good on rear window of my truck.
B00GWITOTW|5|great tank....looks good and holds air as it shood....
B008AFO850|5|Excellent
B000C8PCG2|5|Exactly what I was looking for.
B003LRFT32|5|works great
B00L4TF32G|5|Works great. Very easy to apply.
B00XB8GING|5|Great lights for the price. 3 times brighter than comparable products I have purchased. Heavy metal case. Used them for 2 weeks on my semi truck....until I hit a deer at 65mph. Both lights were hit and lenses and cases didn't even crack. Unfortunately, 3 of the leds in one light quit from the hit, but they are tough. Truck suffered major damage. I've already ordered another set.
B00GRHSU5C|4|doesn't align exactly but does it jobs very well.
B008G5AA7E|5|item is new
B007CDYWSE|5|Fits perfectly, materials looks above the OEM standards
B001S7URFW|4|Fits as advertised , molex  side a bit flimsy but it can be strengthen with heat shrink. Using it for permanent install with a innovate mtx-l and a adaptronics ecu which uses a serial interface
B00I548S2K|5|I hate instructions and this thankfully came with very few. I was still not going to be bothered to read them and it turned out to be pretty intuitive so probably less than 20 minutes later my truck has the much needed balance of these runners. They look great and I've jumped up and down on them. Beautimous! 2011 tacoma 4 door.
B0073WEZU4|5|I was worried about buying the antenna when I read the reviews but I figured what the heck let's give it a try and I am very pleased. I do live in a major city so that might help with the reception but I can't tell a difference between the stubby and my old antenna. Works great and looks amazing!
B000JWMHDC|5|Great price
B001C6Q8M0|5|My husband loved it! Fairly easy to put together, works really well
B000EQR710|5|Worked great and easy to install.
B001DRLQ2U|5|Works great. Quality filter at a reasonable price.
B002XJNIOG|1|My decal did not look like this.  It had a clear plastic rectangular strip around it that was clearly seen on the rear window ....you could tell is was just  a sticker.  I liked the design, but not the actual product....I put in on my rear window and took it off almost immediately.  They need to just display the Semper Fi....not the clear plastic border.
B00N9HM0ZY|5|its well made same as OEM I was really pleased when it arrived as fast as it did I have zero complaints
B007N6PPQS|1|I ordered this steering &#34;dampener&#34; to replace the stock GM stablizer on a 2009 Hummer H2.<br />Unfortunately, this stabilizer is positively charged as rvdan stated. My vehicle pulls to the right significantly. I have to keep my hands on the steering wheel at all times. If I don't, the vehicle will drift to the right & off the road, even if I let go of the steering wheel while it is turned to the left. The vehicle does not do this with other dampeners. As well, the vehicle shook more & there was less precision than with the worn out stock dampener or even running without one at all.  I am running 17x9 wheels with 35x12.5r17 BFG TA KO2 tires, in case anyone wanted to know.<br /><br />I contacted Bilstein & was told nothing but nonsense about how the &#34;dampener&#34; functions, even though my vehicle steers to the right constantly. Their opinion is that it's overcharged, but claim they have had maybe 5 to 10 total calls about shock quality. Yeah, right... Speaking on the phone for longer than a minute revealed that the techs don't know why it's positively charged & couldn't explain why a shock is in place of a dampener. The tech I spoke to stated that it is more or less shock & this seems true, since it will expand like a rocket.<br /><br />I ended up replacing it with a Rancho RS5407. The fitment was slightly tight, but works fine & performs as designed.<br /><br />I'll never buy another Bilstein. There's better brands out there anyways...
B0070Y37BI|5|Even better than expected! Very high quality, looks awesome!!
B004UPZXQM|5|Excellent product!!!
B0097SUH40|5|Good quality accessories with plenty of room in bag for other items.
B004VRO19Y|5|Heavy duty, durable extensions. Easy to install and makes filling your inner tires easy. I installed a tire pressure monitoring system on the valve ends, and they work perfectly.
B000OCDYWK|5|Good buy.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works just as you would expect. I previously ordered the cheaper version from the same site, and that one did not work. I really like that this one comes with setup instructions, which are very easy to read and follow. I would recommend giving up the extra cash and just ordering this unit to avoid headaches.<br /><br />On a side note, I know the instructions mention the Torque app on the play store, but I really think its worth purchasing the TouchScan app which seems to deliver way more information, and even maps it out for you.
B006JVFO5K|5|Got the item, Thanks
B000UIO3YQ|5|Light weight, seems cheap but working great!
B000UUMM6K|5|Very easy to install.... keeps all rain out... and allows to leave the vent open.
B001G63JQE|5|exactly what was needed!
B0050HGZC0|5|While I'm not happy that I actually have to have one of these now, this is the easiest method to hang the placard that I have found. Having experienced the ones with the plastic notch to hang with my mother's placard, and how many times she's had to replace the holder because each holder simply was not robust enough to stand the heat build-up, I didn't want to go through that.<br /><br />The magnet is very strong and this holder does the job nicely.
B00JGJGLMM|5|great quality
B0068BZOY2|4|As good as stock KTM part.
B00H0E6TTU|3|just ordered mine lets see how it is
B00JEMTEW0|5|love this sticker
B000VKOD9S|5|Does the job an dis much better than paying $30 for my dealership to do it! An easy DIY fix as long as you are willing to empty out and your glove box to get to the filter tray that lies behind it!
B006GJYOL0|5|used it for years great stuff if you own a boat
B00650NY6G|5|Easy to apply, protects paint. This won't serve as a bump guard for other car doors, but will prevent chipping your paint if you swing the door too wide.
B000C543WY|5|Purchased the ball joints to install myself. As you could imagine, removing the old ones took some time and effort as they were original with the vehicle. Everything seemed to be a very tight fit. Make sure you clean the control arms thoroughly to make your life easier as the ball joints will then sit true when pressing. Rubber boots took some time to get on as well (found they were too small). Spend some time working them on safely and eventually they will fit snuggly. All in all, the product itself is good and for a good price. Will update if anything fails.
B000BOAX1G|3|I much prefer the flush mount blind spot mirrors. These are angled and will swivel 360 degrees but they really just need to be straight flush.
B00K8EM9CU|5|Exactly what I needed! Fast shipping!!
B005H2SHS8|5|This is the real oil, real s***. A German high quality car deserves the best. I had many German cars and never a problem with them while in my hands. this oil goes all the way and lubricates the watch quality metals.
B0072VYSJE|5|Perfect fit ...
B0092P19T0|5|I have bought 3 different sets and all fit great .
B001D6GYLO|5|Still have not used it yet.  I will be mounting this to a trailer to recharge interior battery and lights.
B0009TU57A|5|Was just what I needed.
B00VA1Q98U|1|Doesn't work at all and the program they sent is garbage and doesn't work either!!
B000CIPUR8|4|Well I had a check engine light on, took it to a shop, they ran the code and it came back as an O2 Sensor code. They recommended this stuff, I bought 2 bottles to be on the safe side, due to some peoples reviews...and I emptied one bottle into my gas tank just after filling it full with fuel. I let it sit for about a half hour, and when I started the car the check engine light was off. I've driving the car all day, probably about 50 miles or so and its still off. When I run low on gas again, I will probably repeat the same process again but yeah, so far so good.<br /><br />I would certainly say had I had an inspection I needed to pass, it would have...I'm kind of hoping it just cleans the O2 sensor out enough to just make it function better. We shall see!
B0002NYBC8|5|ALL GOOD
B008FYKV4I|3|These worked as wipers. I'm not a fan of the dot that fades after a certain time to tell me when I should replace it though.
B00EIBL7RW|5|Exactly what I ordered! Great item!!
B00I3RL1A0|5|It worked for my audi.  Did both back and front brake pads.  Simple to use, solid quality.  Save me a lot dough on labor costs.  Brakes are not that hard to do, and shops charge a fortune to do them.  Save yourself time, and money. Buy this and do it yourself.
B00488B2AM|4|I love it so much, my only suggestion would be maybe include instructions for installation.  This was the first time I've ever used one and had to figure it out on my own, not that it was rocket science but a little guidance would have been nice :)  Overall it's beautiful and looks great!!!!  It arrived super fast too!
B0049E3HHG|5|Works as intended to
B00KTJ1VNM|1|Did not work. Sent back but no reply yet.
B0073WGQG0|4|looked just like orginal, but found out I did not need it, so kept it for extra part
B00LP7TZB2|2|Sadly, the screws that came with the fasteners were the wrong size. They were way too big to fit in the screw holes of the license plate holder. They issued me a &#34;partial&#34; refund. I was disappointed.
B00MQ1BNHU|4|Works really well.
B00CD7DX16|5|Came on time and as described
B00NS6W6A0|5|Gr8 struts for the price I paid. A very gud investment.
B000W3RU9Y|1|Not Industrial grade by my standards.  I used these bungey chords to hang a 9 x 15 sun shade sail across my patio and the first twenty five mile an hour wind destroyed three of them.  The internal rubber separated and all that was left was the small nylon center holding it.  Obviously I'm not very pleased with this product.
B0019AI6RO|3|They look great but aren't terribly functional.<br /><br />I've adjusted them to their smallest setting and they're still loose on my head. The padding around them doesn't mold around the face well and they actually push them up and around my eyes. They constantly fog up despite the air holes to the side. The convex nature of the lenses and their off sizes mean that you are screwed if you try to replace the lenses with better ones. They also let snow in when used in wintry weather.<br /><br />TL;DR: They look good but aren't really great at being goggles. Spend a little more to get a better pair.
B001TXMOW4|5|Great little tool kit!  I'll need to add a few specifics, but overall a great start!
B00MOR4DEQ|5|really good led lights the have lasted a long time, really bright lights
B00HCVRPY4|1|I don't know if this was supposed to be screwed in, or glued in, but it keeps falling apart. It's useless.
B00MNAEPV0|3|They work fine, but I do not suggest using these for day time running lights on turn signals. It is barely noticible if you are signaling since it goes from bright to slightly brighter.
B00RHSEYG4|3|These covers are very flimsy and when you change the A/C filter you have to be very careful. I broke the one that came with our travel trailer and this is the replacement. Unfortunately it is the same flimsy plastic. It is exactly what I needed and arrived on time!
B0087XOTWW|1|These are not bright at all. I replaced with these for my halogen in my landscape lighting and had to go and check if they were on all which they were but with no noticeable light.
B00Q7K3SZ6|5|Love it..classy looking and the writing perfectly centered!!
B00DSD5XJO|4|Maybe not quite as nice as it appears in the picture, but it's decent. Since it was a bit hard to find for me, I'd probably buy it again for four bucks.
B000E4JLM0|4|It's a good purchase
B004J9HEWK|5|a quick and easy fix for my 2011 suburban tailgate failure. dealer cost to fix was $180. DIY was a 15 minute fix. note having a friend to hold the gate up while you work makes this job much easier and safer. 3 months into the repair and i have had no issues.
B00THH9I7I|5|I have had one of these gauges for perhaps 10 years.  I have found it to be durable and accurate.  I use this for both my one ton truck and RV.  The RV runs at 110 psi and this unit has performed very well.  The unit that I have continues to work great.<br /><br />Recently I saw the &#34;two pack&#34; available.  The price is inexpensive.  So I bought it to give one to my wife and the other to one of the kids.<br /><br />I live in an area with pretty extreme temperatures, mostly low temperatures and severe winter conditions.  I have left my gauge in the truck at all times and sub zero temperatures have not impacted its use.<br /><br />For my application, this is a 5-Star unit.  I have not had any of the problems that others have stated in their reviews.
B00T2RE1Y8|4|I got the red ones for my red Honda Civic hatchback. So far so good. Looks great at night!!!
B00LK9NZV6|5|Super fit and durably effective. I love these seat covers.
B008L0CWNY|1|Decent product, but when I called Ready Lift's Customer Support line for installation questions I received zero help.  Zero.  Turned out to be the wrong fitment for my truck, even though I had the &#34;tow Package&#34;.  Vague website definitions led to the mistake.  I asked if they would ship me the right one because I already had my truck torn apart.  Said I had to return the whole kit to the supplier.  Don't worry about their warranty period, this company won't be around much longer with this level of customer support.  Fail.
B00077WEN2|5|Great Fit and a Great American Product!
B00803NSKI|5|Great computer!  Very easy to install and works flawlessly.  It has the right information for an aftermarket computer.  I would recommend the protective case as the plastic mounts really suck (I can't believe trail tech even uses them with such a great computer.  They just cheapen the product).  I highly recommend this product -- you will not be disappointed.
B00BTLEIIY|1|this cover must be assembled carefully I almost break the material is very weak
B000GZV25G|5|Great price, fast shipping
B000E4LWDG|4|worked as advertised, easy installation
B009IFIKAA|5|Took 20 seconds to replace my broken mirror.
B004L036Q0|1|Crap product they burned up
B000CIT2LS|5|Best bang for the buck exhaust out there!
B000CPJJSC|5|Verygood
B002FMYXYU|1|This had design flaws. The connection between pump and tubing was not tight so I had difficulty getting the flow started and once I did it leaked all over the floor. I threw it out.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|I purchased these lights originally for my Polaris RZR to mount on the roll bar to use as side fills. I ended up mounting them on my brushed aluminum bumper and aiming them to the sides to fill in with my CREE 24&#34; light bar ( actually the light bar is just 21&#34; and mounting brackets make it 24&#34;). They work well but I am thinking of finding some floods the next time. The lights have worked well through dry & rainy conditions with some mud action. Worth the price if you are looking for spots.
B009NQ8JLE|5|Great fit!
B001C6N724|5|Perfect fit
B001EYHK8G|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Should last my lifetime.
B001C6Q8PM|5|Worked just fine. Not loose at all. Some have said theirs was loose. It just needs to be installed properly. It should come with a light bulb but it doesn't.
B00E1SMCXK|5|They  worked better than expected and are very quiet.Would recommend to anybody that needs brakes to get this brand!
B0007XXTVC|5|Bought as spares. Priced right!
B000COCRJ6|1|wrong order I need for a Ford  and I received for Chevrolet.
B00LFL75DI|5|Great part. Fit perfectly and works great. Loved being able to search my car to find that the part was an exact fit.
B00S70V34C|5|Fine
B00WSKA8G6|4|12mm hole, 16mm flush mount. Good looking switches.
B00496RE82|2|ordered 4 of these to use in my shop.  One used on a kaw Mule lasted mabe a week, used the 2nd one and it pumped 15 or 20 sec. then quit. Now have 2 tied in series to get fuel pumped 3 ft.  Used up my 3 pumps just to get one to run.  Bought because of the price,  Oreilly gets $50.00 for these and I have not had much luck with them either.  Use on lawn mowers, Mini trks, tractors and hot rods have had my share of problems with these.
B0002NIJ8K|5|These came on time, look great! They are the exact size of the oem emblems on our Focus. However, I used them on my riding mower.
B00132CG4M|3|This lift is NOT universal. Study the photo and description carefully before buying. I had to make extensive modifications to my trailer, because the sides are tall and mounting to the top rail was not an option. The angles would have been all wrong for the lift mechanism to work. This lift is great for a,trailer configured exactly as the one in the picture. Otherwise count on many hours of drilling, fabricating and welding mounting brackets, etc. my tailgate, though heavy, is only about 30 inches tall, so through trial and error I am only using the smaller spring. This was after calling tech support.
B000CO7PPW|1|These things are useless for vehicles with sun/moon roofs.  There is only a thin layer of foam with which to work.  You then run into a hard back that these will not penetrate.
B00UNG3EXQ|5|Good product and was shipped quickly.
B000E2CO9Y|5|Came fast and looks good!
B0006N5RW2|5|Nice for the price.
B00445L290|3|I wish I had gotten a battery powered. It does a good job cleaning most everywhere. But cord makes it a bit awkward.
B0028OLI3E|4|Excellent tool no more pinched knuckles belles, and the best part of easily riveting with one normal sized hand with ease even my 6 years old can do it but with two hands.
B004I3VY32|4|Great product for the price have used it a couple times and works awesome.
B00BE5JLS2|5|Product was cheap and fit perfect worked absolutely great im happy...
B00HYU4QLS|4|looks good over all but some of the pieces didnt fit soni didnt even use them
B001PWA0IO|5|The best product ever. I'm glad they started putting these on new models from the factory
B008BVZMGW|1|did not work
B000O51VJ0|5|Works great for camping when there are fire restriction!
B006MX8196|4|Love them, but we aware that you have to cut your own seat belt and head rest holes and if you pull too hard the straps will break.  They are a huge pain to put in but once they are in they look great. I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend them to others.
B00RBG2YQE|5|This hitch was easy to install and it looks very nice.  I installed it on a 2015 Subaru Forester XT.  This model has a dual exhaust system.  The hitch appears to be designed for a single exhaust since it has a notch on only one side that makes it easier to fit around the muffler hanger.  That said, I was still able to maneuver it into place.  It would have been a little easier if there were notches on both sides.
B000WOB4AY|5|No review
B007ZLEX00|5|Great jacket! Soft but rugged leather... looks worn but not ratty. Beautiful craftsmanship at a great price point! I'm very happy with this jacket!
B00PZTYASE|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium. Goes on easily and looks great.
B006IDFZMQ|4|Works and looks great, fit perfect. Exactly what I was looking for with an integrated taillight and blinker system.  Arrived two days before it predicted on Amazon.  Was missing the sub harness when received but seller responded quickly and professionally to my issue.  I fitted it to my bike and tested the lights and every worked great, but I can't permanently instal without the sub harness. Only reason for not being a 5 star transaction was the missing sub harness. I will update review once I get the sub harness and hook it up.
B00BEN1QQY|5|worked great
B00GWYUOE0|4|So far the product itself seems like it's well made. The fit is perfect.  I don't really feel that great of a difference in the temperature inside the car, but I mainly want to protect the dashboard from the sun.  There's a side effect to it's use on my car, a Nissan Altima 2014, the visor reflects all the heat back onto the windshield and it got so hot that my rear view mirror fell off!  The rearview mirror was scalding hot along with the area on the windshield where it was attached.  So, I'm waiting to see if this will continue.  I'm in Texas so it gets real hot down here.
B005O2ZUDQ|5|Just what i was looking for. Perfect visor for my HJC CL-16 Green.
B003S8EGUQ|4|Perfect and cheap
B001KSCEZU|2|Did not fit my 02 Honda civic si Hatchback ep3, had to take the glass to a mom/pop window housing shop where they made the proper cuts for the fit. glass is curved to it will be difficult for actual window car shop to cut with slight risk of cracking.
B00ICSWGJ0|5|Great product and price
B0026686V6|4|Mirror replacement took me 5 mins, just be careful not to drop nuts to inside of the door. I did that and had to buy extra nuts because i didnt feel like removing door panel. Replacement mirror is little darker than the original one and it vibrates while driving. Other then that is perfect. For 35 bucks cant beat it.
B00400EWT6|5|Works well and helps keep out debris and water if your into mudding and all that fun stuff
B000765MHI|5|Was very satisfied with the prompt service and of course with the Product will use them again and will recommend to others.
B005N6X9IQ|2|Runs really small.
B00429NKWK|2|Really 4 1/2 stars as the product performed as described. Took off 1/2 star as the protective glove provided may fit a small child and I accidently got some of the sealant on my hand and had a reaction to it. Overall very satisfied with the end result. Took about 45 min per headlight to do the job. Hopefully will last as described. Included before and after pics.  May 23 2017 Follow up. Headlight need to be treated again. Did not last even 2 years without substantial discoloration enough where the car wash is asking to treat them. Have to bring down to 2 stars for this reason. Dreading the fact that I would have to perform this job every year and half.  picture included
B000RNW85A|2|So thicck that is impossibleto use on small wire connections
B0007LMC1C|4|Works great but be ready to be sprayed when you pull it out of the wheel.
B0012XOQ9U|3|The hooks are fairly small and don't fit around the kayak holders I have , the rope is very cheap they use. I'd rate them a C minus
B00C4B18JU|2|it's not fit... screw postion...for 2015 rx 350....<br />If you cen grind to fixed it.<br />you can use it..<br />if can not ...don't buy it..
B00D3298A0|3|The size and quality of the mats are good. The latex/plastic smell fades away quickly. There is not much for traction on the underside,so the mats tend to slide around and not stay completely in place.
B000MK27RC|5|Nice product
B00GQIW2ZQ|4|I like the sticker but the quality wasn't amazing.
B00HV2KNA2|5|I give this a five star. It shipped out fast and great quality. I only had one problem, I ordered the wrong struts and shocks. ( make sure you order the ones for a 3-2 lift and not stock) . All my fault.
B006X8BATI|5|Easily installed using provided hsrdwsre. Looks great on the truck.
B00YE5Q132|5|I left my car at the MOT station whilst I was abroad. The locking wheel nut was in the boot and so the garage open it to get the nut. On my return I found that they had not closed the boot properly, which meant the light had stayed on and the battery was drained. This unit jump started the car without any effort, which allowed me to get to the shop to buy a new battery.This well made device came in very handy in this emergency.<br /><br />It comes with a carry case, a car cigarette lighter attachment which allows you to charge the device in the car, a mains wall charger, a set of short jump leads, a laptop charging cable and eight adaptors which will fit most laptops to enable laptop charging. There are a series of LED lights on the unit, to indicate how much charge is left in the unit. The charger itself allows for the manual selection of Voltage,you can have 12V, 15V or 19V's. It also has a built in torch and emergency flashing light. It took a few hours to fully charge the unit and has a 12000mAh capacity, which is more than enough to jump start a battery and recharge small electrical item, such as a laptop or phone.<br /><br />Overall this is a well made device and I am happy to Highly Recommend it.
B001G8DW14|4|works fine and delivered in a timely fashion but there were no leads attached whcih i thought there might be..
B007Z4XCM2|5|Looks sharp on my son's vehicle
B00KMBEMZG|5|rejuvenated my GM key-less entry fob for much less that the dealer wanted.
B00QGA5X28|5|Fit good looks great
B00WA15I1S|4|No instructions or cleaners are included with the unit.  It is very attractive and functional.
B004HE3V9C|4|Perfect fit. I a paired them with new rotors and after around 5k miles they are doing great.
B004K9KETY|5|Love it!! smells good too. the soap is much smoother and slippery then other soaps then i have used. i will buy more when i run out for sure.
B00T9I2FKC|1|Blah. It is a single circuit LED array, which would be fine. But they wanted it to be a two brightness bulb, so they put a resistor in series with one of the input terminals. That would be fine if they had diodes, or had two LED groups, but they didn't. So if you happen to turn on the low brightness circuit without turning on the high brightness circuit, then that resistor tries to power  up ALL the other bulbs on the high brightness circuit and burns itself out.. and the bulb won't come on. As a result, it tests fine individually, but if you ground the high brightness input then the low brightness circuit won't light. And when the bulb is in a system, with a bunch of bulbs all connected together on the high brightness circuit, (like your other turn signal lamps) then that provides an effective ground path. Bad design. They should have put in two diodes on the input terminals, or used two separate LED groups in the assembly, to prevent voltage from one input feeding out the other input. Doh. Seriously.<br /><br />After it smoked and wouldn't work when in vehicle (but bench tested fine), I disassembled it.
B007AOS5CE|4|Works well, exactly what I've come to expect from the Husky Liner product.  This one has the proven diamond-plate texture which looks rugged in a pickup truck.  Husky has more &#34;formal&#34; liners that you can consider if you don't like the diamond plate.  Fit is fine, and they're holding up well after a couple of months of use.<br /><br />-1 star because this is a one-piece liner.  I had a similar liner for the back seat of a 4Runner that was two overlapping pieces, which made it easier to get in an out to clean without spilling the contents on the carpet or dragging the liner across the interior plastic.  This one is one piece which makes it a bit more difficult.
B006JY97GO|5|For the price, you just can't beat these. I have already had to use it several times to pull out stuck Dodge and Chevy trucks.
B00NT9IN12|5|This device was quite the life saver.  I'd been having problems with my vehicle's electrical system and it would randomly kill my battery to the point I couldn't start my car.  After using my friends much larger jump start unit for a month or so, I purchased the Brightech Spider.  Not two days after I received it, I had a dead battery.  My boss happened to be with me when it happened and she was really impressed how quickly I was able to open my hood, unzip the storage bag, hook up the unit to my jump posts and start my car.  Once the car was started, we were on the road in a matter of minutes once I realized the car was dead.  I got three good jump starts off the Spider before I had to recharge it.  The best part?  The storage bag fits under the seat with no problem!<br />Would totally recommend this to my friends
B003FVFV46|4|It's batman but it doesn't fit as good and multiple pieces but he picture looks like one
B00EF403J0|5|Perfect for 3800 W Honda generator
B00J62SFRI|5|These are awesome! The quality is top notch. Only took me about 20 minutes to install both sides. Easy to install, the price is right, and they look great! 2012 F-250.
B009OTW646|3|The foam does clean my truck, but you still have to use your hands to wipe off dirt and grime on the lower part of the vehicle.
B009OXCY76|5|it works perfect on my dodge 2004 3500 sprinter van
B00J5CVMLU|3|very nice
B012I9UWSA|5|It is really space-saving. It’s super light and folds to a small circle.
B00D9C2CDO|5|I haven't put it to use yet. I'll update my review once I get back from my road trip from California to nevada. Will be strapped to an fj cruiser roof rack. So far the bag looks and feels durable. I had been searching and reading reviews and this bag had the best reviews. It was packaged very well with instructions and has that new plastic smell.
B00EE6QP46|1|No buy
B000CINVA6|4|Use all the time
B0015PK3AG|5|my Toyota Camry can't live with out it.
B005DSO5XW|5|Excellent!
B00LBDVX6K|5|This thing works fantastic, much better than a strap or chain and does not ruin the stuck or tow vehicle! I wish I had these when I was a kid!
B00BGTP03Q|5|Super cute, real vinyl stickers (cut, not printed), easy to use.
B0057GWP6Y|2|While it looks amazing it unfortunately began melting and warping while in the windshield. Also was impossible to touch because it was so hot. It's too bad I was really looking forward to using it.
B00OZOOZWG|5|Good quality part! there is a video on youtube using the same part that walks you through it....... the installation was rather easy.
B0031OYB84|5|Fit really well......and looks great.
B00Y75QZD0|5|product for review: Works great!!! I use this to charge two phones at once and it has not let me down :)
B001GMX91S|5|It works and fits perfectly. Top notch item...
B000E0Q7QM|5|Working great so far.
B0009PYW3W|4|These were smaller than I expected but overall they are good.
B00HZH66YA|5|I installed the 87 octane tune on my 2007 Nissan Xterra. The installation of the tune is extremely easy and fast. The entire process takes under 10 minutes. After the tune there is a very noticeable increase in acceleration. The shifts are much smoother. Although a bit pricey, in my opinion well worth it. I don't think that it will improve gas mileage as you find yourself stepping more on the gas pedal just to fell the increase in power. If you are looking for an increase in power then don't hesitate to purchase.
B008XAFZLS|5|Just by lookink at the unit it appears to be well made with quality parts. In my case, installing it in a 1974 MGB, completely stock minus smog pump, was a straight forward installation. Instructions for wiring are simple and clear. Just flip the position of the included spacer and that is it. It relies on rpm's to produce amperage so your idle will probably have to be adjusted accordingly, I did. On idle it pretty much works like the original 43 amp factory unit. Once you start driving things brighten up a lot. Literally. Not to mention the unit should be a lot more reliabe than the old one. I'm only running Lucas fog lamps and two 8&#34; electric fans for cooling but if I need to add something else I know I'll be covered.
B00M3D8TSC|1|Very cute print EVERYTHING IS ENTIRELY TOO SMALL STEERING WHEEL COVER SEAT COVERS ETC WILL NEVER RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WASTED MONEY
B00A71IJTG|5|Perfect.  Thanks
B0002Q7UJ6|5|Good belt
B00QJO1HYO|5|Stretchy and fits my thick steering wheel perfectly. It adds so much to the look of my car. Thank you.
B006TN2WWG|5|Excellent fit, very good replacement. Although the OEM handles were chrome, these beige handles matched very well with interior color scheme. I only needed to replace driver's side, but bought passenger side to match all handles. These were half the price of the chrome ones, and I am satisfied with the quality.
B000C7S062|5|Almost a perfect fit.  Had to make a little adjustment and all was well.  Took the opportunity to remove the a/c condenser since the a/c had long ago quit on me.  Much improved airflow now.  The little red truck is working again.
B008MY9Z6Q|1|Poor quality hardware, threads are loose, need three times the Teflon tape just to get it to stop leaking.
B0054SGU3E|3|The drivers side seat panel on my 09 Pontiac G6 came undone, the fasteners had worn out and come loose. I got these and popped them in the slots where the old ones had been and popped it back into place, and it held fairly well, only a little bit of give on one side. But I have noticed them getting looser as time goes by, requiring me to have to pop the seat back in on occasion.
B00Q3SDTQU|5|Speedy delivery being it's coming from China.  Great workmanship, quality and appeal.
B0027QWNGO|1|It seems like the wide-mouthed trash receptacles are much easier to come by these days.  However, I was looking for a car trash bag that had a drawstring or tight opening, so I was happy to find this one.  Unfortunately, when the trash bag arrived, the string was missing.  Big bummer, as now I have what is basically a wide-mouthed trash receptacle.
B005271AZA|5|Received as ordered.  Easy to install and fit perfectly
B0018BO5KG|5|Right on time got me back riding in 3 days in. The price is great too
B004I0YMIO|5|perfect fit
B00CTVN3DY|3|Quality not so good, ripped right away. I did not return it because I did not want to go through the hassle and I love Minions so I needed to keep this
B00COYNZJ8|5|Wonderful! how can you not love it? for this price its great!
B009E2VS6A|5|Instructions were easy to follow, it works
B00NGJEN5K|5|Fun and easy to assemble. Recommend, doing a test run before taking it to the field.
B000BUU5XG|4|Works as described.
B00BLKXW9O|5|quick service and it works great.
B00B9F2QBQ|5|Perfect fit and cost-effective great product.
B00F64N052|5|A great addition to my jeep and at a good price. Received early and installed before long trip.
B000N9OVQW|3|Did not fit my need.  Could not find a lube that would fit the filler end.  Poor choice on my part.
B008J1E0OE|5|Great product.  Works as designed.  Easy to install with basic tools and knowledge.
B000XB25HC|5|works with craftsman 650 series mowers with the electric start.  Save your money and buy this and not the new one they are advertising for like 80 dollars.
B00684TAYY|5|Perfect, just as advertised!
B0032I5TT4|4|Good shoe. Comfortable but buckle system can sometimes loosen slightly...not a serious issue just a little annoying for those that want precision. Truth is I like them a lot....
B008G1WT0Y|4|Removed 1 star because the clips that came with it are lacking. As others stated, use your original OEM clips and these are great!
B00GSAUHB8|5|This is a great product that does a good job of protecting my car from the hot southern sun. It also folds nicely into the small pouch that I can then keep in the side pocket of the door for easy access.
B003OBRSRA|4|great
B00JBIAU20|5|can't beat them for the price,look great!
B001GJ7HCI|5|great
B004TR7ZDU|5|Received in good condition and is an exact replacement.
B00R37VEIK|5|Easy to install
B00WMQIR4Q|5|OEM products at a great price
B00E1ZMW2E|5|Shipped within hours. Arrived 2 days earlier then expected. Great jacket. Fitted as expected. Great riding jacket. Simple design. No unnessary bells and whistles. A must have.
B002CKT9T4|5|Love my new hubcaps!
B004YA1NBM|4|They looks pretty cool.  Hope no one steals it.
B00JU65OP6|1|Do not waste your money.
B000HBM49W|5|Stop using the tape and start using this. It's so much easier, seals better, and the excess can be wiped off pretty easily.
B00447SCDM|5|Very cute, perfect size for car, not too big.
B004AIIF9Q|4|excellent
B007KFMR8Q|3|I was a good replacement for the OEM rotor/brake on my 2008 scion xd, installation was easy (no missing parts and fitment issues). But I did not observe a significant difference in the braking (like other users reported) after the replacement.
B00HM9V3X0|1|Bad experiece!!!!<br />Item was necer received!!!!
B0079GPYA4|3|This tool was listed as working on a Volvo 700-series fuel tank.  It doesn't.  The slots are too narrow to fit the splines on the outside of the plastic lock ring (nut).  I had to take the tool to a machinist and have the slots enlarged, which essentially doubled what this tool cost me.<br /><br />It may well work on other Volvo models, but don't expect it to work on a 700-series.  Probably won't work on a 900-series, either.
B00JGQLZSU|5|Best price around
B0042Z0662|5|Unit as stated, packaged well.
B005VNQYVU|5|Excellent fit and operation.
B00S4HFNXK|4|This works on small boats 16 ft or less.  Because of the rectangular shape I don't recommend them for larger boats.  Even with the smaller boat, I wonder whether it will remain effective for more than a year of so.  Buy with caution, making sure it will work with your boat.
B0031XMMG8|5|Exactly the board I needed.
B0002ILK90|5|Great service-promt
B00GI2CCLO|5|The OxGord Car Shade is thicker than the cheap ones you find in most car parts and big box stores. It is large and fits my Honda Civic well.  It's also reversible so you don't have to show the zebra pattern if you don't care for it.  The opposite side is plain metallic silver.  I was not sure about the pattern, but it turns out looking very nice in my silver car.
B000I9TPDG|4|Fit well and comfortable.
B007H8DKJG|5|Perfect fit and corrected my check engine light issue.
B00AYHYYP6|5|Excellent wears good , looks good , and sporty I love them
B00M5H6CVW|5|Excellent ....much improvement over the AC Plugs I was running
B000C9GYTA|4|It works like it should. Unfortunately, mine was good and I later had to replace the resistor to use the #1 and #2 fan speeds
B004GDFCKA|5|It was a perfect fit.
B00KGIDY7C|3|Picture wasn't clear on the drive. Wrong number of teeth and diameter slightly larger.
B002MESVUI|4|Fit great. Look great. Great price.
B006H34AE6|5|This thing is amazing. It removed all the dog hair from my floor mats in my car.
B00D3E1E6O|5|Fits my 2010 Honda Odyssey perfect.
B00E0FRTZU|2|Says its a 3x, fits like a large, maybe a 1x. Wish it fit like it said...
B002PQU6YC|5|Better than the originals. They make my truck look new again. Easy to install. Perfect fit.
B00MVCHN3C|5|We used this long Water Blade to squeegee our RV after washing it. This saved a ton of time that would otherwise have been required to towel it dry. The handle adapter worked well with a Wentworth extendable aluminum painter's pole.
B00E94QMPU|5|works and looks good
B004UM9XQG|5|I love high gloss shine tires and this product delivers.  Great on vinyl and leather as well.
B00MP4OJTC|3|Bends a little too easily, don't expect this thing to hold up against a lot of wind.
B00IPTX104|1|I am 165 pounds and can not fit in them<br />There like 12&#34; wide
B00CHI89JW|5|This was so easy to use and much cheaper than the dealer! It works perfectly..and my husband now knows not to &#34;toss me&#34; the keys!
B00DPWSEAI|5|Was purchased for my f350 dually but I think it's wrong size but this item is everything you looking for
B00MPE82BS|1|Horrible. Dust pan cracked unusable
B007V1UJD4|4|as advertized and wife is very happy
B0015GPQX4|1|Useless. It does not fit my cup holders well and it falls all over.
B000ET9SB4|5|This is a neat little compressor.  Comes in a storage case and everything fits inside.  I've powered it up just to see how it works and it's got a very decent output.  It's a little noisy but not bad considering that it IS an air compressor.  Haven't had to use it yet but it's a welcome addition to my motorcycle.  Provides peace of mind for long road trips.
B0002SR8AK|5|This tool is a tremendous value and big time saver!  No substitute for having the right tool for the job.
B00GU7NTGO|5|Fit 2004 Suburban Z71 perfect.  No issues, no more hauling the tire around on trailer etc.  No safety collar like the old one to rust up.
B0041CCBOG|5|Cover was a good fit and worked very good evan in rain
B00CAKILAO|4|It took a little trimming but it was easy with a good pair of kitchen scissors.  It serves the purpose and I am satisfied with the cost.
B008VQLJ28|5|good product arrived fast
B008JVFJYO|5|Great shipping - fast...  and these things are easier to use than the ones that came with our bike rack which I practically had to be He-man to pull over the nubs...
B00HAV0IHC|5|Fast delivery happy customer!
B00ZKSEZQ2|5|Exceptional quality, bright and durable. I color matched my brackets and because of the light output and clean look, I took off my 50&#34; light at above my windshield.
B00URRNL98|5|Fit and looks nice
B00BQAL2NW|5|awesome product
B00HM92O06|5|This sticker is hilarious and its always fun to see who enjoys the humor and who gets their undies in a wad. Someone had the gumption to actually try peeling it off my car!! WTH!? hahaha Who does that???
B00JNYTQ90|5|Great on glass and fast wax on painted surfaces/ love it !
B007FGR852|4|The product came on time and was in good shape when opened. The product did not come with any directions on as to install which would have been nice but luckily I figured it out no problem. Would buy again at the price good value.
B0040ZIVA2|5|Got this for my grandsons birthday as he had just gotten a Ford Ranger (same color) & he loved it.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Excellent product
B008X02JJO|5|Part fit exact and installed great
B00JMCCBRW|5|Been using this in my 2008 BMW 335i n54 motor ever since first oil change, originally Pennzoil Ultra Euro.  Now at 100k miles and still running great.  Did an oil pan gasket not too long ago and the sump and cranks looks like new.  Great price for subscription.
B00BB0TGS0|5|Delivered quickly. Sturdy, long, locks into bed well (06 titan). Very very happy!
B00945SINS|5|works as expected
B00SRFPG9K|5|Original Mopar item.  Good quality and fits my Wrangler perfectly.
B00P9GHH10|4|arrived quickly but scratches very easily
B00266TXF4|5|Boat starts and runs great. Thanks amazon!
B00OLHQSYU|5|Using this tool it was easy to open my iPhone 5s. I was concerned that I would damage the cable that connects to the home button, but this tool removed that fear. Well worth $10.
B0045K2Q9Y|5|Fit my motorcycle needs, and took up less space allowing me to get to the others easier!
B00YGBNIPI|5|good
B0090JVTYI|3|I bought this for a Streetrod project, and expected it to be symmetrical in shape.  But one side is slanted, and the other vertical making it a bit more of a challenge to design a console pocket to fit it.
B00BDVNBZ6|2|I purchased this from a different seller, paid something like $2.50 for this MTC brand.  There are a few well known vendors out there that have it very low cost (not including shipping).  It fit OK but did not last.  less than 3 years after installation the plastic is cracked, when I inspected the inside the plastic was MUSHY!<br />No problems with original fit, didn't leak for 2-1/2 years.  But for the hassle of installation and leaky coolant (and possibly being stranded somewhere and/or melting an engine) I'd rather pay more and get one that will last longer.<br />I'm trying Beck Arnley 147-0005 next.  Dealer wants $34 bucks for the real McCoy.
B000FGECW6|5|Perfect
B000MITKOM|5|works great
B00C5SRGUC|5|Great mat. Lays and sweeps easy. Looks good, folds up easy and goes back into carrying  bag with no problem.
B00GLFN3WK|5|The best $$$$ can buy and I love it . I use tho hook all the time and it works 100% all day
B001AMA32C|5|Easy to install on my 2003 Dodge Dakota. Didn't have to take tires off or raise up . Very happy with ride and price. Shock delivered on time. I baby my trucks so I try to install the best parts.
B003PI6VMA|5|2011 kia soul (plus) perfect fit.
B00TZF06VO|5|Every thing was worked good. Would use them again
B001FZL9ZO|3|Lots of plastic, not very strong, fake chrome that got brown rust spots after one rain storm.
B0084L0YR6|5|Im a woman with no previous auto mechanical experience what so ever. But I figured the problem why my ac went out and ordered this product. I spliced and installed this part myself (30 min) with the help of google and youtube. It has been a week and has worked great so far. I drive a 2006 Chevy Silverado Lt with a v8 4.8 fyi.
B00JR3RYBE|4|Good product works well, not loud enough for freeway use but great for back country roads and off road use!
B003YJ8TVQ|5|Works great , saves space , I mounted it with velcro<br />in my dash opening .
B000C3XDB8|5|It's the only filter I will use on all four of our vehicles.  I always order them here because they have the best price.
B002YI72TS|1|I bought this because several people claimed it was &#34;superb&#34; &#34;fantastic&#34; and &#34;better&#34; than similar products when cleaning and protecting textured plastic\poly surfaces exposed to the elements and uv.  Do NOT use these on textured surfaces.  While the cleaning agent will not harm the surface, you'll notice that the material easily snags and leaves trailer threads all across the surface which are difficult to remove and clean off.  The &#34;wipe&#34; itself seems like it is constructed from little wisps of cotton that are compressed into a paper towel like format.  Migt be fantastic for smooth surfaces but its absolutely terrible for any (even minor) textured surface and cause the texture will snag the wipe material and leave remnants all over it.
B0082195GO|1|Does not stick.  Its always partially peeling off every time I go to ride and makes it look like crap.  Get a solid color instead.
B00180OS7M|5|Ordered wrong ones  easy return!
B002YXC0A4|5|Works great.
B00N3KZH6G|4|works great
B000VZF6YE|5|I keep this in the compartment in my ATV and it has held up through 6 months of abuse. Still works great.
B0096WJ1A8|5|great product!
B00FT69V8W|5|I would HIGHLY recommend doing business with this company! I recently purchased two of their seat vest's. I was happy to see that the quality is excellent, and was so disappointed when they did not fit my 1999 Z3 seats (no removable headrest). I contacted Aagis, and they were fantastic! Sent me out a different style with a prepaid UPS label to return  my original purchase. Unfortunately again, the second set was a bit to big, so I took the original vest to a local shop to see if they could sew a piece of sheepskin to the top of the vest, making a custom fit. I asked Aegis if they would be willing to send me an extra piece of sheepskin to match, and they did so without question. I now have the perfect fitting seat cover! Thank you Aagis for being such a GREAT company to do business with! Your customer service is well beyond 5 stars!
B00O3QCJ74|1|It didn't fit my  car
B005JU5UEW|5|best blade son the market
B00KTJ9I46|5|These worked wonderfully.
B00D42AFS8|5|Unbelievable!
B00D1CQVIY|5|Great price and easy to use, fast delivery.
B00480J4JG|5|Bought it for my Volkswagen GLI (2006).  Great product.  Easy to install after watching You tube video a few times.
B000TYONCI|3|This part worked for only one day and then it came off. When my mechanic reinstalled it the second time it stayed on.
B007MEONVE|4|Bought a set of these and they sent me 3 that fit and one that was a completely different lug type. But they're very good quality wheels. Next time before you ship it out make sure they're all the right lug and size as listed
B002EIJP48|4|The only bad thing is it makes it louder
B00FSG8224|5|Used these to replace the old bulbs in my travel trailer,<br />These have a great white light and are very pleasant.<br />Very bright and use almost no power, Highly recommended!
B00FC22AS6|5|Using the 55watt 9007 bi-xenon kit in my 05 Chevy cavalier. I used the relay harness to draw power directly from the battery and they work flawlessly. They take about 10 seconds to reach full brightness, and boy does it make one hell of a difference over the factory halogen bulbs.
B00CB3E50U|5|Nice sticker for my laptop, the color is the same white as the apple on the top.
B00N3C65H4|5|Fits perfectly, didn't use the switched I spliced it to my head lights. Looks amazing.
B00877SL2M|4|Bright light.
B00CIGOQJK|5|Awesome and comfortable
B005N73UFC|5|I'm a fan of Hot Leathers products~~This hoodie is super thick, soft cotton~~Very well made with great construction. Great deep pockets, nice and roomy hood and the graphics on this are soft, not stiff like some graphics can be. I will continue to purchase Hot Leathers products!
B004GE8ZC6|3|Part was a direct the fit<br />Poor paint job on the grill flaking off right out of the box.
B000JWKMBG|5|A perfect, leak free fit. I use Gold Plug on all my cars.
B0097AA126|5|Good product and was shipped quickly.
B00AOO8LVW|5|Awesome product. Installed in under an hour on a 2004 Tundra Double Cab.
B007Q7SYT4|4|Very easy to install and stopped the death roll with my steering.
B008697KXC|5|Great price and is very sharp.
B003UM7B98|5|I own and older Chevy Tahoe and a new Chevy Volt.  I perform all of my own maintenance.  This jack is a terrific value.
B009DJTFLY|2|Lasted 1-year ...I open and shut this car door maybe 2-3 times a week and rarely roll the window down so I would've hoped it had lasted longer.
B000CCMSOW|5|The real deal. It's OEM.  Less expensive than the auto store and didn't have to run out to pick it up!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Great product.  Works well and is large enough for my full size Range Rover windshield.  Also, appreciated the follow up from the seller making sure I knew how to fold the product properly.  That was a nice touch and compelled me to write this, my first ever review of a product I bought on Amazon.
B000BUU5SQ|4|It works, and doesn't leak.  Not the highest quality workmanship, but does the job.
B008DREON6|3|Nice try  Using it for sunglasses storage, but the pocket is a little big.  Smaller pockets are good for holding business cards, a small notebook, or parking lot tickets with the mag stripe.  Pen holder loop is too loose for a Bic stick pen or similar -- the pen falls out after you hit a few potholes or rough roads. Back pocket not large enough to hold #10 envelope with registration and insurance card.  OK for now but I'll probably replace it if something else comes along that is closer to my needs
B002UC4XZ4|5|Worked perfect for my motorhome storage doors
B008TSYDX0|1|This is the cable listed by TORO for our mower.  It has &#34;fitted&#34; ends on both sides and is about an inch too long - it would not engage the clutch on blades - which allows the mower to start.  Waste of money - now having to just hope we don't cut our hands off when emptying bag
B00YY7M4AO|5|Works well with my Ford Escape. I like the power on/off button so I can just leave it plugged in my car.  I use Dash app and paid for some extra features but I'm sure you can easily download free apps depending on the details you want to see on your car.
B005VWWLAO|5|fit perfect very happy with this part ty
B00KWMNI6Y|5|They are excellent and fit my vehicle perfectly!
B00H03GBSA|5|Looks great
B00030DLEE|5|I use this at work and it gets the job done.<br />Negatives-The plastic on out side feels cheap and I need to check the latch to make sure the pin isn't coming out everyday , carry handles a joke.<br />Space is limited , good way to reduce your portions<br />Positive - heats up your food in about 30 mins just remember to set a timer<br />I use glass containers ( plastic is not an option )
B0002S9WZ4|2|Too loose for my liking on my 2000 jeep wrangler. I returned it for a full refund.
B001445IZ8|5|Finally a well built oil suction pump
B00LNQBQLW|4|I tried installing these in my 2015 Toyota 4Runner and they will not fit because of the oversized casing which holds the fan.  I'm pretty bummed out because I did purchase additional JDM led bulbs for my day time running lights which look amazing!
B004RION6S|5|Looks great on my bike to show my german heritage
B003UM7B98|5|This thing is solid! It weighs quite a bit and I definitely trust it to hold its load where it needs to be. I've used it several times now without failure. I'll trust this thing before I'd ever buy a bargain jack.
B007NP4Y7K|3|Emblem is nice but is already starting to peel up from each side of the double sided sticky tape. Will have to add more.
B00AZ4Q852|1|Garbage don't even fit my window
B003FBV8ZW|5|Ok
B007JXEJ1C|5|it works perfect for my  DODGE SPRINTER  2004 3500 a/c blower
B00ZYV99IY|5|Love theses car mats. My husband likes Batman so this was the perfect gift for him. The mats are heavy and thick.
B00LAV2BVO|1|Car great for 2 days and then ran worse then before I changed these out. I wasn't sure what it was so took car to professional mechanics and he told me the coils were not putting out enough power. Buy this instead Denso DAC673-6005 Ignition Coil
B00JBID2V6|1|Wrong part. Lack of detail about two different headlights styles. Ship back to much money.
B000C9UKYK|5|Fit good.
B008PVAEXO|5|I work on my motorcycles quite a bit, this set works great for me.
B00ONGRI4S|5|This fuel pump is great! Switched this one out for an old one on a Honda CRV 01. Better way better. Made the car run better and it quit dying very happy with this product. Installation isn't so tough. Thank you!
B001KOIP1G|5|Great product, shipping was a little late.
B00MENPKAG|4|I've only had it for about 5 days now, but I like it a lot (hence the 4 stars). Let's start with cons<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. It does not come with instructions on how to install, but it's very easy. Just screw the old on and screw on the new one.<br />2. It does not come with instructions on how long you charge the gear.<br />3. The leather on my original Toyota gear had a richer feel. The leather on this one feels cheap. The chrome part is plastic. So the whole unit does feel cheap to the touch.<br />4. I recommend this gear if you want to spice up the interior of your car. Just keep in mind that it's not very showy in the day. Only at night.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1. It looks so beautiful when it lights up in the night.<br />2. It lights when it's charging and so does the charger.<br />3. It adds more excitement to the boring Corolla interior.<br /><br />KEEP YOUR ORIGINAL GEAR. Based on the cheap parts, I don't know how long it will last. However, FYI: I've read a review that state that they had theirs for 6 months with no problems.<br /><br />I recommend it!
B003TTL0TE|5|As described...  works great! High quality product.
B0002V9IFU|5|Simple to use and cleans up the leather bits nicely!
B00MGI60RQ|5|Inexpensive, replaced some incandescent lamps in my travel trailer.<br /><br />One is failing, but at this price there are plenty spares.
B000C9SP4W|5|Friend in another state needed cooling system work, among other parts ordered made sure all parts were OEM so as to minimize variables (fit) upon ordering. Great service and shipping!
B0031R61DO|5|so far so good
B004TRKBOK|5|hopefully i never use it but i know it will work.
B00AB2IFIQ|1|Doesn't fit My 2010 harley davidson truck
B001F0O1BI|1|water separator bowl threads would not hold bowl. buy American!
B0051S4VEW|4|Note that the black patches visible in the picture are HOLES.  The black you're seeing is the glove's interior.  When you put them on, you'll be looking at your own knuckles.<br /><br />I still wore them--they work fine, and I'd intended to wear cloth gloves inside them for warmth anyway--but my co-workers had a good chuckle that I'd unintentionally purchased &#34;thug gloves.&#34;
B008SO6BDK|5|For the price compared to quantity you can not go wrong here.<br />Relays are great it you want to switch higher voltages on or off using a small voltage.<br />These are rated at up to 240 volts. I have only tested 120 and it worked flawlessly.<br />I can switch them on and off with a 5 volt microcontroller.
B0075VEKJO|5|More HP and saving more gas, getting great miliage
B00L1KHWMM|5|Easy to assemble
B00002NCB2|5|worked like the old one
B005OZ5GXC|3|I thought I was receiving a set of 4. The description of the package contents needs to be worded with better details. The actual product was as I expected.
B00CNEQZHS|5|Fit perfectly and work perfectly. That pretty much says it all.
B005M9BQHK|5|I got these and installed them and had 1 bulb not working,I called Orange Cycle Parts and they are sending me 2 so i have a spare.Excellent customer service, very friendly. I would recommend.
B008CE0CW2|5|works great
B00KTOX8HO|5|These LED lights are awesome.  They replace the yellow/orange incandescents in my car plus they use less energy AND have more brightness AND last longer.<br /><br />There is no reason to NOT upgrade your car with these!
B004B1C8TA|5|Love, love it!  It's looks different from the other loud fake looking blind plate holder's. This one looks classy. Go girl!
B008032QH4|5|worked great, fast shipping, great price
B00J4PDWUW|5|Looks nice very good
B00EC2CG9U|2|The hooks will scratch just about any surface on the planet. Pay a little more and avoid these.
B005SEJTYG|5|Its purple!
B000OKT8RM|5|fit rv just right  sturdy also
B001BCLW6M|5|Fit Perfect and works as new
B00ICR1UB6|5|It works perfectly as described, well built and elegant design. Interesting, it took four days from China to New York and a week from New York to Florida!  USPS service obviously not as great as it used to be.  My tablet when off does not have leds to provide a sign that the device is charging. With this usb  meter, I know now that the tablet is changing and at how many amps.  NOTE : This device does not transfer any data so it doesn't matter if your port is usb 2.0 or 3.0.  What maters is the voltage and amp your charger or port is able to handle which is supposed to be very much the same and independent of port hardware version.   Nice device, thank you!
B000DZBHLI|5|Works great !! Very water tight seal.
B00B6TEZ6E|5|If installed right, this is a good quality gasket, not too thin and not made of only paper.  I used it on both my banshee's and had no problems.
B003LMGDHI|5|Got it on time, and was what I expected
B004MDEV38|5|Fit perfect on my 2011 odyssey,  20 minutes to install, just backed the van on 2x4's to give it a bit of space, didn't have to undo the exhaust
B0032YVDEI|5|Exactly what I needed
B005P7CL6O|5|This is awesome stuff made my old gun look new. The receiver was extremely easy to cover the stock was fairly easy just remember use a little heat to help stretch it a bit . The forend was the hardest for me take ur time and ur riffle or shotgun will look like it came from the factory fast shipping good straightforward directions and plenty of YouTube videos to help out too
B00GD8OL62|5|They changed the look of my 2015 ducati panigale. Very happy with the product. Although when it was shipped for some reason they were loose in the case they come in. Not sure why but they didn't break
B0064VJOVK|5|Looks great!
B000WP9KIQ|4|Fits Yosh and D&D street pipes too!
B00QFZUVH6|3|only had for a couple Its not water proof but water resistant seems to be some sort of water resistant cloth. Don't know how long it will last will find out in a few more months. OK for covering car to keep sun from tearing it up the only thing I can say is the price is ok how durable is yet to be seen.
B00GV77H2U|3|Worked somewhat
B00BDO1PR4|5|So far they are great! Overall fit is pretty good.
B00MQAK2B4|4|Great
B008MCDXX4|5|great!
B000M5NNQ6|5|Received in good condition
B009CCM6CC|5|worked like a champ.
B000VUCC5A|5|OEM nice, brought as a set with the other side. Found that a previous owner that messed up the existing housing while I was replacing it. Very happy to have it all connected up properly now. looks good as new.
B003YOXMPO|5|Good stuff
B008UR7J6I|3|Difficult to get to get it to work.
B004I12424|5|Excellent experience
B00AT9AX72|5|These worked great as daytime running lamps in my vehicle. For all of you posting bad reviews because these don't work as turn signals; do some research, it takes more than just changing your old bulbs to LEDs. Fast shipping and great price!
B000KYYMKK|5|worked great, good deal
B00KTLV95U|5|This was perfect!
B00JAMYDFC|5|Cleans absolutely anything I throw at it.  Stubborn stains that have been on the interior trim of my car for years are now history.  Even cleaned the stains off of my leather seats.
B00ALI2LW6|5|Looks great, good size.
B001C6Q8PM|3|👍
B002PQW6NG|5|Just what I was looking for.  Extremely pleased.
B0031B4YU2|5|Exactly what I wanted. High quality and effective.We use these in our cleaning business. They eventually lose their fiber pile but there is no lint and they seem launderable​ forever without ripping or wearing out completely.
B004A4KEW6|5|Was just what I needed
B005HEAHAM|5|love it
B008QRIXVC|5|Instead of sunshine state, it said, IN GOD WE TRUST&#34; i dont have a problem with that because i do trust in god, but it's not what was advertised
B00M8UHSX2|4|The do exactly how i intended but I wish there were some kind of spacers to prevent damage to the metal on the Jeep itself.
B00BHD674W|5|Great product.
B011YTFPBE|4|Are these for 26inch wheels?
B00COJ9L96|1|this gard is not long enough.<br />they didnt make the length clear so its NOT a good buy.
B00574WIE0|1|Not a sticker. This is a falsely posted feature. Disappointed that it's not what it said it was.
B004VBY8LQ|5|Exactly as I ordered it.  Would have been nice if it came in a kit with the test strips.  Coolant, Prep, and test strips all together.
B005FNKFY8|5|Custom keying to an existing key is brilliant. Work smoothly as advertised. Looks to be weather resistant - time will tell...
B00JZ0H694|5|Good deal.
B00MOKFM9S|5|Great light output. Hard to believe it is a LED.
B000CIT3N0|5|Good deal
B001P2HWC6|5|It's good but way too heavy I wish it comes with better pins.
B00CFALFXY|5|Love them.
B0002SPCAS|3|I purchased this product because of the research and reviews I read about it.I used it on two cars, followed the instructions, left it enough time for it to penetrante. I'll tell what it did and didn't do. It made the leather a little bit more supple. It cleaned pretty good. What it didn't do was remove wrinkles. It didn't make it look new. In my opinion it didn't restore it in any other way than just making it a little more soft. I've used Lexol conditions for years and I can tell your I'm not impress with this product. Is it a little bit better than Lexol? Yes, but not that much. Maybe it don't work for me that much because I've always taken care of my cars seats and maybe they are in good shape and I set my expectations to high. So in conclusion should but this leather rejuvinator? If you have the extra cash lying around and are willing to... Yes. If not stick to Lexol leather conditioner and you'll be happy with the results for the money you spend. The pictures I have posted are the end result. To be honest not much of a difference in the before.
B000COMXO0|5|did what I needed it to do
B00TJHHMTM|5|Handles were received within 48 hours with no additional charge.  Awesome!! Quality better than expected.  Will definitely buy from Autoandart again through Amazon.  AAAA++++
B0024E6V9E|3|Did not fit the filter I purchased, but made it work. It would be nice to give ID dia. and depth to crossbar dimension so others do not make the same mistake I did.
B00199IJIQ|5|They work great and fit great
B004HV575G|5|Easy to apply and looked great!
B0006IX7Y2|5|A must have....... I will leave it at that!!!!!!! SMILE!
B00YVHGTBM|1|I purchased this and when I realized it didn't work on 2012 Lexus IS f it was to late to cancel order
B003ZNVDPK|5|great
B00312B95E|5|keeps heat off legs
B00LC82GZQ|1|Did as website instructed and blew a fuse in my 1997 Saturn SL2. Luckily someone was able to figure it out (shout to Douglas L. Norton) before I had the car towed. Would not recommend.
B009HU7HSW|5|Ok
B001L9KI56|5|Super great to take the pressure off the wrist. Love it1
B00SLKD55S|4|Somehow my 2010 F150  A/C compressor died, getting an OEM part was out of the question due to its price, so I bought this one. I took it to my mechanic and so far so good. A/C is working fine, no funny noises coming out of this unit.<br /><br />Regarding quality, time would tell. This unit looked exactly as the original Ford part. Built quality seems to be good. I will update this review if anything happens to this compressor.
B004HE56EU|5|aweseome deal for whole acdelco brake set all the way around<br />Half the cost as the store.
B00B9H59B8|4|The item is good, no problems BUT for a little more money replacing the complete handle you don't worry about &#34;just having the tape hold it in-place.
B00HSO0EY8|5|Make sure you get the vent as well!
B005VTSWW8|5|It fit perfectly.
B00KWNUXWK|5|Gift for my girlfriend she loved them as she loves ladybugs. Very nice and nice to look at.
B00JVZ9OVG|5|This also fits Isuzu Ascender. The parts store quoted me $191.70 Ea. These mounts worked just fine.
B00KWHSVHK|4|My girlfriend loved these but it was a bit tricky to install everything for her. Looks alot better with these on there.
B00CB9868Q|5|Fit perfect and looked good.
B006WPQNB2|5|This is a great product for camping!  Actually does a low flush and hold six gallons of water.
B007SOOYO4|1|Colors are incorrect. I wore that insignia for 4 and half years and have my unit crest and patches still. There is no magenta but rather RED in the background. Whomever you heisted the graphic off of had it wrong. Congrats on following them down the trail into the land of the ignorant.
B00852MK30|3|They're too big for my application
B00H6XPZN6|5|Very nice product. Really keep the sun out. Can still see thru them when driving. The suction cups really hold nice. They have been attached for over a month and have never fell off.
B000EPZZIS|5|Got these for my 2005 Toyota Avalon and fits permit.  Delivery was on time and looks great on the car.  So far I have not had any issues.
B002SA0SCA|3|Sent it back, did not fit 2001 Polaris.
B00CXADGQ0|2|product arrive early and it also show tracking and love it. I have a dodge Ram year 2005. One negitive on this product, it would not light up when you hit the switch on one of the lights or both. It will only light up when you open the one or both doors. Only the door open it will light up what is that not even the switch would work. I don't like that. I would have to find other LED that will light the right way.
B00657BNE4|5|These are sweet!  Long live the mighty 7.3! Best engine ever made!!!
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Very helpful in blocking the sun.
B002NGCO30|3|I really wanted to like this product.  My plan was to use it on my sailboat as an emergency backup power supply.  I tested it at home after charging with the included AC power charger.  I ran a 12w CFL lamp for over 3 hours.  I was very impressed.  I then tried to charge it by hand using the attached pull cord.  After about 50 pulls it began to make strange noises and I feared it was falling apart internally.  After another two minutes of pulling the charge light was still red and the pull cord had zero tension on it confirming my fears.  Deciding the pull cord was now broken and being the sole purpose for my purchase I began my autopsy and opened the power source up.  The internals are very basic containing a small battery (similar to a security system battery) and a very small generator about the size of a man's wallet.  After opening up the generator I found the problem was the two small rivets holding the all plastic centrifugal arms had sheared.  I replaced them with some small steel bolts I had laying around, reassembled, and tested...it worked.  For how long, who knows.
B00LEBLI82|5|I received the new Led lights and installed in my camper. All 10 of the lights worked and have a better light output then the old lights. I just ordered 10 more so I can replace all of the lights in the camper. Also they are much cooler on the fixtures and draw a lot less current off of the batteries. Since I just installed them I can't say what the life will be.
B00MB0E1WK|5|Love it!!
B00IO9CIEA|5|Fit my 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis.
B00MYATLCC|5|fits well and works
B000C5C524|5|these work great on my ford 2002 f-350
B00P2D3W0A|5|these lights are bright as red color fit perfectly, wish it can manufacture as amber color for turn signals light as well.
B009LN4SN2|5|For me it works just fine 1996 Toyota Camry Le 2.2...
B000NK7G54|5|Great!!!
B0012GTVVA|5|I love this bar!! Took 5mins to install! I even bought one for my mom's trailer I highly recommend! I would post a pic but the one they display shows exactly what it looks like on your door
B00G66ASPE|5|Perfect fit and engine can breathe properly again.
B004AH4OJC|5|Bought a pack of these just in case I ever needed a spare.
B000JFES40|5|Worked great.
B00B8ZHD74|3|This covers the Miata, it certainly does not fit it. Kinda like an extra large glove covers my wife's small hand. The antenna is retractable, which helps as there is no antenna hole. If your antenna is a solid stick this cover will need modification to cover your Miata.<br />There are no pockets for the mirrors. The cover just loosely drapes over the entire car. Material is strong. Rain does soak this cover. This is not waterproof. But, dirt and dust to not get through.<br />Quick off and on. Corners have elasticity. Looks like a king sized fitted sheet.<br />Not exactly what I though &#34;fits Mazda Miata&#34; meant.<br />It is ok, which is why I kept it.
B000VKTUJQ|5|Fits well and much less expensive then the dealership.
B00P86N30U|5|Very solid mud flaps
B000NVW1LM|3|Well the first box leaked during shipment so they were nice enough to send another. I put it in my front differential but as of now it has slowed the leak but not stopped it. If this would of stopped it I wanted to put it in the Transfer Case and Motor of my Bronco and in the motor of my girlfriends car. Maybe you just need more than the 8oz bottle. I'll try it again to be sure
B00BLST0PG|5|Nice just what I wanted
B0009IQZH0|5|Nice size towels.
B000C5416M|5|love moog products and very strong products would definatly buy again if needed
B009AZH1UI|3|Does work but too small for a typical modern closet, maybe if you have a 3 foot square closet it might work but if you have a 7ft wide 2ft deep closet - you need 3 or more.
B00QXO7SLG|3|The product is &#34;OK&#34;, but it does not fit the 2015 Yaris. It does fit the 2013 Yaris.<br /><br />The Amazon page states that this is for the 2015 model Yaris:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QXO7SLG?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0<br /><br />But it does not fit the 2015. The product packaging states that it fits the 2013.
B000C5YD1A|5|Fit my 2002 WRX wagon perfectly.
B004LQCDOA|5|nice quality. works excellent
B00HQ5HKAK|5|I love the softness of these car seats. The black is so rich. I have a 2015 Camry and the look is just what I hoped for. The only problem is hooking them correctly. The seats are close to the floor and the hooks are too small but I was able to work it out. Absolutely no shedding.
B00ELN94CW|3|Does not fully adhere to the back of my car
B000F0G0TK|5|A+
B002L6DMD8|5|Perfect and easy installation on my 2011 Nissan Sentra. You never realize how much you need new rotors until after they are on. Smooth breaking all around.
B000NWA55K|5|I have encounter issues with my radiator fan. they stopped working so i decided to replace both. this is the OEM part. I bought it to avoid any amps variation so i don't burn my car's electrical circuits. it worked perfectly.
B00FFAZF28|2|I ORDERED IT BUT IT DIDN'T FIT MY FOLD DOWN CAMPER. I SENT IT BACK
B000W0RQ8C|5|Solid receiver lock. Cover keeps the key hole from dirt and grime.
B00UUEJINQ|5|Smaller the I expected but love it still
B009DK2GSC|2|Product did not match my car after i was told that it's the same match for those years.
B000C5FL7K|3|It says &#34;Filter Kit&#34;, but its just a filter! NO &#34;O&#34; ring included! Otherwise it was what I expected.
B00A6YL0Z4|3|The shock absorbers don't allow you to fit tools to tighten the bolts. I had to have them machined  to fit the tools in the hole to tighten the assembly. Other than that they seem to work well.
B00VJ4LHUS|5|Great product, installed securely and with ease.
B004TC6USQ|5|Worked perfect
B003P627I4|3|SUPER small
B00MHI3KPU|3|I like the band but the pad itself is pretty flimsy and easily allows your fingers to do the work which is not only fatiguing but also can cause issues when using scratch removers or compound by leaving finger strokes in the paint.
B0099DYAHI|5|I need just one headlight.. It is possible to sale only one?
B004EI6A8K|5|This is rela
B00MYQK7PG|4|Very nice,Thanks.
