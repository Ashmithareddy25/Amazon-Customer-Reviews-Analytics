B00CFOKXM4|2|These batteries caused my mobility scooter to stop working. After a $75 trouble call, the technician measured 20% capacity on one battery and 80% capacity on the other. These batteries are stale or rejects. After the technician replaced them for $90, the scooter ran great. The seller will never get my business again.<br /><br />This is a completely fair review of a truly terrible set of batteries as verified by a Factory Authorized Dealer using an approved Load Tester.
B000C6YLVQ|5|perfect
B00521AHNW|5|looks good
B00B4S2D52|5|Perfect fit for our older model Toyota!
B001IGBI1K|3|The description of this item says that it is rated for 20,000 pounds and infers that it includes a hook. The truth is that it is rated for 17,000 pound break strength and has no hooks just loop ends. It may be an acceptable recovery strap, time will tell, but don't trust the description.
B00C9ZNNMG|1|Amazon told me it will fit in my 09 F250 4x4 and it does but i had to have a fabrication shop build two rails as a base. The bed walls curve up and there was no support in the middle leave about a 2&#34; gap. The mounting bracket would not work without these rails or some shims.<br />Large screws did not work to hold the top mounts in place, you must use bolts.<br /><br />I read reviews stating that i only takes 15 minutes,  maybe a hour. Cost me a lot to have a shop install it.<br />The tank itself is nice, and arrived in fine shape. Good quality product, would buy one that fits next time.
B00FQHY64S|1|I must have gotten a bottle from a defective batch or something because this spray didn't work as advertised. It actually left such bad streaks and white residue that I had to wash it off my car with a professional matte paint job. With that said their matte auto wash works really well...
B0043063JU|5|Great value
B000UKD5PC|5|Does the job
B00EFYGKT2|5|Easy installation looks great
B009YYC3QM|4|Considering how inexpensive they were, I was pleasantly surprised to see how &#34;high end&#34; these floor mats look. Of course, the main concern with a new product like this is how well it wears over time, and I won't know that until more time has passed.  But so far, so good.
B0006H8PIG|5|Replaced the OEM turn signal lights on the 07 for focus with these because the amber coating was starting to flake away. Came off a little brighter than what they were replacing. These bulbs will probably out last my car.
B00C3NA2VE|5|Works great, would purchase again, no problems!
B004L0AAQY|5|Bench tested them and they seem very bright and very inexpensive!!  Will be using them with a snow plow. Very well packaged when shipped.
B002L9J0JU|5|These look great and are perfect because they bolt on so they won't just fall off. My husband installed them in 20 minutes...looks perfect!
B006926MKA|5|I bought this for my niece who is in the military. I liked the pin a lot and love the look of it.<br />I know she will be happy to get it when she comes home.
B000IZ4ANA|5|This was very easy to install and it fit like the original. Great price compare to similar products and operated smoothly.
B007JRK09S|5|They are very comfortable. Made of a good material and look great on top of my black leather seats. My only complaint is they werent free ;)
B000CITKCE|5|Slow rate trickle charge is an excellent way to maintain batteries seasonal or occasional use vehicles. It's an instrumental part of getting the most stretching battery life as long as possible. Lack of periodic charging not only results in unreliable dead batteries but also drastically shortens battery life span. Used religiously, this product will pay for it's in just a few seasons. You can use it for a life time.    Trying to think green, I invested in one of those solar cell chargers to compliment my occasional use toys. I also invested in replacing 2 batteries with extra short life spans as a result. I'm now back to the tried and true.    If you are attempting to revive dead batteries, this trickle charge may not be forceful enough for a battery to start taking a charge again. In this case, you still need a regular charge to shock it first even if just for a few minutes. Thank god for the status light indicators on this system. They are accurate and should be monitored at key times to determine the state of your batteries. If you are not getting a yellow charge indicator, your dead battery needs a better connection, more water/acid or a more force full charge first.
B002O00GM6|5|good product
B000CNJKE2|4|Product is as stated in description and installs easily with good instructions.  I would buy this product again and it is priced well.
B0016I09YM|5|worked great for repairing fog lights
B005A9VU6Y|5|Fit in my van all good. It used to be blowing hot air and now it works great, thanks!! Highly recommended!!!
B002KODT7U|5|Essential for the motorcycle
B001AWM3C0|1|First of all - it will not charge a dead battery - battery must have at least 7 volts, which only means you have to put your battery on a standard charger for an hour or so and then put this charger on.<br /><br />Second - it states it is supposed to desulfate batteries / restore them - I have yet to confirm this after charging 7 different batteries<br /><br />third - for some reason it does not like interstate batteries - I tried 2 of them and it would not work on them unless I went through a few differnent steps<br /><br />forth - I tried 2 different dry cell batteries - would not charge either on<br /><br />fifth - on deep cycle batties it took over 7 days to charge it up - after a full charge I put it back on a week later and showed only a 50% charge<br /><br />It might be fine for maintaining batteries and I like the fact I can charge 2 batteries at the same time - would I buy it again - no.  The reason is I wanted a charger that would desulfate my batteries and this one does not perform that function, or at least to my satisfaction.  I was trying to avoid spending big money - but you get what you pay for.<br /><br />I would not recommend this charger unless you just wanted a trickle charger<br /><br />I was going to give it 3 stars but after reading my review - I knocked it down to 2 - just does not messure up to the ad hipe.  If only if worked half as good as it sounded<br /><br />update: 1/17/13 - - product states 14+ volts but only charges up to 13.  I have tried 6 different batteries and it has not worked an any of them.  As soon as I put them in my truck they went dead.  The starter would not even ingage.  This charger brings them up to - what it calls - a full charge but when I put on my Yuasa YUA1200901 Smart Shot Battery Charger it says they are not fully charged.  I will be using my Smart charger on the 6 batteries that this charger would not charge and see if there is a difference.  I will update this review in 3 days
B0030GDLTI|5|The starter worked better than the one that came on the original starter.<br />Price was great compared to other parts stores.
B001GH5OBG|5|I installed this kit on my 1999 Jeep Wrangler in about an hour. Very easy to install and fairly straightforward instructions. Just make sure you lay everything out first and look at the part numbers and compare them to the diagrams so you are sure you are using the right part for each mount. I did have to open up the holes on for the mounts on the sides of the body, but only by a 1/16th of an inch or so. I used a small rounded wrasp/file and less than 30 seconds of hand filing on each hole opened it up enough to fit the new mounts. Great kit.
B00G7HO4O8|4|I like the gloves for breathing feature and protection they offer. Only negative point is that the previous pair did not lat as long as I wanted. Right glove developed hole on the side of index finger. I guess I twist the throttle too much?
B00HA6KACA|5|Perfect sizing and specs! Great price as well.
B000C5HJUW|4|Worked great Thanks Should have got in the first place. OEM parts are the way to go if you want the fit to be better.
B004B7YXOM|5|Plugged it in and entered the pairing code and worked right away have to say this thing is amazing tells me everything I need to know about my car helped clear a old code works perfect don't listen to all these people that Dont know how to use it and leave a bad review buy best money ever spent now don't  have to go to the dealer every time for check engine light 80 bucks a trip thanks!!!!!!!!
B0031BE6OQ|5|Have been searching for months for a saddlebag that fits the 2012 Can Am Spyder.  Seat is 24 inches wide so I needed a saddle bag with ample straps. Didn't want to spend $1000.00 on hard bags.  These come on and off in a minute. If you want saddlebags  that un-install without any nuts and bolts, just velcro, these are perfect. Do not get in the way of the tail lights and do not impede the passenger's legs.  Not huge capacity, but I was looking for some that are slim lined and accent the bike, not big wide ones. These look like they belong there and are very handy and well made. Super easy to install. Just make sure the 2 reflective patches face to the rear. Highly recommended.
B00EZJPXWW|5|Remember, LEDs are not your standard incandescent bulb. LEDs have a polarity, meaning electricity goes through them only one way. If your bulb doesn't work, flip it around and try it again before declaring half don't work.<br />Every one of mine work as has been the case with literally every type and quantity of LED bulbs I have bought on Amazon.
B0002YR6EW|5|Great Stuff
B000H94F6E|5|I recently bought this for my dad and his car(s). So far it works and charges like its supposed to. It does take a little long, so it is better to charge a dead battery over night.
B001OMVCGY|1|Have had 2 set both blew out. Will not buy again.
B00CE42EGS|5|Great!
B000C9SK9W|5|I bought this pump for my carbed 84 Corvette that has an in tank fuel pump.  I bought it to use as a back up pump should my in tank pump go out.  In tank pump would be a pain to replace when away from home so with this small inline pump I can mount it right near the carb in an emergency.  I have a 3/8\\" fuel line attached to each end of the pump so all I have to do is remove two hose clamps from the line at my carb and hook the 42s pump up.  I have two long wires with alligator clips that I use to ground the pump and to power the pump from the battery positive terminal.  This pump WILL pull fuel through a \\"dead\\" in tank pump and I measured 3 psi at the carb. Pump is rated at 4-6 psi.
B00HX0AY9M|5|DelIvered promptly. Exactly as advertised. Product works well. I would recommend both the product and the vendor.
B000GOG3P6|5|This product fit great in my car, worked well in a 1998 plymouth voyager minivan. Had no trouble installing it.
B000CO80PG|1|the 2 filters for my corvette were so drenched in oil that i was afraid they would screw up the mass air flow sensor
B008G32R9K|3|They serve their purpose. But, they vibrate a lot. trying to figure out how to make that stop.... would recommend looking into a better pair that won't vibrate like this
B0049IWMRI|5|Works great, seems strong.  Carried some nice bucks & now doesn't get blood or ticks or hair inside the explorer.  Lifts nicely.
B00TKUL8TI|3|Unit got here on time. Having problems with some of the lights out on it. But it does look good on my truck.
B0034ZNY10|1|Just waste of money, not good product. concept and manufacturing is different. doen't do job. better find the name brand may good for us.
B0002M9RH8|5|This is a complete kit of good quality. I will buy one again when I need it especially at this price.
B000R308RA|1|This lasted until winter weather and then burnt out costing me a new trailer harness and labor. Wiring is to small!
B000BQUJL8|2|Valves do not bypass water heater, with valves set to bypass water or antifreeze does not flow through included hose.  Was going to send them back, but ended up adapting them to work correctly with PEX pipe due to how compact the valves are when installed.
B0031I66HO|5|Identical in Form, Fit and Function as the OEM Gates tensioner on a 2007 Mercedes C280, about $30 less than the same part number at RockAuto. Made in Turkey.
B001BTNKBK|3|Item came in a timely manner. The zipper on the jacket was bad so we shipped it back 5 business days ago and have not received a replacement back. Cute jacket and I hope the zipper is not a problem on the next one.<br /><br />Got my second one in and the zipper had the same problem but it's a cute jacket and I won't be wearing it much so I'll deal with it.
B009DJVHLU|5|Good condition
B0002F69YO|3|This little level works as well as most. Though it is fairly large to be mounted on the outside of an RV I think. To take care of this problem I mounted it on the inside of my LP gas bottle door. Not only is it out of the way it is protected from the elements. It remains easy to use as I only have to open the door when raising or lowering the 5th wheel to see the level.
B007Y4YY70|4|I like it and it fits great.  Good quality, but a little pricey!
B000CITKCE|5|Gets my motorcycle charged, and is a sturdy little device. I'm happy.
B000E7YYDS|5|Durable nozzle. Won't break when you drop it to the ground. I have bought many other fog nozzles (the red plastic ones) and they would break very easily. This one might be doulble the price, but they last more than three times my previous model. I only wish they would make it in the 1''npt
B007LTS6RC|5|Great
B0002KR1Z0|5|I used this Cigarette lighter / jack assembly in my off grid cabin. I wired it into my 12 volt solar system to charge cell phones and other items that take a 12 volt charge. Perfect package, shipped on time !!!
B0082CALNO|5|These door sills look awesome on my 2012 Camaro R/S! The shipping was great and was the best price I could find on the internet!!
B00FBQLAL6|4|The fit was great after making a small ajustment
B001BXKL40|5|It does just what I wanted it to do very happy with this product. I got this for a electric bike
B0023VIMCW|5|It looks really good on the car, the mechanic had no problem installing it, it was a perfect fit. the lights are very clear and bright,I was very impressed, thank you.
B000GV2VW8|5|Nice plow for the money. Work as I expected it to.
B00817T0GE|4|Very nice stickers
B004NYINY4|5|Very good quality 6000K LED lights.  Very bright....  Make sure you have the proper fitting for the insert.  Using it as a signal lights...
B002V0ECX8|5|Took about an hr to install, and pretty easy as well. The step bars look awesome on my 2014 F150 Supercrew!<br /><br />Fast shipping, and all the hardware / brackets were included.
B00KTHT4EW|1|Didn't work
B001Q8DMIW|4|low lint, quality weave. Not real heavy, really need to be pre washed for absorbency to clean glass of for fine detailing.
B000FBRAE8|5|This is an actual quote by \\"Thomas Jefferson\\", you know, one of our founding fathers. I guess he wasn't a patriot either to your narrow mind.
B008U1MOM8|1|THIS Super Mini ELM327 IS  NOT PAIRING WITH ANY DEVICE. PRODUCT COMES DEFECTIVE. NOT RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO USE IT WITH ANDROID DEVICES.
B001GJ3FIS|4|Works as advertised
B008MNYXR8|5|Shipped put fast.  Great
B006K8YQYW|5|Purchased for 05 Ford Escape. Perfect replacement and simple little job. Took two minutes. Tiny screwdriver included which was thoughtful. Also, three times cheaper than from my local parts store!
B001EOWQIA|4|Nice clean unit.  Only complaint is it lacks provision to mount the trailer wiring coupler.  If you order this hitch I suggest also ordering this item: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NYYREC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_10  The hitch is approximately 1.5&#34; lower than the OE hitch.  Direct bolt up and you have to drill two holes in the frame.  Definitely re-torque the bolts after towing, the front bolts on mine had loosened some after towing approx 50 miles.
B0000C6FOM|5|Great product. We are enjoying using them
B000CI6ZHW|5|Factory clutch started chattering at 117K because people will not learn to drive a manual transmission properly.  (Just because you can get the vehicle to move doesn't mean you are necessarily doing it right).  By 120K, it was slipping.  At the time, I couldn't immediately get time off work, so I babied it for another 3 weeks.  The point of all of this is, by the time I got to do the clutch replacement, I knew the original was cooked.  Now, I'm not knocking any machinists out there, but when metal is heated up (overheated) and cooled that many times, it gets hard spots in it.  A thinner, turned down flywheel can dissipate less heat.<br />The point is, for the cost of a new flywheel, it saves running to a machine shop, coming back a day later, paying him in all likelihood half the cost of a new flywheel for the turning, and you may still have a damaged part.  Flywheels have come down in price (like brake rotors) that it really is a no brainer to buy a new one.<br />The ford factory flywheel had a LUK stamp on it.  This is basically and OEM part.  I saw no flaws, nor have any problems arisen in the 4 weeks since it has been installed.<br />Installed LUK 07-179 clutch set with this flywheel.<br />Repair manual says to replace bolts when removing/ installing flywheel.  I did not.  Just blue threadlocker on the old ones.<br />The only downside to all of this is the new clutch system will engage about an inch off the floor.  Still getting used to that!
B00LFL8J9C|5|great parts super fast shipping
B002L15W8G|3|I love the seat cover design.  The peace sign is actually embroidered, not a silk screen. I could not keep them. They were advertised as having Smart Seam technology for side airbags.  When I received them, the box AND the tag on the seat cover said NOT for use on seats with side airbags.  Called Amazon, they thought, maybe old stock, so they sent me another pair.  Same thing, not for side airbags.  So disappointed to send them back.
B002N4MB6W|3|They only lasted about a year before steaks started showing during rain. Usually with the more expensive sets I can get 2 years or more.
B00D3UP9J6|1|I purchased this gas caddy to use around the farm and strap to the trailor when traveling.<br />First the hose is inadequate and I replaced it with a proper hose and nozzle as well.<br />the hand pump lasted 15 gallons before it would no longer prime. I contacted the seller and they informed me my unit was just out of warentee<br />and the manufacturer in China would sell me an improved one. I don't think so<br />beware of this unit!!!!!!!!<br />I replaces the pump with an electric one and it works fine...now I just have to fill the tires with foam as they leak
B00HZOC23W|2|I found these mats to be extremely slippery. My foot would regularly slide as I was driving (even in my hiking shoes) and items on the floor of the backseat would slide from side to side while driving. The edges of the rear mat didn't stay put and I would hook my foot on the side of the mat while getting in and out. Needless to say, I returned these and purchased floor mats from my dealership. I definitely prefer the mats from the dealership.
B0033203YK|4|Priced right, but I'm still searching for the perfect back cushion, one that is made for my back.  Usually, I'll use a small pillow to get the right firmness.  I even went so far as to open the stitching on a pillow, and remove some material, just to get the right support.
B008OEPHQG|5|Great value!
B0051ZHC9Q|5|I've had a significant leak in my 1998 Acura 3.2TL (315k miles) for about a year now. The cost of replacing the rack just isn't worth it so I treat the symptom with frequent topping up of the power steering fluid.  I had been going through at least 20 ounces of off-the-shelf Honda-rated fluid from Advance Auto at around $7 per 12 oz for the past year.  Once I switched to this, not only did my cost per ounce cut by a quarter, I've reduced the frequency of filling, having only consumed less than a quart in 4 weeks.  Anecdotal, but I think this is actually better tolerated by my steering system.  Great value and no more running dry.
B00AWXJQYG|5|Very easy to install and my car looks good. Looks sportier and works what it should be. The side skirts is very flexible and yet looks sturdy from distance.
B00JNWDUQM|5|I love it!
B000BUTD9S|3|You get what you pay for. Compared to my friends wrap rugs I don't see these lasting very long. Our steps aren't square so the buckle up some, but do the job.
B00LPOS64M|5|Perfect fit cover for your C7.
B001AZUAQS|4|Love it, good quality and very nice gift for my husband's Christmas stocking. He loves the look and feel. Great gift
B000T02H98|1|I was looking for a cover that would go from ground to ground so I bought this one since the size was listed. I needed a 72\\" wide by 72\\" high but this was only 59\\" wide by 59\\" high in actual measurements. I had to go thru expense returning it.
B000GOG3MO|5|My ac works better then it did brand new :) plus it saved me hundreds of dollars from having to go to a mechanic. Thanks :)
B00H4Y91BE|1|Did not fit my Q7 key.
B00D42AFS8|5|Perfect and needed item for motorcyclist that get on the road.  Not only can it jump your suv or bike it can charge and power your other electronics.  Very small compact package that can easily be stored under a seat or saddle bag.
B005NFHTEM|5|This is a nice product and worth buying and is worth buying if you are willing to wait a few days to get the product to save a lot of money. They stop good and they look like they will last a while.
B0000AY4YX|5|If you have a lot of oxidation on your RV that needs some TLC then I highly recommend this product.  I have a 5th wheel trailer that had been sitting out in the sun for a long time and I used this to get all the oxidation off of it.  It took one pass with my buffer to get off most of the oxidation but had to make a second application on the really bad areas.  Following this with the polish & then wax protectant from Meguiar's made my trailer look like it just came off the showroom floor!
B002RB849O|1|How can ONE plastic \\"paint can\\" cost $45.00? It must be a great one. Nowhere in the product description does it say this is for a case of them or how many are in the case if that is the reason it is so expensive.
B00353PWAW|5|I am a normal guy that washes his car every two weeks, I have bought Armor All, Turtle wax, and Meguiars shampoos and althought they are all great i believe this one is the best!<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- I get a lot of bubbles with very little soap, I can wash my car with two cap full of this concentrated soap!<br /><br />- Smells GREAT!<br /><br />-Car comes out shining bright!<br /><br />-Not too expensive<br /><br />- I prefer it over Meguairs Gold Class car wash<br /><br />- Would recommend to the average guy that just wants a nice clean car
B007HRX7HW|5|Had a difficult time finding this but when did price was excellent and exact replacement
B000C2Y6KG|5|works better than oem for 04 Nissan frontier excellent
B005EB6N8S|4|Very handy :-)

B002HEOMF6|4|This is a nice replacement for the frame which advertises the dealership. Easy to install and very high quality construction.

B0009JKGJ2|2|I was in my local auto store Saturday and decided to pick up some rubbing compound to hopefully buff out a few minor scratches and imperfections on my truck. There wasn't as much to choose from (I had looked at several kinds on Amazon a few days prior). I had a choice between the Turtle for $3.99 and Mother's and two others starting at $12.99. I remember seeing decent reviews for the Turtle, coupled with the difference in price, I made it my selection. Big mistake.<br /><br />I remember the compounds I've used in the past as being pretty thick. This stuff was like butter at room temperature. It did remove SOME of the very minor, almost insignifigant, surface scratches and blemishes, BUT only after a whole lot of elbow grease. I was extremely disappointed in this products ability to do little more than remove waterspots. To add insult to injury, I had to rewax the areas where I used the compound. I know this is a two step process, with the addtional waxing, but I felt like I was having to do extra work for lackluster results from the compound. It did bring some bling back to the red paint, but again, not enough for the effort I had to apply.<br /><br />Thankfully, it was only $4 (get what you pay for), so I'm only out time spent. I'm going to pick up something a little more substantial next time around.
B000HZFDPU|4|2012 AUDI S5    So I have this 4 wheels drive car and last winter slipped on ICE at 5 mile per hr and hit the curb, believe me owners of S5 it broke whole bunch of axle / suspension components. something to do with performance parts . 14000 $ worth of damage fixed by insurance off course. For folks who want to know, the tire were stock 255/35/19 I think is the size, Perrili Russo Zero. Not suppose to be driven in winter let alone ice. I know. Fast forward to this winter I live in little Rock, Ar. Where it only snows twice a year but it becomes a ice skating ring, hence starts my search, determined not to have a repeat of this, look into several options 1) winter tires 2) Thule chains 3) Thule K summit 4) Finally the winner SCC super Z6.....  several reasons for choosing this  1) do not need / want to put on and off winter tires for 2 days in a year .. Although remains the best answer to the problem. too lazy to store tires/ put them on and off/ I have a sports car for a reason, dedicated winter tires just would not cut it for 2-3 days / yr use for me. If I was where it snows more then I would def invest in them.  2) THULE K summit has mixed reviews / quite expensive/ does fit this car... folks complaining of this falling off?? / other Thule products need more clearance  3) Now this one. took it out , put it on the front tires, goes on fine, drove 5 yards, put the car up on jack and look underneath unfortunately does slightly touch the struts.. took it off, tried on rear tries, smaller suspension assembly. Goes on fine. takes about 2 min per tire. drove on the dry road around the block at 5 miles/hr .  no noise, no touching the wheel assembly. do not think would scratch the alloy wheels. Of note on the dry road the car was bumping like crazy almost to a scary point. Looks okay; do not think would stand up to serious abuse, I did not buy them for serious abuse anyhow. I suppose the bumping on dry road would go away with ICE/SNOW on road. Would not DREAM of driving iton dry road.....  Bottom line:::: goes on rear tires only. not a perfect solution. But after extensive search for months, this is only one I came up with short of winter tires/ chain combination.... Again working on ICE not SNOW.  Hope this helps someone.... will update after real word use..
B0067UBT9S|5|as we got our rear motor mount replaced, we found out that we needed this one replaced as well. so glad we looked here, since the price for both was below any other quotes we had gotten.
B0012I9I98|5|My husband is a rural route mail carrier and has had this light on his Jeep for over two years now and it still works great, and this is while running it 6 days a week, 6 to 7 hours (or more) each day. This light is BY FAR the best utility light he has ever bought, in the past he has replaced the other models within a few weeks or a couple of months. We made the mistake of buying a similar product just a month ago trying to save a few dollars but half of the light has stopped working already, and it wasn't a cheap LED light. He will be going back to this light. Yes, we would recommend it.
B00305ABYC|5|Easy to change.  Fits perfect, looks stock.  Did not need to program mine as stated in the description.  Plugged it in and everything works fine.

B00030CY5G|5|They got the job done. They are a little large fitting around a 4 gauge wire but they crimped on just fine so no complaints.<br /><br />10/12/2014 So a bit of an update.  There has been no corrosion thus far. I am using these under the hood of my vehicle as the mains wiring connection points and have been really impressed that there is no corrosion yet. They are holding up very well. I highly recommend these if your looking for ring terminals. Again the only gripe is that they are slightly larger than necessary but that is to accomodate fitting over the jacket of your wiring but will work fine for a cold weld.
B007IW6WIW|5|Fits perfectly
B003ZWISLS|5|The handle looked pretty much the same as the original Toyota part that it replaced except that it is unpainted. The part was fairly simple to install, and there are some fairly good instruction available online as well as YouTube videos. If you are not comfortable with an unpainted handle there are some online sources for custom mixed spray paint if you'd like to go that route. That might get the cost up close to the price of an OEM handle however. Shipping for the part was fast.
B002I0GYZU|5|Awesome Plugs and best price on Amazon!
B000JSXTSS|1|the front of this flaps when you are driving,and it as tight as we can get it, it is even starting to rip.
B001JL426C|3|Box is just ok. It arrived dented and the hinge was not riveted in 1 spot. I did fix it. Locking mechanism is good but opener shocks are temperamental. I tend to wonder if it is a knockoff. I have other Deezee products and they seem a lot sturdier.
B003LS15XY|5|all good
B000P6KWO8|4|Easy to install and add lots of extra lights where you needed them.  Like the looks of them and were not expensive
B00AGK2AQQ|5|well done
B00029WSVI|5|Ordered it for my husbands ford explorer, fit perfectly and installed with a screw driver . For 5 bucks with prime what a great deal. Gets the job done
B007YLIK2S|4|Our family recliner is back in business with this replacement
B0097GSD5W|4|arrived quickly and works well
B00HV2CKZ8|5|It's works good could fit a little tighter but it was cheaper than the rest so it's a win.
B000DN7T3A|5|Installed on a 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse. Went from the weak &#34;meep meep&#34; sound reminiscent of the Roadrunner from Looney Tunes, to a much more noticeable tone that will definitely get your attention because its not what you would expect on a smaller car.
B004JBYYNA|5|I bought a set of these for my sons truck and liked them so much that i bougt a set for my truck.<br />Great product
B0071NQRFQ|5|The product works well and is well built, but it is also heavy and large.  I own a top ten stolen car in the city with the highest auto theft in the nation (Modesto).  I feel this is a great first layer in a security system. Goes on easy and the special lock cylinder is EXTREMELY resistant to picking.....But the USA distributor is no longer in business and getting extra keys ( 3 sent with product)  is a real issue, an the English distributor is asking $35 for the first key and $10 for any beyond that.
B00B79XIQ6|5|Great little shade! I bought one for my new midsized car and then I bought one for my daughter's new van. Fits both great! It is adorable!
B002S9Z9EI|5|VROOM
B007TL0P6M|5|I purchased mats from the dealer that were snow  an water .... Not they were flat a had no lip to hold water when the snow melts on my boots . Returned them an found these an they are Great ! They fit perfect , an could probably hold one inch of water! .  If you give as a gift tell them because they come with photos all over the boxes ! Delivered on time & Yes you should buy them ! Oh no rubber smell an they don't leave marks from your shoes
B00080QHMM|4|it does the work
B000EALHH6|5|This is the cleaner I've been waiting for. Despite the instructions, I use it undiluted on glass and stainless steel primarily, and it works wonders at removing tacky resins.
B0023VBPBC|5|Good packaging on these headlights - definitely cheaper than buying this part local. Fit like a champ and works great as an OEM replacement product.
B000CNJ6JG|5|Delivery was excellent and I am happy to find this old stuff made fresh.
B00066UKMG|2|Ok, so considering the amount of work to replace these things, they should last longer There are too many comments here and on other sites that confirm the lifespan of this replacement part is very poor.  Therefore the part is kind of a waste of time. Does anyone know a better quality part source that isn't very expensive? Somewhere on YouTube I saw a video about a $50 part for the pair; that seems way to high.
B007EETS6M|5|This tool is exactly what is needed to do the timing correctly on a 2001 Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder.  After weeks of the local Ford/Mitsubishi dealership messing up my timing by not using one of these, I purchased this and did the timing myself.<br /><br />Without this tool, the timing from the dealership was so far off it wasn't even funny (5 teeth in the front, 8 on the back on the V6).<br /><br />Completed this repair about a year ago, and the timing is still right on it's mark.  If you ever work on an Eclipse timing or know anyone who might, you need this tool.
B002XM5G70|3|Purchased this pump as  areplacement for the cheapo one that came with my RV. Have not installed it yet. Will wait until the Spring. Looks okay.
B003CMIH2Q|5|Bought for son; he's a HUGE Walking Dead fan. He LOVED it!!!
B000KL365K|5|Fit's my 04 IMPREZA WAGON like a glove.  Either it does or does not, not much to review here except that it works!
B000C2EC6Y|5|Just as would expect from FelPro
B008HIVREK|5|Everyone loved this sticker on my truck. Someone even liked it so much they stole it! I want another one but I'm afraid that they may take that one too.
B00D2K1Z6S|5|As described, works great, fast shipping
B00094I1SA|3|This is a space saver, but the only way it's really effective is if you separate all the plates before you put them in the holder, and even then, as the holder empties, you get more than one plate unless you are careful.  It's a good idea, but the edges that hold the plates in need to be a little wider.
B003Z4BBSI|4|These goggles did get slightly foggy when at a standstill but once you get going they get cleared up. They are also amber colored so they are difficult to see with at night, so keep that in mind before purchasing. They felt fairly comfortable and are easily adjustable. It also came with a little bag to place the goggles into.
B000GV6TPS|4|This was actually the model for a Harley, but it works well with my Yamaha.  I had two steel mesh lines made with AN fittings, then attached it to the ORK.  Simple and straight forward.
B000Q073FY|4|Right Part!
B00CMP3Z4E|5|Giving it 5 because it works. I swear I must have used it about 10 times already on both cars and motorcycles. I am happy with this purchase. BTW, I jumped a PT Cruiser, Scion XB, and a Yamaha motorcycle.
B007G2KSUW|5|Best boat cleaner ever
B0023UPORY|5|perfect
B000G72UOQ|4|Fits in my 2009 Prius. Does the job but isn't fancy.
B009FNXAXM|3|Nice bars but brackets are a little light for the weight and size of the bars. More brackets per side of heavier brackets would be an improvement.  Installation easy and look great.
B0009H519Y|5|If you are a fan of turning crappy dirty metals into shinny &#34;like new&#34; objects then order this product right this minute! I was about to toss some tarnished candle sticks then I came across a video on youtube where an everyday Joe demonstrates how he uses this to polish whatever tarnished metals he has and it worked like magic. I figured why not give it a try for under $8.<br /><br />Works great, quickly and easily. I suggest you get some gloves and lots and lots of little rags, because it is so quick and easy that you will have a hard time stopping until you run out of rags.
B004SSEF56|5|Better then I expected, very sturdy, also detaches which is always a plus, thick material, real metal nit the cheap kind
B000N4UQL6|2|I purchased this item as a gift for my boyfriend, but it turned out I had misunderstood him and ordered the wrong item.  When I went to return it (the very same day it arrived) I got the message<br /><br />  &#34;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.

B00032KBFE|5|Very good purchase.  Extremely good product.  Highly recommend.
B00EOV1X98|1|The product was so poorly packaged, from the manufacturers, there was more product in the package than in the spray bottle of actual product. So I never got to use it .  Usually Chemical Guys is on their game but for SS6 it was game over... so disappointed after spending over $105 for nothing...the marketing is spot on, it is 100% invisible!
B00N2K6M2A|2|Not happy! Don't get me wrong it does work but it is not what was advertized.
B007EERHYM|5|On time and as said.
B000CSNO44|5|Excellent products. Highly recommend.
B00KLKS8O4|1|Do not buy from caltric. Part failed in less then 3 months... We're going to try this zoom zoom
B000C8ZGHC|5|Free shipping on parts like this are what make them 5 stars.  Yes places like Rock Auto have it slightly cheaper, but with shipping the price is the same, plus with Prime you get it in two days and returns (if necessary) are a breeze.  Fits 2000 Cherokee perfectly.  Very well made.
B004Q19SXY|1|Made a purchase, and it was not as described.  They said I would get a refund 9/1--- 30 days later, nothing!  Don't do business with Tom's or Amazon!
B002CYNS10|4|the clear ones broke and we had to replace them.
B005FTW69E|5|THANKS .Everthink is okey.
B000C59SJW|5|The shocks are great every thing  i thought thay be.
B00S1UTN6S|5|delivered on time, product as described.
B002SZAEBK|2|This isn't a huge rack, it won't hold as much as those big, rectangular racks.  But it's a decent amount of storage space, definitely suits my needs.  It's a very nice looking rack on the TRX700xx, the shape really flows with the quad.  It went on very easy, took 5 or 10 minutes.  It feels very strong and durable, I've pushed down a lot of weight on it and used it to pick up the rear to drag it around into the trailer.  Only issue I had was that shipping was longer than expected, and since there appears to be only one seller of this item I'll go ahead and add this to the product review.  It wasn't horrible though, just went a week or two over the shipping time frame.  I'm patient and I ordered it well in advance of our next time out riding so it wasn't a big issue for me.  I still feel it's worth it though, the 700xx is a pretty stylish looking quad and it should have a stylish looking rack the fits with the angles.    Edit: Dropped score from 5 to 2-stars after about 5 trips out to the desert. After more use rack doesn't support much weight at all. At this point, with hardly any weight at all, rack drops down after a bit of fast, rough riding. I've tightened up the bolts but I'll end up having to make some of my own modifications to make it unable to move up and down like that at all. Not a great design in that respect, it should be pretty much locked in at the height instead of only relying on tightness of the bolts. The price is too high for what it is and how it works.
B000CMGVJ0|5|Love them
B005VWRAIC|5|Worked perfectly.<br />Solved my problem
B001EA0LVS|2|YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR CHEAP. WOULD NOT BUY THESE AGAIN. NOT WORTH RETURNING. VERY CHEAPLY MADE WILL NOT LAST
B0015357RW|5|excellent
B0002KKHS8|4|Seems to work pretty well.
B002UYF1NU|5|This is working great resolved my pump issues was easy install. Flushed the system as recommended haven't had any issues.
B004EDF8HY|4|The resistors were exactly what I needed and easy to install. The resistors did not come with any installation instructions for the application they were sold to correct. I had to google how to install. The resistors work as promised and I am very happy I bought them.
B00189BJWU|4|I Love how it looks, makes it looks tougher
B005ZZOE6Q|5|Great product.
B00HYKHLD8|4|They fit and they look awesome
B004S5D4EM|5|I really like the ride quality of this tire, cornering is also great, i have this tire on a bmw k1200s  and really makes me feel secure with the correct grip and stopping capabilities of the z8, I would highly recommended.
B00HED2C34|5|Perfect fit and well made! Made in the USA to!! A bit wider than the stock flaps. Husky brand products are all nice!
B000E3CYJ8|3|like it but it was to big
B007GZIWAM|5|Nice
B000I1VWIK|4|Unfortunately they did not send me the item PICTURED (with the Velcro adjustment strap.) I don't mind that much tho, I had the same solid-plastic version on my previous MCs and they work fine, just a little difficult to adjust.<br /><br />Apart from that, the Throttle Rocker is literally one of **the best** inexpensive upgrades you can buy for your motorcycle. I'm pretty happy with it, hand fatigue is gone now. :-)
B000CMHSU6|4|good fit  easy installation
B00SLYCNXE|5|Great product, Works great....
B00IZK4AH6|5|I was super scared to buy something like this off line but to find out it was much cheaper than the auto parts store I just had to give it try. To start off the shipping was great! Came right on time &' both parts were there &' not damaged . I was surprised to see such a big box i didn't know shocks were that huge ! Lol .<br />My mechanic had no problem putting the shocks on &' they perfectly for my 2005 Vibe . If I ever need any other parts for my car I will check here first.
B00TOLYU48|5|Got 3 days before vacation. Drove 1500 miles round trip and never had a problem. I took a risk with zero reviews and am glad I did. Very sturdy and little shake. Excellent price for hitch rack. Holds 3 bikes cozy. Love that it comes with lock so no extra purchase required. Even includes straps to tie wheels. Love that it leans so can get in back door and folds down if you want to keep it on though its light and easy to remove. We love it!!
B00FSC31MY|5|Good stuff
B00MG687JW|5|Awesome gadget! It was mailed right as I found out that my car battery happened to be dead,  came fully charged,  and easily jumped my car. I've used it camping to keep important  devices charged.  I take it with me every time my friends and I are doing a road trip.  It's very useful.     I am getting one for my little sister,  this battery is great :)
B005ETHSB6|4|Axle is great.  Thicker shaft than stock.<br /><br />DO NOT USE THE SUPPLIED BOLTS!  They will shear before factory torque specs are reached!
B00B9HOQVC|5|You can't beat this jack for the price. Lifts my travel trailer more easily and quietly than the unit that came with my trailer. Install is a snap. Highly recommended. Its only about 150.00 cheaper than most replacements.
B000C3BB6M|4|I have 4 of these on my 69 Buick. One controls a very large 30 AMP Fan mounted to the radiator as my primary Fan (On at 160)constant powered. One controls another 2 smaller fans mounted to the radiator as my secondary fans (On at 190) ignition only. One controls a remote oil cooler fan mounted behind the front grill. Another one controls a transmission cooler fan mounted behind the oil cooler. These are really great when you get them dialed in. dual outputs and you can beef up the relays to 50 AMP. Iv had them stop working and not come on at temp. Iv had them get stuck on. Iv had them get totally spastic. I do not put a lot of miles on the car and at first I was really mad about the failure rate. I replaced a couple of them completely and these also failed. Enough was enough. I started trouble shooting them on the car and discovered what was going bad was the radiator probes. They either short out or they stop working above 190 deg. I ordered some temp probes off of Digikey. Much higher quality! and they cost around 8.00 each. The bloody replacement probes from Derale are like 13.50 and they are the same garbage probes that hayden uses. You can order whatever length size temp range and style you want. Being an electronics guy I didnt have a problem figuring it out. I forget what the ohms were on the probes (I think they were 10k)I measured one at work before I purchased some replacements. I soldered the wires from these probes to the wires from the unit and used heat shrink tubing to make clean. I dont want to take a chance of the wires coming apart. It's too bad the product is getting such a bad rap from these probes. If you put a switch on the green wire to ground you can turn on the fans manually if they take a dump. My Riv is 500 HP Pro street with an electric water pump and full electronic ign. I can't afford to blow it up. I tried the Derales and I hate them because the temp adjustment is way inside the case, and is an Absolute retarded design. I give the Hayden system 4 stars but the probes are 0 stars.
B00026Z3EK|5|Torin Heavy Duty Garage Jack was received in great condition as promised.  Delivery was on time as promised.  I was able to follow included instructions to assemble jack for use.
B000L7QZ0Q|5|I purchased the flaring tool almost a year ago to be able to double-flare several fittings on 3/8&#34; copper tube gas line and again recently to double-flare 1/2&#34; copper tubing for a gas line used in a garage heater installation. The tool works great and would recommend it to others.
B00J036R3M|3|For the money, they are what they are. I purchased these because my car has the older, yellowish angel eyes and the right side went out. I figured I would give these a shot since they were cheap and later purchase a more expensive set. They look really good in low light situations such as on a cloudy day, late evening, or in a parking garage, but they are not that bright in daylight. Again, you shouldn't expect them to be anywhere close to the newer LED angel eyes on newer BMW's, but for the money they are just fine. I will probably keep them in longer than expected because they look ok and its just not worth the effort to go through the trouble of changing them out. With that being said, if one ever blows, I will probably purchase a brighter set.
B00KI1L5BO|5|Very Good  Very Bright
B001R9WQ32|4|These don't get very dark in direct sunlight, and they fog up pretty easily. The fit is good on me (larger head) and good quality.
B0016LFWFK|1|Stopped working after about a month. Another one didn't work right out of the box. not worth the money that's for sure
B00BPZG28I|5|:) Excellent!
B004ULDGW4|5|everything went well
B0009N0XM8|5|Thank you. I really like the mats which will allow me to clean them more easily.
B003IS3HV0|4|Ordered this to condition my leather sofa and chair and the stuff works great. Highly recommended, and use it with some leather saddle soap for a great combo.
B000WMCJPK|5|Easy to install works better then I thought it would was shipped rite away one of the best jacks I have had to use for my trailers two thumbs up
B00KLKL6ES|2|Got here fast but leaks a lot
B00BQWQN1Q|5|Awesome product a++
B0045G09TC|1|It is not  a wallet chain it is a key chain not very good quality Chinese junk
B004I5O658|5|Looks awesome.  Everything I wanted!
B000YJDC6Q|4|This lights add a lot of visibility to your bike and look cool. They are cheap and work great.  They come with extra batteries that was an added plus!
B002FDMFRQ|5|I've used these for years and if you're front forks are seeping and you don't want to spend a bunch replacing seals-this is you're ticket.
B003V94KIK|1|For the time I received the wrench i have to rotate the wheels of a trailer, so perfect moment to use it.  the first 3 nuts of the first wheel it worked ok but with the 4 it started to spin off.  This is a toy to screw or unscrew soft nut not for car wheels.
B009ZSKNEG|4|This extension is a necessity if you are going to use the Gen-Turi exhaust on a 5th wheel toy hauler like my Heartland Cyclone. It extends the stack just the right height above the trailer.
B001FJ4WYA|5|IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL. GOOD PRICE AND QUALITY
B004GDV4IY|5|Product was well packaged and works as advertised.
B00BRL73Z6|5|Perfect fit..my wife loves them.
B000GU5OTG|5|Be sure to look at the measurements as they look bigger when you put them on.<br /><br />These are nice and heavy and easy to see with!
B00267PZUK|5|This tool is engineered  to the exact needs. It does the job quickly and efficiently.  I had 4 of 8 plugs broken. It paid for itself after 1 plug..
B001BSBE6Y|5|As usual saved over half the cost of going to the dealer to get this item for my wife's car. Perfect fit came with clamps. easy to change. Don't know how I can sell this any better same as OEM but you save so much money.
B0031B4YU2|4|I use these for my Hoover twin tanks hand held steamer.  They grip the loosened dirt and absorb very well.  Washing is a breeze although some stain don't come out but they are a good bargain.  I also used as a towel for my wet dogs and they did a good job drying them.  Size is generous does not shed.
B002HSEGTY|5|As soon as I opened the box I could tell they were great quality. Instructions could have been better since there is a technique to applying these. I found a video on how to install the rocker trim before I installed these which helped me to get them just perfect. Peel and stick sounds easy but these are long and also go over the edge which makes vertical and horizontal surfaces to attach to. Just peel back the first inch on both and position the sill . While holding it in place pull the plastic cover on the 3m tape from the sill. This should help to get the sill exactly where you want it. I love the look very nice.
B004LWVEKS|4|this is better than a bulky battery charger.  It works nicely if you have an extended period of time in which to work.
B00APXHY6K|5|Fits perfectly into the stock grille, gives the grille and truck a more cleaner and more aggresive look to it.
B000WGBNW6|1|Piece of junk!  insertion tool tip broke on second helicoil install, wasnt even using force.  I guess if you want to only use it once it will work but that is it.
B006HYGZJI|5|The fit and finish of these gloves are outstanding. I have a second pair of riding gloves from one other company although these are far superior in quality. Good hand protection in the right places. The double cuff is fantastic to prevent any airflow to your arms. The price was right for the quality. These will be good ridding gloves for touring due to being wind and water proof, although breathable. I would recommend these gloves for anyone riding in early spring, fall or touring.
B002SIR91A|4|Have you ever gotten out of work only to find that you've been plowed into your parking spot?  This is the perfect shovel.  It doesn't take up much space in your trunk, and it works on even heavy snow.
B000688VNE|5|Great jacks and operates as designed. I will admit that this in not the safest design but sometimes nothing else will work. Have been using this style jack since I was a kid on the farm. Everyone has on of these in the back of their truck.
B00557LMYG|5|Perfect it works great
B0082A9QSW|4|Fits well.  Came with needed fasteners, and uses existing holes.... so no drilling needed.  Simple installation.  Recommend over VW OEM product due to drastic savings!
B000WJFWSY|5|They are nice and tacky, even when a bit wet. They absorb the vibration well and last well. The wire grooves are handy too.
B0085YFJ8Q|2|I have used this several times and each time I find red residue all over my car.  I'm disappointed that it doesn't live up to it's online review.
B004XH67B2|5|Fit my D4800 XS Power battery with no issues.
B000P7O5DG|5|This is great it allows you to bring in gps and down load updates on your desktop or use while on home mapping out paths
B001AIZ5HY|5|After trying internet BLOG suggestions (toothpaste etc...) and another kit purchased from PeP Boys, which did absolutely nothing I bought this headlight cleaner as my last ditch attempt at DIY etc.  AND..............it completely worked.  I had (notice...PAST tense) medium level fogged headlights. Following the directions exactly as written headlights now look brand new and very bright. Don't use a lower-power drill. Make sure it is the kind of drill specified that plugs in. One word of warning...........be sure to thoroughly tape over the outer area of the headlights.  I used three levels of painters blue tape because the drill with the sandpaper pad could very easily rip through and damage your paint job.<br /><br />Bottom Line: this product ACTUALLY works.  I really liked how the sand paper attachments attached by VELCRO and not by adhesive. A stroke of genius on Dupont's part. So............if you want save a couple hundred in cash (I was ready to pay this) you can do this yourself if your patient and expect to complete this in about 2 hours or so you WILL have brand new headlights and you will have saved yourself a bunch of cash.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00DNX94E4|3|Small, but inexpensive.
B002IC5M2E|5|left, left, left i wish they would include this in the description. Good part and has castlenut with cotterpin included.
B00DYSDSJU|1|WILL NOT FIT 2011 ACURA MDX WITHOUT MODIFICATION!  The stealth plastic covering the wiper must be cut to fit which defeats the purpose of this item.  Stay with a normal wiper.
B000BKJDKM|5|Used this to run to my back strobe light in my sliding window for plowing. Plenty of length for my quad cab. Hooked it into my 3 outlet  adapter.  Works great so far!
B0058P3J5U|2|In the process of returning it since it didn't fit too large
B0056A50PY|5|Good
B00YVHGTBM|1|I purchased this and when I realized it didn't work on 2012 Lexus IS f it was to late to cancel order
B00EVXE9F4|5|Great stuff
B000G1568Y|5|This with a Magnaflo exhaust is just awesome. Performance inhanced, sound is incredible and I know it's improved my gas mileage. A must buy!
B005JVNQPQ|4|This product is great it works as advertised... I bought this for my Honda cbr 600 f4i  2005 gas tank and lets just say I watched the rust just fall off. Great product... I would have giving them a 5 but they would not ship this to me in Japan.. So I had to buy and ship it a friend to have them ship it to me.. SMH but it did get to them fast...
B001O01ARW|1|Timken is typically a good, recommended brand.  Installed two of these on front of my van last year.  Last week, I had 3 MIL faults on this vehicle, ABS, TRACTION SYSTEM, STABILITY SYSTEM.  Took to repair shop and was told there was no electrical speed signal whatsoever coming from right front wheel bearing and they recommended replacement.  I purchased a new wheel bearing locally and installed it on my own and this fixed the problem.  Contacted Amazon seller & explained situation and asked if there was any warranty whatsoever, received no response so I am taking that as a NO.  Would not expect warranty for mechanical wear, etc. but believe that this wheel bearing should not have had an electrical failure.  Buying locally, at a higher price, got me a 3-year warranty.  Guess you get what you pay for...
B004TRC5E4|5|Great brush- works on about anything other than wheels. I would definitely recommend this brush for all your detail needs.
B00FPL10WQ|5|the part was a breeze to install. Even though on Amazon a note popped up saying this part does not fit your 2005 Cadillac. The price was far cheaper than anywhere else I could find.
B0009FB7DA|5|This is a direct replacement for the 56070 Fifth Wheel Wiring Harness.  I search everywhere for a direct replacement and finally stumbled on this while comparing photos to the broke one on my harness.  I have not seen anyplace that discloses this information so I thought I would add it as a review.  I emailed Curt twice to find out the product number and they never responded.  The product is great, but the company that makes it need to start responding to customer questions.
B0046KHZYO|5|We received the Roof Rack Cross Bars and installed immediately, they were an easy install.  We love them and we love the price. The only thing that we did not like is the loud noise that they make as we are driving, you can hear the wind.  I don't know if all Roof Racks Cross Bars make this noise or if it is just these ones.  We are still very happy with them and were easy to install.
B00D3HZWNW|5|These are quality riding shoes.  I am very happy with the shoe and I would recommend these shoes to anyone.  They are low profile and look like normal shoes instead of robot boots.  They are flexible but do have some weight to them.  The only thing I would say is that the size chart is a little off. I wear a 11 and the chart says to purchase a 45 European size for a US 11.  I did exactly this and the boots I received were massive.  I then returned them and bought a size 44 Euro and they fit perfectly.  45 = 12  and  44 = 10.5.  I rated this a 5 stars for the product itself.  I would give the overall experience of getting the correct size 3 stars due to the fact that the size chart was not accurate.
B00G6188EM|5|Works as advertised and looks great. Just be advised that the strips are designed to overlap a little. Incredibly easy to install and adds an awesome look paired with the natural safety advantages of retro reflectivity.
B0006HNUCM|4|Only could not get the front shocks for this product.  No explanation when I ordered it.  This rear shocks came in time and performing well for the last couple of weeks.  Would recommend to others.
B003PDSK42|5|I wanted a top that could be rolled up, pulled down on dusty days or removed easily.  This top fits my  2013 Polaris Ranger 400 really well.  Well made, good stitching.  Good Velcro attachments.  Arrived in perfect condition and early too! It fits over the rear view mirror (bar attached) and windshield--very adjustable.  In Arkansas you can experience all four seasons in one day-- going from 30 to 60 degrees in hours and 75 to over 100 in the summer! You really can't be the price a good top!
B002LGO9I0|5|This is a great hitch. Shipping was fast also. I have a Yamaha grizzly 700 and it took about 15 to 20 minutes to mount the hitch.
B007FFZ6VG|4|A bit awkward,  but it works well.
B002VR07JO|4|Although I couldn't use this because it didn't fit for my application (2006 Mazda MPV) , it feels like a solid, good quality part.
B00GOZE16O|5|Good price quality product.
B0002F9YIC|5|Working as advertised and then some.  Keeping my 8 year old climbing boots in great shape, come what may.
B00FBQL4TE|5|Very good quality and fast shipping, thanks
B000V9AIQQ|5|Great product, have ordered a number of these and used them in both jeeps as well as ford crown victoria p71 police interceptors.<br />the quality is good for the price and the color match is universal enough to blend with stock interiors. a suggestion would be that they update the front of the console and replace the flip out compartment with a fixed one that holds phones!!
B000HS8PT8|5|Nice product.  Used it very little so far, but it is definitely as quality product.  I wish it came with bag to compress and store it when not in use.
B00CTTN160|4|The paint quality was very good, color matched, packaged well. There was however two scratches found when I opened the packaging, no big deal, the tailgate is for a truck with 100k miles on it . I was disappointed that the access cover for the latch assembly was not included. Price was good, or to be fair very good with the fact it was painted to match factory color.
B00335CZ8O|5|This is an Awesome product, I had decided to buy these for a friend, cheap and fits perfect 5 stars *****
B003FO2O1G|5|Item arrived very quickly to Australia. Was very easy to install on our existing antenna. I changed the top of the antenna of our Jayco sterling. Took about one hour all up. Very happy with reception thank you.
B003TODXQW|5|Great quality. I've used this product a few times already and expect this tool to hold up to repeated use.
B002YQVIH2|5|The fish is just what I wanted.  It is a good price.
B00H33BP0G|5|My husband loved these for his truck.
B000FPXV5G|5|Fits perfectly and is a pretty standard size for a vehicle cup holder. No complaints here. Not having a cup holder was gettibf old fast.
B00BFDGO6K|5|Genuine Honda parts, purchased to replace aftermarket wipers on my recently purchased Element,nothing works as well as the original equipment wipers,in my opinion.
B007QV0R7W|5|I'm not a mechanic but I used this to find shorted wires in my car. Plus with the ability to put power directly to a motor you can diagnose whether the the motor is bad or some kind of short in the system fast. Highly recommend it.
B0055DMZ7I|5|my piston used to get romantic with my sparkplug in my 1980 NC50 Honda Express. not anymore they don't. it's a huge bandaid fix but it's better than nothing. washers came exactly within spec. good, bright anodized color.
B00K7938LW|3|having trouble getting them to stay on.
B005CLKVA6|2|I ordered this replacement door handle thinking that it would be silver but it was black. It seemed cheaply made, I was afraid it would break, but it has held up so far.
B000CMHTT6|5|these husky liners heavy duty floor mats are great for my chevy silverado. they are well made, sturdy, and retain a lot of dirt, keeping your vehicle's carpet clean. i highly recommend this product.
B000CNLHI4|5|EASY TO INSTALL- GOOD PRICE
B003SWNVI0|4|lots of room actually more than i anticipated. seems durable..but dont know yet about truely water proof. i am going on a 1600 mile trip with this on my car in a few days so we shall see.  havent driven with it yet so thats the only reason its not a 5 star rating yet. its easy to pack an easy to fold up and store. the storage bag for the cargo bag is nice as well. i will update in 2 weeks on how well it does on long trips.  it shipped faster than what it was sd too..so far i recommend both seller and product.
B00O7T0F9G|5|as like OEM works great on my 2011 dodge charger rt
B00G099YHA|5|good fit and great deal on price
B00BYQD2XG|4|the zippers on the lid really need to be bigger...Constantly misses the teeth while zipping and then doesn't close and than doesn't open and you are fighting with it. Contacted the company, and they said its made in china. However the rest of the bag seems to be good. Just the zipper sucks
B006DD95YK|4|Great product right here
B000K02EDG|5|4.8L 2005 Tahoe Engine runs so much smoother.
B0016HPUS8|5|I ordered and received this sensor in two days. It showed up as advertised in the original manufacturing packaging. I ordered the sensor and the thin wall socket for less than what it would have cost me for just the sensor at my local auto parts store. I removed my old sensor and installed the new one in about a half hour. It has been working great so far, problem solved.
B00AIBNL7A|3|Definitely covers the steering wheel does as expect.  There are two small concerns that would keep me from buying the cover in the future.  1.) It’s a tad bit small for the steering wheel on my 2011 F-150  ½” larger would make all the difference.  It moves around a ton and needs constant readjusting.  2.) The vinyl lettering is beginning to come off after only a few weeks.  No big deal as I’m not huge fan of white lettering anyways but it’s still coming off.  It absolutely covers the wheel for the most part and keeps the steering wheel from crumbling in my hands in the Florida humidity but I maybe could have shopped a little more.
B007D5XXNG|5|😀 thank you I loved
B00JIIZCM6|5|So far so good. Not greasy, feels good.
B007RFDE4U|4|These replaced the passenger reading lights in a Dodge Caravan. They are a blue/white light compared to the halogens that are stock. Not quite as bright, but they do the job and light up the interior. If you are surface dweller and love bright lights, these may fall a bit short of expectations, but for finding a dropped toy, these are nice.
B000RFUF12|5|.Received the product very promptly and packaged very well.  I am very pleased with this company and their great service.
B002J7RDZM|5|I've been a car nut since I was little (a long time ago) and have tried everything from near pure carnuba to expensive two-part waxes.  Been hooked on Liquid Glass for a while, but I read on a detailing site about this stuff and decided to give it a try. WOW!     Designed for car lots, auctions, etc., this stuff allows for a mild polish/wax event at the speed of light! I tried it out on my Ram, which is like new and thought it wouldn't accomplish much. I was wrong. Made it shine like a diamond.  Probably wouldn't hurt to put some heavier pure wax over it, but for a quick detail job to hold for a month or two, frankly this stuff is the king.    I liked it so much after buying a quart, that I went back and bought a gallon.  That says something!    Regards!  J-
B00G1WOEQM|5|Great deal.  Better than most auto body prices by far.
B00MRV83G8|5|Good lights at a good price. Thanks Amazon!
B00755JMYS|5|These led lights fit my 2008 Toyota Tundra perfect. Just enough for all interior and license plate lights. Now to get more for other cars
B007JG1W1E|5|For whatever reason my wife and I seemed to be constantly dealing with gray water tank odors.  We live in our motorhome but do not use our toilets at all because we have a separate bathroom in our building.  We drained our tanks continually and cleaned them often but the odors persisted.  This product completely eliminated all odors and I am getting ready to order more
B000T9LZDI|5|Best metal polish cream you can buy.
B000CF3VU4|5|This part fits perfectly. I was shopping around for price, but because part is in Bosch box (not made by Bosch) it has a great price and my car is fixed. By doing it myself I am sure that I saved $200-$300 parts and labor. I believe my code was P1130?<br /><br />George M.
B0009FH5BI|5|Perfect fit on my old 87 k5 blazer. Easy to install. The only thing that took any time really was finding a good, solid, clean place for the ground connection on my rusty old truck. Besides that its just plug it in, zip tie it up, and hook up your trailer and hit the road.
B009L39LWK|5|Fit and price were right.
B00DX8971E|4|Great battery!  I love the terminal designs which are almost identical to the lead acid Yuasa.  So many lithium batteries don't have the OE style terminals which just annoys me, so that's a big plus.  Cranks over my Kawasaki 1100cc triple 2 stroke with more authority than ever before with lead acids...very noticeable cranking amp improvement.  I like the charge indicator test lights too...very nice touch.  Unlike many others, this is a sealed battery without a balance charge port, making it ideal for PWC use.  All in all, I'm very pleased.  My only gripe which took away one star is the hardware included for your cables to attach to the terminals are NOT stainless.  One ride in salt water and they are a rusty mess.  Simple solution swapping over stainless hardware though so no harm, no foul.
B000K5SD68|5|Great item, great price! Arrived to me sooner than expected! Luv it! I can now ride with my man on his Harley, without borrowing his funky looking shades. :-)
B001OBEA6O|5|These were actual ford manufactured calipers that were rebuilt.  Replacement was a breeze and worked perfectly.  Very happy at this price.
B00CYFXZX8|5|nice
B000J2JE0G|5|Exactly what I expected. Fast and affordable.
B00HZO5RY8|5|great
B00HZTDKZG|5|I've had this over a week and it works great! the old one snapped a wire so I got the newer version and so far so good!
B007NNGZQ0|1|Generator doesn't charge. Advertised as being load tested at factory, tester must have been asleep. Don't buy.
B00LM029HE|4|I purchased this Lamp for my 2012 CTS recently.  It looks exactly like the original, fits correctly, and doesn't leak.<br />The only problem I have found is that it blinks 2 times faster then the factory Lamp. I does function normal on emergency flash.<br />Overall, I have to give this Lamp a 4.0.
B0068C4KPK|5|Outstanding product. I put this in a Yamaha vstsr 950 last year when I was preparing to drive to Las vegas from Washington state. I departed Washington in August at 4 am which the temperature is cold. I just made sure I warmed the oil before taking off. Now understand the 950 is big enough to make cross country trips but gas mileage is reduced significantly when riding over 65 mph. Anyway during my trip I encountered all types of weather and obstacles. Staring in WA when the temp was 40 f and ending in Las vegas when the temp was 95. I didnt think the bike would make it when I reached Idaho and hit 110 degrees. But the oil performed like a champ. My bike is air/oil cooled so imagine going 80 mph in 110 degree weather for hours. My cell phone wouldnt even charge in the heat. I also had a full load of the bike as I was caring my belongings. I was smart for getting synthetic vice the equivalent in mineral oil. This is the only thing I put in it now. The shift is smoother and the engine is quieter. Highly recommended.
B003O78ZIU|5|Perfect fit. I even bought some for a friend. Someone mentioned adding wing nuts so you can easily move them around. Great product.
B002ZRQ4WO|5|I REALLY LIKE IT, IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT PLASTIC LOOK LIKE MOST DO... MY ADVICE, ORDER ONE SIZE BIGGER REMEMBER THAT IT GOES OVER YOUR REGULAR CLOTHES SPECIALLY IF YOU WEAR A JACKET..
B00B5NPL7I|1|tHOUGHT THESE WERE BATTERY OPERATED FOR UNDER COUNTER LIGHTS.
B0031HRQTM|5|Great Price and does exactly what it should do. It holds the trunk up when it's open and down when it's closed.
B00B9ZJT7A|5|I had a professional install these. Someone who has &#34;20 years of experience&#34; and i was told he had a hard time. So I'd recommend having a pro put these on but aside from that they look awesome.
B001B5EMS4|4|The disc and clutch plate are made in Japan but release and pilot bearings are made maybe in China. I bought the release and pilot bearings separately.
B000EALHHG|5|Great Product and works as advertised, I have used this product for many years and wish COSTCO still carried it.
B00KL0M08Y|5|Fits my 2015 Hamster perfectly; quality material and construction.
B001OSURD2|5|Bought before and they work great.
B006ZAPE78|4|Trim ring looks awesome!  A little tricky on the install.  Didn't like wire coming out of bottom so made a mod and now wire is not visible and completely inside headlight housing.  30 min total time with mod.
B007Y6B8OA|5|awesome for the buck. Good product, will buy in the future.
B0000BX6RG|4|Easy to use and adds a nice color to the table and chairs.
B000BNZPSI|2|The look, fit and installation were all great. It installed easily and looked good but performance lacks. I locked the mechanism and tried the handle. It put up a little resistance and then with a minimal amount of extra force, the handle popped open. I then took it back out to verify I had installed it correctly...I did. I immediately removed the unit, boxed it back up and returned it for a refund.
B0051D3MP6|5|Works surprisingly well!
B004RV0BO8|5|like my flag, it is durable tin and easy to clean and stands out on my bumper which gets peoples attention which i need for my Avon job
B00I4D6SJ2|5|East to install and works great
B001IZIFQC|4|Runs small on a high wall pop up 14'.It does fit be careful stretching it or u will tear it.Good cheap cover .
B00GZWEHOW|5|Excellent product and fast shipping.
B005H5332A|1|I received item without manual, i install into car but 1 side not working.After the day the other side too.It's doesn't shows -ve and +ve only red and black wire but it's put into car both ways then blow out fuses.now i return the item and now using halogen bulb's.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND DO NOT BUY THIS ONE .This is not worth more than $1.00
B002GCHNOQ|5|well satisfied;great product, very fast assembly saved a lot of money by doing the job myself, top quality strut assembly
B00BVEMV7E|5|This product is great. Very easy to install. Lights are extremely bright. Very satisfied. These light up the road like you wouldn't believe.
B00237YS3I|4|All the different colour shades give it all the more charm, its easy to fit but got to be careful while changing the lens as its  a bit delicate.
B001EB9WPI|5|Mounts easily.  It is very sturdy and is a great height.  I use it on my Eton Matrix.  It comes up to just below my eyes which is just perfect.
B00DLMKTOQ|4|this setup is awesome for the price, a local shop had similar yet not as good looking ones for twice the price and 1 bulb dies after 2 months and a ballast after 3. I'll get a second set if I need to.
B000F5LJ3M|4|I bought this Puller to take out the tie rods on my Ford F150.<br /><br />It was too small so I ended up having to do it the hard way.<br /><br />I really was looking forward to using it as I just am getting too old to beat on the front end of my truck anymore.<br /><br />It is a good quality piece however if you have a truck It is not a \\"Universal\\" unit.
B0076KBPNI|1|I tried to upload the software provided in the package and encountered error with the bluetooth program.  Never able to get it worked.  Wasting time and money.
B009DJQCHO|5|Great
B001P27YV0|5|Worked great.
B00877SL2M|5|this is great LED light bulb  much brighter
B00E9HWS9G|5|excellent and quality of the product, you can also cutomize.
B005M1ZBH4|1|I installed this item, then gave it a couple of months to try it out. Have had many issues with it.  The clamps will not stay tight, so the filter falls off or the connections come loose. Now the check engine light is coming on because the oxygen sensor is not registering correctly with this intake. I am try to return this product now. Not much hope since I gave it couple of months to see how it does. Did not really see any change in gas mileage. May have increased HP slightly. Definitely is louder than stock intake.
B001O13BLO|5|Dealer wanted over 350 dollars to install new lift supports!  I paid about 45 dollars for two! I'm not that mechanically inclined, but thanks to youtube, I saw how easy it was to install myself and did it with a friend who just held up the trunk while I put them in. Done in about 10 minutes.  Parts came in quickly and work well!
B00BITKP9I|4|The filter fit right into the compartment, with no problems.  Filter was made in China, did not have arrows to show which way it should be placed.  Good price,fast shipping.
B005JZTRMS|5|I bought a used Saturn, and even though the seat belt was plenty long, I didn't like where/how it crossed my chest.  This extension makes the required seat belt feel more comfortable.
B006O0IQGU|1|faded after 2 months to an crappy looking silver. Plus the threads are garbage on the inside. They're not worth the hassle of stripping your lugs out.
B00BY9DRGK|5|Starts right up, nice piece...
B00MG9D1G8|5|Works great<br />On my ranch hand brush guard
B00E6ACU1C|5|great
B002HJ557A|4|I've had this on my 2006 FLHRCI, Road King Classic for quite some time now. Looks and sounds good.  It was an easy install and louder than the stock horn.  I gave it 4 stars because I was hoping for louder.
B000CPAW2E|1|not happy at all had to cut to fit a two inch pipe!
B004R35CP4|5|I have a 2014 Juke NISMO RS. I had to have a shop down the street remove the tow hook, I caught them at the end of the day, they threw it on the rack and had it off in 5 minutes and charged me $10. Nissan uses some kind of green thread locker, and they are not shy about it's application. Other than that it went right on. I also bought some thread locker and 2 slightly longer exhaust insulators (the rubber thing that the muffler hands onto).<br /><br />I applied blue thread locker to the bolts before I put them in.
B001CUZDTA|3|Didn't last as long as I though it should have
B006ZLDDPM|5|Exactly what it looks like. Well made and holds both valve covers and 8mm wires securely. I'll buy this for my next project too.
B007ZDDUCK|2|Tried on some of my leather purses. Made no difference in the look of them. Perhaps it will help them last longer.
B000W0MOH0|3|Good one, but for the price I wish if this was a bit more strong and bulky. Its kind of medium size and I do not know if people can cut it.
B000CINVA6|3|I bought this to lubricate a sliding glass door that's been particularly troublesome.  This can isn't the best medium for that application, as the contents are too pressurized.  Instead of just getting the grease on the rail that the wheels travel on, it blows all over the entire metal rail, to which dust, bugs, etc. adheres.<br /><br />I'm buying a tube of WL grease today.
B000E283S0|5|Good stuff, good quality, works great would purchase again.
B004GFS2C8|5|product is easy to use and does what it's supposed to.don't expect an invisible repair,you'll still be able to see the original chip,but it wont spread and ruin the windshield.if you have AAA insurance,they may still provide this repair service at no cost.my company does not.
B002DU3TTO|5|Haven't had a chance to use it.  It should work as expected so this review is premature.  Probably will be several weeks before I can put it to use.
B0041TVTEC|5|good … this is the one  i was looking for<br />the  price was good too  at the  store that are  250 with out tax
B000BRFTLC|5|Very easy to install, and is doing a fine job in my 5th wheel RV. It was a replacement for a 55amp and the Charge Wizard I had plugged right in.
B009RUC6DS|5|Hey these work great for the price.  maybe a little yellower than i wanted but that would be my fault.  plugged right in and worked with no problem.  love the amazon marketplace, better than ebay.
B0052SF0LO|3|I bought two of the lights....Only one works perfectly, activated by motion. The other one, only works if you put on on, or literally put your finger on sensor. If only both worked, i would give it higher score.
B0002KM5L0|5|I bought this bleeder and a spare reservoir cover for my BMW K1100LT, threaded a barbed fitting into the reservoir cap, installed \\"speed bleeders\\" and now can power flush my ABS-equipped bike in a few minutes.  It is the ONLY way to do this single-handed.  Buy two of the catch bottles for the front calipers, and you will be doing this fomerly tedious job every year just because it's so much fun.
B00M3NEBMK|5|I bought this for riding on the motorcycle in cold weather. I am definitely pleased with my purchase. It is very comfortable, keeps my head warm and prevents my hair from becoming a tangled rats nest. Even when you are wearing it so your face is uncovered, it is warming. I definitely look like a ninja while wearing it.
B000FQ23JK|5|I bought this to replace the factory plate holder on my 89 YJ that had been ravaged by years of weathering. This is a great replacement. Bolts directly onto the body, just make sure you save your old hardware. Full 5-star rating, would recommend to everyone.
B000CII6ZQ|5|Worked great.
B007KTNCWM|5|I wear it  every day! It is light weight and quite warm.  Looks fantastic! Sam L.
B000TYHZM8|5|works on 96 gm vehicles with rectangle reservoir.
B0012WHBSO|5|My father wanted a quality portable compressor that ran on 12 volts. I had heard that Viair made quality compressors so I picked this one up. We've used it several times on fishing and camping trips and it works great. It is a little loud, but it makes up for that by being very fast to inflate tires. We haven't abused it, but I think it would stand up to some pretty rough use.
B003U1NPBW|5|very kool need one more got another dog lol but there good for the price....happy with the order hopefully rest will be good
B002R0NOX6|5|i didnt get why its weight says 7lbs but that was probly just the general shipping weight for the companies products otherwise it worked great and went in well including the pigtail spring. may be a bit new looking then the other side but the colors are about the same
B001SLEMFE|2|It is just a another cheaply made cover. Would not purchase this item again. Rips easily and will not last.
B009EX4F3M|4|The Velcro tape that came with the product did not stick very well to the dash surface. The dash cover is nice overall.
B0058SPQ80|2|I had VERY high hopes for this device but it shows 2 volts higher than the battery's actual voltage. Also, even though it shows 2 volts higher the bar gauge and percentage read 20-30% at 12.7 actual volts (tested with Watts Up? And Innova 3320). Still hopeful to find a solution to off grid monitoring other than referencing a volt meter. Guess it's time to memorize the volts = % DoD chart.
B001AX9UD4|5|I had leaks at the joints on my stainless steel catback and since I considered the possible future of taking it off to upgrade and resell, I decided to use this bandclamp. It's nice how you don't need a 2nd wrench to hold any nut. You can literally just wrench one handed from the get go. I did use an impact gun to save time on that and to get a super strong seal. I would recommend these clamps 100%
B0052FRE34|5|Fine quality
B001LHVOVK|5|I have no troubles with it whatsoever.  Reads code numbers like it should.  Erases codes like it should.  No problem.  Easy to use.
B004QPAYTM|4|Had to file away some of the plastic in order for the contact pins to connect. Other than that I like the function of this product.
B000BUU5XQ|5|Keeps the stabilizer jacks from sinking into the dirt.  they were easy to use and I wished I had this product 20 years ago when I had a popup camper.
B001RB0P1K|5|I love people asking me &#34;who is that?&#34;  This sticker is all that and a bag of chips.
B007Y87B2G|5|Quality, Exact replacement. DB Electrical has won my loyalty.
B0075E3WZO|5|Fits great and looks great. In a car with very little room for storage, this provides a much needed, right at my fingertips (literally) solution. Well done and nice quality.
B00EEKQBY6|2|The Nipple size on the Petcock is not the same size as the nipple on the Carb!
B0028SHNMU|5|Quick shipping.  Classic leather smell.
B001CEG90I|4|Works noticable better than plain filter. Have used Charcoal and Baking Soda Filters for the past 4 years. Well worth the extra money.
B001C6Q8OS|2|The product came backwards, I had to take it apart and reassemble it also the metal clip was not bent. Due to product being backwards it trips the fuse, the quality is not as good as OEM but you get what you pay for.
B0054T95ZS|5|These surprised me today.  They are actually in an AC/Delco box.  I bought some fancy bronze ones that I couldn't get off the post due to corrosion. I actually damaged my battery post.  I am going to stick with these from now on.  The soft material can always be peeled off if you are a victim of severe corrosion.
B003EOXJXE|4|There are better built 150psi working pressure tanks on the market, but none of this lengthy dimension which fits perfectly behind the seat. The inside is coated with a clear anti-rust coating and there is a bottom drain bung which is mandatory when it comes to the safety of any air tank.
B00CI91NIY|5|The decal is well made, looks exactly as shown. Application is easy and delivery was super fast. What more could you ask?
B007VTQXJK|4|I gave this product 4 stars because it a a well working product with a really good price, but lacking in few areas such as packaging and instructions . I was a little skeptical buying this because it was so cheap, however I was impressed.<br />Fitment is not quite perfect but it fits well with a little wiggling around the bulbs fit into the sockets securely. Zip ties and brackets to mount ballasts are provided and the cables seem strong enough to last for a while.<br />So I have had this 6000k kit on my bugeye wrx for about 3 months now and none of the components seem to be letting go. Everything is working great so far and the lighting is pretty good. I've modded my headlights to look and work like the JDM projector headlights from an STI so I wouldn't blind people on the road.<br />Their customer service is substantial. I was having a little trouble with the install and emailed the company. 30 minutes later, a representative called me and helped me out with my problem step by step.<br />This was a really good buy for me since I'm on a budget and I actually got a quality product.<br />I WOULD DEFINITELY GIVE THESE GUYS A TRY.
B0009IBJCQ|4|Bought this to keep in my car in case I ever needed it and thankfully I haven't yet. Looks like a great product easy to use and perfect to keep in the car. Only ranked four stars because I have used yet, will update when used.
B002ZRQ4QK|5|Well after 10 YEARS of use I finally got around to replace the factory installed wipers on my 2006 VW Jetta.  The wipers available here on Amazon are the original wipers that came with the car and are quite simply the best windshield wiper blades ever made.  I probably could have used the old wiper blades for another year but they were just now starting to lose their function.  Amazingly the old wipers didn't have any cracks and the rubber is still quite flexible with just a small amount of fading apparent and this is from living in a climate with harsh Winters and hot Summers.  With so few car parts being reliable and functional for an extended period of time these are truly a standout.  As other reviewers have pointed out these mount to the wiper arms using the 90 degree PIN mount, which is an amazingly simple way to install a wiper.  Well done BOSCH!
B00062YOHM|5|I bought two of them for the engine on my airplane.  They seem to increase the horse power a little.  Easy to install and built well.
B000CIC1EI|5|Fit and worked great for my 96 Grand Cherokee Laredo
B00K4G5XGG|5|I bought this as a surprise birthday gift for my brother who is rebuilding an engine for his Honda. It was a huge hit! It was easy to install, fit perfectly and (in my opinion) has made the engine look super cool. The gear-head in my house tells me that doing the Vtec conversion will greatly enhance the engine performance greatly! I can't wait to ride in it when the car is finished! This is a quality product for an excellent price. Highly recommended!
B005V0EBFO|1|This bag collapses in on itself and makes it impossible to put anything in it.  The snaps inside are useless for holding a plastic liner bag up inside--really poor design (and one of them fell off within a couple of weeks).  This trash bag is trash.
B00029X5VA|5|We needed new wipers on both of our cars.  I had heard good things about silicone wipers and decided to try them on both of our cars.  They work beautifully, leaving a clean surface everytime they wipe.  I cannot say anything about their durability - but everything I have read about silicone wipers tells me to expect them to last a long time.  Wonderful product at a wonderful price.
B0016LG0CY|4|Delivered as advertised. Sturdy product. Could have stated fuse rating in product description. Good value for the price. Recommend this product for special project.
B00D45AVIE|5|Love it. I paid over $200.00  for my other helmet that is very similar.
B00HZSN48K|5|Mounted on a 2007 F150.  Good quality mirrors of seemingly OEM-type materials.  Surprised to see on the box they are made in Taiwan, but quality seems to be there.  You should know these are HUGE mirrors.  I mean, bigger than F250 super duty mirrors and they stick out a good 18&#34; unextended.  They are spec'd to the OEM mirrors.  Everything worked as it should right away:  puddle lights, turn signals, power mirrors.  Installation was not difficult (suggest looking at You Tube videos from 1A auto parts on how to remove door panels before you get started--there are a few tricks).  The driver's side mirror didn't fit perfectly and needed a little finessing, but it eventually squared up.  The passenger side mirror has a slight flutter above 40 mph but it's not a big distraction.  The driver's side mirror doesn't move.  These mirrors take some getting used to, especially in fast-moving traffic.  I did some research and set the top mirrors to catch just the back corner of the truck and mainly focus on the driving lane farther behind the truck (where a trailer would be).  The bottom convex mirrors are set to see the next lanes over and catch the rear wheels (so I can finally see the damn parking lanes without adjusting a mirror).  If you do it right, a car approaching from the rear will appear first in your big mirrors, then in your smaller mirrors until it is right next to you--no blind spots.  Also, you should be able to see curbs in the convex mirror as you round corners.
B000E28EG6|2|Used them to hold the wrapping on my 2000 GSXR 750's exhaust.  Ended up going to AutoZone and buying hose clamps.  They just dont hold that well, and it is hard to get them to tight.
B000E4OK5I|1|These mirrors from Best Price Mirror are not even the correct fit. They do not fit the applications they say they do as the mirrors are not made to OEM specs. Only buy these mirrors if you do not care how they fit.
B003S88ZDA|4|the keys arrived in good time, after getting cut, worked well in the ignition. After getting them programmed started the car with no problem!<br />You helped me save $$!
B005HMP7HM|5|really brightens up the interior and it comes in all type of bulbs. Fast deliver too and in good conditions.
B00KGHJ51W|3|Appears ok, but I am concerned it may be a little flimsy and may warp--time will tell. It was quick shipping though--thanks
B00S19924W|4|Great products and service.
B00HXJ8MBK|5|Not a great fit but I still really like it
B0006VORDY|5|I had a standup portable camping grill for years and it worked ok but was very small and had only a grill and very small griddle section. It used the small propane bottles and did not get very hot & run out of propane quickly. Last weekend I used the Camp Chef and it was awesome!  It was nice to be able to use a frying pan for my eggs and the Grill box was perfect!
B0087FSA70|4|It was easy to apply. It does bring a lot of clarity to the lenses.
B0085IZLMG|3|Functional fit but off color for my 2004 Tundra
B00LEQ28OA|5|smart
B004J8P22A|3|I think it's a well crafted product, one thing it lacks is the pin to secure it to the hitch.<br />If it included the pin. I would give 4-5 stars.
B0041U6MYI|5|fit great
B002GOEJW8|5|Wasn't difficult at all to get this up and running, the hardest part was figuring out where to secure the excess cable length which they give you ample amounts of
B0000BWGY6|5|We went with this model because of its size and it being slightly lighter in weight. It was very easy to assemble but I don't think we'd trust it with 500lbs. Oh and it measured 60\\" x 19.5\\" OD.  We certainly recommend this hitch rack to friends but I'll give it 4 stars rating because if its 500lb rating.  That much seems a bit over the top!!
B001PJS2FK|5|I had issues with the matching bumper, but this part was super easy.  I especially love that it has a couple of shims that can be used to adjust the height.  That makes is latch so much easier than the last bumper I had on the Jeep!  I also like that I can adjust the depth of the tire mount to match my specific tires and wheels.
B00068XCQU|5|Excellent piece of equipment. Does a great job.
B00NY4LQHU|5|This product comes with no installation instructions or wiring diagram. If you are not familiar with wiring and testing either learn and find someone who is. Light arrived on time and in protective packaging. I purchased their wire harness and I recommend that you do the same becaue it ia good quality. I mounted these on my YFZ and used the existing headlight swith to activate. Because of this I did not use all of the harness, but I was able to utilize parts of it. The lights work great and they are bright. They flood well, but the throw is not much further than the 60w H6M bulb installed in the headlight housing. With that being said it is a flood/work light so it performs the way it was designed to. Good quality construction and solid mounts. Overall this a good product and much less in price in comparison Rigid which don't seem to be much better.
B002GG312A|2|The $200 retail price for these is absolutely ridiculous but, even at the price I bought them, about 90% off, they are still only a two star product.  I have only had them in my car for a couple weeks and they are showing significant wear.  Granted, even a mild Minnesota winter is harsh on floor mats, but they should last at least a year or two.  Additionally, they will not remain in place.  The only thing they have going for them is that they fit well in my 1997 Paseo, however, that is not enough to outweigh the significant negatives.
B000C822WE|5|This is a fine replacement part. Fits perfect with out any problems. This is a great price compared to others.
B00HCQA7BC|5|Good quality at fraction of dealer cost. Easily can mount in under 2hrs.
B001EA0LI6|5|This one fixed my sticky problem on my two cars' doors because I did not know that the edge trim came in different thickness. It is thinner and look sharper.
B001PB7KTM|5|The used Liberty needed something to make it perfect. This was that something!!! Thanks for a great product in a timely manner!
B00JA0FXKS|5|Worked great!
B001ADA1IM|5|needs to be about half the price.
B00FWOKJYG|4|Will this fit on my 2006 f150 on the bumper right in front of the grill?
B00BLS9WCM|1|Mats don't cover behind gas pedal also the back mats are 2 pieces instead of a 1 piece, that is what comes from Kia originally. It leaves the center carpet unprotected! Would not recommend these as winter mats!
B001A1M1XW|2|I bought one of these and installed it. Everything went just ducky...until I went for a drive and found the image shakes like a leaf. The fit and finish is OK and the adjusting mechanism seems to work fine. But the shakey jake view is bothersome. I plan to return it as soon as I've found a better one. The reason it shakes, by the way, is the vertical pivot arm is NOT as strong as the OEM version. The whole assembly looks exactly right...but something inside is not as stout and it allows the mirror to vibrate.
B0067ECS6W|4|just another filter
B00009PGNS|5|We bought this cooler as a supplemental refrigerator in our RV for fresh produce & milk.  We paired this with the Wagan 5Amp AC to 12VDC power adapter.  Since it cools by a fixed degree below surrounding temperature, we ran it during the daytime heat to keep produce cool, then unplugged it at night so it didn't freeze.  It worked as described, exactly what we need.  The fan noise is not loud, about the same as a small electric space heater.  We have only used it with the Wagan power adapter so far.  The power adapter got warm, about the same as a laptop adapter, but not hot like some others have described.  We would recommend both these products.
B001Q8DMB4|3|For some reason, it soaked up tons of water to wash with but it didn't want to hold onto any of the soap. It still worked well enough, but I don't think I would get them again.
B000ETUD22|5|Works great!  Can't believe I used to do this any other way.
B00MHXAHKQ|1|Absolutely the worst Amazon product I have ever ordered. Seat strap broke while installing onto seat and bead string already broken after a 1 day use. Only one strap to hold to seat, so cushion slides every time you get in or out. Worst, Worst, Worst.
B000C640IA|5|works good
B001B74FGG|1|At first I was delighted with this product, but now, not so much. I wish they made the product with the correct resistors already in place for each model and make of vehicle. First the volume down button on the steering wheel stopped working, then the volume up began intermittently working. It's inconsistent, but I don't feel like pulling the entire dash unit out to check all the connections again etc.
B003TQ7A8C|5|The only thing I did not like about this kit is that the leds are red not white. I am using for my suzuki c90t and I will have to do some MacGyvering but the light is very bight and a visible even through an old red lens.
B0002LAC32|5|In my opinion this is the perfect tire/wheel kit available.  Great dark satin finish on the tires if applied correctly.  Very effective wheel/tire cleaner as well.
B000VKZNPG|5|Product fit perfectly, bolted right in. Only issue was the wrong side was initially shipped. They very promptly shipped me another one even before they received the wrong one back.
B0002ILK4K|5|Works great on mighty casey train. Hold charge for weeks. Hour per day. I charge it with my car battery charge.
B000C6KM82|5|The only oil filter truly up to Subaru's high standards. Great deal, shipped right to my door with lightening speed.
B004ZVRGXO|1|Too dim and not bright enough.
B00G3BRNVY|5|BOUGHT THIS AND A 10-2808  OIL FILTER FOR MY SUBARU CAR RUNS ALOT SMOOTHER NOW, I WILL CERTAINLY RECOMMEND ROYAL PURPLE MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND THE BEST PLACE TO BUY IT  AMAZON.
B00881NJE2|4|This decal was perfect, right size, and went on easy. It was delivered on time and it was a gift to my dad for his dodge pickup. Only thing I didn't like was how it came in too folders but other then that it was great!
B0083H5JCQ|5|great product
B00062ZDCW|5|Nice deal as advertised. K&n kicks butt. Best reusable filter. Always use them in my vehicle. Nice clean flow. Brappp
B000JZI0J4|5|A+++++
B000BH5MAA|5|I have a small teardrop trailer, and I cannot back up for anything. Leveling the rig used to be a nightmare and I could not do it alone as I had to back on to pieces of wood, check level, roll off, take off or add to the pile, roll back on, rinse and repeat. Now I just slide this up to the wheel, and crank! So easy even I can do it alone, and I am a LARGE 50 year old female. Save yourself some time and get this.
B000BGM2XG|5|Works just fine so far.  Of course it's the same model that quit working  after an unknown period of time.
B00PV5CKM0|2|Ok but won't stay in place
B00KTHKR4I|5|excelente
B00LN0F0H4|5|I was hesitant to buy this item at first, seeing as it was the least expensive item available for sale. I thought that the low cost would be associated with less features or functionality. However, I have been using this device for about a month now, in conjunction with the DASH mobile app that allows me to track various measurements about my driving, including MPG, throttle position, engine temp, etc. This device is worth every penny it is sold for, and much, much more.
B001OZS94O|5|Love these shocks and the ability to adjust them.  I had never installed shocks before but it was simple.  Mine were not coil overs luckily.  Torsion bars in the front, leaf springs in the rear.
B000C9DCBS|1|It was the part I needed, unfortunately it was defective out of the box.
B000C7XWZ6|5|Works great, fit was perfect.
B000CQDRN4|3|I bought two, one is the low tone and one is the high tone.  Claimed to be, or called \\"Extra Loud\\" they are not half as loud, or about half as loud, as the horns in my '84 Caprice.  Those horns in the older sedans were/are a great loud horn(s) and if I had it to over again I would just visit a local auto salvage shop and ask for the horns from an older GM or Ford or something. (If you do this be sure they test them for you first)  I was replacing the horns in my '98 Cherokee (which sounded chinsy) and was a little disappointed in these.
B00B51BQHE|5|This decal went on without a problem. The finished product looks great, very clean. The price was right as well.
B005SB6TLA|5|If your looking at this you have a Large RV or Boat.  I have been an RVer for near a Decade now. I consider this a must have. It solves 1 major problem and one price gouging issue. First the Problem, the factory 50 Amp cord plugs straight in and twists to lock. Due to the have gage copper and insulation the weight of this attachment and the cord hanging down the RV puts a lot of stress on the receptacle. To the point it starts separating after a few years (3 years in my case).<br /><br />This device dangles at a true 45 degree and allows you to use a much cheaper 50 Amp extension cord to power your RV/Boat. Do a search on a 50 Amp power cord (300 Plus Dollars) and one on a 50Amp Extension Cord (100 Dollars or less)<br /><br />If your current power cord is separating and your considering replacing it. I recommend using this adapter and a 50 Amp Extension cord.
B00AC5QK4I|1|It only worked once, the second time I connected it - nothing.  I connected it in line to supplement a tired mechanical pump and the second time I connected it - it didn't pump work at all.
B005XOY9ZK|4|fit great i like this .....can see much better......
B0068C1OYK|5|Fit my 2014 ranger 800 efi beautifully I couldn't be happier
B00AXG3IMS|5|Took a bit of time to reach me, but the wait was well worth it.  Outstanding quality! Really adds to the exterior of my Honda CR-V.
B008MOOYV2|1|Did not work.  Would not program after 3 attempts to program.  However, the black and blue ones I purchased worked fine!
B001G6JSHS|5|Some one could not brake and stop fast enough and broke my A6 Avant tail light. With this broken tail light I could not pass the TX safety inspection, so started looking for a cheap replacement. OEM costs about $130, used one on ebay costs about $60. Bought this from amazon for $80 and found that magneti marelli did build the original Audi tail light as well.    This light assembly says that it was made in India. Quality is not bad, almost as good as the original one. Very easy to remove this and put the new one on A6 Avant. Will take about 15-20 minutes, since I did it myself anyone can do it. I am glad that I did not have to run to a shop to replace this part, it was simple enough with the good quality parts.
B000V8VZ78|4|It's good for cleaning dust from your leather and for conditioning it. It will not remove coffee or tea stains from white leather. If you need to remove deep stains, use Shout Advanced Gel - it worked perfect on our white faux leather sofa.
B00332GO8O|3|I bought these (w/ stake holes) for my '04 Silverado reg cab short bed. They look really nice and all, but the holes didn't line up very well. couple inches off. No big deal for me, but if you were gonna put something in those holes, it might be a big deal. It required a little trimming on the edge close to the truck to fit right. Good product, overall, for the price.
B001KQ43RE|5|Worked fine.
B000C5UFJE|5|Works as said
B004AIJ5PY|5|Installation of this rear wheel hub was for my 2002 BMW 325i as part of total rear wheel overhaul.<br /><br />If you're gonna go through all that trouble to press the old bearings out and press the new ones in, along with all that needs to be taken out to get at them, then I highly urge you to replace the wheel hub as well when replacing the wheel bearings.<br /><br />Dorman parts are excellent OEM quality for a great price. I am impressed with their performance. I compared this hub to the BMW OEM hub, and it is identical.
B002T5HJOE|5|great
B000PW9S7E|5|Love this stuff--works great on my Coriander counter!!
B00CMU3R1K|5|Excellent fully recommend them

B001AWLJG6|5|I recently purchased a Damon Outlaw Motorhome that has a toyhauler garage in the rear and wanted a secure way to haul a Yamaha XT250 and Suzuki DRZ400. I purchased one Condor Pit Stop first to give it a try before deciding on what I would pick up for the second bike. These bikes have very large front wheels and after looking at the adjustability of the Condor it seemed like a better solution then the other popular brand, Baxley.  Out of the box, fit and finish is excellent. The Condor folds open for setup or closed storage in about 1 minute. The adjustment for the tire size also can be done in less than a minute. When you pull your bike onto the chock it holds it very secure and does not need anything to hold the bike upright.  For trailering I am pretty sure just two soft tie-downs would be enough to keep a bike safe but I always like everything overdone so I use two soft ties style tie-downs on the front handlebars and two standard tie-downs on the back of the motorcycle. For our first trip we traveled from Orlando FL to California on a variety of roads without any issue. I am very happy with the purchase and will be picking up one more.
B00FM7B1AO|5|Electric auto battery charger is very nice and thanks for selling it.
B001U60T9U|4|My mom has custom seat covers from Cover King for her car while my younger bro has generic ones for his.  The Cover King set is definitely of superior quality, especially the mechanisms that keep the seat covers strapped in.  However, the generic ones do still fit great.  Considering they cost only a tenth of Cover King's, I decided to go for a generic set for myself.  And after a month and a half, and some additional tweaking, I'm satisfied with my decision.<br /><br />I'll say outright the FH-FB051115 is neither a perfect nor near perfect fit.  I will however give FH Group some slack considering how unconventional the seats in my car are, which is a 2011 Honda Fit Sport.  There will be quite a few wrinkles and looseness especially with the headrest and backseat covers.  This is where Cover King has a greater advantage:  they use a combination of straps, clips, hooks, and Velcro positioned in the most convenient and effective positions.  The FH-FB051115 is anchored to the seats with only straps, elastics, hoops, and optional clips that result in a somewhat flimsier fit.  I couldn't figure out how to effectively use the optional clips so I completely omitted them in my particular installation.  Also, the straps and hoops can be ripped off if pulled too strong too fast.  I really suggest going slow when tightening everything.<br /><br />To be more specific about the somewhat flimsy fit, the headrest covers just aren't shaped properly for those of the Honda Fit's.  I was able to stretch and tuck them in for an approximation, which I think turned out great but still not near factory-installed caliber.  Still, the FH-FB051115 just isn't 100% compatible with the Honda Fit's seats.  The most prominent incompatibilities are with the seat belt buckles and the way the Magic Seats function.  Simply, you can't do any inserting where the buckles are because there aren't any little crevices for the fabric to go into.  It's even more pronounced with the Magic Seats since utilizing them loosens the seat covers.  Maybe cutting a slit for the buckles to go through might help, but I'm loath to do any irreversible alterations.  I've even left off the armrest because of that.  I did make slits for the holes for the headrests, but those were minute and easily hidden.<br /><br />Despite my complaints, I'm actually quite happy how the FH-FB051115 looks in my car, especially considering the low price.  Look at the pics I uploaded and you can see how well they conform.  Sitting on and getting off of them after a few days does loosen the fitment, but nothing a quick re-tuck can't fix.  Unfortunately, how it interacts with the Magic Seats I'm not happy at all with.  In their usual position, the FH-FB051115 looks very good on the Magic Seats, but flipping them up and down now requires added steps with the zippers and all the re-tucking.  At the very least the Magic Seats still retain their function, but I'm probably going to replace the back with Cover King.  For now, the FH-FB051115 gratifies me superficially.g them loosens the seat covers.  Maybe cutting a slit for the buckles to go through might help, but I'm loath to do any irreversible alterations.

B006R2T4ES|5|I use this in my 05 f150 truck for the rear cab light when the doors open. Perfect fit and no problems with connections. Very bright at night. Very nice red no pink haze or anything. Stands up to offroad shakes and rattles.
B001P4KGV8|4|A very good design, a little uncomfortable. I recommend you select a size more big than usually buy, since the helmet is too tight.<br /><br />Best,
B0002W2W2K|4|We have taken this to various places while camping.  It dries very quickly.  However, after about four months, there are pieces of the nylon that have come undone in two places.  It still works great. I would have liked it if it the reversal patterns were brown and blue as it stated in the description instead or white and brown.
B00RURSUBC|5|Great light. It was shipped quickly! Thanks a lot!
B005024BZS|2|Only complaint is that it fit too small. If you have a tiny peanut head it will fit properly. I should have known when I noticed there is a separate peace you can get as a extension
B00I96JZU8|5|Fit my 1980 Yamaha XS850 like a glove! So glad i got this and at a good price as well.
B0064IU5FW|5|Great
B00UJ5YL6U|5|Works like I had hoped it would, very versatile.
B000IZ25VY|5|Works great, no issues, great seller!
B001OYUVQY|5|love it now I have to get the floor mats to match
B00OUM8GLY|5|I had a difficult time finding a windshield shade to fit but this one fits great on my 2014 Ford Escape.  Folds up neatly and fast.
B000OP6KLY|4|I'm sure it has all the performance I could ask for, but I didn't realize until putting it in that the oil 'looks' dirty on the dipstick when it's that color.  I'm old and just used to watching the color of my oil, and with this brand I won't be able to.
B00I3LCFN8|5|Fit perfectly. This was one of the easiest jobs I've ever done. It took 30 min tops to replace this from popping the hood to closing it.
B00B9EWEE6|5|They fit perfectly and look great - very nice.  Came quickly and have performed well.
B00SQX3KDC|1|Wanted some lights to light up my sprayer so that I could see if the chemical spray was coming out of my tank.  Didn't do what i wanted it to do.
B0088BBQC4|4|Good fit for my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder. Good product and have been working well ever since.
B000WJEXAM|5|It's an oil filter. It cost less than at the dealer. Buy it.
B00LGZYS10|5|The sticker came 3 days after I ordered it! Super quick shipping! It looked it came via snail mail, so I wasn't expecting a small envelope with the sticker in it. I'm not sure if dimensions were mentioned, but it was smaller than I expected, but I still love it! It fit good on the small window bit of my crossover. Installation was easy.  Clean the section you want to apply the vinyl to, peel off the back sticker, position, place and carefully remove the front sticker! There is no visible clear sticker. Very pleased with my purchase! Only wish it was a little bigger. (Teehee)
B000KSTFJO|5|some people recommend me this so i bought this.<br />i think this is very good quality and reasonable price.,!b d
B002MAMBDU|2|Product works well enough, but the blue dye used in the Clay Luber stains skin, rags, and everything else it touches.  And although<br />the dye comes out eventually, the mess it creates while using it is unacceptable!
B000GV98JW|4|Love them
B002RPLH6W|5|A few years ago I got into an accident where I hit a deer on my brand new cruiser when I was going 55 mph. My face smashed into the concrete and then hit a guard rail. The face shield was so scratched up that you couldn't see though it and the rest was scratched too but it saved my life. I'd highly recommend this helmet.
B0052FRWRM|5|Wife's old car starting to fall apart. There came as advertised and are working great
B00E1SJ2W4|5|I truly cannot say enough good things about Callahan's customer service. I actually had to contact them twice and was extremely surprised with how prompt their response was and the fact they truly seemed to care about me as a customer and not just a number.  The first time I contacted Callahan was about delivery. When I originally ordered the item I did not look closely at delivery date. After ordering I noticed it was an estimated delivery between certain days, so emailed asking if it was possible to add overnight delivery and was told this was not an option. They called me back and he let me know what method they use to ship and looked up what typical delivery times were in my area. They arrived in 2 days and all was well!<br /><br />The second time I emailed because there was an issue with the fit for the pads on my husband's car. They took care of everything promptly and more than made up for the inconvenience. I am so happy with their product and the way they conduct their business and would recommend them to anyone. We will be ordering from them again for sure!
B00C7G924K|5|Love the fragrance and it last a long time.
B00GIP6GRW|4|I really like my new Jeep emblem on the front of my vehicle looks great
B00JVHLS3G|1|Mine turned yellow in a day
B006AZCHT6|5|The order arrived quickly and as stated. Each filter came out to be less than half of what I would have paid at Pep Boys.
B000GTTARE|5|Perfect fit for my renthal fat bars. Good yamaha blue color match. I would recommend this. Bike looks much better with it.
B00BFXJB3S|5|I couldn't be happier with this tail light. The brightness is incredible. I wanted something that made me feel safe and visible. This by far beats any other tail lights you can buy. The programmable chip is a great feature. You can choose the brightness, how many times it flashes when you brake, startup flashes and a few other choices. This product is also the definition of true plug and play. No cutting, no stripping, you just take out the stock one, put this in its place and it works! I'm considering buying this for all my motorcycles.<br /><br />This installed perfectly into my 2012 Yamaha R6
B005MEZIYM|5|Love it!
B009RWPPSY|5|The key works well. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00C307CBK|1|i stripped the thread on these things ass soon as i tried to put them on, and if you think they are for a the black heavy duty motorcycle turn signals that this company also sell, you are mistaken. i had to highly modify the turnsignals to fit into these brackets. i paid $20 for a product that is basicly a paper weight. YAY!
B000JFHMVG|5|Great product @ a great price
B004ZCKGHQ|5|Banksy rules!
B0017UBHQS|5|exactly as described. took left overs to my local mechanic for his work. good price
B001EA0LUY|5|GREAT PRODUCT FIT PERFECTLY ON MY SILVERADO ON ALL FOUR DOORS  WOULD RECOMMEND
B005IRXTEO|5|2000 Jetta TDI - fit perfect. You can not get a better deal for a very good shock!
B004NDMCGU|5|This tool is excellent quality and fits well in my handlebar bag.A good choice for small repairs on the road
B000XBKAQU|5|Very quick ship good quality
B000JZHM3Y|5|I just got today my intake and installed right away.... I went to the beach (2 hour travel) and I feel a nice difference and throttle response... even also the engine sound is better... I am using this intake in wife 2002 Corolla with 7afe (Asian model)  with a Dynomax Super Turbo and the whole setup is perfect for the car.
B004ADW68C|5|Came in when it said it was and looks beautiful. Very nice upgrade to the factory stock headlamp. The PT headlamp replacement is a pain so you want to make sure you have a good replacement when doing this project, and this is a very good selection.
B003RWQATI|1|it did not work for my 1999 mercury villager
B00G7W0UM8|5|Nice
B009B4270M|5|Couldn't find strut boot for it had to modify old one to get it to fit.Make sure your wheel hub is straight the bottom hole is oval and if you just tighten you tire may be off.other then that its fine.Did a small test drive felt great will see how a longer drive feels.
B0015MFYC6|4|Good Product. Just need more detail directions for the functions and better way to get custom tunes instead looking for dealers.
B008ZOIJAG|4|Really nice caps sets wheels off nice. Good looking very happy with the product.Would purchase them again.Price was reasonable. Happy.
B007TY59TM|5|just as I expected.. and the price was very reasonable.
B002UXT3NU|3|Pretty unnecessary, i bought on a whim. Nothing really special about it. I wouldnt buy again
B000C5YD42|5|This was the exact part for my 2000 Avalon, and it took care of my check engine light (code 1135). Price was better at Amazon compared to other options.<br /><br />Had to get underneath car with 22mm wrench in left hand reaching through opening near trans-axle, and reaching towards the right, while lying on my back.  This position gave good access, a good vantage point for squirting PB Blaster, and good leverage. My arm was stretched all the way out when I was trying to disconnect terminal, but finally got it.<br /><br />Check engine light has not returned in a week of driving, so I am good to go.  Perfectly pleased so far.  I don't look forward to having to replace this one (rear bank) again so I hope it lasts another 157K like the original.<br /><br />Based on experience thus far, I would highly recommend both Amazon as well as this replacement part.
B001GMX9Y0|5|Installed on a 2008 Avenger R/T in about 1.5 hours (the most time consuming is getting to the battery on this car).  Remember this is designed to be installed outside, underneath of car.  (someone mentioned that it took them hours to route the power cable underneath the carpeting and such through the car to the battery).  Open the trunk and pull back the carpeting and remove the wing nuts holding the taillights in place (two on each side)and use a socket to depress the cone shaped holder in to release it.  From underneath, go up behind the bumper and feed the short wires to the driver side taillight.  Gently pull up on the red tab on the light socket and depress it to slide the socket off.  Plug in the Curt Socket to the taillight and slide red tab down and do the same for the other Curt socket to the wire socket you just unplugged.  Do the same for the passenger side and mount the converter box to the underside of the car with cable ties (provided).  Jack up the driver side front of car and remove tire.  Then remove the plastic plugs in the wheel well fascia.  This is done by prying out the round center plug (not the washer looking thing)with a flat end screw driver and then a small open end wrench can be slid in and rocked side to side to get it the rest of the way.  Once it is out, you can pry out the rest of the plastic piece with a screw driver.  Then undo the two screws connecting it to the fender well (7mm socket).  Remove the negative battery cable (12mm) and the positive (10mm) Hook up the black cable per the instructions and route under the car and put it all back together.  Not very difficult at all and it works great!
B000WBQ4U2|5|I used this product to crimp some A/C fittings on my '77 toyota pickup.  Everything worked great and it was very easy to use.
B007N6TXH0|5|It mounted easily! It was everything described and more. It makes work around the house easier.  Thank you Thank you
B00E1SOY40|5|They were exactly what the description said they would be. My husband had no issues using this product. They're brakes....
B00ED3HY3Q|5|was exactly what I was looking for.  it protects my wood floor
B009AQS4IU|5|These license plate frames are very sturdy and they give my Hummer a feminine touch.  I like the way they look!
B000C9CDI6|5|It fit properly and worked perfectly.
B000ABB1P2|5|This stuff does a great job of preserving my motorcycle windshield.
B007CPLEFG|5|The Hyundai Sonata 2013 perfect fit!!! We received a quote from a dealer for $217 dollars to install a drivers side tail light assembly.  So My wife and I decided to viewed the installation process on YouTube, it looked easy and it was.  You only need to remove 4 to 5 nuts and disconnect the power source that's all! It only took us about 30 minutes from beginning to end.  FYI if you drop one of the nuts in the dark empty space below it will make your installation a longer.
B001TJ3HUG|5|I was surprised to see how well this worked on all types of leather
B00B1AKFUS|1|Although product description and reviews stated otherwise, these in channel visors did not work on my f-150's auto raise windows. They also seem like they are not quite exact for the truck. Installation was simple enough. The instructions say to put the included &#34;clips&#34; at the front and back of each visor to keep the window from hitting the visor.  For a 4 piece set they only include 4 clips instead of 8 and they don't do the job. The &#34;scotchbrite&#34; square that comes in the packaging to clean the channels is a joke!. It's the size of a postage stamp. They also seem like they are not quite exact for the truck.
B00EFDYFHW|4|worked as designed. tooked for ever for the manufacturer to deliver the parts.
B005C5UWNS|1|The Aftermarket Company that sold this to me has a horrible customer service and is very unwilling to help with problems with their products. I would highly recommend avoiding this company.
B00075XCT4|5|Installed on a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo. It went on easily like it was built for the vehicle. Looks great. Nice powder coat finish. Husband and son installed it in under an hour. Shipping was fast and packaging was secure. Very pleased with the purchase.
B0007LDXLA|5|I got this for my mom and she really loves it. The long handle makes it easy to get the top of your car, especially when you're not that tall, and she was concerned about getting something to remove the snow off of her new car that wouldn't scratch the paint. It's pretty pricey compared to others, but she is very happy with it.
B00RK3EASI|1|Unfortunately these cv boots don't last more than two rides. I bought a set and my friend did also for our 2013 Mavericks.  The inner boots get hot from running them and then the pop open from the pressure. The axles seem ok so far, but the boots are not correct.  They need to be longer  and a different rubber like the OEM boots. Sixty won't stand behind the boots even though they are not good. I would look at another brand axle.
B00K9UGBPO|5|Fast shipping. Went on great
B00KGIJOC6|1|didn't fit
B000JZY7IW|5|I put these on a 2005 Sequioa Limited and now the rear lift gate lifts itself. It does require a little extra downward pressure to close the lift gate, but no more smashing heads when the old ones decided to not hold any longer.
B00R244KYY|4|👍👍👍👍👍👍
B008FCE6KK|3|Parts fit my 2015 Buick Enclave.. but the fit of the metal tap plates into the plastic slide parts was very poor and required otherwise unnecessary re-operation of the plates and plastic parts before they could be used. I needed to buy and use a 5-.8 mm metric tap to get the mounting screws to work.<br />The instructions and parts list, as mentioned by other reviewers were pretty bad. The You-tube video mentioned by other reviewers was NECESSARY to to the assembly since the instructions did NOT say how to remove the plastic &#34;chrome&#34; slot cover to begin the assembly.
B005TMIK10|5|Installed easy. Seem to handle the carrying load well. Satisfied with the price and quality of the product.
B0002KNVPE|4|Works as needed. Bigger diameter than I needed but that was my fault.
B00029XBCI|5|as described
B001INL9KI|2|I ordered this decal and on the plus side it came quickly, three days i believe, however it was not what i expected, for less than 4 bucks i should have known, but based on the picture i thought that this was the large decal and it is not even 6\\"x6\\". I dont know what the #A1470 refers to, but there is nothing in this post to indicate size to the average viewer, other than the picture which appears to be the window of a car in which case makes the sticker seem bigger than it is, this is false advertisement, if i didnt think my friend would want the small one in addition to the larger one, i would demand my money back because now i have to go and buy another decal which is very inconvenient at this time. So seller, thanks for wasting my time and money.
B000182F0Y|5|super good
B00RNSI9EQ|5|Great item...and fits just like OEM!
B006SYN4AA|1|Frayed and deteriorated quickly.
B0009IQXXG|5|works great
B0081IHYUW|1|Would not order again
B002VGA1SM|2|This fan was a direct fit replacement for my '08 Honda Element.  Went right in and lined up with all of the clips and pieces of the original.  I'm very happy with the overall fitment!<br /><br />Unfortunately, it is MUCH louder than the stock fan was, almost embarrassingly so, but it does seem to function well.  The fan has held up during cooler months without problems, but the upcoming summer here in Arizona will truly put it to the test.<br /><br />All in all, this seems to be a good value for a direct-fit replacement if you need a new fan and don't want to pay the high Honda OEM prices.<br /><br />UPDATE:  The fan made it just over the 2-year mark before it died completely!  Not exactly &#34;reliable&#34; in my book, considering the OEM fan lasted nearly 8 years!  I'm stuck ordering another TYC fan simply due to the outrageous price of the genuine Honda product right now and the fact that I only plan to have this vehicle for another couple of years, but it's clear that this fan definitely doesn't deserve a high star rating for anything other than price!
B000CIV71G|5|I'm very happy with this oil filter. I installed it into my 4.6 liter V-8 engine and I'm very happy with it and would order again.
B004TRKBOK|5|Well constructed and seems to be easy to use fro the feel in my hand. These items can and have saved people from nightmare situations.<br /> The price makes this a great value.<br />  craigsfolly
B005JU5X6M|5|OEM blade.  Best on the market for my Toyota Avalon Limited.  Once you use these, you'll never settle fo ra standards wiper blade again!
B0028MLGRY|5|great
B0049Z6WMM|4|This was the only pulley I had an issue with when replacing all my pulleys and belts.  The issue is really ACdelco's fault.  If you put in your VIN they MAY give you this part as the replacement part... and the reason... they don't make one identical to my original part, but this one will fit.<br /><br />I decided to use my original which has three bolt points.  One of these days I will replace it with one made by a competitor that is a perfect match to my original.  My concern is it could snap the ears off the water pump where the thing bolts on.  I did not want to find out.<br /><br />So glance in your engine and see what you have.  If it is two bolt points with no triangular mounting bracket this is the one.<br /><br />I will include a photo of my water pump.  The two bolts on the ears to the left are where this would connect.  The third bolt on mine went firmly into the solid body above the water pump mount.
B000CITKCE|5|Works great and at a good price so I ordered another one.
B007VRC9MM|4|Worked fine , I would get it again for the right application
B00068XCQU|4|Very Reliable.  Keeps the battery fully charged and ready for the next demand. I have two of these units in constant use.
B002PZ1ISG|5|Same stuff good price and reasonable shipping
B003GBJ3DU|5|Seems to work.
B004UHRFSO|1|Buyer beware, it is not as pictured.  It is the &#34;spun&#34; look which is not my taste and you can barely see the logo.  It is cheap, it arrived looking like a dog had chewed it with scratches and dents on the pink part.  The &#34;tear drop&#34; shape is not aligned properly, it is garbage, do not DO NOT waste your money.  I will be receiving a refund.
B00C5SYW2M|5|Fit like it should and worked like it should. It actually looks a little beefier than the OEM.
B001D315LQ|3|I gave it 3 stars because it did actually work. I used it to measure the back pressure before and after the cat. After I used it to measure pre-cat, the end of the hose melted onto the connector. So I had to cut it off in order to use it in the rear o2 sensor hole. If you only plan on using this a few times, it's a great deal, but otherwise you might want to spend more money and get one that will last. I also read an article after I bought this on how to turn an old o2 sensor into an adapter, and then you just have to buy a low pressure gauge.
B000EQ8GRO|5|I like how my car drives now so far excellent thank u all very much going to tell all my friends
B006M3FYUU|5|The mats fit perfectly in the Highlander and look really good. They are great for helping preserve the carpet in the vehicle, particularly on wet, rainy days!
B000GU3KHO|5|Well built, elastic rim is very secure.
B00RW7BXP0|1|I bought these lights less then 3 months ago, they seemed really nice and bright to begin with but now there is already 3  red LED's on each light not working, pretty bad when I have only been out with this vehicle 12 times at best and they are already burned out.  I tried getting an answer on what kind of warranty they have and I cannot get an answer for that I would definitely not buy these again if that is all the longer they are going to last and company wont tell you there warranty.
B004YJWA74|3|I bought this to reduce sun/heat in a 2011 Toyota Prius after struggling to find a mesh-type shade that would fit the back window, a window which is long and slanted toward the rear.  I wanted something removable because I live in the north where I'd like to have full sunlight in the winter.  I've used the removable mesh shades and been happy with them in the rear passenger windows, but couldn't figure out what to do in the back.  This seemed like the answer.<br /><br />This product was initially somewhat hard to work with, because the \\"static cling\\" is VERY clingy.  After spraying with a lot of water, though, it un-stuck and was pretty easy to handle.  With trimming, it fit the window well, and does a good job of blocking sun without being too dark.  It also can be removed and re-applied easily.<br /><br />The primary problem, though (as others have mentioned), is that the optical clarity is not great from the inside.  This isn't because it's too dark, but because the static-cling film is not as clear as adhesive-type window tint.  When you add to this that my vehicle's window sits on a slant, it makes the visibility considerably more poor than other types of tint.  From the outside, you'd never know this unless you looked very closely, but from the inside it's really impossible not to notice.<br /><br />For my purposes, though--and considering that my car has a second rear window panel below the primary one that I didn't tint--this product works pretty well.  It would work slightly better on windows that are positioned more vertically than my rear window, since when you look straight through the film it is noticeably more clear than when viewed on the slant. When compared to the options that the mesh-style shades gave me, and considering both the price and the fact that this allows me to go tint-free in the winter, I'm happy with this product and would, in the right circumstances, recommend it to someone else with limited tint needs like mine.
B003A4MP06|5|great product
B00L6SDPK2|4|Looks good
B004RGRCGI|5|Must have for trash and cleaning up trails
B000C9PCR0|5|Bought this for 1953 Chevy fit and workes like new again
B0006HNRDO|5|Perfect.  Worked just right with my Supertrapp aluminum end cap. Using 5 discs for my Suzuki drz400s. Love the sound, and very tunable with number of discs to find right back pressure and noise level.
B00QOJ027C|5|Love the decal!
B00T3GQCJ0|5|Installed as direct replacement! Fired right up!
B009DJM11K|5|Great Price and fast shipping.
B001C6GQQ8|3|This hitch was easy to istall on my 2010 Rav4 but it sits way too low on the vehicle. Hopefully it won't get destroyed first time off roading.
B00877SL2M|3|item was as shown so far work well
B002R0YMZK|5|This Parking light lense worked and installed just like a factory unit should.  Looks good and matches the original giving the vehicle a stock look.  Highly recommend this product.
B002692308|5|this was a great deal at a great price, easy to install and replace old broke part and looks good as new
B002Z311MQ|5|You cannot remove or replace an IPR (Injection Peressure Regulator) on the Ford 6.0L dfiesel without this part. Once the pressure regulator in tightly installed you back the socket off the sensor nut, to turn the electrical connector to the correct position. You don't, you just busted an expensive replacement part. You gotta have it. It's a good price and it works just fine.
B001PNMBUI|5|I ordered this waterproof rocker switch for use on my motorcycle to link the remote brake light sensors to both my wifes and my Gmax motorcycle helmets. The is a very heavyduty switch and worked perfectly for my application. I would recommend this switch for anyone needing a heavyduty quality switch. GAMA electronics provided great service and fast shipping.
B0031AWJZK|4|Didn't fix right had to remove the bow-tie cap and clue back them on. Lost one already.
B000C55Y54|4|Direct fit, steering feels much firmer and ride is less squirelly.
B0009V4GLE|5|FITS MY 2006 FORD TRUCK LIKE A GLOVE INSTALLED IN 15 MIN LOOKS GREAT.SHOWS FOG LIGHTS IM READY FOR THE LOVE BUGS
B000C3ZE3S|4|its ok but not needed so check if yours are bad
B000C11JIY|5|Excellent  quality & price
B0050SG9KW|5|Perfect for finding TDC
B00548VTCQ|4|I bought this item for $470 on another site.<br />Its recommended that you get it installed at local muffler shop. The sound is pretty good deep growl specially when switching gears, its not obnoxious at all and drone is minimal gives your v8 A NICE sound, rich.. deep. If you are looking for ricer super loudness look somewhere else. Overall this is a good flowmaster cheapest kit you can find and will not disappoint you, gave me 2 more miles to the gallon.
B004I0ZC06|5|This is a great product at a nice price.  Installation was a breeze and works perfectly.  I am happy with it and would certainly buy car parts here again.  MXP
B0068ODC66|5|Work great instructions or fantastic
B00AA5IUVQ|5|Great for bypassing relays and not having to run around trying to find a cotter pin or a piece of wire to do the job. Looks more professional from customers point of view.
B00080QHMM|5|I had the previous version of this digital tire gauge. It served me faithfully for almost 10 years. Very accurate and easy to use. Unfortunately, you could not replace the battery. This version works exactly the same, but with the added benefit of a replaceable battery. The only drawbacks I see are size (it fits in the hand well and takes up that much room in the glove compartment) and no way to easily deflate a tire when over-pressurized.
B00F6BBAIE|5|my car is co sute now
B000LE6AXG|2|The massager works just fine, but the heater is very poor - and doesn't seem to work on the days that you really want it to.
B0016L19CK|1|Loved the Jensen stereo but the remote was utterly useless. It didn't work out of the box so I tried 3 different sets of fresh batteries. It never worked with any consistency and NEVER worked from more than 2 feet away. Entirely disappointed in this product. Don't waste your time.
B000DZXIL0|5|I love this wax, it's easy to use and does a great job.  Once a year I polish up all the tractors with it, it keeps them shining like brand new John Deeres.
B006R0AZ9S|5|I bought this light for my shorlandr trailer it never had a license plate light before so i drilled three little holes two for the screws, self tappers, and one for the wires. tapped into the running lights and perfect. Its water proof so water and snow cant get in which is what u want anyway. Easy install and promptly delivered.
B00J1NFQRE|5|5 stars
B00KTHZZ3Q|4|I have not done anything with it but I think I'm pretty sure that it is what we needed
B00AJQUU9G|2|no this is bulls***, they are lying it is not a lower unit they are a scam
B006I256YO|5|Great fit for BMW  e53 x5 and has excellent rust protection. Rotors are as heavy as oem rotors overall good product.
B000GZPH1G|5|This is my 3rd on I've bought.  I lost the first one and liked it so much I bought another one...and then decided I better buy a backup.  My first long trip (2500) I didn't have one and my wrist/hands hurt so much, I sanded down a piece of plastic that I could wedge in-between the throttle and the handle next to it, to give me a little break.  Then my brother-in-law told me about this.  So I bought for a coast to coast trip.  I also bought a manual cruise control, but hardly even used it.<br />The rubber band and natural auto tightening design works well.  After a few hours I would have to spin it around because it had slipped a little.  Over all...very happy with it.
B0009IBJAS|5|This seems like a well built little unit--real metal, fairly heavy, not your usual cheap plastic crud.  The wires are also heavy duty, even the clamps are oversize and well made.  It is very easy to hook up, and you can connect three different ways to your car's electrical system.  I chose to hook directly  up to the battery terminals, and it was very easy with the large oversize clamps.  Light came on right away, started charging as soon as power connection made.  The only unanswered question is durability.  If there are any problems with the unit lasting, I will come back and update this review.  Currently this is a &#34;keeper.&#34;
B00JH6KNKU|4|I thought the product was very good nice and bright easy to install
B002JATYOC|5|Good price, and arrived early too.
B00068XCQU|5|What a wonderful device! I used the pigtail conn, so its a quick release to the trunk where my battery is located. Just as the doc cited, the LEDs cycled normally all the way to solid green and a 13.5+v battery. The car its used for sits alot and after 3 weeks or so, sometimes you could see the drain in that the windows forgot their positions and the airbag warning stays on. With a properly charged battery, this does not happen. Very satisfied with this small box so far.
B00GJX1NYE|5|Very well made, worked grate.
B000CGTKA8|5|I got these because they weren't as expensive as the EBC Yellowstuff and they had the most all around stats for the best price. I am highly satisfied and after I installed them there was a time when I had to brake hard to make a U-turn and these brakes really made my Mini Cooper stop FAST and also had no squeal or jerking at all. These were easy to install and feel a lot more powerful than the OEM MIni Cooper brakes. Everyone online, from the MiniUSA to North American Motoring forums claim that these are one of the best brakes out there. There is no wonder why so many people recommend them, and now I am confirming that.<br /><br />-Ken Flemming<br />Author, How to Get a Job in Video Games
B0072W5OXW|5|Great product,love the color...
B0052FREAC|1|You have to modify the mount hole for a mounting bolt. As in bust the old thread piece out of your broken one. And it doesn't have a plastic pin that you need so you have to find a screw that will work...  Terrible set up.. How can you modify something if you don't have the parts to even modify?
B00407RSCM|5|a bit hard to understand instructions but best out there that i could find
B00A66GYDA|5|Amazingly easy to use, accurate, and not expensive.
B005N00GHY|5|My husand loved this magnet! It is really nice. Semper Fi!
B000LNQJQ0|5|I wanted this to protect my house key because I live near water.  The description is accurate and the product is of good quality.  Good buy for the money; I can't find them locally and that is certainly odd.  If you can they want too much money for them.  I think this is a good deal.
B0010E00T6|5|This turned out to be a great purchase for me.I bought it on amazon for $15 and asked my oil change guy to install it for me. Don't be tricked into paying $40-$50 at dealerships or oil change places for something that cost $12-$15. These shops sell these to unbeknownst customers all the time, and with a little research they can prevent this ripoff.  It's easy to install too. Just watch a youtube video for your car's make and model, and they will show you how to install it. If you are not sure, ask your oil change guys to install it for you.<br />There will be &#34;fresh breeze&#34; artificial smell (like if you use air freshener in the cabin) for a day after install, then it will go back to normal.
B000W0KT86|1|Premium 100% stainless steel? I don't think so. Within 2 months of installing it, the lock started to discolor. It is now an ugly, rusty piece of junk. I haven't tried to remove it yet, but if the lock mechanism is made of the same \\"premium\\" stainless as the exterior, it's going to be a huge problem.
B000BUU5WW|4|Works great.
B001DRLPZ8|5|I have no complaints although the filter I removed had an angled port on one side while this did not. Regardless,  I was able to finish as it just is a hose that attaches and slack was more than sufficient. Do not know what the vehicle had originally and this worked fine. Engine started right up and throttling issue was cured. Still running smooth today... Sharing is caring...
B000IYHD2G|5|Was getting code for bad O2 sensor on my 2004 Mach1. Replaced with Bosch brand which worked for awhile but code came back. Ended up replacing both sensors with Motorcraft and no more codes. Only go with Motorcraft.
B0085ILPTO|5|Just what I expected..
B003XWEO7C|2|If you are planning to put these on a Harley look somewhere else. The insert does not work and the throttle will stick when the switch cover is tightened up. Had to rip them apart literally and modify them wasn't worth it.
B0057B66NM|5|item fit perfectly on the car it was a perfect fit
B00EYV2PJU|5|Awesome product, used them for my majoras mask skull kid cosplay and it was on point lights lasted 7+ hora on one set on Duracells
B000EJBP74|5|very accurate very nice product and good price thanks like i said if i m going to the store the price is to hi
B001O07VI4|5|It came on time and it fit just right I loved it
B001QUDX98|5|As expected
B0053P6BRS|5|See my review for the base that goes with this for more details but I'm extremely pleased with this hitch head and Trends Auto customer service.
B005CWA46G|4|Good price, fast shipping, exact fit.
B00CMY2154|4|Good and nostalgic !!
B000IYTANQ|1|Item arrived with rusty screws and still filthy from the car it had been on.  Listing says \\"remanufactured\\" but as you can see in the pictures above, it is \\"used\\".<br /><br />Remanufactured should look like the picture, ie some form of remanufacturing, cleaning up, replacing worn parts etc.<br /><br />Buyer beware.
B001BY0A2M|5|I picked this up at Kroger's one day.. a little over $7 a bottle. It worked great.  I found this deal on Amazon and who can refuse such a savings?<br />The product does not streak, it has no unusual odor and I use it in the house for stove top and mirrors.<br />I experimented one day and even used it on the wood laminate floor.  NO STREAKS or dulled look,<br />I ordered 2 sets and I am all set for the rest of the year.<br />With 4 cats, there are always little nose marks on the bottoms of the windows. This takes care of them quickly and efficiently.
B0058NY4L0|4|I've only used the seat once so far for a 175 mile ride and it was much more comfortable.  The only problem I had is that I tended to slide forward on the breathable fabric whenever we were stopping.  A small problem compared to a sore butt.
B002XM51CA|5|My dogs was hesitant to come down the steps until we used these to cover them.  Now the dog happily bounces down.  Great if you are barefoot too.
B007OSL3DY|5|This lock fit perfect on my truck. Seems like really sturdy metal and would really be hard to defeat I believe.
B000VZMW9G|5|Fit like  glove !! really good quality!!
B000TCGJ2W|5|Ordered this for a 2000 Chrysler Grand Voyager.  The item shipped/arrived quickly and was packed well.  The side mirror fit perfectley and works just as good as the old side mirror.  I would recommend this part if your replacing a damaged side mirror.
B009CWMS20|5|Very bright! Seem to be reliable. I had to purchase these to replace the bulbs that came with my original conversion kit. These plug right in and seem to function flawlessly(which I wish I could have said about the originals...) of coarse the &#34;originals&#34; were from a different vendor, that Amazon does not carry any longer.<br /><br />Amazon is awesome!
B000I8XD30|1|I bought and installed one of these also. It lasted three nights then shorted out, tripping home circuit breakers as soon as I plugged it in. From the time it was installed it always seeped slightly, creating a housekeeping mess.    Do yourself a favor and save the hassle of cutting (and later replacing) a perfectly good radiator hose and install a freeze plug heater from the start.
B000RBILHQ|4|I am going to say that the massage part is great. However I can’t guarantee pain relief.
B0028PJ10K|5|Just what we needed!
B0006ZRG4C|4|I have this on my smart car. I figure any extra &#34;look at me&#34; lights can't hurt on a car that small! It takes a bit of installation as it has to attach to the existing lights on your license plate but it is easy enough. took about 10 minutes to do. The light is very bright. The one complaint is that when the light is not on...its kind of an ugly plate. Its clear and you can see the tubing. It is def meant to be seen at night.
B00KTIWI1C|3|Didn't realize this was a case only... not an actual remote.
B00E9LQV6S|5|This is our third Heatshield brand custom-fit and it did not disappoint! We have three totally different vehicles and the shields fit each one perfectly. Well worth the money!
B001C6OYYY|5|It worked.  After I replaced the entire wheel hub and sensor
B00IJ1PZ20|4|Looks sweet, but I must've not read the description correctly because I had to go and buy a $100 press tool to install the master link..
B004W7KS2M|1|Inadvertently ordered the wrong one?? Very difficult to return, basically was told send back however you want,& once we get we will decide if you get a refund or not. This was only after answering 50 questions(seemed like) about my vehicle-almost as if they didn't believe I tried& it didn't fit!! Over$100, going to cost a fortune to ship back on my own(refused to provide return ship label), might not get money back,I don't think I'll order my CORRECT hitch from these guys!!!
B0024NWT2S|5|This is the third time I have been asked for a review. The second time  I did this, Amazon sent me a rude letter saying I violated their advertising policy. If I get another letter like that I will be done with Amazon. As far as the product, I am ecstatic with this product. It was exactly as described. Will definitely purchase from Auto Halo again if the need arises. The price was right, great job Auto Halo.
B00538TU8C|5|prefect!
B009DJYUUK|5|Great part love it thaks😀
B002Q8Y208|5|Of course there are a lot of products out there to make cars look good, but I came across these because these were the nicest looking lights I found. I have an '05 Magnum and my old lights were tore up... Granted it did take me about 3 hours to install, mostly because of front fascia removal and install, and I did it myself, it was well worth it. The lights themselves have extra wiring to show off the Halo rings and LEDs, and if you are electronically inclined, should be very easy. less than a half hour per side. From order to arrival was about 2 days, very quick! If you are looking at these, look no further. if you need assistance, email me at socalbri@gmail.com. Also look at the extra pics I uploaded with notes. Not a lot of products have customer pics, that's one thing I like to see is what it would look like installed. Check it out!
B001P11SCM|5|Controller is easy to mount, easy to setup, and applies trailer brakes smoothly and properly. Took 10 minutes to install. Couldn't be more satisfied!
B007OSL3DY|5|works great
B00EZWCFAM|1|Worked good first three times using it. Then the hook straightened out and dropped the sled. Now can't lift my sled. Defective piece
B0042Z307E|5|Very nice and appears to be durable and washable. Folds up nice into the carry/storage bag.
B00FI230KM|5|Fit was great! Had to modify bracket for power steering reservoir so it did not rub the reservoir!
B000COAZEK|5|Used this product on several vehicles, many under extreme conditions.  Performed exceptionally well - no fade, low dust, no noise and long life.  Worth the extra cost, especially considering the longevity.
B00LYL6P9E|5|Good product, arrived on time
B008GUESF4|5|I have a 2001 f350 6.8 v10 , I had a misfire with no engine light on , I bought 10 coil packs from this seller . After installing them along with new plugs trucks runs like a champ again. The good thing about these coils they come with the coil , plug boot , and spring along with dielectric grease . You can't beat these for price or quality. Super nice product. Thanks guys.
B0023TDXFA|1|We bought these for replacement headlights for our soon to be 16 year old daughters car. Upon opening the box we noticed a defect in the passenger side headlight. My husband has taped them and rigged them as much as possible and the passenger side headlight will not stay in place and will not stay on. Her car had to have headlights so we felt obligated to keep them. She just got pulled over tonight for having a headlight out. Now we are stuck with a set of headlights that dont work and we cant afford to buy her new ones right now.
B0019WQRY6|4|Looking for standard sway bar linkage replacement for 2005 Malibu Maxx.  Never tried Mevotech in past for either of our 3 vehicles...Ford-150 4X4, Hyundai Azera, or Malibu Maxx.  So, I bought two for my Malibu.  Product appears beefy(sturdy) compared to the stock linkage.  Although length of stock and Mevotech linkages are identical there were some differences.  The stud length on the stock Malibu is 33mm, and for Mevotech 43mm.  The extra length of stud comes into play when installing.  Not sealed linkages, each comes with zerk fitting.  The box doesn't say if they come pre greased, nor were there instructions in either box stating that they must be greased.  Nonetheless, I lightly greased each before installation.  If you grease, don't over grease or you'll pop seal detaching it from ring.  Now about installing on Malibu Maxx.  Through trial and error I discovered that there's an easy to way and a hard way to install.  There are two ways to install; top 1st and fully tighten, bottom last.  2nd, fit linkage through each hole before tightening nuts. To save time and headaches install top linkage first (top attached to strut assembly) and fully tighten, then install bottom.  I installed bottom first on left side of Malibu and fully tightened only to discover when I tried to attach the top it would fit through strut assembly.  The extended length of the Mevotech stud(10mm&#62;), combined with zerk at end of linkage prevented me from fitting through strut assembly.  No matter how I twisted the linkage to make it fit it would rub against inside of wheel well.  I could've removed the zerk fitting and it might have fit.  I just removed and installed top first and bottom last.  Right side of car took half the time.  However, you can install anyway you like.
B0002ILK1S|3|worked fine
B004NCY1DS|5|This product worked almost as advertised, but the USB wasn't charging my cell phone.  My friend has a similar one that works just fine and we swapped all the parts (batteries, cords, phones) and narrowed the problem down to the USB port.<br /><br />I went to the Goal Zero website, filed my complaint, and with just a few email exchanges their customer service sent me a brand new one at no charge!  I'm such a satisfied customer and rarely are product exchanges this easy.<br /><br />If I don't update this review after now, just go ahead and assume the replacement I received today works like a charm.
B0002T8GKA|5|I love this stuff.  I have a 1952 police car and the gaskets don't keep the water out when I wash it.  I can clean and wax the car at the same time without water with Dri Wash.  It also does windows and chrome.  Does a pretty good job with bug splats too.
B00KQ8D8MI|5|Came new in factory sealed Volvo box.  Easy to install yourself. You can rebuild your old pump, but only the one side.  Not worth rebuilding old, it won't last. Bite the bullet now.
B00DRUI5YS|5|nice
B001OBMONK|5|inexpensive rotor, but do the job, i recommend
B0030B2N10|4|Bought this as a gift and they said they liked it, so gotta guy who likes his garage accessories, this may be just the thing.
B001TE0IMG|5|I use an inverter in my Silverado to power my laptop. I have found the inverter to be the quietest one I've owned. Previous units had the fan running continuously and I found the fan noise to be a real irritation. The fan on this Cobra inverter only cycles on for a couple of seconds every so often and even then it's not loud enough to be noticeable.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Seems to work ;)
B00KW0VIZ4|1|Not happy with it and I'm not going to return it it's too much of a hassle forget about it I'll never purchased this again
B002HEOMF6|5|It's real and nice
B001EP0H8A|4|There weren't a lot of these to choose from in the 1.25&#34; size and I probably would have preferred not to get chrome, but it seems well made.
B000BXKZUG|5|This stuff is GREAT for taking the creakyness out of a leather jacket. Just don't use too much.<br /><br />Also, when anybody thinks of using WD-40, honestly, use this instead. WD-40 is not actually that great of a lubricant, it just keeps things from rusting. This is the stuff you're looking for if you want to put the 'ol duct tape and lube axiom into practice.
B005DXNL0A|5|Bought to use on my 2012 King Quad 750.  Fits the machine very well, allowing easy access to the fuel filler and easy removal of the seat.  Currently mounted using the included straps - which work much better than I expected.  It is very secure on the machine whether bouncing down the trail or being towed at freeway speeds.  The size of the box is great - it really swallows a lot of gear.  The latches are secure and easy operate with heavy gloves on.  Great Amazon price and fast, free shipping are always pluses.<br /><br />Update 12/18/13:<br />Having used the box for deer hunting and ice fishing, I'm happy to say it continues to exceed my expectations.  It just swallows up the gear...it really is bigger than it looks.  I originally mounted with the straps thinking I would be taking it on/off.  That hasn't been the case, so I recently hard mounted the box  with four stainless steel u-bolts (I didn't like the ones provided by Kolpin...my first quibble).  I removed the rack from the machine to make it easier, and the entire task was accomplished in less than an hour with no hassle.  Very easy to do for anyone with hand tools and basic mechanical knowledge.  In general, I find I prefer the hard mount - more solid, more secure, and no worries about straps coming loose.
B00KTIR6CS|5|Took me less then 5 minutes to switch this out for my old key fob.  Before I switched to the new one, I thought that the battery was almost dead as the buttons weren't responding all the time.  Turns out it was the buttons and not the battery!  It looks sooo much better and works great.
B004J398Y8|5|Works good
B000OR18BE|5|This thing is great - especially when hosting large groups in your RV or people who don't know how to conserve water :)  Now I can leave my RV set up at my favorite camping spot all summer and not have to move it to get to the dump station.  FYI, if you want to keep it from being stolen, either secure it with a cable lock or do what I do and connect the drain hose to the RV and Tote.  Nobody's gonna want to mess with your poop!
B0053D8YDE|3|The antenna diameter is 0.125&#34;. Same as the Wilson 1000 antenna it is designed to replace. If you are looking for a whip-to-stud adapter, look for one with a &#60;0.200&#34; opening. The smaller adapters are used on shorter antennas and the .200&#34; adapter is used on longer (up to 8 ft) whips.
B0065HI9UA|5|I ordered this since I have an ATV & Motorcycle and was sick of unscrewing it from each battery when I wanted to move it to the other. The adapter is the same as the one you get with the charger itself!
B00551B62K|4|Great product. Just what I ordered.
B008G21YE0|5|I can see now at night, thanks a bunch!!
B000COSBIW|5|Had a lot of problems driving a little bit than usual. Car seems to fly..... Fitted 4 new Monroes and car is doing well. Can drive faster than ever and reliable
B0002SQTYG|5|This is a high quality product which has really come in handy in my producton world. I use the Clore Solar ES2500 to power up scales in remote areas of my plant. I've also used this model in the past to jump cars, but I seek to pass along my success in using it as a power source where A/C is not handy. Make the investment! It's well worth the cost. I've tried the cheap $40 units at local stores but they seem to be disposable models in comparison.
B00192KYE0|5|Bought this for a camping trip and did the job perfect. Its sturdy and tough, and collapses to take up almost no space at all.
B00F3T01MU|5|A design needed to realize expected life cycle of synthetic oils, highly recommended for regular oil changes.
B000JKM6BM|1|i'll start with the good. It looks like a tank. Forget about hard top removal. It's a pain to get the cross members back in place. On A YJ the front post mounts are off the front window frame. Getting to the bolts under the dash are a contortion act on passenger side. The driver side requires the removal of the whole gauge assembly to reach the nuts. The quick release cross bar has knobs for quick removal. The plastic nobs just brake and need to be replaced by lock nuts. Again as with all their products the powder coating is no better than a rattle can, and is even scratched by light brush. Its a squawker to when u hit any bump. Wind noice is mild and not an issues. AMAZON says it fits the Renegade. IT DOES NOT. It took extensive modification to make it fit. Once I put a yakima cargo carrier on it it helped with the noise and rattle. Id read jeep forum post for the real scoop on Smittybilt
B00480GYF8|4|I installed these in my '94 subaru impreza wagon a couple months ago and so far so good. Light output is average, but not amazing. Hoping they last. Nice price and no complaints so far. I usually stick with Philips and have no problems. Love amazon prime shipping!
B002T09MNU|5|exelent
B009GJ322Y|5|Looks really good if you like the mudflap look, can't beat the brand. Does the job and makes the car look 10 times better when it's dirty, don't do any off-road (brz) but PA quality roads it does the job.
B000H8XO3A|3|Good deal for the price!  Was a little smaller then factory, so there is a small 1/4&#34; gap below light, and I had to buy longer screws to install it ($3 at auto parts store).  I also had the seal go bad after a month.  But it is a good working headlight (with bulbs) for a quarter of what the dealership wanted and half of what auto parts store wanted.  Got me back safely on the road for much cheaper!
B005HAYDR4|4|Sturdy, easy to install and great to have something to hold on to!
B00HJXSXGE|5|Not unusual to get a comment on the street that my 4Bumpers looks cool. Then asked does it work and I say, it is a great way to stop parking car attendants and inconsiderate street parker's from dinging your car. Every car in our home is protected by 4Bumpers
B000B8I61G|1|Small, flimsy; it broke within a fortnight of purchase. Yes it is inexpensive, but inexpensive should not equal worthless. Don't make my mistake; spring for a couple more dollars and get something better.
B00BQN5OX8|3|Had to return,  my lifts are different sizes right one is 1/2 inch shorter then the left, , these are the same size, this caused by tailgate to rub along the top when opening.
B004GKNAIO|1|I'll give a 5stars for the product itself, well designed and a good glove, for the company selling them a 1 star..if I could them a zero I would, just be careful if you want to order a size other than small... I ordered a medium but got the small. to tight for my son to use and the company say they do not have any more gloves... with what they cost and the return fee I may as well give them away as a gift for someone. had to buy another pair that fit him from a different company... not happy with customer service for not updating amazon and removing the options function... customer service replied back to me and told me to contact amazon to rectify their problem... now that's not on!
B002PN53DO|5|Price was great so far everything is great delivery was quick
B0099TDYWE|5|Awesome universal filter. Used it on KZ1000 and a Harley.
B0049W14Y6|5|On time delivery and as described. Thanks from Ross
B000YC9FTQ|5|works great
B0009XQUKC|5|works exactly as it should. have verified the pressure readings with a friends Snap On pressure gauge and they matched exactly. It doesn't have the fittings to test every kind of system, but it will test the main bulk of systems out there.
B008X5XFQA|5|This is a great replacement for an OEM mirror.  My mirror was damaged during a car break-in, and Nissan was charging $700 for a replacement 350Z mirror.  Thinking that was a bit insane, I looked for alternatives.  This has all the features of the OEM mirror, and is actually a little nicer looking.  The Homelink buttons feel robust and responsive, and the mirror is a little wider than the stock mirror giving me a superior field of view.<br /><br />If you need Homelink and auto-dimming, this is your best bet.
B000C4929Y|5|Very easy to install And  work great.  There is a great step by step on jeep forum
B004C24OYU|5|I purchased these and had an issue with one side when the bike got wet. I was very frustrated with both that and fact they did not mount as advertised on the back of my speakers as the magnets were too big. CYCLE SOUNDS TESTED THE PRODUCT FOUND THE PROBLEM,HONORED THEIR WARRANTY AND SENT ME A BRAND NEW PAIR. The owner of the company, Ed Files, called me personally to apologize. Very satisfied with the overall product and experience with the company. And I apologize to Ed for my previous post.
B00KRAR4HA|5|Bought this for the TV in my travel trailer, works great.  Nice long cord, I was able to hard-wire into the trailers 12volt power.  Now not only can I power my TV, but thanks to the 2 USB ports, I can charge my phone & iPad too.  Like the in-line fuse as well.
B005D5T6C0|5|Great product and fast shipping! I love my new interior lights!
B0001EW4FO|5|The vent shade was delivered fast and in good condition.  It went on the vehicle fast and easy.
B001IH8Q0A|5|Worked well to attach a cargo carrier.
B00559VRDU|4|exact replacement. received in less than a week. good price. THANKS
B00MH4VSJY|5|went on very easy and has stayed so far.  would buy again.
B0024NT0HA|5|couldn't beat the price for these lights. i paid about $60 give or take. but after doing the headlight restore kits 4 times and all different kits i gave up on having nice clean headlights, well this deal was the one to save my life and restore me to have joy in my car. definitely worth every dollar and was an OE match for my 03 ford focus dark metallic grey. they matched in color of my OEM originals
B006ONI5PO|5|Purchased these for a 2 door Wrangler. The set also includes a third  cover for the rear door handle. They look great and are easy to fit. Drew many favourable comments from observers. Very happy with the kit.
B000CSGX4C|5|Works well and is a very good value compared to it's price elsewhere.
B0075XI71O|5|thanks
B00DBFOCYG|4|gel filled seat 8&#34; by 15&#34; , 2 straps go under seat, clip on seat pan , 3/8 in thick , cheap solution to expensive issue
B000CIE5N8|5|THIS KIT IS SUPER EASY TO INSTALL WITH JUST A SCREWDRIVER. THERE ARE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE AND NOTHING ELSE TO BUY. This kit fit like a glove and made the engine run silky smooth unlike the Petronius brand which screwed up the ignition system.
B002NF0K9Q|5|Worked as supposed to.
B0006MRSMK|5|It is exactly what I needed for my trailer project. It fit in the space and was easy to install
B000XECJES|5|These cloths are fantastic for just about anything.  The soft microfiber is great for glass such as tv's, computer screens, tablets, etc.  They also work great for all purpose cleaning such as kitchen counters.
B00DYOVXZ0|5|The device works exactly as expected. It arrived two days late, but that was due to the carrier, not the seller.<br /><br />I use OBD Fusion on IOS and Torque Pro on Android and both work great!
B00KFYSD6Y|4|Great leather looks good, but it is cut a little tight in the corners
B001NYE24C|4|It fits correctly, which always a concern on this particular hose.
B0002VAZA2|5|Fast delivery and receive what we expected!
B0002I94CK|5|Great replacement part at a great price
B009ZLZDMU|5|This product was just as I expexted. Verry sleek and makes the car look better install takes a little time. But happy with results
B002R1097O|1|Junk, had plastic pieces floating around inside of light and I could not install, I had to drill out to install slide lock.  I would have returned except I have a state inspection in two days, do not buy.
B00EKO7UZK|5|Great product and Amazon delivered on time.
B00DDOSNH2|1|I looked at all the reviews before buying these bulbs, and was impressed with the rating these got. I received mine, and right off the bat everything looked great. All the bulbs worked flawlessly, and the brightness and color are perfect. Fast forward 3 months, and almost EVERY bulb has lost one or more of the LED strips, some have more of the LEDs burned out than they have working (and the ones that work are flickering). I was using my RV full time for most of time since I bought these bulbs, but LEDs should still last SIGNIFICANTLY longer than that. I am now standing in my RV that is about half as lit as it should be... I was almost tempted to buy more of these same bulbs, since I love everything about them, but after seeing a few other reviews like mine, I'm not going to chance it. Buy at your own risk.
B004J2V0ZO|5|Needed a simple code reader to read and remove nuisance code from computer. Works great and does what it claims!
B001O7PNNM|5|I washed my car. I waxed my car. I even used a clay bar, but nothing was able to get rid of these deep mineral water stains; until I tried this stuff.     My sprinkler system is hooked up to dirty, minerally well water, so my car got some bad treatment for a couple months. Deep deposits everywhere. I used Meguiars clay kit and this paint remover, and all those deep, discolorations on my black celica disappeared instantly. (Well, a few hours \\"instantly\\")    My Black Beauty is right back where she belongs!
B00153EYTO|1|I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a by-pass button to eliminate the 30 seconds that I have to wait for it to transfer between two power sources..... that rates a 1 star<br /><br />I had problems with the first TS-30... the manufacturer was very helpful... snd shipped me another one free of additional charge.... good for them... I'd give them a 5 star.<br /><br />The sales literature wasn't clear to me that the 30 second wait would be so intrusive in my expected smooth, continious operation.<br /><br />I don't recommend this product to anyone without careful thought and complete understanding of it's operation.
B00FDQPCR2|5|Light was easy to install and provides plenty of light in my shed.  The cord is long enough to place the unit anywhere inside the shed.
B003QHQW8I|5|solves the do it your self problem. very necessary to avoid a mess.
B005F2WIYO|5|Works smooth, fitted perfectly to my 1973 Dodge W200 powerwagon.
B0002UNON8|2|This stuff is spendy compared to most of the other scratch removal products, so I did some homework before buying. Meguiars put together a very nice video of Scratch X in action on their website and I was sold. And indeed, it worked fantastic. Put a little time and work into it, and your car will be scratch free just like the day it was painted.     Unfortunately, that appearance only lasts between 1-3 months. Then your car is back to its old, scratched appearance. I believe the \\"2.0\\" in the product name refers to how many months you can reasonably expect it to work until you're out there yet again polishing the same old spot you thought was gone.     If you plan on dumping your car or selling it to some poor schmuck, this is for you. It's the ultimate concealer. As far as the work of actually removing the scratch, no go on that. I haven't quite figured out what makes this stuff so special, but it seems to be little more than makeup or coverup for cars. It works on the same premise as Clinique or Loreal Paris.    Maybe someone out there likes spending half an hour ever few months polishing the same spot on your car. If that's your thing, buy two tubes for a year of fun. But for the person who wants a solution that lasts, keep looking. I still am.
B000GRZGMY|2|Some what disappointed. Looks nothing like picture, the only thing you get is a chrome plated billet license plate bracket. I was expecting to receive turn signals ( turn signal/ license plate relocate kit ???) I see no way to utilize this with any type of turn signal lites. The quality of what you get is very good, but there is no way this was ever worth the retail price they list of $ 184.00. Barely worth the $26.00 plus shipping( $ 37.00 ). Power sport was very good on the re-shipping of product to my proper address and responded to my e-mails.
B00NLQUYTW|4|Matches perfectly
B000C1Q68M|5|I bought these brake pads after the cheap one I bought at autozone died on me within 5months. Make sure to flush the air bubble out of the brake fluid. Braking with these is easy and smooth. It has been over 6 months and the pads are still pretty thick. Really worth the money! I will be getting these again.
B0002MB2BM|1|Cheap. The blue on top of the shifter is already coming off and the pedals move side to side because of how they are 'secured'  on. Just buy something more expensive, my set will be going in the trash.
B000EBI58O|4|This bucket really is the same item that Griot's garage sells.  I use Griot's for everything that requires professional knowledge to formulate (waxes, polish, orbiter), but for something as low tech as a bucket, I'd rather pay half the price.  Eurow's bucket includes the lid - that's a separate purchase if you buy the bucket from Griot's Garage.<br /><br />The removable drain grid is great for keeping sponges from sinking into the wash water.  When the bucket is dry, it's handy for holding your car wash supplies.<br /><br />If the bucket came with a rubberized, no slip, non scratch bottom, I'd give this product 5 stars - but since Griot's version doesn't either, maybe I'm just being too picky.  If you need a wash bucket that can store your supplies, get this one!
B004VQNXH6|1|It may have been a fluke, but the description said it would fit my 2007 mustang, and it didn't. The hole was too small for my shifter.
B004IIZJAQ|5|so cute and a great price.  gave it as a stocking stuffer for my daughters car.  she loved it so much
B0009V1WS4|3|This was too small to fasten the lock portion on a 2011 Silverado 2500HD. So it works just like a non-locking hitch pin for me.
B000C9TCUS|5|I love the WIX oil filters.  They are far superior to Fram w/out breaking the bank.  Fast shipping and everything was as it should be.
B002Z600DY|5|Who would spend $200+ on a mirror?<br /><br />I would since these mirrors keep my interior free of clutter.<br /><br />Also, did you know that cars get broken into and burglars steal your garage remote and rob your house since they know you are not home? They get your address from your registration. This stops that, unless they steal the whole car.<br /><br />I use to use a key chain remote, so I did not worry about that issue. However, the Prius does not have a traditional key. So, my garage remote would be in my pocket and I'd have to dig around for it before I could open my garage. What a pain!?<br /><br />One downside with this garage door opener is that you can open the garage without the key. This is bad if you park outside your garage. Someone could break your window and open your garage door.<br /><br />Of course, there are people who will buy this to enter security gates. None of the above would really be an issue in that case.
B00757IGYS|1|When we received the Antenna we desperately needed, we put it on right away then and checked it out.  We cannot use it now since it does not help to hear any radio stations and is worse than if we have no antenna like our situation was before.<br />Thanks anyway, Jac
B00ABZC4Y4|5|The bikers shield  women's deluxe rose extender is everything I expected.  It looks great on my vest. I love it.
B0067ECS6W|1|Ordered 2, 1 showed up full of rust
B0054CVBKC|5|This thing works great! Best unit for the money. Battery life is very very good, sound is good, bluetooth connection works perfectly and install was a breeze.<br />Best unit on the market.
B0006TIRZA|5|Simple and easy to install, just make sure that you are installing with a inline fuse or you will have problems. Durable simple and perfect!
B008Y59DDS|5|Nothing better than OGIO in gear bags, back packs or anything they make.  Great quality.  Lasts for years, even when traveling every month.  Great product.
B00CHEUN6I|5|Good
B008GVE1G4|4|For what I thought to be a cheap light unit as in cheap quality I was more then satisfied that unit is constructed better then expected. Suction cups kinda sucked and not in the way supposed to so I mounted mine with small L brackets.
B00AO6IK20|3|Ever wonder why you can't find a picture of anyone wearing these kind of helmets? My thoughts are no one would buy them. Worth the $31 I spent, but definitely not &#34;low profile&#34; -- if there is such a thing that isn't a novelty helmet. The eagle face is kind of fugly (again, no full pics of all sides of the helmet for a reason), but overall this is a decent helmet -- or second helmet for a passenger. I do like the shield. It is a little difficult to pull into position, but it does look like it covers more than enough to be useful. Plus, it is one of the redeeming values in the style department. It helps make up for the overall bubble look of the helmet. I'm a full face helmet guy normally, but I was hoping to get and use this to match the style and look of my new cruiser -- as the full face look doesn't seem to fit the bike. Meh, style over substance isn't exactly the best safety policy anyway. Very comfortable, and I do like the quick release strap. Would NOT have purchased and been satisfied with this at or even near full price.
B001B5FDAK|1|Useless. Bought this to clean my Toyota Tacoma. Works ok on the roof but the ends of the brush are hard plastic and while washing the thuck edges were hitting the paint. I used something like this before and the ends were microfiber to help with this. The other problem is because the top of the brush is hard plastic its hard to get in tight areas to clean. I will use this on the roof but use my 2.00 sponge on the rest.
B0097BC6UU|1|First of all I have purchased another similar set for my 2013 truck and they work perfectly.  These not so much on my wifes car.......I have installed In-Channel before so I know how to do it.  Read all the instructions and did a dry fit to see how it would fit.  This is when I saw that it will be a very tight fit.  I installed and on the first one window impacted the shade.  I adjusted and had to do that on each one.  On the last one i did a small crack on the edge but decided to keep the windows up for a few days to get a good seal.  When my wife lower and raised the window for the first time in 2 days the shades jammed under the window and broke.  After a few days everyone has either cracked or broken pieces.  I will be taking out all pieces and finding a better made replacement
B000LG73TE|5|It worked after sooooo many tries. Had to use YOUTUBE to get a better understanding.I saved a lot of money!!!
B001D589ZE|4|Quality product at very competitive price compared to PepBoys or other Auto shops.<br />I'll order again.
B00ALPW926|5|Fit perfect.  Sold the car not long afterwards and was glad to not have the mirror be a problem.
B007YW7C94|4|Good as all Alpinestars gloves, however the protection is a kind of plastic. It disappointed me.
B0094QJ55C|5|Works good! just make sure it meshs with the worm gear, also Replace the o-ring while installing as the old one will be hardened and brittle.
B000FGEF6Y|5|Mu husbands truck does not have a lot of storage space, and he really wanted to something to be able to hold everything he needs for work.  We looked for a while until we found this product, it fit his new style Chevrolet Silverado perfectly.  It has a compartment for his change and also has cup holders that fit two fairly large drink cups.  The price for this item is great and well worth it.
B00P2SYBJG|5|fit perfectly, restored power and economy on 4.6L Lincoln town car. I replaced the spark plugs at the same time. take note of if the old plug boot (rubber insulated connector from coil to spark plug) has oil or a watery mix of oil and water or coolant on it when it is removed. It seems these engines have a problem with the spark plug well filling with oil,coolant or a combination of each. this eventually gets up under the plug boot and allows the high voltage spark to go to ground through it instead of the spark plug thus causing a cylinder mis-fire. I have seen this several times on different cars. check problem cylinders  for collection of more fluids on a time frame of your choosing, just don't wait for it to do it agan before attending to it because the ignition coils on these engines generate a lot of voltage and the short circuit around the plug causes  them to get very hot and cause them damage over time. at least that's what a tech told me, so avoid the nusance and possible expence of more replacements.
B0029T0S70|4|Bought these for car drying/detailing, etc. They work well for that purpose, absorb a lot of water, and dry out relatively fast. They do leave a bit of lint on the car at times, but not bad. They also have a nice satin border, for what that's worth.
B002NI0NQI|5|I bought this hook and loop package to use in my car. I have a home made mount for my GPS. I had used industrial strength hook and loop and it worked quite well, until summer. I live in the Mojave desert and I found that the Stickem on the industrial strength stuff would lose it's bond. It's August now and & with this new, high-temp stuff, nothing has fallen off yet. The actual grip of the hook and loop isn't as powerful as the industrial stuff I had before, but it's plenty good enough for my application. The main thing is that my patches are staying stuck to the dash.
B000XJRYQ6|5|A-OK
B001B1K35Y|5|It was a great purchase, the product is of high quality, as all the products that it commercializes jafrum, already I have bought several previously and continus buying of this one it marks and recommending it widely
B00HJ15H0Q|5|Fits perfectly! eye catching!!!  very nice!  I am pleased with this product!!!
B0009H527A|5|part is as described. fast shipping
B005OZN300|5|Perfect duplicate that I needed. Had a local key store cut it and used a website to program it. Worked perfectly.
B003JANIZ2|4|I did opt for free shipping, but never would have done so, if I knew that meant it wouldn't even be sent out until a week after I sent the payment.  It seems to me like the \\"free shipping method\\" is just an excuse to be lazy and take extra time, before the purchase it shipped.  It states that free shipping should take a certain amount of days, but they don't tell you those days don't even start until after they decide to ship the product.
B004KL0I9I|4|I bought this for my 2011 Subaru Outback. It works perfectly with the Torque Pro application for Android smartphones. You can wireless view and log data as it's coming out of the ECU. Perfect for recording data points as well as reading off and clearing error messages. No issues with the pairing process either.
B0076QWP40|4|Simple bolt on hitch, took five minutes to install, though the box came trashed and the hardware had all fallen out by the time it arrived. Luckily it bolts to five existing points so I just reused the bolts on the car. If I ever tow something heavy (I bought it for a bike rack), I'll replace them with heavier grade hardware.
B00B4DIMR0|5|Very good
B004VTFRKE|5|Lights are great, installed them very easily about a month ago. Only issue I had was I have an 07 ram and the package says 06 when delivered. 06 has 3056 light bulbs for the swap (reverse) and my truck has 3057 called to ask about it and spyder didn't know how to answer. It blew my 3057 so I'm guessing I have to go with 3056
B0007IN9LW|5|very good,
B000CPJRPW|2|The unit I got was defective. Amazon would likely replace it, but it's too much hassle to return such an inexpensive part. I just got another one from a local store.
B00CS8OX8W|4|Great product. Looks exactly as pictured. Good quality and you don't have to worry about the edges curling up and falling off
B008AZA4C6|4|Nice quality, but kind of small.
B0000DYV3N|5|The sound seems to be loud enough but not to loud. I cannot hear over my radio or traveling at higher speeds so I like it so far 2 thumbs up. Does it stop Deer? Well I have not seen to many around so maybe they do not like the sound. k
B000KYXRSI|5|Works just fine in my 2006 Ranger. Has been through multiple rainstorms and still functions perfectly. Pretty easy to configure also.
B0051CAE1C|5|Every diy'er should have this in their toolbox.
B00666GOX4|5|No noise and grip great on my wing!
B003N9PCTO|5|My used Honda did have a DVD player but remote was missing. It got dangerous and annoying each time the kids wanted to watch a DVD. With a snap of the fingers, I got this product and it latches on to the rear ceiling. Kids can now control /fast-forward/pause, etc at their desire. One of those must-have's. Make sure you buy the batteries too because they are an odd size and hard to find in grocery stores or discount stores.
B000YE17D6|5|Fits great and works better than original.
B0073W281W|3|I live in LA so I thought I wouldn't have a problem with the reception, but I could really tell the difference between the stock antenna and the Stubby. Good thing I only listen to the radio 10% of the time. I really just bought it so my antenna wouldn't whack my garage door or the top of parking structures.<br /><br />Pros: Looks awesome!<br />Cons: Lose a little a quality, hear more static (which I was okay with)<br /><br />If I had to to buy another \\"short antenna\\"... I would probably try another brand that made an antenna a little bit taller. But I will never go back to the old/long/stock antenna!
B009S9RCPU|5|came earlier then expected, sticker quality is great, I would recommend  this item to anyone wanting a vinyl decal quick with good quality.
B001NYTHMO|4|These headphones are great.  However, unlike the ones that come with the Odyssey, you have to turn this model on/off or the batteries will run down.
B006FKAHFM|5|Great instructions, easy install, works as described.
B001PWA0IO|5|Bought this for my dads 2012 F150 after I bought the one for my 2011 Avalanche.  Works great and easy to install.
B0013RLL1G|4|it works well as described. i wish they had something like this when i had all of my other jeeps...
B009RUCHWI|4|Just as good as the expensive sylvania lights. Nice packaging, but one lamp was rattling around, thankfully it worked. I would give 5 stars but one lamp was rattling around in the package.
B00266BS8E|5|These are going on my 1962 Ford Falcon as I switched the power train for a V6 4.0L Ford engine
B001A5F1YE|1|I bought Whirlpool washing machine. It did not work from the first  day they delivered it. It's five months into it and we've had numerous  poeple coming in to repair the unit. My home has turned into their factory. Their customer service and warranty sucks. I will NEVER buy another Whirlpool product ever again. Their service model puts the onus on the consumer to spend time and effort to fix the problem that clearly falls under company's juristiction. There should be a timeline as to how many times customers have to have repairman come over to their house. There should be a timeline as to how many months a broken device should be unoperational at the consumers house. Whirlpool shamelessly claims that they are following a process. Their process is written solely for the purpose of wearing down the consumers. They try anything to avoid solving the problem and when it's evident to even the service men who have come repeatedly to fix it that the piece of junk is unrepairable, they refuse to replace it. They have asked for second opinions and sent the same repairman for it. A second opinion by definition should mean two things: 1. The first service provider wasn't good enough (which is already a problem since Whirlpool is the one who contracted them). So, why would you send someone over to the consumer knowing that you will ultimately challenge their diagnostics and deem them as unreliable?  2. You didn't trust the firsts diagnostics so you should send another company or repairman for a second opinion. Whirlpool has sent the same guy who deemed the machine as unrepairable and keep sending him back everytime I call. As I said, their policy is to wear you down.  Not sure if this is a sustainable business model. I wouldn't be surprised if they go under. No wonder people consistently turn to European products. Very disappointed.
B002OI3SNW|5|What can I say Putco stuff fits perfectly and the chrome is just top-notch.
B00K17A2E6|5|Fantastic product
B001UJB9AU|4|Sheds just a bit bot worth the price.<br />Holds lots of water<br />Negative is you have to switch hands to use both sides
B008KZJV3Y|5|Fit perfect in my 2013 elantra!
B00L2XVAPS|2|Lasted maybe a month, when they worked they were very bright.
B009TRTSAS|4|Only just installed it but it works great.
B008GFKY1Q|3|It is as expected
B000C9NZYW|5|Make sure you have the .50 spark plug gapper for platinum plugs (with wire hoops). Don't use the &#34;coin&#34; style gapper on these plugs, you may break the platinum tip.
B00068OIYA|5|I was a little skepticle buying these as I could find no reviews. They ended up working out great for an aftermarket piece, and to date I have had no issues with them. Highly recommended.
B002PUX528|5|I must say that this product looked better then I thought it was.  People are now asking what type of SUV is that and where did you find the lights?<br /><br />Thanks APC and Amazon for offering up a great product at a affordable price.
B003BYRB72|2|poor product did not last a Year
B0013AG61S|5|Great product!
B00480FHJC|4|Does the job as an oem replacement bulb. Not exceedingly bright, but works well. Installation was by the book in my 2001 VW Golf.
B003ZLVL22|4|Good product but would be nice to have a page of instructions, for that you get 4 not 5 stars
B000VL699O|5|Very Happy with this purchase. Not too loud, I wish it had been less expensive.
B000C34KT2|5|Fit perfect, eliminated all of our squeaks.
B0002M9Y58|1|i wanted the one shown in the picture that was shown on amazon, but unfortunately i have received a different item.
B00F0YASQ2|5|Work great. Glad I didn't have to replace the factory radio highly recommend the lp7 over the lower models having a remote out makes the install so much easier
B004M7VF2O|5|Fits the Genesis sedan perfectly. I could only wish Hyundai made the install a little easier. I've used the Fresh Breeze filters in my Toyotas for many years. They work great.
B001BK7VE6|5|under constuction
B000XEGEWG|5|THESE ARE AWESOME!!!  I got a pack of these to use for household cleaning.  I put them in the washer and hang dry (don't add fabric softener.  Great for dusting, and I cut one of these into 3 to use with my swiffer wet-jet- it fits perfectly and sticks to it well.  I just throw in washer when done and they're ready to go!  I use these all over the house, and you can use different colors for different rooms chores- I use blue for floors and green for bathroom- then I know my bathroom clothes will not be used elsewhere!  They are great!
B001AY2WLU|2|My score is not based on the product's efficiency or usability. Please understand that a tool this portable may not provide enough torque to get even some simple jobs done, but it has its uses.<br /><br />My score is justified by the rather weak center rivet that holds both halves together. My tool loosened within a few days of use to the point that it will not hold onto my keychain. Also loose are the rivets that secure the arms of the tool. I still keep the tool around but it is now secured with a rubberband.
B0009ZEW6E|3|I'm sure it's a good filter.  ...for whatever car it is intended for.  You should go to the FRAM site and compare the manufacturer's model number with the one that Amazon suggests.  Amazon took back the part that did not fit no problem - so don't be too scared
B00EFEY0FI|4|Great item and fast delivery.
B008I2P0KC|5|Someone keyed my husbands 2013 one ton truck while we were eating lunch one day. The entire rear quarter panel would have to be repainted at a considerable expense. Hoping this product can save us a good deal of money, but we haven't tried it yet as the weather hasn't been conducive to applying it yet. I'm sure it will work well.
B0081TUSK4|5|great!
B001PWA0IO|4|simple, easy,
B004JVTOKS|5|My daughter is an EMT and recently got a new SUV and wanted a hitch cover.  When she saw this one she immediately purchased and is so happy.  It is very well made, arrived super fast and well packaged.  We purchased a locking device so it would not be stolen.  All around great purchase!
B00EKTIV30|5|I have purcaseed these mirror cover on my 2013 Dodge Charger,I must express that it's a very nice addition!
B004ZIV4SU|5|Product fit well, was easy to install, and was a lot cheaper to do myself than paying a shop to do it.
B000BQOO0U|1|I got this as a replacement for a similar but old plug-in cooler my family had.  Not sure if mine was a dud or indicative of all of the Wagan colors, but it failed to keep my refrigerated items cool for a 3-hour car ride.  Sent it back for a refund.
B000CPC5T2|3|Good product, fast shipping.
B0010Z4MDK|5|This battery was shipped to me right away and I received it within 2 days. I plugged it into my alarm system and it began charging immediately and I was back in business. The price was great!!! What a savings I had priced alarm batteries and most ran $35.00 and up what a bargain price I got. I would recommend this battery and using Amazon as a good source for anything you need.
B00OB68DTE|5|Highly recommended! Would buy again in the future. Thanks
B001MJRVFU|1|And as such, am completely underwhelmed<br /><br />I would seriously reconsider buying goods like this online again. - although I acknowledge this may be a one-off
B0076R5W7Q|4|Just not ideal for a 3-yr old!  Just does not stand up for those that are younger and harder on toys.  But great otherwise.
B00DSD7K54|4|excellent quality!  Now i carry Freddie with my on my Laptop where ever I go.
B000K03S9K|5|2003 Dodge ram 1500 slt 4.7L Quadcab 6.5' bed, fits perfectly, same as OEM except hanger rod a little lighter duty, but fits the OEM hangers.
B006B7YLX8|5|Installed on a '13 F150 with 5.0L V8.  Not sure it added any power but it definitely adds nice intake noises when you get on the gas.  Its also settles into quiet when just cruising down the road.
B002X1PNRY|1|Bought one of these for my 2001 Sequoia. It looked well made and installed easily. Unfortunately it only lasted a couple months because the metal bent so it didn't work anymore. Once the weak metal bends it became so weak it didn't work to bend it back. I even tried welding a bead across the weak part but when heated the metal just disintegrated. I purchased the same part from Dorman on Amazon to see if that one works any better.
B001VJZOBO|4|This devise is the perfect in-garage parking indicator/assistant. It is easy to program, provides the familiar light sequence, and therefore saves impacts on the garage walls or other items in front of the vehicle. It is very affordable also.
B002ZKFKMG|5|Bought this as a gift for my husband who is an avid road and mountain biker. He was always loading and unloading his bike gear and this keeps it all in once place and together. It is tough, durable, lots of pockets, lightweight. Just a great, highly portable gear bag.   I am thinking about getting one for my car for misc kids stuff as it is so great!!   Thule used to sell this at Target, but I couldn't find it there. They have also come up with some new totes, but this one is by far the best!
B000GU7OQC|5|The Joker MacHine Through-Hole License Plate Frame Chrome shipped with four chrome bolts and four lock nuts. The problem is the 10-24 bolts and the 10-32 nuts were of different thread types.  Without checking for specific thread types I attempted to screw the two together, finding the first to be extremely tight, I moved on to the second, which I had a bit better luck with, though I did have to literally lock the hex wrench in a 4&#34; BENCH mounted vice to get a good enough grip on it to tighten the bolt/nut set exerting at least 20 foot pounds of tightening force to assemble the set. I thought that since these were lock nuts that perhaps the nuts just went on hard as I always attempt to avoid nylon locking nuts as I think there are better alternatives.  Going back to the first set, the head of the hex bolt stripped before the nut was even close to being tightened. I have a bolt cutter and was able to split the nut to get it off. I then immediately removed the nut from the second installed bolt, and was lucky that it came off just as that hex head stripped. And yes I do use quality Craftsman tools and had the hex wrench fully inserted into the bolt inset.  I then decided to look at the nuts and bolts and could easily determine that the thread patterns do not match as the bolts have a course thread and the nuts have a fine thread. I should find this extremely surprising coming from a company like Joker, but then few things surprise me anymore.  This is of course unacceptable. I did go to the hardware store and for about $5.00 bought some black 10/32 flathead hex bolts and stainless washers and nuts as replacement parts to get the license plate/frame assembled and mounted. It looks okay, but is definitely not what I should have had to do to put this license plate frame together.  UPDATE: I contacted PowerSport Superstore and they told me to contact Joker, which I did by email. Joker immediately offered to replace the bolt/nut set. I received the replacement items only a few days after contacting them.  I purchased this frame with the Joker MacHine License Plate Back Plate - Black; and the two items meshed perfectly together. I mounted the items with my WI License Plate (which I had to elongate the mounting holes a bit with a small circular file to get to fit properly). The bolt set allowed me enough length to mount the frame, back plate and license plate on my 1988 Honda Valkyrie; and it all looks very nice together.
B0061SHI7I|4|i purchased these to replace that boring oem light in my 99 grand am, they were a little complicated to install because i had to bend the terminals to hold in the light because it was a little short, so i had to make adjustments because it kept falling out of place.it was no big deal but i noticed the blueness was great but since my car depends so much on the dome light i really noticed the overall brightness wasn't worse nor brighter than the oem bulb, that is the only part that got me was it supposed to be super bright? these are ok for now but until then i will try to find a brighter one to where i could tell. i also wish the seller offered faster shipping, i had to wait a while to get 2 light bulbs (Cali to Michigan)  lol but i still recommend them though
B000FQ7S54|3|Just like previous posts it didn't come with instructions like it shows and the glue wasn't strong enough to hold it on had to use tape to hold it down but i guess all in all it did the job
B005WXN1F6|5|Grat product, was looking to put the large Monster decal on the windscreen of my motorcycle but it was way too big so beware.
B008J151H4|1|I had the Wolo 419 and was expecting more power / louder with this one. I was seriously let down. The tone/ frequency is lower (sounds deeper / more manly) which I really liked and really beats the factory honker, but its was probably only 60% of the power of the 419. If I could return this I would.
B000AL8VD2|5|I put this on almost everything that has an electrical connection. WAY… Way… Cheaper purchasing this tune then buying little packets every time a bulb needs to be replaced, or spark plugs.<br /><br />When I change plugs I put this on, fixed a poor radio connection putting this in the plug (Never flickers, or turns off now), putting some on bulbs insures an easy removal in the future. If you have had a stuck bulb you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Great stuff every one should have some laying around!
B000C9SJUC|5|Fits great on my 2002 Chevy blazer I lost two leaving them on the bumper to fill up, not anymore.
B005QIG8UC|5|Great price, seems to be a high quality build. I expected to be an XL, so that's what I ordered - it fits fine. I will say, it (the mat black one anyway) does scuff easy as another person here said. I tend to run a bit hot, so I'm seeing fogging issues, but that may be more a \\"me\\" issue than anything else.<br /><br />Still though - great helmet. If this gets stolen/lost/what-have-you, I'll happily buy another just like it.
B000VAKXVK|5|Good low priced set of tire chains. Not as easy to put on as the more expensive pairs, but easy enough for a couple of times a year. Overall good value.
B00480FHJC|4|This one is cheap,and it works, I don't care how bright it is, so ,the cheaper the better. Although don't know how long it will last, you never know.<br />Update, I just bought the third one. So the life of this bulb is about one year.
B0091UB5TA|5|Looks great
B002KNP0PK|4|I think some of the other reviews on here did a great job describing this jacket in detail, so I would just like to share my own experience with it thus far.  I am 5' 10&#34; and 150lbs, and I bought the medium jacket.  The waist line is fine for me, but I could see others complaining it is too short in the torso.  My wife thinks the sleeves are too long, but when I extend my arms to grab the handlebars I find that they are a perfect length.  The 'armor' pieces in the elbows, shoulders, and back can get turned lopsided when putting the jacket on, but make me feel extra safe without being too bulky.  The jacket is stiff out of the box, but some elbow grease and leather conditioner will fix that.  My wife is a big fan of the reflectors on the jacket.  At first she thought the vintage stripes looked dorky, but after driving in her car behind me at night she says they do an amazing job at make me more visible.<br /><br />All in all, I am pleased with the jacket and the amount of warmth, protection, and visibility it provides.  You will have to work the leather a bit out of the box (especially around the collar) but that's the only fault I really have with the jacket.
B000LY5JFQ|3|I ordered this &#34;perfect&#34; match bumper in black and it came in pewter. It was still a good buy and a lot came with it for the price. My husband was able to paint it to match.
B000CLZKKM|3|part was fine,if you replace this make sure you use the old shims or inserts that are on the old bolts,they go up inside the lower control arm, IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS THE BOLTS WILL SNAP OFF AND CAR WILL BE TOTALED
B00068VBX6|3|Although Smaller than expected, excellent quality.<br />Need to be creative for installation.
B000C3ZDDE|2|Replaced OEM shocks on my '02 Z-71. Don't see much difference. They were touted as performance shocks, better than the OEMs. My suggestion is to just buy the OEM if you are looking to restore original ride and handling.
B00126IDDC|5|Cables are not included, but you can easily buy them at your local hardware/auto store. Easy to hook up to battery. I used a Sawzall to tear down a barn and it worked great with a minimum drain on my car battery. 1500 continuous amp with 3000 peak amp.
B009PF8EYK|5|It works like a champ!<br />Thank you!
B00EER3FVG|5|product as described and great delivery. would purchase again.
B000C9WLA6|5|totally wix quality
B00D3YEGO6|5|I loved this license plate holder. I have received many compliments.
B00D6GWTPY|5|Feels of high quality. Snug fit so it will not slip off easily. Buttons and key release work as intended. Does collect lint if kept in your pocket which easily wipes off. Aside from that it is a great protective cover for you intelligent key.
B007BL4WPA|5|Great product, great fit!  Easy install in about 15 minutes.  Looks like factory with much less of the cost.  I definitely would recommend this product for a direct replacement air dam
B006WQGEU6|5|Easy to install, looks good, and protects my bumper from my dogs jumping in and out. Really happy I got this.
B00FSAUWVY|3|had hard water spots on my vehicle windows.  This made the windows about 70% better.  I can live with it.  I rubbed and buffed as hard as possible using body weight and all.  Still waiting for a product out there to do 100% on those waterspots.
B00FRHOMNM|5|Excellent wiper
B008N21TQ6|2|Poor quality, got scratched after about 2 weeks.
B000C8NTN0|5|I purchased this to replace a damaged timing cover on my 302 in a 1991 F250. The part fit perfectly, and it appears to be a well machined, high quality replacement. I am very satisfied with this cover.
B000VI06ZU|5|Very durable and heavy duty.  I have other step stools this style and this by far is the most sturdy!
B004WABZQC|5|Definitely less vibration. The original was in tact, though after 12 years the rubber had obviously hardened. After replacement, she was purring like a kitten.
B0014E36KM|5|It completely fixed my power steering leak after two uses. The power steering fluid level has remained steady for a month now.
B000AA3NHC|3|The package description does not specify if the kit is for a 6 or 10 gallon tank.  The kit I received was for a 10 gallon tank which will not work with the 6 gallon atwood tank I have and I had to return it.
B000QJDVO2|4|This is a well made product that does exactly what it claims to.  It is made of leather material and is quite durable.  It can attach to one head rest, or hang between two.  We have an 8.5 inch widescreen DVD player and the case held it just fine.  My only complaint is that it did not come with any paperwork on how to attach it to the seats; however, it did not take long at all to figure it out.  I would recommend this product, especially for the low cost.  I paid about $11, after looking at several cases that were much higher.
B007Y3VH0S|3|Just OK
B000GARM5K|5|Very useful!  I love that both me and my kids can use this.  The hinges on it are very large and built such that it's hard for my little kids to get fingers pinched in, which I love also!  Great product for a great price!
B000G26NI0|3|Definitely not the green I was hoping for, as many people mentioned earlier. As you can see in the picture, the left is the G2 posted pic. The middle is what you actually get, and the right is what I ended up doing to try and salvage my poor, poor calipers. Spray a very light coat of black. Can't complain about my results, but if I had known, I would have used caliper spray paint.
B0054TYK80|4|I would have given them 5 stars but they failed to mention in the advertisement that they are not solid on the inside and the 3M tape is cut every .5 to .10  cm so getting all the 3M tape cover off is a pain. Once they were applied it looks great and worth the four letter words I used to the seller.
B00APN8YT6|3|The helmet is very sharp looking and the quality is about average to above average.  Though I have only had it for a couple days now it seems like it'll last.  Matte finish shows finger prints easily and the drop down tinted visor works well but doesn't go down far enough for my liking.  While riding, the bottom edge can be seen and is a distractor.  Sizing runs a little small.  I have a 7 1/4 hat size and the medium is quite snug.  This may loosen up the more i use it.  Wind noise is minimal and at freeway speed, there is a lot of wind that comes from under the chin guard.  Vents work well.  Overall, it is a low cost, DOT approved motorcycle helmet.
B00ADPSVM6|3|Simple install. Hp rating can't be accurate. I didn't get the &#34;seat of the pants&#34; boost it claims. I did see a 2-.4 mpg increase across the board. It was worth the mot spent for the fuel savings.
B004EKB5HY|1|Not good quality and fade fast! At least I didn't pay a lot for these stickers but wouldn't buy again.
B003EOVHKG|3|The package itself seemed to be okay, but some of the powder coating on the parts were scratched, with a few down to the metal..
B005UTS6FW|5|I love these wiper blades and have told all my BREAST FRIENDS to buy these and HELP WIPE OUT BREAST CANCER..
B00BR05EEY|5|Awesome Product. Easy to use. Matched Color Very Well. Lightning fast shipping
B00F8LEB9W|4|Keys arrived promptly.  However, the batteries were old and after a couple of months, needed to be replaced.  It can be tricky to get multiple KEs set to the same security code - primarily because of the &#34;strange&#34; way Ford designed the activation sequence.  When I had my truck into the shop for other work, I asked for some help with it and it was a kind of hit and miss proposition but with two experienced staff, they finally got 3 of them set the same security code.
B0096J90KW|5|Good product and bright light.
B000F0WRS8|5|Fit perfect for the vehicle referenced.
B000COCTWG|1|Bough a pair but one lasted 1 month only, also noticed one was blue light and the other was yellow light, the one with the yellow light is the one that is not working after a month.
B0048YKWO8|5|Fast amd easy! Would definitely prder from again. It fit perfectly and was rather easy to install. Car now works!
B000EDUTX6|5|Fits our RV stove perfectly and gives us more counter space.
B008US97XA|1|This product is made for a different year bike. Description failed to include info about the years that it fits.  I wasted my money.
B00DQJ8T00|2|I lost several radio stations. Looks great though.
B004GCKRU6|1|Very poor quality, glass mirror shakes, vibrates wile truck is running. This truck mirror is not expensive but is cheaply made, not worth the money. Would not recommend.
B00BN450NO|2|It has no white its all Greg and silver
B00E815ELW|5|I have a brand new 2014 Ford Escape Titanium with the &#34;light sand&#34; interior and wanted to protect the light carpet.  I was a little leery about ordering these mats which were listed for both 2013 and 2014 models, but they fit perfectly!  They are extremely well made and will obvioulsy hold up well.  Worth the money for sure!!<br />I first ordered the tan but if you're  picky about matching color, the tan is darker than the light sand interior - I ended up with the black instead..
B004ZLL64Y|5|It was exactly what I ordered and what I expected it to be. It didn't take that much to get here either. I'm a very happy customer
B001DRLPH6|5|The dealer wanted to charge $$$$ , DIY in 10 mins and save your money , fuel mileage improved as well.
B00439Q05S|5|This product is easy to instal and adds security and piece of mind. With tailgate thefts on the rise and the addition of a tonneau cover make this a must have. I ran the wires to the passenger side kick plate and tapped into the wire power supply at that location. This only opens when I press the key fab twice as if you were unlocking the passenger side door. I am very happy with the end result and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to walk out to their truck only to find the tailgate gone.
B003JEISI0|5|Exactly what we were looking for. Fast shipping!
B005VK7IPO|5|What can you say about a genuine OEM part except it fits like it should and looks like it belongs.
B000C2ZJRU|5|These filters were used on mid-'70s Chrysler products and provide a return line to the tank to bleed of aerated fuel. I have used them many times to cure vapor lock problems. They should be mounted near the carburetor with the return fitting turned to the top for best results. Today's ethanol - laced gasoline is tolerated by fuel injected engines, but is the kiss of death for carbureted engines. The Reid Vapor Pressure is astronomical, meaning it boils at very low temperatures.
B00HAR8LY8|1|Did not work for my scooter .caused problems with carberator
B000EVYGZA|4|This works fine for its intended purpose, the display is easy to read. The only complaint I have is the little clamps that are supposed to hold the probes are very weak and don't really hold them well.  I end up just wrapping the wire around the middle and letting the probes dangle.
B000CMFSVC|4|I though these might be a little more form fitting, like Husky's other liners.  They're just thick, flat heavy rubber mats.  They work well enough, just not as much coverage and as I'd like.  They're about as good as some Goodyear mats I've bought in the past on sale for 1/3 the price.  If I had known, I probably would have searched for the Goodyears.
B00GXUE7DW|3|Good product not very bright though... Almost a purple hue to it.
B0031W4X8Y|5|This was what my husband was looking for and it fit his older chevrolet pickup truck perfectly. This was also the best deal.
B000FW2MWW|5|Very Useful
B0030WPSZ2|5|Great quality products at an affordable price.  I really enjoyed the entire package down to the grit gaurd.  Awesome value, fast shipping.
B005F5IYOE|5|Very well put together first aid kit. I decided to add a Quikclot set to it to complete a basic first aid kit.
B000KPU8JI|4|This is a very handy tool for troubleshooting. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it had a screen like the power probe 3. It uses lights instead.
B005M4Y1S6|3|The description was confusing as its called a Keychain but comes with what looks like a neck chain. Not great quality but ok for the price.
B003PI4JJ2|5|Product looks good and funtions great!!! Cant beat the vintage look and performance of this horn.  Had it installed on my vintage harley.Very old school.
B001R8WP0M|4|overall a good product. However, the chock needs 4 bolts and 4 washers.  received only 3 but i was in a hurry had to use what i had. no choice. the product is completely bent and not really usable anymore, however my motorcycle did not fall. too bad i was missing 1 bolt and washer. the chock needed 4 but only 3 in the package as witnessed by 3 other fellow riders who wanted me to return the product but i was leaving the next day so i had no choice. Too bad it wasn't there otherwise i could have used it again, but since I was short one bolt / washer i can't use it again. However the produt held up, just barely.
B00AZXBDY4|4|No problem -- We used the kit and the lawn mower works fine
B009E1NDYG|5|Great product.
B009DJLPYE|5|Driver's side rear tail light cover busted and found this on Amazon and easy fix.  only thing that was a little more of a challenge was exchanging the internal wiring/lights, but it took me maybe 10 min.  Highly recommended.
B00K658MBI|5|Felt a boost in performance and gas mileage!
B00778H1DW|1|it is too small it doesn't fit at all. It can work for a bike.
B008UZJKDA|4|Great helmet for the cost
B004A6LUNG|5|Great Service.  Great Price!
B004I0NQ04|5|This taillight came fully functional and took two minutes to install with a screw driver.
B000E7UIVU|5|As described, great fit on my XC90.
B00061SM9E|5|recommend this product for pulling of steering column gear.  adjustable jaw lengths and can lock the jaws from spreading.  handle medium duty jobs. recommend this product.
B00KNXACFC|5|awesome key fobs. direct replacement for my 2002 maxima, programming was a breeze, would buy again in a flash.
B00597NSBM|5|Exactly what I wanted and they keep my contacts from drying out. They fit very securely to my face!  Love 'em !
B002X91VTU|5|excelente
B00GWEVFS4|5|Perfect fit, custom use
B001RUB3GW|5|Made my car look new!  I had to use some spacers for shims to help align the headlights.  For added protection, I sealed the outer 'glass' - just in case!  Came with headlight bulbs and cornering lights!
B003GZJBQK|3|the first time i received looked good but weld on top right broke after a couple days of having it installed and started to leak. Amazon sent another radiator within two days. awaiting to see if this one holds.<br />Did fit perfectly into 2002 wrx with no hassel. One hour install.
B0045XRK06|5|Plug it into any available USB slot and boom. . . .Light!
B000VAW10G|5|Excellent
B00WL11AMS|5|The first thing I noticed about this little pump is the weight of it, that tells me they didn't use plastic parts on the inside which are going to wear out and break in a short time. This has some quality built into it. Now it comes with 2 little nozzle tips for beach balls and pool floats, and a needle for football and others that use that style to inflate. I used it to inflate my new pool float, it's not as fast as my compressor but it got the job done. I didn't have any flat tires so I purposely let the air out of one on my car, I didn't jack the car up because I wanted to see how fast and powerful It was. I inflated the tire from around 10lbs back up to 36. It took a few minutes , the pump didn't struggle, the built in gage was as accurate as my pencil gage.<br /><br />Built very well. Used this at the track to add air to the tires, the fastest cig lighter air compressor I ever used.
B0013HQADK|5|My main purpose for purchasing this exhaust was because it is stainless steel and I needed something that would hold-up to the salty environment that I live in here at the NJ Shore.  It looks great, but I was very surprised by the improvement in performance that my car now has with this exhaust.  It is like I purchased a new car because it is so much more fun to drive.  Anyone who owns a non-turbo PT Cruiser knows what it is like to drive an underpowered car, but this exhaust system helps improve performance to make the Cruiser the fun car it was intended to be.
B0019IO6X4|5|works like it suppose to, nothing bi
B000WJYZFA|5|Yuasa Factory Activated Maintenance Free Battery is EXACTLY that!!!! Delivered when it was suppose to get to me, installed in 2006 CBR 600RR and so far so good. Amazing!!!!!!!!! Get this product and make sure it's ordered through Amazon.com!!!!!!
B000Q86IQQ|4|This cupholder is a lifesaver! I drive a 1995 toyota camry and there are only two cupholders in my car. The cupholders do not fit anything in them except a pop can or a bottled water! It's RIDICULOUS!! I take coffee to school every morning, and I need somewhere to set my travel mug! This definitely did the trick. I mounted it alongside the center console on my passenger side and it works great! It's made of super durable plastic and adjust to fit ANY beverage :) perfect for my needs!
B0030Z4KW6|1|I considered it because it was the only aftermarket horn that I could find to fit my motorcycle.  Along with the High Tone Horn, they sound horrible.  I plan to put the wimpy original horns back on.
B000182DVU|5|Good quality and installs in minutes. Fit our application well and looks good.
B00HVJDHVW|5|Nice and at the right price.
B00L2XLL2U|2|If you keep your registration stickers at the bottom it will cover them completely. Easily twisted in hands- flimsy
B006ZHLJ2U|5|I ordered these for my 2013 Toyota Tacoma TRD Double Cab at the end of Jan 2015.  The lights are very bright - night and day difference from stock bulbs.  The instructions to install them come written on the box Putco provides, but I used a Youtube video as well to ensure easy install.  I will mention, the OEM bulbs were somewhat cumbersome to remove from the front lights, but once removed, the Putco lights went in with ease and they work as marketed.  As others have mentioned, they seem a bit pricey, but I believe you're paying for the quality.  In fact, I paid $45 for them and they are currently selling for $53.65 at the time I'm writing this review.  Now I feel like I received a deal!  At any rate, I highly recommend the Putco LED lights to anyone looking for better interior lighting and a somewhat 'customized' appearance (at least at night)!
B0010GDR9O|4|Would be 5 star except it did not come with the necessary gasket and was not particularly well packed. Delivery was prompt and it worked properly when installed, after I located a gasket for it locally.
B009F10S3Y|5|this honestly makes my car (2012 camry se) look so much meaner. Easy to put on and when i was adjusting it it seemed easy enough to pull off. I dont know how long it will hold up in a car wash though. also make sure your car is clean before applying because it will not stick as well.<br /><br />overall great product id recommend it to a friend.
B00IY3YLCI|4|These things are bright.  For the price they are outstanding for the front of my pontoon boat.  One of them won't tighten down all the way but it works just fine as is.
B004UGAEKQ|5|This worked great right out of the package.  The price was awesome, and it was OEM.  It was shipped very quickly.  Why I would have paid over $50 for the same thing through a dealership is beyond me!
B000CN5QG8|4|Takes just a few moments to cut and instal
B00466ROGC|1|If you need instructions you probably shouldn't be installing these, it's 2 wires and putting new grips on. The throttle tube can be removed and replaced by your current one if you have a return cable (I don't). Glue is just going to get soft and make them spin around, I put grips on dry and I've never had a problem.<br /><br />Mine came with little coils of wiring sticking out of the right grip that made it annoying to hold onto (I was afraid of electrocution at first but then I realized it was only 12 volts) without gloves on, and after about 2 months of daily use the right grip failed completely. The left one still gets warm but the right doesn't.<br /><br />I briefly considered ordering another set as a replacement but I'm just going to spend the money on something better, what I should have done to begin with.
B00A93RSUI|5|Definitely looks nice, and durable. brushed aluminum with black leather. can't say much else really, its a nice key chain.
B000VBAAMG|5|Weather Tech makes the best fitting, durable and high quality mats on the market. The thicker all season mats are too thick and do fit along the side of the floor like these do. Cleaning is as simple as removing, sweeping off dirt and then cleaning with soap and water, letting them air dry and re-install. I have weather tech mats on my Jeep Cherokee also an intend to buy for any future vehicle I will have.
B000ALG0KS|5|very happy with the strong arms the were a cinch to install now the rear lift gate is like brand new again cant beat the great price many thanks
B0007N5758|5|This brush is great to clean up your hands and fingers. The finger brush is not that tough on your finger nail unless you really push it hard under the nail.
B002M3FZNA|5|Rugged construction, accurate, good quality good price. Works well checking the inner tire pressure on my dually. I would recommend this to a friend.
B0085LTTC6|2|Very small. Cant even see! Part of the sticker was scratched off. I AM NOT HAPPY. not worth the money.
B005FI5J5I|3|I've had this for about 8 weeks and the studs are already falling off, especially after the drive-thru car wash.  Not as sparkly as other's I've seen driving around.  You get what you pay for.
B007V2C2QK|5|Everything I expected, really keeps the heat out and protects my leather interior.  Loved it so much I bought another for my husbands car.
B000VKPS7Y|5|Good price!
B0000AZ759|5|I'm disabled, and this handle is perfect installed at my front door as a grip to help me lift my weaker leg over the threshold. I like the dark color, and the matte finish helps it blend into the woodwork. I've bought a second one for the back door. Well designed and constructed and sturdy.
B000GKD722|5|A lot of sealer for the money
B0013JDW3Y|3|There's nothing wrong with this bulb.  However, there isn't anything that great about it either.  My only other experience with yellow fogs is PIAA Ion Plasma Yellow.  Personally, I liked the PIAAs better.  Having said that, neither bulb were particularly good for breaking through the fog.  If I was driving in the fog and turned the Nokyas on, I couldn't see any better than before.  That's all the proof I need.
B00BT1H1ME|5|A must buy,saves you tons of money.
B001737OQW|4|I bought this to replace a Craftsman one that I had for years.  This one operates easily and the cord wraps around nicely.  The hidden hole for the inflator cord is a pain and I just threw away the cover which wasn't needed anyway and was always in the way,<br />  Only problem with this inflator  (which I found to be pretty accurate)  is that it is very slow.  It takes a long time to pump a car tire from 20 lbs  to 36 lbs.  My older one was much faster.  But this one is okay.
B005JIQJYE|3|The color matches perfect but the fit isn't that great.  It doesn't fit against the windshield like the instructions say it will and it doesn't wrap tight against the pillar so there's a visible gab all the way around just below the grab handle.  I know of at least one other guy with the same experience on the same setup, so it isn't just me.  I found it necessary to trim it some to get it to fit down into the corner of the windshield.<br /><br />Also, if you get this, be very careful when tightening the screw.  I noticed that my grab handle moved more than I wanted it to so I tried to tighten the screw up some more.  When I did it pulled through the pillar pod mold.  I ended up putting the factory bolt back in the handle and just used a small screw on either side of the pillar pod to secure it to the pillar.  This actually closed the gaps I spoke of above and with the screws painted to match they're hardly noticeable.  Plus the handle is still tight.  I actually think using a small screw on each side works better than using the one large bolt provided with the kit.<br /><br />On the bright side, it's very secure and works WAY better than the suction cup mount.
B00881EQ1C|4|The frame is slim, I say about 3/4&#34; thick. Install was pretty simple and offers decent protection.<br /><br />Only complaint about this frame is that there only 2 screw holes to mount it on the bumper. The bottom two are two stubs that secure the plate in place. But I don't like it loose like that so I drilled a hole to the side of it and secured it on all 4 corners.
B008Y9K0OU|5|We bought a used expedition and it was missing the knob. I found this and ordered it. arrived on time (early than expected). took it out of package and put it on and PERFECT! Price was good. I'm very happy!
B000E2AQQW|5|Great little cover for my filter...its keep alot of dirt out and does a  great job..
B000EVWDU0|5|Good product. Works as described.
B000C48XDA|5|This unit is so easy to fit. The hardest part is undoing the fixed pipe nut, but once that is undone everything is plain sailing from there. It's quiet strange driving my Jeep now, I can here the motor running!!!
B002ICSOTC|4|fast delivery<br />everything is ok<br />thank you
B006LJ9POQ|3|The mirror broke when struggling to place it in the frame because of slight difference in dimensions. Doesn't fit frame
B00RG9C79U|5|Nice
B008NE8J0I|5|Fits my 2012 Ford Explorer key fob like a champ. Ford Explorer key fob has cheap silver on it that flakes off, this makes the key fob just look better.
B001E3923S|4|These boots are amazing. The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 is because I'm going to have to break them in. Otherwise, true to size, incredibly sexy and made quite well.
B004E66D98|5|SAVES MY CUSTOMERS A LOT OF MONEY
B0049W0X5M|3|You need to remove some of the windshield fasteners to install the bag. Those push-pin fasteners might be a little &#34;fidley&#34; to remove. Be careful when doing so or have a few extra's laying around. The bag is well built, but as you might expect, storage space is very limited. It might be fine for a wallet, an energy bar, and a small multitool, but that 's it. The zipper is hefty but a bit stiff.
B007Q92GT6|5|Works Great for all the dvd's I recorded.
B00MC72Q1K|3|These are not any brighter then the incandescent 1157's they replace.
B008BYPZT8|5|this belt lasts longer than factory belts. wont use anything else
B003SZKOBO|5|Installed in 2003 Trailblazer EXT. Went in with two screws. Comes with lights so all you need to do is plug in the harness.
B00HDKFQS6|5|Excellent product, the only drawback is that I lost 0.1 volt over the lenght of the cable.
B003TTRORQ|2|I think regular car soap works just as good, plus it's cheaper and doesn't require shipping.
B0089O7SZ4|5|Works very well. Is a great ash tray for pipe smokers.
B001Y91MFI|4|I was very impressed with the product and  the shipping was awesome as well.
B001E50AN2|5|I would recommend this product to anybody.  Teenagers will love it. It is an excellent product.Thanks! Very neat looking in car.
B001U2D6OO|5|its good and bright it was easy to put up. working very good its lights around 20 ft. by 30 ft.
B0014BBOWC|5|These pads were delivered ahead of schedule and fit great. It was nice that they came with the new clips.
B003M2EP36|4|Good product.
B00UK5FCO4|3|Lights look great easy on the eyes at night. Very easy to install, had a little trouble finding power, but well worth the effort.
B003XZQQZM|3|Pros: Results are not too bad for small (0-2&#34;) repairs with time and some skill, as long as you don't set expectations too high<br />Cons: Needed to deviate from instructions for good results, repair mix did not work well as patch glue, blue dye was seedy<br /><br />  This is my 2nd purchase of a leather repair kit, 1st time (May 2011) I bought the $24.95 Leather Magic kit. I was reasonably satisfied the first time when I used the Leather Magic kit to repair a small 1/2&#34; puncture in my dark blue couch so I decided to try the more expensive LeatherNu kit when a large dog chewed (and swallowed!) a 1.25&#34; x 0.5&#34; strip out of the couch.<br />  Let me say that the size and type of repair makes a huge difference in how noticeable the results is. Skill level (and patience) are also needed to get good results, in my case I have had some amateur experience with drywall and auto paint repair but have only patched leather twice. You should also know that in my limited experience at their best these kits typically leave a repaired surface that is a little blemished and uneven, similar to human skin scar tissue.<br />  After reading the instructions I used the supplied backing fabric to bridge the gap left by the removal of a 1.25&#34; by 0.5&#34; strip.<br />this did not work that well because when saturated with the leather repair compound, the light weight backing fabric resembled a wet noodle, very difficult to glue to the backside of the leather and impossible to get completely flat. The muslin like fabric I got with the Leather Magic kit worked better. Neither kit had very much fabric, only about a 2&#34; square. Kind of cheap in my mind, good thing you can buy this elsewhere.<br />  At this point I attempted to level the hole with the leather repair mix but due to the wrinkles in the backing fabric, this did not work. I re-read the Leather Magic instructions that referred to cutting out a leather patch and gluing it to the fabric, which made sense to me so I tried this but the leather repair mix would not hold so I used some 3M type 90 spray adhesive which worked well.<br />  At this point I deviated a bit from the instructions again by premixing about one teaspoons of leather repair+ about 1 teaspoon of  blue & black &#34;dye&#34; in a shallow plastic jar that I had from the Leather Magic kit. It was not clear from the instructions whether the repair mix was different in nature from the &#34;dye&#34;, I suspect that they are the same except for color, but who knows....I had a lot of the trouble mixing the color because the blue &#34;dye&#34; had dried out a bit so it was a little &#34;seedy&#34; and hard to mix uniformly with the black & the repair mix.<br /> The next steps were simple but time consuming, I applied the colored repair mix wherever needed to fill the holes and cracks and &#34;level&#34; the surface and let it dry completely. I did this several (6?) times.  When it was leveled, I sanded the surface very lightly with very very fine (800??) sandpaper and applied the colored repair mix again. Finally I applied the repair mix and tried the grain paper, which sort of works, make sure that pressure is applied while the repair mix dries.<br />  The results of all this error are not too noticeable for such a large repair. It helps that the couch color is very dark. I do think that the instructions could have been much, much better. Instead of a slip of paper that is 14&#34; x 3.25&#34; printed on both sides that needs major rewriting to get decent results, LeatherNu should:<br /><br />1) Use a regular sized 8.5x11&#34; paper for instructions with pictures and standard sized type, double spaced.<br />2) Vet their instructions by giving their instructions to real consumers and asking them to use the product on several types of repairs..<br />3) Provide more and better backing fabric.<br />4) Date code their product and manage so that their product does not dry out before it gets sold.I tried this but the leather repair mix would not hold so I used some 3M type 90 spray adhesive which worked well.<br />  At this point I deviated a bit from the instructions again by premixing about one teaspoons of leather repair+ about 1 teaspoon of  blue & black &#34;dye&#34; in a shallow plastic jar that I had from the Leather Magic kit. It was not clear from the instructions whether the repair mix was different in nature from the &#34;dye&#34;, I suspect that they are the same except for color, but who knows....I had a lot of the trouble mixing the color because the blue &#34;dye&#34; had dried out a bit so it was a little &#34;seedy&#34; and hard to mix uniformly with the black & the repair mix.<br /> The next steps were simple but time consuming, I applied the colored repair mix wherever needed to fill the holes and cracks and &#34;level&#34; the surface and let it dry completely. I did this several (6?) times.  When it was leveled, I sanded the surface very lightly with very very fine (800??) sandpaper and applied the colored repair mix again.

B007OWN004|5|Worked well at a great price
B000IY6RVY|5|Fit like stock. Easy install
B00EBV5S4W|4|Easy kit to install. They look great. Only problem i had, it came with one resistor for the harness and not 2 to plug into the other side now i have to stare at a lamp out light.
B00BD4YFO4|5|Great look!
B002BFR4RY|5|Very happy with this purchase. I thought the plate was going to be the plastic material that I got from another online order but was pleased to see that it was the metal material like real plates.  It will last for a lifetime.  Very happy about that!
B00P2D3W1Y|5|great, great, great inversion for my trunk!
B005C43YHU|2|Not great. Bondo makes a better product and contains a lot more in the bottle.
B000BN3A4Y|5|Don't get in your car without one,
B003WGPIIS|5|Simple to replace, a perfect match, works as advertised!  Actually, an improvement on the original, as the 'Auto' on the Drivers window switch lights up, unlike Toyota original!
