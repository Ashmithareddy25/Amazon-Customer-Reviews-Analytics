B001FB4W0C|5.0|Supernatural is the best tv series airing on televison, now and ever. The comedy of this season is unbeatable and the cast gets ridiculously better looking as time goes on!! The season oozes sex appeal and grasps you from minute 1. All I have to say is Monster Movie & Yellow Fever!! ;) You'll be watching Eye of the Tiger over & over & over again, I couldn't get enough!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was disappointed by this book.  Ana the main character was depressing to me.  First she has never been in love or had sex, fine I'll believe that because I'm 22 and a virgin; but to just lose it to a guy after only knowing him what five days and then falling in love with him in a 3 week \\"relationship\\" if you can call it that.<br /><br />Plus words are constantly used again and again, please find a thesaurus.<br /><br />Just for those who choose to read my review/opinion I will let you know that it was easy and quick to read which I like.  And a lot of people really enjoyed reading it but I was just not one of them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a simple perfect solitaire app. I play all the time and have never had an issue with it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is fresh to me and a change of experience compared to other apps. anybody who likes a good action game will enjoy this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was THE BEST book I have read all year. And I read a lot! this story was 10 times better than the stuff I read from \\"famous\\" authors. I will definitely check out more titles from this author.
B007P3TMW2|3.0|It wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be.<br /><br />The ending was a surprise. Was another surprise too.<br /><br />The boy did a very nice job in his first acting appearance.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|When the description said this would sync my contacts, I assumed that meant I could see my contacts like I do on the desktop client.  Perhaps I'm mistaken, but all you can do is search for a contact while composing a message.  You can't see what the address is until you select that person, and none of the other information about them is available to see.<br /><br />I'd really like to find something that would let me sync my contacts with Hotmail so I could have them when I don't have Wifi.  Sometimes I need a street address or a phone number and don't want to fumble with my small, slow phone.<br /><br />The mail part is OK.  Nothing special.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The whole trilogy was perfect in its delivery.  The last part of the third book had a \\"Sixth Sense\\" effect for me.  It made re-reading the books even more thrilling and haunting for me, but it left me wanting to know more about what Christian was thinking/feeling during the entire trilogy.  Where is a real \\"Christian\\"?  Is there a living, breathing man that would even compare to this fictional dream?  I am not looking forward to the theatrical release.  I really don't think there are actors that could do justice to Ana and Christian.  I hope I'm wrong!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|i have this app free on my droid 2 so i cheaked if i could get it on my kindle fire too but 2.99 no way.<br />besides it only has 2 lvls for this high price. But i love the game alot i go back to try to bet my high score all the time. I also think the grvitational pull is cool i love the path to show where your dird will go but its not easy trust me.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first book was the best book I've ever read because it messed with my head so much, in a wonderful way! The second book was the perfect story to read after the first.  Just like the perfect dessert following the best meal I've ever tasted.  The only problem is I enjoyed it so much that I want more and there is nothing as satisfying.  I find myself looking at all of the men around me wondering \\"Is there even a Christian out there or will he always only exist in this trilogy?\\". Real men don't wear skinny jeans.  Real men are strong and protective.  Real men want to lead, not be led...will REFUSE to be led.  Real men still show the women they wanted so desperately in the beginning of the relationship that they still want them desperately after being in the relationship for an extended time.  WHERE ARE THE REAL MEN?  Where is Christian?
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is truly awesome and could easily be sold at a price. I would recommend this app to anyone.
0345803485|5.0|Have you ever felt something so outrageous? I mean so completely, totally and utterly not in your sphere of understanding yet it resonates with you so deeply, so profoundly, that you have no choice but to let it in? Embrace it? Well that is what this book has done to me. I could not put this book down. I read it in just shy of 24 hours. From the beginning and especially to the end I was captivated. This story, the people in this story, are so well written so real and completely jacked up. You have no choice but to care about them. Cry and weep with them. Hope beyond hope that some way some how things will work out.<br /><br />Christian Grey- Dude scares the ever lovin crap out of me! But guess what, I totally love him. I want to know now more than ever what his deal really is. What makes him tick and why. I found myself often times forgetting he is suppose to be this 27 year old self made billionaire. In so many ways, his attitude, his stride, his old wounded soul, makes you envision someone much older but still very, very hot.<br /><br />And Ana? I love her. You feel at every turn where she is coming from. Very realistic. From her life before Christian to her life during Christian. Very much a heartwrenching and often times hilarious POV you get from her. (I loved all the email conversations) *snickers*<br /><br />I love how this story flows. There is so much in this story. Alot of set up but you dont get the feeling as if its taking too long to get going. I can't believe its only 26 chapters long, but you dont get the feeling that it's rushed nor that it's dragged out either. But you get a well balanced, complete, very engaging set up for this trilogy.<br /><br />This is a very sexy, erotic, decadent, dark read. But with heart & soul. And I think this is what balances it out. The heart, the soul is what make the hard, uncomfortable scenes bearable. For those of you who feel you may be on the fence reading this, it definitely is not for the faint of heart. But every thing is still in my opinion, tastefully done. There are books in this genre/subject matter that just completely turned me off to what was written on the page. Made me sick to my stomach at times even, but this book did not do that.<br /><br />It pushes you alot. In so many ways in so many directions. Especially me, but yet I could not walk away.. With that said, I can't wait to read the 2nd installment in this trilogy. I pray it continues to get better.<br /><br />I recommend this read.y thing is still in my opinion, tastefully done.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|great action sequences, great acting, a great story, a great arc - definitely violent and this may turn some people off, but anyone giving this less than 4 stars is probably clinically insane.
0345803485|2.0|I've only started reading last night and made it to chapter 4 before I couldn't take the repetition any longer. I paid for it, so I'm going to finish it - but next time I'll read the reviews before I buy into the hype. I find it extremely annoying so far how the characters constantly say each other's names at the end of every sentence. No one speaks like that, and I KNOW who the characters are at this point. I don't need the little reminders, thank you very much! Maybe it's just me, but there are some very poorly written sentences and it sounds as if it were almost written for/by a teenager. Again, only on chapter 4 - but hoping it gets better.
B005H5H3LW|3.0|The movie was not too bad it seems alot of the story was left out to shorten production, maybe to save money. Acting seemed to be okay. Special effects were okay.<br />The anime is much better but for a subsitute until I can get my hands on the new anime series this was okay.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|if you like time management games you will enjoy this. easy to play and easy to earn money. food choices are good also.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Such a disappointment with so many good actors involved.  Slow moving, confusing and - when you're done - just a huge let down.  Don't waste your time.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|This is pretty handy! I use it on my Kindle Fire, so it cannot automatically locate me - but it's easy enough to just enter a city name or zip code (once you remember Kindle doesn't do that and stop trying and re-trying! :D). For some things I would still use Yelp first, but this has tons of good info.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 5 yr old loves this game.  i love that she can play it and i dont have to worry about content .
B007V2UGPE|4.0|lots of fun. graphix good .  enjoy it alot. good interactivity with the allies and different powers u can get.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Definitely a must buy. It's a pretty different movie from most and I enjoyed it a lot in the theater that I had to buy.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I liked this book.  It definitely had elements that reminded me of Fifty Shades of Grey such as the very controlling leading man having found wealth & success after enduring childhood abuse.  Another similarity being his adolescent attachment to Eva.  You know, the \\"I'd just die without you\\" kind.  I found that I didn't want to put this book down either and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series, Deeper In You.  I like Eva & I want to know who it was that abused Gideon.  I also find myself intersted in Cary and pulling for him & Trey to make it.  If you loved Fifty Shades, then you'll love this book, too.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a consumer I am furious that this book ever made it to publication .  I am furious that it has received so much hype from reputable shows like The Today Show as well as my local news and radio.  It was because of the hype that I choose to give it a shot, even though I am not a fan of romance novels. I was unable to read more than 5% of this book due to the complete lack of editing, flagrant disregard for grammar and unimaginative writing.<br /><br />Seriously, there was a sentence fragment in the first 1% of the book.  How does something like that get missed?  Also, the writer has a penchant for describing things in this format....\\"adjective, adjective and adjective.\\"  Really????  Is there no other way to structure a sentence for descriptive purposes?<br /><br />What makes me really sad is the fact that so many women have gone on record saying they couldn't put this book down.  I'm not so high brow that I cannot enjoy simple fiction.  Hey,I am a HUGE Twilight fan; but, things like editing and grammar count.  They count a lot.  This book places an dark mark on the publishing industry.  I'm sure a great many people in this industry have turned down books that were much more well written simply because they were not up to standard.  My heart goes out to those who have been turned down for such reasons because when you see a piece of trash like this take off, it has to feel like a slap in the face.<br /><br />Please save you money and read one of the other erotic books recommended by other reviewers.  I fully intend to send Amazon a private complaint regarding the sale of such a sub standard product.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app any rabio broadcast on inter.et can be listen by this app . Ui is easy to understand and navavate its the only radio app I use!!
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|A few weeks ago I watched the trailer to this movie and thought... \\"Gezz another movie where the girl is beating up the guys? What a load of BS\\". So I passed it by. I didn't realize it was Gina Carano. People who don't know of Gina? She is a real fighter not an actor. She really can beat the crap out of most guys. So I watched the movie. It seemed to have some problems of direction. But, I loved watching Gina move what an extraordinary athlete is Gina. She needed some more direction. Hey Gina maybe you should learn to raise your eyebrow like Dwayne Johnson. You know... when someone says something stupid, you raise your eyebrow just before you smack the crap out of them.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Tom Cruise appeared sedated, not his hot shot self.  The plot was intense and well written, but the drama about his wife could have been more transperant.  Instead, a snap shot in the end revealed the emotional intensity between the two and I was disappointed that their relationship was left aside.  Maybe the better for the rest of the MI fans.  Overall, good film, good gimmicks, cheap humor and side effects to boot.  I rate the first three better than MI4.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Decent app, would be better if there was an option to turn off the animation for the end of the game.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I use Amazon almost daily! I love it! I rarely have any problems. I would and have recommended this app along with Amazon many times.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|when I first got this app I thought it was great. all in all it is however some pictures I can not open.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Doesn't use wick, so it's good on the road. Many simple, easy to play games. Would recommend this, definately try it out :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a great game. fun fast paced. full of mini games. for those of you having trouble exiting the game, just go into the setting in the in game options and there is an exit take option
0553381695|4.0|This is the second book in the Song of Ice and Fire series (after A Game of Thrones and before A Storm of Swords, A Feast for Crows, A Dance with Dragons, The Winds of Winter (forthcoming) and A Dream of Spring (forthcoming)).<br /><br />After the events of A Game of Thrones, the Seven Kingdoms are divided. Chaos reigns as several protagonists claim their right to the Iron Throne, refusing to bow to the young and capricious King Joffrey: Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly, Ned Stark's eldest son Robb, even Cersei's father Tywin Lannister.<br /><br />While all armies move to conquer castles and loyalties, Catelyn tries to parley with Renly to join forces with Robb, Sansa, betrothed to Joffrey, is stuck in Casterly Rock with Queen Cersei, and Arya is fleeing with Yoren and a bunch of cutthroats bound for the Wall. As for Bran and Rickon, they're left to fend for themselves in Winterfell.<br /><br />In the North, Jon Snow leaves for the Frostfangs beyond the Wall, scouting for clues of what happened to his uncle Benjen Stark and information about the mysterious and ghastly Others.<br /><br />In the East, Daenerys Targaryen, with Jorah Mormont and her Dothraki, tries to come closer to the Narrow Sea, looking for ships to cross back to Westeros with her newborn dragons.<br /><br />Again, I found that the fact that each and every character is named and described more confusing than worthwhile, distracting me from the plot, and making for a laborious reading. However, thanks to striking characters such as Tyrion the Imp, Bran or Arya, the intrigue is still very engrossing, even though it took me months to finish this heavy, small-font volume.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I heard from everyone how amazing this book was, so I bought it for my Kendel.  I am almost tempted to ask Amazon for my money back...this is the worst book I have read in a long time.  I don't really know what the fuss is about, the erotica is remenicent of a bad romance novel and there is absolutely no plot.  The characters are stereotypes and flat.  The whimpering virgin act gets really old quickly, and the domineering macho man gets old even faster.  There is MUCH better erotic literature out there, with a plot and everything, that doesn't seem like it's written by a horny teenager that failed english class.
B005EJNAK4|5.0|this movie is awesome! life like tht culd b good. no1 culd b hurt only ther machines. unless of course ther was tht weapon
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I loved everything about this movie. Considering this is probably the 10th time I've seen this movie since I was 9 years old (13 years ago) it never gets old for me. I had it on DVD but upgraded to blu-ray for $10. It looks amazing in HD and the sound will blow you away! This still beats any \\"global disaster\\" movie made after Armageddon's release like 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow.
B00005RG6B|5.0|I bought the original years ago when it came out but vhs was the format in them days?  I decided to go ahead and get the dvd.  The quality of the picture is not great but it'll do for know.

B007X15GRQ|5.0|What an excellent movie. I enjoyed every second of this film. Extremely happy with my decision to rent this engaging thrill-a-minute masterpiece.
B003ZSISGM|5.0|An amazing book! Like the first book, I hardly wanted to be separated from my book! I was reading it every chance I got. I can't wait to read the next one.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|\\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is a fictional World War II film. To date it is Quentin Tarantino's highest-grossing movie.<br /><br />The film narrative boldly shifts away from the norm of factually based WWII pictures and presents a story where the war could potentially end by aiming to assassinate the entire German High Command.<br /><br />The story is multilayered and represents several points of views. The cast is loaded with personalities who are absorbing and Christoph Waltz's portrayal of SD Colonel Hans Landa is marvelous. On one hand Landa appears gentle and compassionate and on the other he is cold, ferocious and without a glimmer of mercy.<br /><br />Some viewers might be unsettled by a few violent scenes but any true admirer of Tarantino's work will feel right at home.<br /><br />Shot in France and Germany the cinematography is fantastic and it is a unique movie loaded with great scenes.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B004MC8CA2|5.0|very feature rich and works as advertised.  love that you can download for offline reading at church. not much else to say.
0671027344|5.0|Perks of Being a Wallflower presents something incredibly special that most people, not just young people, can relate to. The book was a great friend and comfort to me.  Perks is my favorite book... because it was the last one that I read ;].
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not bad. tries to get you to spend money constantly but if you can keep from doing that you have a good game
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|After watching the trailler of the movies, I bought the trilogy and read the first book in a few days. The writing is very good and holds pretty much your attention. Now I'm in the middle of book two and it's getting even more interesting.
B0070Z4M4I|3.0|The orginal movie \\" The Thing \\" is a classic and I enjoy it at anytime.  Wasn't sure what to expect with the remake, and Hollywood didn't disappoint with this updated remake. The special effects and the monster, well, lets say that you will enjoy this remake.  I give it three stars.  Enjoy
B0059XTUVI|3.0|Meryl Streep stars as Margaret Thatcher.  If it weren't for her incredible portrayal of this woman, then this movie wouldn't have been worth seeing.  It's not bad.  It just is.  It seems the filmmakers had no idea what kind of movie they wanted to make about Margaret Thatcher.  The movie teeters all over the place from Thatcher as a young up and coming.  Thatcher roaming around her house at old age with senility and reminiscing about her previous self as a powerful Prime Minister.  Was the real Margaret Thatcher that fixated on her past and now finding herself approaching death and unable to remember anything for any length of time?  I wanted to like this movie, but it just wouldn't get to the point.  I couldn't handle the back and forth every ten minutes.  Back and forth to nothing.  Meryl Streep rocks in this.  That is the only saving grace.  She IS Margaret Thatcher.  She embodied every little bit of her.  I just wish the script gave her a substantial story to work off of.
0810979772|5.0|Both my son and daughter love this book and are also crazy over the entire Diary of a Wimpy Kid series! I'm so glad this book keeps them both busy and interested for more. Might want to check out [...] for more great books like this.

B007JWKLMO|3.0|This film stands as a testament to Harrison and his spiritual journey through life. There is no Narrator to bind the films various interviews together. As a result the film can sometimes be a little confusing. If you are a huge Harrison fan, you will have no problem following, but if you are not, it may be difficult to understand, particularly at the beginning of the film which is somewhat fragmented and lose in chronology. About 2/3 of this film is about George in the Beatles. At one point it seems more like a John Lennon Documentary. I was very disappointed with the films treatment of Georges solo material. Over half of his works are not even mentioned (some that contained hits such as the album \\"cloud 9\\") and the impression the film gives is that he gives music an effort immediately following the Beatles and then does nothing until the Traveling Wilburys. This is of course not the case, and the fact that a film on George fails miserably in documenting the music he made in the last 20 years of his life is a shame.<br /><br />Where the film gets it right is in his spiritual journey and capturing the essence of the man. The interviews are heart felt and a beautiful testament to the man behind the music.<br /><br />I would like to have seen more footage. in the Beatles years, I would like to have heard less of John and Paul's music and more of Georges. This is his documentary after all.<br /><br />To sum up my opinion, this movie is a mixed bag. I think a die hard fan will enjoy it, but it could have been better and more focused.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I have really enjoyed this movie. I watched it in the theaters when it came out and just had to have it at home.
1401207529|5.0|I've always been a huge batman fan,and my co-worker recommended I should read this particular title. After I read I could see why she recommended it to me. This company just made the experience getting it that much better. I recieved this comic book really quickly, and it was in excellent condition.
B0064NTZQ2|1.0|This movie is senselessly violent, and when it's not, it drives you into a coma. It is just awful. To be rated as one of the \\"best movies of 2012\\" means some paid hack rated it. Dont even waste your money at redbox, it just isnt worth it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love this app! !! i got it on my kindle and it is fantasticly wonderful GET THIS APP NOW
B0075HP2K4|5.0|The album is remarkable from start to finish - something rare these days. I love the lush arrangements and her gorgeous voice.  It feels like I won the lottery when I find an album I can get lost in and listen to over & over. This will be one of those. Hooray!
0345803485|5.0|This book is great - really liked book two.  Amazing story line not one I have ever read.Can't wait for the movie
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I read some of the reviews before I bought this app and was a little worried that it wasn't worth the money. Boy, was I wrong! This app works great! I have been using Google Calendar for a while now and my whole life is organized on it. I was looking for an app that would allow me to use it on my Kindle and I stumbled on this one. It does everything I could have hoped for and more! It syncs with my Google Calendar and I can still use the app when I'm not connected to WiFi. Once I connect to WiFi again it syncs up to my online calendar and stays up to date. I was even able to change how it was displayed on the screen! There are so many options and possibilities that this app allows. I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to stay easily organized!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addicting works well on my Kindle my husband and I compete for the best time we enjoy the app so far.

B0072NWKEC|5.0|Loved it - Kerr's books are informative as well as entertaining about a Hellish time in our history, and he has a fine tongue-in-cheek wit.
0345803485|1.0|This book is very poorly written.  If it were not for the subject matter I would think it was written for elementary school students.  The phrases are repetitive and boring.  Like a 5th grader learning how to write a first essay.  If this is supposed to be an \\"Erotic\\" book then I am never reading one again.  I can't say enough how terrible it is.  The author refers to the main characters \\"inner goddess\\" about every three pages and it doesn't get less cringe worthy once you get used to it.  Even the names of the characters are ridiculous in my opinion.  There is no plot line.  I have no idea how they are going to make this a movie.
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|While there was more action in this instalment, there was absolutely NO character developement and very little plot.<br /><br />It's okay if you are just looking to mindlessly entertained for two hours. But the movie did very little to add to the story. It was more like it was just a set-up for the next movie.<br /><br />Eve's character was very disappointing. They did not develope her character at all. She went from a scared child to a powerful monster in minutes. You learned nothing about her life or who she is. Nor was there any developement of Selene's character. While we all knew that both were going to survive, this movie does nothing to make you care whether they lived or not.<br /><br />This seemed very much like just another run of the mill sequel put out to make money off of the franchise. If this was the first movie that I had seen in the series, it would also be the last.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The best part about this movie is how a young attractive white woman helped black women with their oppression. What would they have done without her?
B001E45XT4|3.0|For the price its an OK headset. a little tight for me. was hoping I could wear this for about a couple of hours but I couldn't go for more than 30 minutes of gaming or watching a movie. sound quality isn't that great either. tried to play around with built-in PC equalizer but didn't help at all. The sound leaks as well. I mean someone 2-3 steps away can hear what you're listening to(that's on a medium volume)<br /><br />Though I like the design, the quality of the cord, remote volume/mic mute control and the ability to hide the mic when not in use.<br /><br />Get these only if you're on a tight budget.... Like I was :)<br />but if u got $50-60 to spend, get a Turtle Beach or something else
B007EC6FIS|5.0|I have been extremely excited for this album release; I have loved every album Keane has put out for its own sake, even the experimental EP Night Train from 2010. While each album has been wonderful, I've always felt that Hopes and Fears was Keane's definitive \\"best\\" album. I wondered how Strangeland would stack up.<br /><br />I am blown away by this album! I think it is up there with Hopes and Fears in its greatness--Tim's peppy piano melodies and chord progressions, Tom's incredible vocals, and the solid strength of Richard and Jesse in the rhythm section. This is a band that not only has great ideas musically, they execute them flawlessly.<br /><br />High points on the album include the fast-tempo and hopeful \\"On the Road\\" and the gentle, gorgeous \\"Sea Fog.\\" Particularly poignant is \\"The Starting Line,\\" with its gentle piano chords supporting a simple melody that perfectly showcases Tim's brilliant lyrics:<br /><br />\\"Drag your heart up to the starting line<br />Forget the ghosts that make you old before your time<br />It's too easy to get left behind<br />I know you've been kicked around<br />But tie up your thoughts and lay them down on me\\"<br /><br />To be honest, I can't find one song on this album that isn't strong in its own right--Keane has taken some sonic risks, including slightly different styles that would seem to some to be too different to be on the same album, but somehow flow together beautifully here. The opening to \\"In Your Own Time\\" has an almost pentatonic feel, and always puts me in mind of an Asian folk song before launching into a more typical pop sound.<br /><br />The overall theme of the album lyrically is of nostalgia, with a sense of hope for the future. Songs like \\"Sovereign Light Cafe\\" take us back to Keane's youthful adventures, while the title track \\"Strangeland\\" and \\"Disconnected\\" speak of love ended.<br /><br />To compare Strangeland to Keane's previous albums seems almost unfair--each album has been special and exciting in its ownway. To me, Strangeland seems like the album that Keane could only make at this point in their career--at a point where they are no longer starry-eyed young men looking to make it as rock stars, but rather married men (and some of them are even fathers now) who have found some stability in their lives between being in the public eye while maintaining their private lives, as well. The album has a deep maturity to it.<br /><br />Five stars. I adore it already.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|its a very fun game and a good way to pass time. easy to earn money and cheap to buy coins and nuts.

0545405777|4.0|Its a really good novel. the reading is easy the concept is something I have read or seen before but made fresh. even when you know what is going to happen you still get surprised and cant stop reading next chapter.<br /><br />I buy the collectors edition, I had already read the book and I believe its worthy the extra bucks, its a nice hard case. cant wait to buy the next books in the same edition.<br /><br /> the only defect I can see (or maybe it should be like that?) is that the pages are not evenly cut, so when the book is closed it appear as small u. maybe is so when opened it dont get damaged?  any way great book.
0345495004|3.0|I liked reading Loving Frank and trying to imagine these historical figures as they spoke and acted in their everyday lives and during the actual events that occurred.  I did not know much about Frank Lloyd Wright and had never heard of Mamah Cheney and, had these things not really happened, I would have thought the book's storyline to be unbelievable.<br /><br />While I have heard that Wright was charismatic, I had a difficult time trying to understand the attraction between Frank and Mamah.  Some people give creative types such as Wright a pass when they live selfishly and ignore family and friends.  The fact that Frank does just that is not a surprise.  I wondered, however, what was missing in Horan's storytelling that compelled Mamah to abandon her children and her comfortable life.  Mamah must have been passionate and driven to do so and to claim she needed to promote women's rights, but something was flat in way her character was portrayed.  I found her to be whiny, selfish and annoying, and lacking in any depth.  Who knows?  Maybe that's exactly what she was like, but reading about her wasn't enjoyable.<br /><br />I have seen some reviews that criticize the end of the book as too abrupt.  I thought the way Horan described the ending was well-done in that the actual events were very abrupt, violent and shocking, making the unbelievable ending somehow believable.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I'm a relative newcomer to the Epic Music genre. This one kept popping up in my searches for soundtracks, so I listened to it and bought it on a lark. It remains one of the best (if not THE BEST) Epic soundtracks you can purchase. The songs are catchy, haunting, and magnificent.

0307719774|5.0|After 80+ people have written various reviews, I cannot add any thing not already said.  Its a really great idea to see how you grow over a course of 5 years and I plan to buy them as gifts for friends.  Its fun to write in every day, as you get older you forget what happened 5 minutes ago, this a nice keepsake to pass on to my children.
B001E45XT4|5.0|These just came in today, Im a big gamer and spend alot of time in vent so the added mic feature is really nice I don't have to use my laptops built in mic that makes me sound all distorted and picks up a ton of ambient noise. Overall quality is great they seem very sturdy the mic is a bit delicate but shouldn't be a problem as long as you retract it everytime you put it away. Only downside for these is the cloth material that sits on your head and ears, after about 30 minutes my ears are getting pretty hot and the fabric padding on the top of the band kind of messes my hair up and makes. Obviously those aren't any major cons and I would recommend this item to anyone for the price of 20 dollars it a steal
0345803485|1.0|This book is total mind garbage. Women are suppose to love this? The way Mr. Grey speaks to Ana is just appalling. There are ways of being dominant without being so creepy and controlling. What a waste of money.

B007V2UGPE|4.0|its a fun game for what it is. I was expecting more of a tower defense game but I will end up playing this game for a bit
1451673442|5.0|This to me was a workbook in chapters.  There were exercises presented daily for 28 days in the chapters as you read them.  In completing these exercise you got to know yourself.  While doing these daily exercises your world around you started to change because you started to change by viewing the world differently.  The change is not in your circumstances but how you view them.  This I feel is a good book that will help an individual grow and bring Magic into their lives.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Let me start with a little background for my love of John Carter's Mars and the stories Edgar Rice Burroughs set on the planet.<br /><br />I first learned of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series from my high school math teacher. She and her husband, both of them science fiction fans, had been thrilled when Ballantine Books began releasing new paperback versions of the books. I'd read \\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" and \\"The Outlaw of Torn\\" already, so I wasn't a complete stranger to Burroughs' stories. I was intrigued by what my teacher told me about the Mars series and readily accepted when she offered to let me borrow \\"A Princess of Mars.\\" The following weekend, with nothing better to do, I opened the book and began reading.<br /><br />First published 100 years ago with the title \\"Under the Moons of Mars,\\" I'm absolutely positive Burroughs had teenage boys in mind when he wrote the book. First, the world is absolutely chock full of beautiful women. Beautiful, NAKED women. The stories are a mix of science fiction technology -- such as the wonderful flying ships all the human races of Mars use -- and the swashbuckling excitement of ringing steel as heroes and villains cross blades with the fate of a world or, equally as important, the fate of a lovely (naked!) woman hanging in the balance. Strange, alien races with strange, alien cultures aid and hinder John Carter, gentleman of Virginia, mighty warrior of Mars, and hero of the story. What more could a teenage boy ask for? I finished the book in one day.<br /><br />As luck would have it, I discovered on Monday that one of the few fellow science fiction fans in my high school had brought his two-in-one Science Fiction Book Club edition of the second and third books in the Mars series. He ended up loaning me the next six books, none of which took me more than a day to devour. That's not a particularly impressive feat as the books are fairly short, but I'd never felt so compelled by any series of books I'd read prior to these.<br /><br />Put simply, I love the John Carter books. Yes, they're formulaic and lacking in any kind of humor. But they're also exciting and imaginative and, along with \\"The Lords of the Rings,\\" which I read a few months later, the first books I really, seriously wanted to be true. So you can imagine what I felt when I heard Disney was finally going to bring John Carter to the big screen.<br /><br />Trepidation. Excitement. High hopes. Low expectations. Read on to learn what I felt after actually watching the movie.<br /><br />The movie opens on Mars, Barsoom as it is known to its native races, a place the book did not take readers for several chapters. In this case, the opening sets the conflict into which John Carter will be thrust when he arrives on the planet. The city of Zodanga is conquering the entire planet. For hundreds of years, only the mighty forces of Helium stood firm against Zodanga, keeping their power in check. But now the Jeddak (the king or ruler) of Zodanga has powerful allies; strange, bald men who control great power and place some of that power in the Zodangan Jeddak's hands. With this power -- and the advice of the lead bald guy -- Zodanga will be unstoppable.<br /><br />I suppose that could be considered a spoiler, but it all comes out in the first few minutes of the movie, so it's not much of a spoiler. There are actual spoilers in the next few paragraphs. Skip ahead to the \\"End spoilers\\" line if you don't want to read them.<br /><br />The movie follows the novel's storyline, at least in fairly broad strokes. John Carter heads out west looking for gold and stumbles across a strange cave from which he ends up being transported to Mars. He meets and is captured by the wild green Martian tribe, the Tharks. The princess Dejah Thoris is captured by the Tharks after her airship is attacked and destroyed. John Carter escapes with the princess and the young, female green Martian, Sola, who is one of the few among her race who feels compassion.<br /><br />As John Carter and Dejah Thoris begin to fall in love, our hero battles Warhoons, a different tribe of green Martians, before ending up in a place of honor in the city of Zodanga. There, Carter learns that Dejah Thoris has agreed to marry the Jeddak of Zodanga, hoping it will bring peace and allow her beloved city of Helium to survive. Determined to stop the wedding, John Carter escapes from Zodanga, journeys back to the Tharks, and enlists their aid in his cause. The Tharks attack Zodanga then move on to Helium, arriving just in time to help defend Helium against the forces of Zodanga. After defeating the Zodangans, John Carter and Dejah Thoris are married. Alas, their happiness is not eternal, as John Carter is returned to Earth where he spends his days trying to get back to Mars and the woman he loves.<br /><br />Within those broadly stroked events, there are significant differences in the details of the movie compared to the details of the novel.<br /><br />John Carter is a straight-forward man of action. That's what he was in the books and it's what he is in the movie. I think the movie John Carter starts out a bit more dim than the one in the books, but he gets smarter as the movie goes on. As did Boroughs in the books, the movie makes great use of Carter's amazing jumping abilities (Mars has one third the gravity of Earth). The movie John Carter turns out to have been married prior to the Civil War. During the war, his wife and child were killed; something which is used solely to draw out Carter's willingness to commit himself to Dejah Thoris and her cause. That bit was totally superfluous and something I think should have been left out.<br /><br />In a move that didn't surprise me one bit, Dejah Thoris is both a beautiful warrior woman and a brilliant woman of science. In fact, she's a Regent at the Helium Academy of Science or something like that. This is a particularly tiresome thing Hollywood has been doing lately. That's why the Fantastic Four had DOCTOR Susan Storm, the Avengers (the British spies, not the American superhero team) had DOCTOR Emma Peel, the X-Men had DOCTOR Jean Grey, and, I assume, if someone ever does a movie based on the TV series \\"I Love Lucy,\\" we will have DOCTOR Lucy Ricardo. It seems that it is no longer enough for a woman to be brave, intelligent, beautiful, and heroic; all of which describes the Dejah Thoris from the books. Now she must also be a brilliant scientist or lawyer or some such (no pressure, there, ladies). So, we get the brilliant Dejah Thoris, who John Carter calls \\"Professor\\" several times during the movie. Other than this bit, though, I think the movie did a good job of capturing Dejah Thoris, even if John Carter never once called her \\"incomparable.\\"<br /><br />But the truly major change from the book to the movie is in the source of the conflict between Zodanga and Helium. Burroughs pretty specifically spells out that all the races of Mars live for war. It's like a sport or a hobby to them. One nation is always fighting another nation and no one seems to really need a reason other than this love of war. In the movie, there is no mention of this aggressive side of Martian culture. Instead, it is the city of Zodanga that wages a war of conquest all across Mars, crushing every presumably peace-loving Martian nation in its path. It is this centuries-long war which draws in the great difference between book and movie.<br /><br />The great power wielded by the Jeddak of Zodanga has been given to him by a bunch of planet-hopping, shape-shifting bald guys. We never really learn exactly who these guys are, though they are referred to as \\"Holy Therns\\" at one point. Therns are the white race John Carter eventually discovers on Mars and they are bald, but the bald guys in the movie are not native to Mars. Still, I'm going to refer to them as \\"Therns\\" for simplicity.<br /><br />The Therns not only provide great power to the enemy of Helium, they also provide the method for John Carterto get from Earth to Mars. This is one change I rather approve of. In the book, there is an unexplained, mystical something which allows Carter to break free of his mortal body while, somehow, still having a mortal body. In this strange state, Carter can travel to Mars simply by willing himself to do so. It's really rather silly, when you get down to it. In the movie, Carter stumbles across one of the Therns' secret transfer points, gets hold of the alien technology used by the Therns to travel between worlds, and next thing you know he's on Mars.<br /><br />Once on Mars, the movie jumps -- usually on the strength of John Carter's legs -- from action scene to action scene. There is enough time taken between action scenes to explain more or less what's going on, but it's not like you really need any kind of deep explanation. John Carter originally just wants to go home and, being short a set of ruby slippers, needs \\"Professor\\" Dejah Thoris to figure out how to use the device which brought him to Mars in the first place. Along the way, the two begin to fall in love. With their growing love, Carter's goal changes from returning to Earth to stopping the marriage of the princess and the Jeddak of Zodanga. Dejah Thoris, of course, is only marrying the Jeddak to save Helium from being destroyed by Zodanga.<br /><br />The wedding, of course, turns out to be a ruse by the Zodangans. While all of Helium is distracted by the wedding, the Zodangan forces attack. John Carter arrives in the nick of time, followed by an army of green Martians led by Tars Tarkas, the Jeddak of the Tharks. We get a nice, big, movie-ending battle from which the primary Thern escapes when it becomes obvious the good guys are going to win. John Carter and Dejah Thoris are married but everyone does not quite live happily ever after because the head Thern sends John Carter back to Earth on his wedding night (though not until after John and Dejah get some off-camera time in the sleeping furs). Still, though, the movie is not quite over. John Carter dedicates his life to finding another Thern planet-hopping device so he can return to Mars. His scheme for getting one turns out to be rather clever, in my opinion. The movie ends with Carter triggering the device. Roll credits.<br /><br />End spoilers.<br /><br />At the beginning of this review, I professed my love for the series of novels. So, what did a Burroughs fan such as myself think of the movie? Like many epic-scale action movies, I can find many faults with the movie. It has plot holes. It has things I wish had been done differently. But I can say that about many other movies, including the original \\"Star Wars\\" and the most recent \\"Star Trek\\" movie. The faults in those movies didn't stop me from thoroughly enjoying them, just as the faults in John Carter don't stop me from thoroughly enjoying it.<br /><br />The action scenes in John Carter are well done and generally quite exciting. The characters are likable and the script brings a sense of humor to the story which had not a single humorous line within the pages of the original novel. I watched the movie with a friend who also has a love for the Mars series. He found the movie quite as enjoyable as I did. My teenage son, who only knows about John Carter because I've told him about the series, liked the movie, as well. More importantly, at the end of the movie, there was actual applause from the audience. I wouldn't need all ten of my fingers to count the number of times I've heard actual applause after a movie ended. It's worth noting, most of those movies had \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" in their titles.<br /><br />John Carter has its blemishes, including the poorly selected title (I think \\"A Princess of Mars\\" would have been a far superior title, as would the novel's original title, \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\"), but the sheer sense of fun I felt watching the movie more than made up for those blemishes. I wish the movie was bringing in more money, because this Barsoom is a place I'd like to visit again
B005EGXNLS|3.0|I love Bernard Cornwell's novels, especially the Saxon series.  This instalment, however,reminds me of an actor reciting his lines without passion and sleepwalking through the play.  We spend half the book waiting for Alfred to die and I felt like I might finish the book before he did so.  I must confess, also, that the  characters have become so numerous and hard to remember that I found myself going back to prior pages in the book trying to reference who was what from where and when.<br /><br />If you are this many books into the series, you're pretty much obligated to read this one, but its the weakest one of the series thus far and is as forgettable as the characters that populate it.
0345803485|1.0|I read it because I wanted to know what the hype was all about, I ended up skimming the rest after the first two chapters.<br /><br />What a piece of garbage in and out!
0393345084|1.0|Krugman's Keynesian dogma showcased in this book prove that he is not an economist and the Nobel Committee should retract his award. Seriously. How can Krugman ignore the failed Japanese 20 year experience with \\"End this Depression Now\\" policies.<br /><br />Krugman fails to understand that the Federal Government in conjunction with the Federal Reserve/Fannie/Freddie engineered a real estate boom. Home mortgages practically became enshrined in the Bill of Rights. It is unusual that Krugman missed this crucial point because in a New York Times article, \\"Dubya's Double Dip\\" on August 2nd 2002, Krugman writes, \\"Alan Greenspan needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble.\\" How did that work out for you, Paul?<br /><br />Since Krugman has failed to diagnose the problem, his Keynesian spending solutions are flawed as well.<br /><br />As Murray Sabin notes, Krugman does not recognize\\" that the housing bubble bid up prices in virtually all sectors of the economy and the only way to return to sustainable prosperity is for all markets to clear.\\"<br /><br />As Robert Higgs said,...\\"(Krugman) believes that the state is both omniscient and omnipotent and simply by fiat can eliminate those pesky little problems caused by scarcity. Whether it is the discussion of medical care or the nation's financial system, Krugman believes that the state through edicts and the use of force can eliminate scarcity...\\"<br /><br />Krugman believes that all power should be centralized in Washington DC and from there the resources can be marshalled to \\"End this Depression Now\\". But the idea that one man at the Federal Reserve can correctly estimate the price of money and the proper supply of money is preposterous. The idea that 435 elected representatives and 15 Cabinets can centrally plan an economy with 330 million independent actors is preposterous. Someone buy Krugman a copy of Hayek's \\"Pretense of Knowledge\\" before he napalms what's left of Western Civilization.

0800141660|5.0|An Austen story well done in film near ceases to brighten my day.  I could also enjoy a day enjoying an afternoon listening to Alan Rickman reading poetry.  I really wish he would do an audio book, as his voice is divine to listen to.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought the first book was good so I dived right into Fifty Shades Darker and it all seemed like a wonderful blur. I couldn't put my Kindle down as Ana comes to terms with Christian and his Fifty Shades and Christian attempts to be a better man for Ana, meanwhile, fighting his own demons in the process. Internal struggle, inner turmoil, sexual anarchy and a truly beautiful love story..thats all I can say about this book. You'll get so engrossed in this you'll be hard pressed not to lose sleep and focus just going from one page to the other. If your in the market for a good read and a great author, this book and E L James definitely delivers! Buy this book..NOW!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|the. thing<br /> that annoyed me was that you didn't control the attacks and couldn't aim bow and arrow. but you had awesome allies
B007IXWL2C|5.0|E L James has done it again! I didn't think it possible but the final installment of the Fifty Shades trilogy made me almost depressed. I was so upset when my Kindle edged closer and closer to 100% I actually stopped reading the book for 3 days so I could prolong this wonderful serious coming to a close:(<br /><br />In this installment Christian and Ana are married and they spend their days and night engrossed in each other until some emotional twists and turns and dangerous encounters threaten there happiness and love. A HUGE emotional twist makes for some interesting turmoil between Christian and Ana and threatens there relationship in this book. There's betrayal by Christian, second-guessing by Ana as she struggles with her controlling domineering \\"Fifty Shades\\" and tries to adapt to his \\"lifestyle\\" and finds herself being drawn to it. While Christian tries to be a better man and husband he slowly fights his demons from the past to make a future with Ana.<br /><br />This book was a rollercoaster in every sense of the word, but the ending left me wanting more! Please write more of these books..3 just WASN'T ENOUGH!!
0345803485|5.0|I loved it. I don't know what all the fuss is about, with some wanting it banned from the library. It is just a book; someone used their imagination and wrote it. Real life is much more frightening to me. As for the kinky sex--again--it's a book. To me, the sex was secondary to the message of love in the book and the idea that love can heal deep wounds and change people's lives. I have all three of the books and have even given them as gifts. They stuck a chord with me. Pun intended.  :o)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and the two following. Not because of the sex and the S&M but the love story of Christian and Ana. This young girl turns this control freak structured stuffy CEO's life upside down and makes his \\"fifty shades of f*&*& up\\" into a journey of love, lust, excitement and intrigue. I absolutely couldn't put this book down and for all those who want to compare these books to others clearly only wanted to pick it apart for no good reason. Fantastic read, highly recommended and I can't wait until the movie comes out so I can read it again!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|When some of the discs were defective the seller immediately sent me a new boxed set and a prepaid return envelope for the first one.  I really appreciate the prompt action and willingness to trust me even before they got the damaged set back.  I'll be using them in the future.<br /><br />The \\"Criminal Minds\\" series is one of the best ever on TV.  I have other season's sets and intend to have the all.  The characters are each as interesting as the scripts and stories.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was introduced to this book because so many people I know we're reading it & it was on tv everywhere. Initially, I didn't think it was for me. But, I ordered it - read it in a day (couldn't stop) & liked it. I also read the second book & enjoyed it immensely. Some of the erotica is a little much, unbelievable, & over the edge but what kept me reading was the storyline. I wanted to find out why the characters were the way they were! Im reading quite mixed reviews on here but for me- I thoroughly enjoyed the book! Onto book three!
1603429999|3.0|This book contains a lot of information and good photos. I don't feel it's really for beginners however. I was disappointed that all the sweater and vest patterns are written for a baby size. You need a class in pattern design in order to follow her directions to make them for an adult. I'm not ready to write my own patterns. Her sections called \\"Any Size, Any Yarn\\" are not as simple as they sound. The patterns are a little dated for my taste (2 headbands?). I understand it's a workbook but why not make something cute in the process.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|I won't go into reviewing the product itself, in short it's great.  As most of the reviews below can tell you.  What I would like to review is the delivery mechanism.  The Amazon App store is NOT a good place to purchase this app!  They are over a month behind on updates for the same app on Google Play. Splashtop has already submitted the app to Amazon for 'review' (which is their policy) back on Apr 19th... and today is almost a month later and users still cannot use the app properly due to bugs which have been fixed but not released to amazon customers.<br /><br />I was forced to re-purchase this app on the Google market in order to get it working again.  Will never buy from a 3rd party market again for such a critical app.<br />Shame on Amazon for waiting this long to release the fix.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|daniel has shown that he can make them leap from harry to be an actor who can play many different parts. good luck daniel.
B00198X0VS|4.0|I liked the sequel better then the first MIB. The first had that ridiculous and boring bug guy that wasnt funny at all. MIB 2 is funnier and more entertaning. I love that they showed the dog more in the second MIB. I dont know why so many damned the movie other then the fact they feel an emotional tie to the first so any sequel wont have the right feel for them. Buy this movie. It's tons of fun.

0061122416|5.0|Book came in fairly quickly. I needed it soon for my English class, and I didn't have to worry about it coming in late. The book had no wear or torn pages. There was no writing or highlighting in the book, either. It was almost brand new. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|This movie was a real disappointment. There were so many terrific actors in it that it should have been better.  Unfortunately, the primary character, was not one of those actors. The plot was underdeveloped, the main character unlikeable, and it seemed to go on forever.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|first off ill start by saying that this game doesn't require actual cash to play like most &quot;free2play&quot; games. you can progress just fine with the default game options and units. the game utilizes a plinko-style minigame which is a very effective way to get special items without dishing out actual cash. the game is relentlessly addicting and fun I cant put it down. one of the best games on the market. the only bad part is the unrelenting difficulty and how you level up your skills based on that difficulty. it feels like you level up your skills too slow in comparison to the enemy difficulty, but this adds to the strategic element, allowing you to adapt and make smart decisions. An effective and enjoyable little game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its refreshing to play something different.  these games are fun and challenging. my kids enjoy them as much ss I do.
0393061310|4.0|Popular science books are the ones I am very fond of these days. How could I then miss reading this Pulitzer prize winning best seller on a controversial theme of human history. \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" is the main title of the book by UCLA Professor Jared Diamond. This book strangely has two different subtitles for the editions from US (The Fates of Human Societies) and UK (A short history of everybody for the last 13000 years). In hindsight, I feel that the subtitle associated with the UK edition suits the contents of this book much better. Jared Diamond is the author of other famous books - \\"The Third Chimpanzee\\" and \\"Collapse\\".<br /><br />This book is unique in the sense that it tries to disprove the racial theory behind the disparity in the development of different parts of the world. Yali, a local politician, in New Guinea asks the reason for the superiority of Europeans over the other people (especially New Guineans) in the world. This question was raised by him to Diamond in the 1970s. The whole book is structured in such a way as to answer this Yali's question. Diamond through his experience of research he had performed on New Guinea for 30 years attempts to answer Yali's question. As he answers, the reader is taken through a roller coaster of a ride of the entire world history over the past 13,000 years.<br /><br />The book primarily focuses on the onset of food production to explain this difference. Diamond explains why food production which first originated in the fertile crescent region spread quickly into entire Eurasia. He ponders on the ability to domesticate available wild animals and the suitability of crops available for farming in particular. Further, he brings out the advantages of farming over the primitive hunter gatherer lifestyle prevalent in other places of the world. He also argues how this head start in domestication of animals and farming allowed Europeans to improve on their resistance to germs and helped them in technological innovation. He also provides archaeological evidences to support his claims.<br /><br />The other primary factor considered by Diamond is the geographical stretch of the different landmasses of earth. While Eurasia is stretched in the east-west direction, Africa and the Americas are stretched in the north-south direction. Diamond through appropriate evidences describes how the east-west latitudinal stretch allowed Eurasia to spread farming and domestication much faster to far off places than the other continents. Thus availability of crops and animals which can be domesticated and the geographical stretch in east-west direction are supposedly primary reasons for the domination of Europe over the rest of the world. This made them resistant to germs originating from different animals compared to the other people.<br /><br />Some European people might want to contradict the facts as provided by Diamond regarding the holocaust they launched on the aborigines of Americas and Australia. But Diamond brings out such facts through evidences such as the battle of Cajamarca in South America when a little more than hundred Spanish invaders killed thousands of unarmed aborigines of Inca empire mercilessly. He also explains how apart from the superior weapons Spanish had, the smallpox germs they spread helped them eventually colonize the whole of Americas. Similar fate awaited the aborigine population in Australia. However, New Guineans were more advanced and could resist the colonists.<br /><br />This book is a wonderful exposition of facts which are often not taught in school books where explorers such as Columbus and Vasco da Gama are treated as demigods. The main conclusion of the book is that Europeans did not dominate the world because they were people of superior race. It so happened through evolution that their area was more suitable for food production and thereby contributing to their superior technology. Further, Europeans were able to land in the right place at right time and thereby, at this point in the history of world they are able to dominate the other continents. It is nothing to do with the whites being superior to blacks or any other race in the world, for that matter. Diamond puts all the prevalent racial theories in trial and exposes their pitfalls through out this extra ordinary book.<br /><br />Though this book is a bit repetitive in analyzing the same facts and insisting upon them from different perspectives, I was able to appreciate the evidences provided by Diamond to support his claims. I could not find much detail about the societies in the Indian subcontinent in this book, which disappointed me as I have always felt this region had a rich history. Also, Diamond seems to concern more about the area around New Guinea and tries to propagate the findings there to support his claims on other parts of the world. This may not be applicable for all his claims. These drawbacks aside, this book is a very good read for anyone who is interested in a scientific viewpoint of human evolution over the past 13,000 years. I strongly recommend this book for those who are interested in popular science and evolutionary aspects of the world history.hereby, at this point in the history of world they are able to dominate the other continents.

Also, I enjoyed the fact that 50 Shades could open himself to new feelings and compromise what he had always known to be real. That is what love is all about, after all.

6305609691|5.0|Apocalypse Now is one of my favorite war movies and is just as powerful now as it was at its release. This is not a typical war movie where a team of soldiers plows in to take out an enemy objective and achieves it despite challenging odds. Instead, it is much more psychological. It is about a lone assassin who is sent out to take out one of his own - an intelligent, well respected colonel who has tipped over into the edge of madness. And as Sheen heads up-river towards his goal, he encounters enough madness in the daily course of war to make him wonder just who is sane in this chaotic world.<br /><br />It seems that every single character here is played by a stellar actor, even the tiny parts. Harrison Ford is an aide. Laurence Fishburne managed to sneak on set when he was barely 14! Look at the things this character is doing in the movie - mowing down innocent women and children - and imagine a fourteen year old boy taking on that part. Interestingly, the film took so long to make - 3 years - that by the time it finished Laurence had actually aged in real life to finally be 17 years old, the age his character was supposed to be in the film. It's sad enough thinking of a 17 year old having to go through those things.<br /><br />The scenes parodied in other films such as Tropic Thunder originally had their power and glory here. The blast of napalm on the trees. The fleet of helicopters thundering towards a village while Ride of the Valkyries plays. Martin Sheen rising up out of the murky water, only his eyes showing at first. There are so many scenes and phrases here that are iconic, that are used and copied and referenced in numerous other books, TV shows, and movies. Watching this film is almost a requirement to understand the many other works which play off of it.<br /><br />Clearly this was made to be a men-only film. The only three women who show up are the three Playboy bunnies who are sent in to entertain the troops - and they barely have begun to dance before the stage is mobbed and they have to run for their lives. So the movie is strongly focused on men, the chaos they deal with in war, and how it affects their sense of self, right, and wrong.<br /><br />Definitely a must-watch movie.e the stage is mobbed and they have to run for their lives.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|Before editing this review I rated this headset at 5 stars.  However, I've lowered the rating because the right earphone conductor broke inside the cable running from the control box to the headset.  Of course it happened not long after the warranty expired, which isn't Turtle Beach's fault; what is their fault is that they don't offer any type of repair service outside of the warranty period.  In order to keep using this I had to open up the control unit, unsolder and cut off the bad section of cable, and resolder the tiny wires to the circuit board.  The strain relief is molded to the cable so it can't be reused, so I don't know how long this repair will last.<br /><br />If given the choice, I wouldn't buy this again.<br /><br />Here's the old review, just for reference:<br />============================================<br />Pros:<br />Separate bass boost volume control<br />Excellent sound quality<br />Separate volume controls for game audio and chat audio<br />Dedicated mute switch (with LED indictaor) for your own mic<br /><br />Cons:<br />Controls are EXTREMELY easy to bump<br />No windscreen on microphone<br />In order to not be too quiet the boom microphone has to be relatively close to your face-- hope you like to listen to neckbeards breathing!
B005PK1G76|4.0|This is a very good parent tray for the price.  I use this on my Britax B-Agile stroller and it does the job.  What I like is the stretchy pockets for drinks to accomodate different size containers.  What I wish it had was a cover over the main pocket to keep things dry and to prevent things from falling out when you fold the stroller up.  All in all I am happy with this purchase.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|This movie tells the story about the way a man growing into adulthood raises a horse from a baby pony to be trained to do all kinds of special things that the average horse could not as he finds out he is only doing all of this to have this fabulous dream which he worked so hard for to be lost when they need horses of all kinds for the war.  He expects it to be only for a while until the war is over, until all of those horses that lived were to be auctioned of at once.  As we come to the emotional end or climax and an old man wants his granddaughter to have the dream of her life, the old man bought the horse at the the auction but stopped only to hand over the horse for free back to the young man to one once again at not charge, for doing all of that good to help others in the war.  It is emotional and touching and would recommend it and am glad I own it.
B00729GQ0A|1.0|I was very excited to read The Forever Girl, as I had heard quite a bit about it, read some of its many reviews, and become aware of the controversy surrounding it. Like many others, I wanted to know what the big deal was.  I've never posted a review on Amazon or Goodreads, but as I read The Forever Girl, I felt compelled to add my perspective to the unusually large pool of reviews, which I have come to believe are largely dishonest and bloated with unearned generosity.  I have added a SPOILER ALERT in front of certain paragraphs, so READER BEWARE if you haven't read The Forever Girl.<br /><br />Let me begin by letting Mrs. Hamilton know what I found truly compelling about her novel. The character of the crazy old woman, whose radical Christian beliefs seemed to have driven her crazy, was written very well. She stayed true to her character throughout the story, with the nonsensical letters threatening Sophia and insisting she gift her house to God and quit being a heathen. This character brought something fresh to the story, and I really enjoyed her.<br /><br /> SPOILER: I quite enjoyed how we come to realize that the animals in the woods with Sophia were actually Charles. It wasn't just dumped on us flat out with some awkward story that doesn't really fit with the dialogue. A little mystery is great.<br /><br /> Like many others have pointed out, Hamilton's knowledge of the Wiccan belief system and practices is very well researched. She knows her herbs, rituals, and holidays very well! I commend her for this. Many writers skimp on the details, but with the use of knowledge in this story we come to realize just how important it is to Sophia and the progress she will make.<br /><br /> SPOILER: The scene when Sophia happens across the address she has read about was very well done. We finally see a little action! Thalia and Circe stir things up for us a bit and we get to see that the story is taking a turn. The dialogue is great, and Thalia's \\"friends\\" give us a look at some new kinds of characters we haven't seen before. This standoff leaves us wondering about what is going to happen next.<br /><br /> The creation of the Witch, or Spirit Elementals, was very unique. I love the story of how the universe created them, how people believed that their magic died with them, and how the Salem witch Trials was incorporated. It was all very believable. This was the most original part of the story. When we see Sophia beginning her research on her ancestor we have a suspicion that she is the one real witch that was prosecuted, but the mystery, and learning what is going on, is half the fun.<br /><br /> SPOILER: The scene that seems to have gotten quite a bit of negative attention is one that I most enjoy. This would be when Sophia's house was set on fire. The crazy old woman finally lets loose, fulfilling the wishes of the latest letter she taped to her door. I am sure we were all heaving a sigh of relief when she managed to get herself and Red out of the house unharmed. The bleeding eyes scene really jarred me. It was brutal, and I liked it. But the best part was how well the twist was done. When I learned that the woman had been possessed, and this was what had been causing her years of insanity, it fell together wonderfully and made you feel bad for the lady.  What everyone seems to be up in arms about is that Sophia did not press charges, but it makes perfect sense to me. Who would press charges on a little old lady who had no idea what she was doing? Wouldn't that just be cruel? Maybe that's just me.<br /><br /> SPOILER: The next thing I must compliment was yet another twist, (Hamilton seems to enjoy throwing these in) when Ivory tries to stab Charles. We realize the extent of Ivory's dismay but are completely blind to what is happening and why. While I enjoyed the new problem, I must admit I was quite frustrated that Sophia was not as interested in what happened, but I will get back to that. What I most enjoyed here was the memory scene. Where Sophia finally does realize what is going on. It is intense, and I loved reading about Ivory's story as she followed Elizabeth's spirit throughout the years.<br /><br /> SPOILER: Lastly, the mausoleum scene, I have mixed feelings about this. I liked how again we are introduced to the ritual that enabled Sophia to erase Ivory's memories. Only this time she was able to use this to help Charles and Adrian through the tunnels of this underground building. But, the ritual (Ignisvisum) is poorly explained. How is it that she can read through their minds without erasing their memories, like she did Ivory? But other than that, we are introduced to the true head of the family, and we get to see what it is really all about. We see who the people are that took Charles' parents and why they want Sophia so badly.<br /><br />Now that I've highlighted what I think makes this book decent, I'll now discuss what's wrong with the book and why I've given it one star. Beginning with the many counts of glaring plagiarism that miraculously no one else has pointed out.<br /><br />I can not attest to how many times any of The Forever Girl fans have read the Twilight novels, but I can tell you that I myself have read each book at least eight times. Sickening, I know. But I am a sucker for an amazing love story with true original qualities. And I am a stickler for detail.  So here we go:<br /><br /> After the first four chapters, we are finally introduced to the main male character we all come to know as Charles. And in chapter six we get our first taste of long awaited action. Within Chapters fix and six, we come to realize that Charles can shape shift and that a man known as a Cruor is after Sophia. A Cruor is a made up species that is really just a vampire with a fancy new name. So here we have our first Twilight parallel.  Not a big one mind you, but only just the beginning: shape shifters and vampires are the premise of the story. In chapter eight we are introduced to trackers. The very same kind of trackers that we find in the Twilight series. The \\"get a whiff of your scent or a read on your brain and I can find you anywhere\\" kind of trackers. Only, wait! Sophia doesn't have an aura, so she can't be tracked. This is eerily similar to the circumstance of no one being able to read into Bella's thoughts, and her not being able to be tracked for that reason. Next we learn that some cruor can influence the minds of other cruor, and human alike, by messing with their emotions. Just like Jasper, again from Twilight, can change the emotions and influence minds to help or to hurt those around him. To continue, in Chapter Nine we are told that the saliva of a cruor can heal small wounds. This can only remind us of the last book in the Twilight series, when Edward is frantically trying to seal Bella's puncture wounds with his tongue to keep his venom from seeping out: healing her wounds with his saliva.<br /><br /> Some more little things easy for the reader to miss would be that all of these creatures tend to drink animal blood instead of human blood. We are given a brief explanation for this, but still it is hard to ignore. The scene that had me pulling my hair out in frustration was the day after Sophia had been attacked, when Charles comes to meet her where she works, at a restaurant. This whole scene derives from Twilight. It was almost exact, down to certain lines. Charles lets Sophia ask him questions, as long as they are not questions that will get her into more trouble or give her too much information about himself. Then, here comes the waitress. We all remember this from the movie, even if you didn't read the book. She asks Charles if she can get him anything, completely ignoring Sophia, until Charles orders a drink and does not make eye contact with the waitress. The waitress is aggravated when she is forced to ask Sophia what she wants. She is obviously not happy that Sophia, not she, is sitting with this handsome guy. When she comes back to make to check on him, she asks if he is sure she can't get him anything else. The same words the waitress in Twilight uses. Beyond that we have the constant fluttering stomach, fast pulse, and blushing. Again, not a very big thing, but in Twilight this was a huge deal because Bella, like Sophia, had never been in a real relationship before. Next we have Charles wanting to stay distant from Sophia so that she cannot get involved in his world. And then later his words that are almost the exact same as Edward's when he claims he is compelled to protect her, that he does not want to keep resisting being around her. Then we have some more trivial moments that remind us of Twilight when Charles shows up at Sophia's window creeper-style, he makes fun of her out of date vehicle, and admits he has a hard time understanding her. All of these being some of Edward's favorite things to do.<br /><br />Now I will move on to the larger examples. Let's begin with Sophia's parallel to Bella. Bella's thoughts can not be read by any of the vampires that contain the power to do so, none of their special abilities can affect her, and she cannot be tracked. Much like Sophia has no aura, this makes her immune to the effects of the powers of those around her, and she also cannot be tracked. Also, we learn that these Cruor originally fed from the blood of the corrupt, which Edward confesses to Bella he used to do. Which bleeds into the fact that Charles shamefully admitted to Sophia that he used to do this; much like Edward told Bella he was guilty of the same. From here we move on to the fact that Thallia's queen wants to turn Sophia and use her for her abilities. Or for what her abilities could bring for their benefit. Sophia is a rare specimen, much like Bella, and she wants her for their own. And they are going about ways to make this happen, just like Marcus, the main vampire of the Volturi, who is much like their king, only opposite as he looks thousands of years old while the queen in The Forever Girl looks fifteen, tries his hardest to obtain Bella and have her turned so that her powers will peak and he can use them for his own reasons.<br /><br />We are told that the only way Charles' kind can age is if they are no longer shape shifting. Just like how the shape shifters in Twilight can not age until they also give up their shape shifting abilities. Then we have again a Bella/Sophia parallel. Sophia is in a constant battle to get Charles to give up shifting so he can age and be with her until they die, while Bella is in a constant battle that makes more sense. She wants Edward to turn her so that she will quit aging, and they can be together forever. Each is a constant battle between the couples, and each male has a reason to keep these things from happening. Now, in a scene where we get a glimpse of what Sophia is capable of, we see her powers take on the shape of a dome, if only for a few seconds at a time. This is not explained; it just seemed like it was tossed in. Bella, also has abilities by the last book of her saga. And guess what it takes shape of? A dome! A big freakin' dome.<br /><br /> I'm sure people will pick apart these instances and claim they aren't directly plagiarized from Twilight, and for the sake of argument I'll allow that maybe Hamilton did it subconsciously, accidentally, or that it's a complete coincidence.  Okay.  The Forever Girl still faces a major dilemma, in that too much of its story directly parallels the most famous book of its genre.  Deliberate or not, these similarities render The Forever Girl horribly unoriginal and derivative, and if this book ever hits bestseller status (real bestseller status, not Amazon Top 100 for a day) Hamilton is going to face some very, very angry Twilight fans.<br /><br /> But let's move on to the book's other problems.<br /> I will say that I was very put off before the end of the first chapter. I was mentally exhausted trying to read this story. I quite literally had to make myself keep turning the pages. Normally I wouldn't bother continuing, but due to the controversy surrounding the book, I wanted to push on. Nothing of consequence happened until the sixth chapter, and then again not until about fifty percent of the way through the book.<br /><br /> In the first chapter, we are loaded with what is called info dumping: a big pile of information that should be revealed delicately and naturally throughout the story but is instead slapped in our faces with awkward dialogue instead. This makes me think that Hamilton doesn't believe we have the capacity to figure things out as we go along, or that she just wanted to get it all out into the open without having to figure out the proper circumstances for such conversations to take place. We experience this again in chapters six and seven, complete with unbelievable dialogue, too many names for too many different kinds of characters, and little organization of thought.  I blame this on the info dumping. If we had been introduced to the different types of characters as the story went along, not all at once, they would have been easier to remember.<br /><br /> Along with the unbelievable dialogue come unbelievable circumstances. When Sophia see's strange, cloaked figures roaming down her road with glowing eyes and no real shape, it's not a big deal to her.  She ponders for a couple of minutes and then goes straight to sleep.  Seriously?  If that happened to me, I'd be locking my doors, calling people, and looking for a change of pants after peeing myself.  But Sophia not only goes to sleep, she doesn't even think about them again until several chapters later.  And speaking of crazy circumstances that make no sense, why does Sophia begin to freak out about all of the dead animals in the forest, and the two live ones with glowing green eyes, but when she sees her friend, she dismisses the carnage immediately, says nothing to her friend.<br /><br /> A few more things:<br /> Why did we get a bunch of information about Lauren before we met her, but almost no information about Ivory when we do meet her? It was confusing that we learned more about the character we hadn't met yet. But then here comes Ivory and they are supposed to be best friends. Why was there no information on how her mom came to be a part of the crazy lady's basement church? It is kind of a big deal when the main character's mom turns out to be loony, as she is a big part of her life. Wouldn't there be some back story? I will say, though, that I was enticed by the fact that this crazy mother was keeping Sophia's secret.  It kept me wondering why Sophia never told the police what really happened, why Sophia didn't believe she deserved the kindness of the shopkeeper's wife. Though I was confused as to why the shopkeeper's wife wasn't suspicious of her, while the rest of the town was.<br /><br /> To go ahead and get all these strangely made circumstances out of the way, I am going to skip around in the story a little bit. This is going to be a bit of a SPOILER. I want to know why Ivory had to kill the shopkeeper to keep Sophia from going to jail. All Sophia did was steal some food. If she had told the man what she was doing after she was caught, and even then if he decided to press charges she MIGHT have been in jail overnight. But that would most likely not have happened, since she wasn't even eighteen. Also, how did the mom know about the runaway? Sophia tells us that she did not want to take food from her own house because her mother would get angry. But when Sophia shows up with the food for the girl, her mom is already there, giving her food. So how did the mom know, and why would she give the girl the food? When Sophia acted as if her mom would never allow such a thing, this is all very confusing. At first Sophia says her mom is cruel, but later in the book when she is telling the story of the girl in further detail she says that it was her mother's kindness showing through her when shewanted to help the girl. This is very contradicting and jumbled. I don't even feel like my explanation made sense because I am so muddled just thinking about it.<br /><br />Something else I did not get was how Ivory could be so mad when Sophia finally told her about her problem, and she did not find this strange. They had been friends for years, and when Sophia comes out with this, she does not find it at all strange that instead of maybe being a bit skeptical, she was just downright pissed? And she didn't try to talk things out with her best friend, aside from calling her once. She just shrugged it off because it was more convenient to the story. This seems to be happening a lot.<br /><br />SPOILER: When Sophia stays with Lauren for an extended time, why is it that they will not go after her here in order to keep from exposing themselves, when they have already done so once, when they came across the address? Not only did they expose themselves, but they successfully wiped her memory with no problem. Why didn't they just do that again, and snatch up Sophia? If Sophia had just moved straight in with Charles it would have made more sense that they wouldn't come after her there. Sort of. But I feel that due to the fact that they had such amazing trackers, they would have been able to find Charles, and capture them both. The trackers make a huge hole in this story.<br /><br />Another circumstance of Sophia's annoying reluctance to not care about anything in a crazy nonsensical way would be when the woman starts to show up in the yard. This crazy chick shows up, glaring at her through windows, and at one point her face is pressed against the pane and her eyes are gushing blood; yet, Sophia says nothing to her boyfriend who happens to be supernatural and might be able to tell her what is going on. She just goes on about her business like this is no big deal. Like this figure stalking her might just be checking her out. Nothing menacing about that!<br /><br /> SPOILER: Let's take a tiny break from Sophia and talk about Ivory for a second. We witness Ivory's memories over quite a stretch of time; hundreds of years, even. All of this time, she is with a man she calls her sire; he is the man who turned her. Throughout her memories we recall a bit of annoyance towards this man. But he does not seem to boss her around, and when he asks things of her, she brushes him off and goes about her business, and he never seems to care. But all at once she decapitates this man she has been with for hundreds of years! She could have just left him, like she had done once before, but instead she takes the radical route and cuts his head off! And what is even stranger is that she has no emotions about this. No hate, no grief, no guilt, no nothing. This just does not seem logical.<br /><br /> Back to Sophia.  There is one point after she drinks Charles' blood that she asks him if the reason she is tapped into his emotions is because she is a forever girl. But this makes no sense as we have already learned that anyone who drinks a vampire's blood has heightened senses and the ability to see memories, and feel what they are feeling. Why was this even added in? Just to reiterate the fact that she is a forever girl? We already know this. Again, we as readers need to be trusted, to understand these things the first time they are stated. Also, what was with the dream she had about the dead sharks on the rocky beach, with the four girls in the forest? I understand that all the girls are her, but this scene looks like it was taken from The Craft. There is never even an explanation for this dream. We just see sharks on a rocky shore, for no reason.<br /><br /> Another issue I have is Red.  At one point Sophia thinks about her grandfather having a bird in his house and how she used to like the bird. She says that this is the reason she is drawn to Red. But it clearly states that what drew Sophia to the bird was his broken wing and how she could not stand to leavehim there to die. Also, what does not make sense is why he would not leave when his wing heals but for some reason flies off when he's in some strange land months later.<br /><br /> And here's one of my biggest concerns: why does Sophia NOT want to become immortal? Why does Charles never even bring this up? Why if you want to be with someone who has the capacity to live forever would you not just have yourself turned, also become immortal, and live that way? It makes so much more sense than saying you love someone but insist that they become mortal so that they can die with you. She wants him to live fifty or so more years as a mortal with her so they can die together, when no one would have to die should she take the other option? This sounds like a desperate attempt to not sound like a rip off of other books, when it has blatantly borrowed from another story so much already.<br /><br />Finally, what does not having an aura have to do with being reincarnated? I mean, yes the writer has the freedom to invent the rules of her fictional world. But it is never explained to us, what one has to do with the other. At first we hear that you have no aura if you are pure, but what makes her more pure than other people just like her? She is pure because she has been reincarnated? Is this just another inconsistency?<br /><br />Moving on to the final part of this review, I wish to talk about the grammatical and pacing concerns.  In the first few chapters, whenever a character is being introduced, we see their names repeated every other sentence. For example, \\"There was only one person I could go to without turning to the doctors who had failed me before: Great Grandpa Parsons, my great grandfather on my father's side.\\" Then the fourth sentence after that is, \\"The family called her schizophrenic but great grandfather Parsons insisted her affliction was more complicated.\\" And again three sentences after that, \\"Grandpa Parsons' old chest lay between two dust covered lamps near the window.\\" There is no reason to have his name that many times so close together. We were introduced to him, and the story had not yet strayed from him, so in those few sentences we would have known we were talking about her great grandpa still. It's repetitive and very aggravating to read. This goes along with a certain other word that we are introduced to later on in the story: Clairaudience. When this word is brought up for the first time, it is repeated throughout the entire chapter, over and over and over and over. Like we are going to lose sight of the fact that she is now aware of her clairaudience, and she thinks if the reader doesn't see it over and over again, it makes it less real and important. But again, it is just repetitive and aggravating to read.<br /><br /> The pacing in this book was overwhelmingly off centered. We went from following Sophia over a matter of days to skipping months of time. And since this is a story about being sought after, and chased, it would seem things should stay consistent and steady. The one instance I can remember that such a thing worked in this story was when she stayed with Lauren. There was not much there we needed to know about, therefore we moved on to the next part of the story. But all at once while she was living with Charles we skipped ahead months for no reason. They were talking about Charles fixing one of his problems, and then boom, we were taken months ahead and not even to some big event.<br /><br /> Next we have the constant back and forth of Sophia's thoughts. Should I be with Charles, should I not be with Charles? I can understand her restraint at the beginning of things but after they established that they were together, and she moved in with him, this sort of thing should have been much more subtle. It was such a big thing that it was downright irritating. It felt like every few paragraphs she was thinking about this. I feel like this sort of thing is supposed to make me wonder with Sophia what the best choice for her is, but I'm so tired of hearing her think about it, I just want her to shut up. Also, we do not need to know what she is wearing every single day. If the outfit she was choosing was important to what she was doing, like going on a big date, that is one thing. But the reader does not need to be aware of what she picks out every day, and what color the things she picks out are. It's disruptive to the story. And speaking of being disruptive, something else I could not ignore was the overwhelming number of analogies.  Not only were there way too many, but they were forced and unconvincing.  For example, the very first line: \\"An ever-present static had moved into my head like a squatter I couldn't evict.\\"  This is a terrible analogy.  You don't \\"evict\\" a \\"squatter.\\"  A squatter is someone who has illegally trespassed into a vacant building to escape the weather, sleep, do drugs, etc.  You evict tenants who don't pay their rent.  Squatters are typically transient, anyway, which contradicts the idea of being \\"ever-present.\\"<br /><br /> I'm sure this review sounds harsh and overly critical, and I'll admit that if it hadn't been for the plagiarism I probably wouldn't have bothered posting it, but I'm sorry to inform you, readers, The Forever Girl is a Twilight rip-off, thematically, structurally, and at times on a sentence-by-sentence basis.<br /><br /> Of course, the ultimate flaw in this book is its overall story arc.  There isn't one.  The first book in a series has to be able to stand alone as its own book, with a beginning, middle, and end.  It must have its own conflict that is resolved.  Nothing is resolved in The Forever Girl.  The major events in the end are tacked on.  Charles's parents are kidnapped.  Sophia develops her telekinesis to be of use and winds up barely using it. They're all locked up in cells. The Council suddenly decides Sophia will be the key to their taking over the world.  Then a deus ex machina saves the day in the form of Ophelia.  A silly chase sequence ensues.  Another deus ex machina, followed by some plot-hole-filling rationalization for why the saving event couldn't have occurred before the death of the parents, and we're done.<br /><br />As I post this, The Forever Girl has 255 five-star reviews.  You have to give the author credit for her marketing capabilities, her review-requesting, and her cherry-picking the right plot points from bestselling novels.  What you cannot give her credit for, sadly, is originality.  My problems with the story as a whole are simply a matter of opinion and others may disagree.  The plagiarism, on the other hand, may indeed be a legitimate legal concern.

0062119044|5.0|This book was all-consuming and took everything out of me. I was exhausted after reading it and as others have said, it leveled me. As I turned the last page, right before bed mind you, I wept. This was a work of fiction, but I wept for all of the families that have ever lost a kid to school violence and that includes the parents of the kids responsible for it! Eva had her issues but what a horrible position for a parent to be in. How can you love your child when he just committed such a horrible crime? Is it even possible?<br /><br />The story was brilliantly executed. It left me deflated and very sad, yet it's such an important book to read. Shriver has a way of pulling you in, and then pushing you away. As I was reading the book, I alternated between being angry and being sad. These characters will stay with you long after you finish the story.

B002EEP3NO|5.0|The old Batman lego sets came out. Grabbed them all for \\"toys r us\\" price. Now ill go on amazon and see my sets all well over 600$ and its a great feeling knowing you have sets worth tons of money and got them when they came out and dont have to settle for the watered down re-release (unless you pay the 80 dollars just to have bane). Same goes for Jabbas Sail Barge and other sets around that time (even the 2 first spongebob sets i got for mysel....i mean my uhh my ex are up to 250-300$). Though i am kicking myself in the a** for being cheap that one day and not getting the imperial star destroyer for the 120-140 asking price when its was out seeing how the sets 400 on amazon. I never saw the death star in the store so when i came on amazon and saw it for 400 dollars i figured it was the same price as the Star Destroyer and i messed up. So i go on TRU and Target.com and find the Death Star is also 400 on there, thats the original price?!?! went right back on amazon and the 3 clicks of awesomeness has me sitting here as i type waiting for UPS to prime that box i'd leave my girlfriend for. If sets that were 100-200 dollars in the stores are up to 500-600 bucks in only 4-5 years, i cant wait to see how much this is going to be by the end of this year seeing as how they discontinued the set in Jan. 2012 and whats left is left then KaAaAaApPLLLLLoOoOoWwWwWIIIIIIeEeE gone like Alderaan<br /><br />so i get it and get all the way up to bag(s) 3 on box one. tons of missing pieces. no \\"spring\\" looking pieces for trash compactor. no red and black antennas, no red flat 2 block with one hole on top. SO now what do i do? i just paid 400 dollars for something i cant even complete. this is really making me mad i want to smash what i already put together.<br /><br />Day 2. i called lego, they were very nice and helpful. there was a mini bag that comes inside of the big bags worth of missing pieces.Went on the web sight and put in my missing pieces order. i got down to the last missing piece and couldnt find it on the page. So, i called lego and was told that that piece is discontinued in black. i was put on hold and he researched some more and was able to find the piece (i needed 3) in dark stone gray, which will do just fine BUT how are you going to discontinue a peice on a set that is still being sold? so putting my death star together is on hold for now. Im just hoping when my parts come in theres no problem there.g piece and couldnt find it on the page.

076115728X|5.0|There is a bookstore in our area that my daughter and I always go in to... It is rare that we don't buy one book for her (and at least one for me)but last weekend, I promised myself that I would not buy her a book. I had seen a book for my sister in the window and that was going to be it. Well, my daughter went back to the kid's section and managed to find this book. It is a great, simple, colorful book with an awesome message. My daughter is very artistic and sometimes she gets upset if she \\"messes up\\" on her artwork. I thought the message that you could turn mistakes into beautiful things was great for her... How could I not buy the book???  She loves reading it and I hope that it will help her be less frustrated when she \\"messes up.\\"<br /><br />As we were leaving the store, I did warn her that at some point we would walk out of that store without a book for her... (Doubtful) :-)

B00783NWB6|1.0|Well this movie has absolutely no plot whatsoever.  You get a 3 minute recap of the previous movies (which is the best part of the movie).  From that point on its like watching a violent video game and you really aren't sure whats going on.  No plot, no character development, no story, just violent battle after battle...

B005723JSQ|4.0|Sophie Kinsella is one of my favorite chick lit authors, but not all of her novels are equally good. I'm happy to report this one is thoroughly enjoyable. Although we know from the beginning the characters will end up together, getting there is lots of fun. As in all of her best books, Kinsella creates a likable heroine you can really root for despite her flaws. As a businessperson myself I really enjoyed the business angle of this book and the email-related dramas. Two weak spots, for me: a plot line relating to her parents' deaths that was never fully resolved, and a couple of \\"love scenes\\" carried out via text message that, frankly, were just painful (or maybe I'm too old to find this anything but ridiculous).  Hey, Jane Austen's pivotal love scenes always fell short, too. I feel that my $12.99 was well spent.
B000JIJPZY|1.0|I purchased this the other day before reading reviews.  It looked cute and colorful.  It is very small, has very few toys and afer assembling it I discovered not only was the giraffe velcro piece coming detached but that particular piece doesn't come with a toy.  I am not crazy at the idea that the toys velcro instead of being stationary or having links to hold them in place.  I read another review on the site I purchased it from that a Mother's baby choked on the butterflies after removing them by grabbing ahold of them.  Her father discovered her choking child thankfully.  The tiger only plays 2 tunes and not nearly long enough. The only plus I would even consider giving this is the bright colors and easy assembly but simply not worth it!  I can see it becoming an easy bore for any baby.

145162445X|3.0|After seeing the video lecture on Youtube over a year ago, I was excited to find out that Professor Krauss would be releasing a book that, to my assumption, would elaborate on what was discussed in the lecture. It does this, but the majority of the book explains cosmology and quantum physics that is already widely written about by other scientists. It talks about the age, shape, size, and expansion of the universe, relativity, and other things even a casual science reader such as myself have already read and watched documentaries about. There are about three chapters in this book, starting with chapter 4, that have anything to do with the \\"universe from nothing,\\" and most of those discuss other topics more than the subject I was reading the book for. While there is some setup required to understand the \\"universe from nothing\\" parts, what is in the book should be obvious to a person who has read cosmology stuff before. A lot of the book is bragging of the author's achievements, and Richard Dawkins's afterword talks about the book as if it is some classic (along with the usual smug religion-bashing), which it is not. I recommend this book to a person who hasn't already read books and/or watched documentaries about the universe and I do not recommend it to someone who is already familiar with the common topics.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I loved Pandemonium but the love triangle was unnecessary.(spoilers)I liked the Now and Then segments.The Then segment talks about how Lena is adjusting to her life in the Wilds and dealing with the lost of Alex.my heart was sad when Blue died a couple of days after the Wilds was bombed and almost everybody died.The Now segments talks about Lena's mission to blend in with the DFA(Deliria Free America). It was predictable that Lena would fall for Julian.Honestly I didn't fall in love like I hoped I would with Julian's character I just felt sad about his cancer and his brother.However Julian did have his moments like on pg 300.<br />\\"What does it feel like?\\"<br />I know what he is talking about, but still I ask,\\"What does what feel like?\\"<br />\\" The DELIRIA.\\"He pauses.Then I hear him slide slowly out of bed. He is kneeling in the space between our bunks.I cannot move or breathe.If I turn, our lips will be six inches apart.Less\\"What does it feel like to be infected?\\"<br />\\"I-I can't describe it.\\"I force the words out.Can't breathe, can't breathe, can't breathe.His skin smells like smoke from a wood fire, like soap, like heaven.I imagine tasting his skin;I imagine biting his lips.<br />\\"I want to know.\\"His words are a whisper, barely audible.<br />\\"I want to know with you.\\"<br />Pandemonium does have some humor like when Julian told Lena when he was smaller he saw a couple making out and he thought that the man was eating the women.I hope Lena chooses Alex, not Julian ,some random person the author decides to throw in, or she doesn't chose at all. I will go crazy if she doesn't chose Alex.I highly recommend you buy this book.

B007P6VM04|3.0|Very disappointed in the CD as this is some of the music from \\"Smash\\", not all of it and leaving out \\"Never Met A Wolf Who Didn't Like To Howl\\", the Bollywwood number and \\"National Pastime\\" is a crime. I wanted to hear more of Hilty as she's the only reason that's kept me interested in the show; she a showstopper!!!! That just didn't happen so we got a lot of pop-like tunes from McPhee from the show and not enough Hilty singing the show tunes. Can't wait for Hilty to put out a CD of her own and I hope when she does, she does mostly Broadway.  Whereas Mcphee is pop, Hilty can do both pop and Broadway. Just love the woman!
B005H7WDTC|5.0|I started my Beethoven journey by ordering 5 Beethoven symphony #9: Abbado, Bernstein, Karajan, Ozawa and Thieleman. I am usually dissappointed on DVD video quality Pre-2000 thus experienced same poor video quality with all but Abbado and Thielemann. Thus I got the complete symphonies with Abbado and Thielemann on Blu-ray. The Abbado was a deal at $25 for the whole set or about the price of one of the Thielemann DVDs which contain 3 symphonies each. The quality of the Thielemann set with the Vienna Philharmonic is so superb that I do not see how it can be improved upon. Video both far and near is bright and crisp, the musicality of this orchestra is superb, and direction unheard of....though I admit the Abbado set is quite good also. DTS HD is breath taking. And I like the conservative conducting style of Thielemann....no histrionics and little drama....just superb directing. And of course the Vienna Philharmonic building is one of the loveliest in Europe. A bonus on the first disk is the Coriolan and Egmont overtures. To top things off each disk has a lecture on each symphony. The price is about $90 new for the whole set but it is a good bargain because this is a set you will watch over and over again.

0307594165|3.0|\\"Frank and Cee, like some forgotten Hansel and Gretel, locked hands as they navigated the silence and tried to imagine a future.\\"<br /><br />Toni Morrison's Home is a surprisingly lean novel from a major American author known for her complex and elliptical style. Home is even more lean and minimal than Morrison's brilliant Sula, which she wrote forty years ago. For some reason, I yearned for the Morrison who wrote Song of Solomon or Paradise, which is Morrison at her most complex and perhaps her most sublime. That isn't to say Home is a failed effort, but perhaps it's a passive, more subdued effort, one which does not give us the feeling her greatest books have given us.<br /><br />Home tells the story of Frank Money and his experience \\"home\\" after The Korean War. He lost both his homeboys, Michael and Stuff, in the war. In a character reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's Septimus Warren Smith or perhaps even Morrison's own Shadrack, Money suffers re-adapting into American society. He fought for a racist country which still segregated and refused to acknowledge his duty to his country. He \\"loiters\\" around, which causes suspicion from cops. He wanders aimlessly, not quite sure about his own self, which is haunted by images from the past. He breeds shame from an incident that happened in Korea (I won't say what), masking it with visible and palpable anger. Money eventually tries to become more active as a man when he receives a letter from Sarah that his sister, Ycidra, called Cee, \\"...best be dead if you tarry.\\" Cee is gradually dying in the hands of a strange physician Dr. Scott, who is perhaps involved in experimentation dealing with \\"eugenics.\\" This propels the journey \\"home\\" for both Frank and Cee as they travel their way back to Lotus, Georgia, finding their way home like when Hansel and Gretel were lost in the forest after being abandoned by their parents. The place where they grew up, which they hated as restless and yearning children, becomes a place for redemption for the both of them.<br /><br />What I found interesting about this novella is how it captures the leitmotif of Morrison's previous works as a whole, her persistent investigation through all her books of what \\"home\\" means. What I missed was the intense musicality and poetry of her earlier works, but her lean prose might find favor with those readers who have disliked Morrison's style in the past. Still, there are beautifully poignant moments such as this: \\"The swallows were back, bringing with them a light breeze and an odor of sage growing at the edge of the yard. Cee watched, thinking, So this is what they mean in those sad, sweet songs. `When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind...' Except those songs were about lost love. What she felt was bigger than that. She was broken. Not broken up but broken down, down into her separate parts.\\" Reminiscent of Morrison's at her literary peak, these moments are well worth reading and rereading.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing quite what to expect -- I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I can remember, and I took a pass on the first Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey Jr. (RDJ) Sherlock movie because I'd heard (erroneously, as it turned out) that it turned Holmes into some kind of Victorian-era action hero.<br /><br />Well, that was my loss - I completely LOVED this film! It's a rollicking, slam-bang, intelligent, witty and compelling update of the Sherlock Holmes canon, and surprisingly, in many cases it is closer to Arthur Conan Doyle's original concept of the characters than many earlier movies and TV shows have been. Doyle, remember, was writing popular, mass-market entertainments - and his Sherlock is not a stuffy, sedentary dude who just sits around in his armchair puffing his pipe and working out Great Deductions. The original Sherlock IS a man of action -- he is a boxer (yes, that's canon!) and in \\"The Final Problem,\\" where he fights Moriarty to the death at Reichenbach Falls, we learn he knows an Asian martial art called \\"baritsu\\" (there actually IS one called \\"bartitsu,\\" which may have been what Doyle meant). So RDJ's take on Sherlock is spot-on canonical -- manic, genius-brilliant, a bare-knuckle fighter, a martial-arts expert, a violinist, an imbiber of intoxicating substances (though they don't show his cocaine habit - interestingly, it was OK to mention it in Doyle's age, but in ours, it has to be Sherlock swigging stuff like formaldehyde and gypsy wine, although Mrs. Hudson does mention he survives on a diet of coffee and \\"coca leaves\\"...).<br /><br />RDJ's Holmes is also dashingly handsome, as is, for once, Dr. Watson (how could he not be, when played by Jude Law?). And this, too, makes absolute sense -- Watson was portrayed by Doyle as a wounded war hero recently returned from Afghanistan (that earlier Afghan conflict that England found itself embroiled in), so it would make sense that Watson would be fairly young and in fighting trim (Law uses acane and limps a little, due to that war wound, but he's a mean hand with both a stick and a gun) -- not some old, querulous duffer as portrayed by so many earlier actors taking on Watson.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of covert (and overt, hilariously enough!) slashiness (fan term for, er, ultra-bromance) going on - Holmes and Watson are definitely crushing on each other; they bicker and make up like a married couple, which is the ongoing in-joke of both movies (yup, I've seen the first one, now, too!). All this means the ladies don't get to do a whole lot -- \\"The Woman\\" of Holmes' life, Irene Adler (Rachel McAdams) is in this movie only very briefly (and I'm not buying that she's gone for good...). Watson's new wife, Mary, gets booted early, too, but I can tell there's a lot more going on there - I'm liking Mary, and she gets to do a little a**-kicking of her own in this one. The leading lady of this movie is Noomi Rapace, playing the gypsy Madame Simza -- Noomi is the original Swedish \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" and she's put on a few curves to take on this, her first big role in an American movie. She does well here, but her character is mostly a plot device to lead us to the middle of the web woven by Holmes' arch-nemesis, the \\"Napoleon of crime,\\" Professor James Moriarty (Jared Harris of \\"Mad Men,\\" son of the late Richard Harris).<br /><br />Now here is a villain worthy of Sherlock Holmes. Harris' Moriarty radiates menace, with his foxy face and yellowy teeth; he's here (in 1891)trying to create a sort of proto-World War I by taking over the whole line of products, \\"from bullets to bandages\\" -- including an armaments factory where some enormously anachronistic weapons are being manufactured, which becomes a setpiece battleground in the movie. Nicely done, too. Director Ritchie may have gone a bit overboard in his extreme slo-mo sequences, showing bullets crashing through and splintering trees as our heroes flee through a German forest, but it's all undeniably beautiful. The effect of his \\"Holmes-o-vision\\" (where Holmes -- and we -- \\"see\\" what will happen in a fight just before the fight takes place) is also very cool, especially when things don't quite turn out as Holmes pre-envisions them. It's especially effective in the final confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach, where the two engage in one of the great cinematic chess matches of all time (and half of it is in their heads, not on the board! And yes, there's a \\"chess advisor\\" listed in the credits, so I have to assume the moves are all realistic...).<br /><br />A large part of the joy of this movie is just seeing an ultra-intelligent character who also gets to be an action hero -- so often, intellect is downplayed in movies, or relegated to the bad guy (aren't the bad guys always the brainy ones?); or the intellectual is portrayed as a sedentary \\"man of thought\\" rather than action, as in most earlier Sherlocks. This Sherlock Holmes dares to break the mold, and for that I say \\"Huzzah!\\" and here's to many more in this series. Thumbs way up!

B00003CX95|1.0|Don't be a lemming!<br /><br />While oft considered a \\"classic\\" and \\"accurate\\" concerning medieval warfare and Scots history, it is neither!  The writer himself said that he \\"...never lets history get in the way of a good story...\\"!  If you can't make the REAL history of these times into a good story, then perhaps screen writing is NOT your true calling!<br /><br />The plot is perfectly adequate, as is the acting.  The action has little to do with \\"realism\\" or true medieval warfare.  The history?  Just plain WRONG!  Wallace was not a Scots/Pict warrior in woad, but a KNIGHT in ARMOUR.  Robert the Bruce did NOT ride for Edward I and betray Wallace.  Absolute RUBBISH.<br /><br />If you want a tear-jerker and schmaltz, buy this film.  If you want a good action and history flick, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE!
0345529057|3.0|Overall the content in the books is just what I expected to be. I loved the first 3 books and the 4th was okay compared to the others considering I feel it was only half a book featuring only a couple people and leaving out some of the more important people like Stannis, Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen except for a few instances in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The printing of the book was lackluster. The print smudged all the time in all four books and it seems like some of the pages were not centered properly which is just visual annoying. This is extremely annoying because as I was reading the books the print on the right page we smudge so much that it became unreadable. The cover is also made from cheap materials. I have had 2 books were the covers started to come apart.<br /><br />Overall I give the books 4 stars for content and 2 stars for quality of the product.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|Junk, pure and simple!<br /><br />The epic 'The Iliad' has survived for 2500+ years because it is a classic and is still relevant.  Why did the director feel the need to change characters, scenes, and the plot?!?  Paris *lives*?!?  Menelaus *dies*?!?!<br /><br />Needless changes, bad action, hit-and-miss acting.  MUCH better versions of Homer out there!<br /><br />Avoid!!

0307891372|5.0|The computer game \\"Elder Scrolls V : Skyrim\\" is a very vast and complicated game.  The directions that come with the game provide a very basic overview of how to play but really do not give any indication of how vast the game is.  The Official Game Guide is invaluable in explaining the various locations, quests and players that are encountered.  In my opinion, the guide is necessary to play the game with any kind of enjoyment.  The fact that used guides are also available is a cost savings.  I could find no problems with the used book that I purchased.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This ia a fun game fornmy Kindle Fire.  It is only interrupted by ads during the initial shuffle.  This is not too distracting, and for free, who can complain?
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|i haven't finished 1st of 3 in trilogy and it is very difficult to put it aside.  When i do i can hardly wait to pick it up again. Hope the other 2 are as good , as i purchased all 3 on my new amazon kindle --which ,by the way,sure beats any library or bookstore.  Thanks so much  ed bryans
B0079XNWQA|2.0|I'm a die hard Mraz fan, but have to say.....just...\\"meh, whatever\\" about this one....with the exception of \\"I Won't Give Up\\"....I didn't feel moved like I usually do with Mraz lyrics.  I'll give it a few more plays, maybe it will grow on me....but it did NOT grab me like all of his previous albums....and I would 100% agree that his live albums eclipse any of his studio work. \\"Sleeping to Dream\\" is an example....live it's powerful....studio....not so much. A live Mraz performance is a religious experience.
B00065MDSQ|4.0|Disc was loose in case, but Disc was not scratched! Since disc played great and was in great condition. Cracked case is no big deal.  :)

B00723NWJE|5.0|Dark, sultry, even a sadistic wording on 'Miriam' with her sweet voice being a counterpoint. Country edges beautiful use of the recording studio's electronics. I am blown away!<br /><br />Note: I thought the best songs were on the Bonus CD... they seem to take Norah even farther from her comfort zone.<br /><br />This is a beautiful, sometimes jaw-dropping musical experience with a true craftsperson.... and she has never sounded better!<br /><br />And I forgot, Danger Mouse was once again superb in the arrangements and the studio musicians and sound.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Everytime this stupid game updates it adds a ridiculous amount of hours on all ur stuff. It was great until it kept adding all the extra time.

B0060AY85C|4.0|\\"Look to yourself. You free. Nothing and nobody is obliged to save you but you.\\"<br /><br />Frank Money is grappling with \\"normal life\\" after returning home from the Korean War.  Morrison opens the story Frank having one of his many flashbacks from his childhood. The flashback happens while he is in restraints in a mental hospital. The war zone has basically made Frank a wanderer.  While in a brief relationship with an ambitious young woman, Lily, Frank gets a cryptic message from his sister that sends him on a trip to try and rescue her before it is too late.<br /><br />\\"Frank alone valued her. While his devotion shielded her, it did not strengthen her.\\"<br /><br />Frank and Ycidra \\"Cee\\" Money were the type of siblings that had that unconditional, mountain moving devotion. Their parents were present physically but not emotionally. A brief stay with a mean grandmother proved to have a lasting effect on them both. So they grew to only depend on each other.  While Frank was in Korea, he lost his two best friends as casualties of war.  Cee got married and moved to Atlanta. Cee's husband ran off and returning to Lotus was not an option for her. When Cee landed a job as a doctor's assistant with free room and board she was pretty sure it was a good, safe place. This doctor practiced \\"eugenics\\" which Cee didn't understand much about. The doctor's experimentation on Cee brought Frank back to her and sent them both to Lotus a place they both vowed to never return. It was in Lotus that they found the healing and strength to go on.<br /><br />When I realized I had been chosen to be receive an ARC of Toni Morrison's latest novel, I was ecstatic. There is a lot of Toni's \\"invisible ink\\" in \\"Home.\\" Overall, I would say that the story was steady and reminded me of,\\"Song of Solomon.\\" Initially the story was pretty captivating then it leveled off. \\"Home\\" had a lot of heart but not much depth.
B004JMSIRC|4.0|We've all seen the movie by now and know how good it is, so I don't need to review the movie itself.  The video quality is great like it should be for a Blu-Ray, however, the sound was a little disappointing!  The sound is only Dolby D, not DTS like most Blu-rays, so you don't get the \\"full\\" sound like usual.  That's the only bad thing I can say about quality or video itself.
0765316994|4.0|Redshirts takes place in the far future where the star ship Interpid is off discovering new planets and generally keeping the peace.  The only trouble is that other than the captain and top officers, the rest of the crew is dying with a great deal of regularity.  Ensign Andrew Dahl is assigned to the ship and starts to notice all of the irregular things happening on the ship.  Ensign Andrew Dahl makes it his mission to find out what is happening and why.  Soon Ensign Dahl is off to see who is exactly pulling the strings and why are all of the new crewmates dying.  And in fact, I don't really want to describe the plot further because it really gives away what else is going to happen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the book is well-written, I can't say that it held my attention that much.  I grew up watching Star Trek/Wars/Deep Space 9/Star Trek The Next Generation and unfortunately, while the book is fun, I could also see where Scalzi is going with the plot from the start.  Any fan who watched much of any space-quest type of show knows that the captain always lives and a whole handful of extra grunts die off.  In fact, this book reads similarly to the movie with Tim Allen called Galaxy Quest.  Both share some similar themes.  One of my favorite lines from Galaxy Quest is from one of the grunts who doesn't want to go and face the aliens because he knows that it's always the grunts who get killed off.  That being said, the story is fun, well written and mostly engaging.  I just wish that I felt like I hadn't watched it a few times before.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  I saw it later on large screen and was impressed to remember how clear it was on the Kindle Fire.  I like being able to watch new movies without having to buy them without reveiwing them.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I unfortunately saw the movie first - I thought it was great and saw it twice.<br />The book explained in so much more detail and painted scenery, action and suspense in far greater detail than ever possible in the movie

0345803493|1.0|Once again, the author demonstrates how not to write, how not to use a thesaurus, but amazingly, how to sell to the masses who will gobble up whatever everyone claims to be greatness. It's borderline porn, and while I'm not offended by that, it detracts from the story. That said, I don't think there ever was a point to the story. It's aimed at those who gobble up Harlequin \\"novels\\" as though they are great literature. It's written just about as well too. Obscure language that nobody would actually USE helps to break up the flow of the story even more than the random nonsense that the story relies on to sell itself. Imagine Twilight, just worse, and without the supernatural fantasy to get lost in. A weak and boring female lead who tries to appear strong and independent, and a borderline lunatic for a male lead, with unhealthy tendencies towards stalking and control, who is, at his core, abusive.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great app.  You would think otherwise with those notable opinions but I think it's fine.When those adds do come up I just press the back button and it takes me back to my home page.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book because I was intrigued by the concept. It is MUCH better in audiobook format however, as it's much more in-line with the concept in general, and really immerses you in the story. The people who are saying \\"it's just normal high school kids doing normal stuff...\\" and so on, and saying that Hannah was a \\"whiny brat\\" and the like are missing the point entirely. Teenagers are inherently selfish creatures, and are generally insensitive. The point is more that everyone MISSED the classic warning signs, and in my best estimation, this book is a wake up call for people (aimed primarily at teens of course) to THINK about how they treat people, and how their actions can help to push someone over that edge. I don't understand why people are saying Hannah's reasons for suicide are not valid, acceptable reasons. I think that's the point...IS there ever a good enough REASON for such an act? The reasons are rarely ever RATIONAL. RATIONAL and emotionally STABLE people don't commit suicide! She overreacted? Sure...but who am I, or anyone else for that matter, to say how an act should make someone else feel?<br /><br />I think the author has a fairly keen understanding of the subject matter, and understands how the smallest things can seem like SO much more to the person on the receiving end, especially when that person is a teenager, who is already prone to overreaction and emotional sensitivity by the mere state of BEING a teenager.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|In my oponion,this film is darn stupid.The effects are bad,the directing is okay and the acting decent.The main reason this film wasn't a one star is just because of Daniel Craigs acting.Overall,bad.

0805209999|5.0|The Trial by Franz Kafka.<br />Much has been written about this book. Many opinions seem to be rife about the meaning and the basic allegory of the plot and the story.<br />Kafka came from a German-speaking Jewish family and lived in Prague in Bohemia.He had a background of working in a job described by his father as a `breadjob' meaning he was just earning money with no career.He worked for an insurance company where he dealt with worker's injury claims, although he had a doctorate in law. He had a five-year attachment to Felice Bauer and although it consisted only of a number of meetings and a great deal of correspondence, they were engaged several times, each time breaking it off until their relationship finally failed in1917.<br /><br />Kafka completed `The Trial' in 1915, though it was unfinished and later required editing by Max Brod his close friend. It has been studied and many opinions exist of its meaning. Kafka's dying wish was that Brod should burn the manuscript, but happily, he didn't.<br />There seem to be several interpretations. On the one hand,the story is supposed by some to be the depiction of the futility of struggling against fate or God. Others suppose it represents Kafka as a Jew in a society where Jews were condemned openly or behind the scenes, since anti-Semitism was rife in Europe even before the First World War.<br /><br />The book begins with an `arrest'. The central character, `K' (is it coincidence that he has the author's initial and all other characters have spelled-out names?), a man aged thirty who works in a bank is confronted by two men who claim he is under arrest, but free to work and move around, but that a trial will commence to determine his future.<br />In the following story, K becomes acquainted with a number of characters who lead him in a fanciful dance designed to indicate the futility of his attempts to battle the `Courts'. It turns out almost everyone he encounters has been or is involved with the courts and even his family know he has a forthcoming trial without his communication with them. Everyone knows he is subject to `The Process' but even K never discovers what it is he is supposed to have done. I won't spoil the ending but I think it is symbolic not real. He meets various people who claim to be able to circumvent the outcome of the court and its decision, but he is at times enraged by it all and at other times passive, resisting any help whoever it is offered by. In the end, his fate is the reward he reaps by his intransigence and his resistance to taking advice.<br /><br />My own feeling about the book is that it is not as simply asseeing it as written with one message. I think there are layers of allegory. On the one hand, one could interpret it as showing how society treats minorities.There is a veiled condemnation and of the individual which is unfathomable at first, subtle and hidden, but eventually becoming frank and obvious. A Jew living in Eastern Europe might well feel that was so.<br />Another layer is the futility of fighting against Society's opinions. Everyone is part of a social society and whomever you talk to they are part of it and that is revealed repeatedly in the book. K finds that even places he never identified as part of his trial are part of the courtrooms and court process. He doesn't trust his lawyer - OK, he has common sense!<br />Yet another portrayal of the author's underlying theme requires one to see how he might have viewed society's opinion of his relationship with Felice. It was off-on. It consisted of a lot of correspondence and few `in the flesh' encounters. Could it be that The Trial mirrors his feeling about how society might have viewed his eventual refusal to lead a normal, married life? Was he ostracised as a result?<br />If one transgresses, society may condemn one. It might not be immediately apparent that some force is working in the background against you. The evolution of the antipathy may emerge with time and eventually result in the apex of condemnation by the very social world in which one lives. To be Jewish and to jilt someone publicly - might that not evoke feelings of guilt - even a feeling that society condemns one without any visible trial?<br />But in the end, what is K guilty of? Is he just guilty of digging his heels in against a manipulative, turgid system, designed to visitits hatred and injustice on anyone who chooses to be different or even be born different? He is guilty of underestimating the power of the hierarchy. He is guilty of ignorance of the very system that controls us. He is even guilty of passivity. It results in the eventual judgement where the book ends.<br /><br />So, the verdict? My verdict?<br /><br />This is a book that has made me think more than any other I have read since I was a teenager (the first time I read it). Recommend it? Well if you have tolerance for some boring parts and patience to reap the eventual reward of the book, then yes.Not for everyone. It's not an adventure book but as someone who works a as a tiny cog in a big machine it speaks to me as no other book does!sult in the apex of condemnation by the very social world in which one lives.

B004529NKC|3.0|This was a gift for my grandaughter and she really liked it. There's no more to say except I watched too. Nice music sharp dancers.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even better than the first book. Aptly titled 50 Shades Darker, it delves into the dark despair and dysfunction that is Christian's mind. The glimpse is moving and shattering. Ana's conviction and curiosity are refreshing, as is her evolving confidence. The ball was spectacular. Elena's character offers a welcome dramatic twist, while showcasing Ana's sass. The interaction between Leila and Christian in Ana's apartment was heart-stopping. Christian's surrender following the Leila incident shows his intense vulnerability. I could relate and justify Ana's decisions, meanwhile, I could see how outsiders such as Kate would be horrified by the events of their relationship. I'm desperately sad there is only one book left as I don't want the story to end. It's just too rich.
B0012QCZ54|3.0|Never watched this particular movie. This is not my normal type of film, but I bought the other parts for my Granddaughter!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Simply put, I am 50 shades of breathless. Ana's character is so raw and eerily relatable. Christian goes from intriguing to loathesome to broken and vulnerable. There were definitely aspects beyond my comfort zone, but I was enraptured by the story. I blushed as I pushed through and was not met with disappointment. Ana's emotion is real, as is her wanting more in her quest for love. The e-mail exchanges were my favorite part. As a reader I felt her pain and struggle with justification. I cannot wait to read the next. Something I never would have imagined after the chapter introducing the Red Room.<br /><br />The best part of reading this book is the company. It's like us readers share a dirty little secret. We know what each other's eyes have read and the place it has taken us
B00785P2QC|5.0|best game ever.......get it and play it.....works great on kindle fire.....u can play as long as u want but its just the energy that u get......apparently u can only have a minimum of energys....
0345803507|5.0|I finished Freed to day, wrapping up my self-inflicted three day Fifty series read-a-thon. I've written rave reviews for the Grey and Darker already, and this will be no different. E.L. James is quite simply a gifted story teller, and I could not get enough of her raw, erotic, emotional, creative, and original writing.<br /><br />How do you write a story that takes truly interesting and multi-dimensional characters, completely immerses them in sex and lust, and somehow still make the plot, the emotions, and the humor all seem real and compelling? I still don't know HOW she pulled it off, but exhibit A would be this series. Every moment, from Ana's first stumble into Christian's office in Grey to the blissfully happy ending we've all been waiting for in Freed, had me captivated because this story was just so amazingly well written. It was enlightening, exciting, beautiful, sexy as hell, heart-wrenching, and just unforgettable.<br /><br />Freed starts off with Ana and Christian on their honeymoon, and I loved seeing them so happy together. After all they'd been through in the first two books, it was hard-earned! Ana grew so much in Darker, and in Freed we see her truly become her own woman; Mrs. Grey, the confident, sexy wife that's finally comfortable in her own skin. And Christian really is trying to put her first, despite his constant need to be in control. He opens up even more and shares more of himself with Ana, and I was swept away by their love for each other. Their happiness is threatened again by both Christian's past and present, and they discover that Jack Hyde, Ana's former boss who tried to blackmail her for sex, has a bigger role than they ever understood. Christian's temper and Ana's determination to have some freedom in her life pit them against each other when they need each other most, and a drastic turn of events leads to a heartbreaking moment that changes everything for them. In the last 25% of the book (I had the kindle version) everything comesto a head, and it was too enthralling to put down!<br /><br />Now that I've finished the series, I'm really sad to say goodbye to these characters. Watching Christian and Ana grow in these books made them have such a big place in my heart, and it's sad to know that it's over. I'm so grateful to E.L. James for giving us this absolutely unforgettable story, and it is with tears in my eyes that I bid one of the best-written series out there a bittersweet and heartfelt farewell!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved this book.  Nicely tied up the first two.  His style is simple and effective.  Always kept me on the edge of what would come next.  A good read!
0312641893|5.0|AHHHHHHHHH! &*&^%$^^&* man, this book took me by surprise!!! I was such a doubter when I started this book, and I was still thinking about 15% in that I wasn't sure I was going to be able to really enjoy the plot. The whole cyborg love thing was a little weird even for me, and I was pretty sure it would not be something I'd enjoy reading. OH MAN was I wrong! Meyer created something so original with this unforgettable and moving plot, mesmerizing heroine, and butterfly-inducing romance, and I am just so in love with this series!!<br /><br />Cinder takes the basic story of Cinderella and flips it up, tosses it in the air, flips it 180 degrees, gives it real purpose and emotion, and then throws it back down into a futuristic Beijing. I went into this story thinking I wouldn't like it much b/c I'm not a big fan of the whole robotic/cyborg/android storyline. Never did I think I could become attached to a cyborg character like I did Cinder, and I give all the due credit to Meyer for creating someone so multi-dimensional out of a robotic teenage girl. Cinder has such real and strong emotions despite the fact that we see her in all her mechanical weakness, and she grew on me immensely as the story went along. I couldn't help but feel for her plight, her shame for being only part human, her unending desire to not be who she is, and the emotions she feels for the alluring Prince Kai.<br /><br />When Cinder gets sent away to be used for lab testing in order to cure the plague, some unexpected discoveries are made about her that plant the seed for some unexpected turns. She makes discoveries about herself with the help of Dr. Erland, the scientists researching cures for the disease, and he quickly becomes a friend and ally to her when she has so few. I saw some of it coming, but the whole time I was thinking \\"oh, I hope that's where this is going!!\\" because I knew it would make this series so exciting!!<br /><br />I loved Prince Kai, he was sweet and caring with Cinder when noone else would bother. He valued her opinion and her company, and it was a much-needed tenderness in Cinder's otherwise cruel and meaningless world. He was smart and determined with admirable morals as the future emperor, and his obvious feelings for Cinder were heartwarming. I couldn't help but wishing these two together, even though part of me kept thinking it was just too strange to be possible. But again, Meyer created a twist that just changed everything, and it will certainly have a huge effect on all of the characters for the rest of the series.<br /><br />When secrets and twists started being revealed in Cinder, there was this snowball effect for the rest of the story. The last 15% (kindle) were so full of action, emotion, and revelations that I couldn't tear myself away from the story because I was so invested in it. I am SO freakin' excited for the Scarlet, the sequel to this series, and I highly recommend this book as a great twist on dystopian romance!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why am I not surprised? I was recommended to read this book by a friend who is obsessed with Twilight.<br /><br />I couldn't finish the book because I can't get past the idea that the protagonist is portrayed as being weak. She doesn't exactly what her roommate asks of her, she's an English Lit major (I think) and doesn't have any job prospects (really?!?!), and completely swoons over this guy she just met. I know it's fiction - but come on!<br /><br />Not to mention it's kindof a giveaway when in the second chapter he is buying rope, masking tape, etc. How erotic ...<br /><br />Overall - borrow this book if you're interested to find out what it's about. Obviously it's a best seller so people like it, I just don't.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|Oh, my did I LOVE this book!!! If you are like me and fell head-over-heels for the Fifty Shades series, this is definitely for you!!<br /><br />Eva Tramell is excited about her move to New York city. She's found a great apartment, and despite her rich step-father's connections, she's making her own way with an entry-level position at a popular ad agency. What she wasn't expecting was Gideon Cross. He's successful, powerful, wealthy, and physical perfection, and he makes no effort to hide his desire for Eva. She can't fight the indescribable sparks that ignite every time he's near, and she finds herself giving in to the passion that haunts her every thought. But as the walls start to come down and the scars from their battered pasts are revealed, Gideon and Eva are forced to face the reality of their situation. When two people carry around so much pain, nothing is going to be simple, and it may be too much for either of them to bear.<br /><br />My review:<br />I was very impressed with Sylvia Day's creation, and I am so excited for this series!! Bared to You was such a thrilling, sexy, heart-wrenching, and unsettling story, and it left me breathless. It's a roller coaster of emotions from start to finish, and my heart still races thinking about what Gideon and Eva go through for each other! They are such tortured souls, and they complete each other like perfectly fit pieces to a puzzle. Granted, they put the 'fun' in dysfunctional relationship, but it was as if their needs were meant to soothe each other's pain. Gideon needs to be in control but is undeniably enticed by Eva's strength, and Eva is terrified of losing control but finds comfort in Gideon's power over her desires. It's the makings of the perfect storm, and I couldn't look away!!<br /><br />I was really impressed with Eva, she was such a strong character. After all that she'd suffered through in her life, she's remarkably determined and makes it very clear to Gideon how she feels. Gideon is a force of nature, but Eva is no wallflower, and their power struggles were as fascinating as they were scorching!! And Gideon...oh, how intoxicating he is!! From the moment he crosses paths with Eva, I was captivated by this mysterious man. Eva's fascination and attraction to him left me anxiously awaiting his every return to the story, I just couldn't get enough of him!! He and Eva simply can't resist each other, and steamy doesn't begin to describe their moments together; they're blazing, \\"I need a cold shower\\", mind-blowingly HOT!!! *fans self*<br /><br />Not surprisingly, many readers are comparing this book to Fifty Shades of Grey due to some obvious similarities in the plot. But this is not just some knock-off story that tries to ride the coat tails of a successful series, and where the similarities end there is an entirely new experience that FINALLY helped lessen that huge void that Christian Grey left behind!! Gideon and Eva's story goes well beyond their insatiable lust for each other, and their self-destructive tendencies created such an emotional and heartbreaking tornado of a romance. Gideon has a walk-in closet full of skeletons that have yet to be revealed, and the broken hearts he's left behind are determined to stay in his life despite Eva's presence. There's definitely a sinister, ticking-time-bomb feel to the plot in this story, and every time it seemed like they might finally be getting a break from the drama, there was yet another twist that ripped them apart. I'll be anxiously awaiting the sequel to find out what's lurking behind all of those closed doors, and how Eva and Gideon face it all. I just love these characters, I love their story, and I very much look forward to more from the Crossfire series!!

B0001ADAVK|3.0|so the Italian prof completely lies about his life, newlyweds cold cheating husband, control freak Topher, egotitistical LA b/f, cmon, not one good guy, oh yeah, the nerd... geez, women were repressed then but Wellesley had to be the epitome of the equality brew, maybe a typing/cooking school makes more sense for setting... got very exhausting with the many mugshots of stiff upper lip superiority visuals, way too dramatic, kept the suspense low with the typical girlfights and the possibilities to demonstrate the great strides made by women in education to push the barrier to elevate lifetime goals is underwhelming... think Harry Potter's Hermione made more of a statement... luved the synchronized swimming class!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is a good time waster if you know how to use it on a kindle. but I don't like the fact that the background music play after you are done with the game.

0142403873|5.0|This is a great story - fun to read and with a sweet message about the little guy standing up to the bullies.  My son loves this as do I.  We equally enjoy the Whale and the Snail from the same author.

076115678X|5.0|I wish I had this books decades ago. I love my curls now and spend less time on my hair than I've ever done while it looks better than it ever has.
032147404X|5.0|This is an awesome book, brand new. Thank you so much for the quick, efficient shipping. Will definately order from this seller again. I love the way the author explains every thing so you can understand instead of getting technical.
B005PK1G76|3.0|I ordered one of these for my city mini double stroller and it is an average product.  It is a nice heavy canvas.  I like the compartments and it has a mesh zipper area inside the middle compartment.  I do not like that it sits so close to the handle bar that it is awkward to use water bottles and impossible to use any liquid holding device that is not completely sealed- which really is the main reason I bought this.<br /><br />Update a year later- the wire piece that goes around the basket is now poking out of the fabric.  This works okay with kids cups but not with my drinks- like a store-bought coffee with a lid. Basically, I use it to hold little pieces of trash or my keys when we are on a walk. I never use the zipper compartment bc it is too hard to get to.
B006OB3K56|5.0|A VERY INTENSE MOVIE ABOUT ANOTHER KIND OF ADDICTION, GREAT ACTING FROM ACTORS MICHAEL FASSBENDER AND CAREY MULLIGAN.  IT CAN BE A VERY HARD MOVIE TO WATCH SOMETIMES BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE SUBJECT MATTER. WAS DISAPPOINTED THAT MICHAEL FASSBENDER WAS OVERLOOKED BY THE OSCARS, HAD SEEN HIM IN OTHER MOVIES, IE HUNGER, WHICH SHOWCASED HIS ACTING SKILLS.
B0053Q9DHW|4.0|To start out, I have never read Jane Eyre. I will be reading it soon, but just haven't gotten around to it. I've seen other adaptations of the movie before this one and I have to say... I fell more in love with the story watching this version than any other.<br /><br />So what if not all of the dialogue is presented, or this or that isn't accurate. When I watch a movie, I take it for what it is: a movie. It's not a book. It's not the classic so many of you have fallen in love with years and years prior to this movie. I think sometimes you set yourself up for disappointment when you go into an adaptation expecting perfection. Here's the bottom line: You will never find a movie that does perfect justice to classic novel such as Jane Eyre.<br /><br />Now, as far as the technical stuff goes:<br />Great soundtrack. Great locations and set designs. Great cinematography. Great cast.<br /><br />As far as the storyline goes (purely from a movie standpoint):<br />Having never read the book, I understood perfectly what was happening in the story.<br />I found remarkable chemistry between the actors. The last scene (while abrupt) was spectacularly done, leaving me staring blankly, with goosebumps edging down my arms, as the credits rolled.<br />I think the script was passionate, witty, and charming. All the things I would expect from a classic novel.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this film has captured a certain spirit. A spirit I am sure captures the subtle romance happening and soon exploding onto the pages of Jane Eyre. It's not about the details, it's about the feeling.
B00628RVV0|5.0|I think this movie was good in that the truth was presented although very raw. I would never want to see it again, for sure.The acting is very good.I rented it here the other night. It surely sticks with me in my memory!!
B00005V9IL|4.0|I originally saw The Abyss (In its shortened version) in a theater.  The extended directors cut takes the movie to a different level.  It is one of the most unique movies ever made.  Cameron is a great film maker.  On the dvd you have a chance to see both versions.  A must for sight and sound.
0385534639|4.0|Have you ever wanted to join the circus? Have you ever wanted magic, or an opponent? Celia and Marco didn't want either, but Celia didn't want to meet her, or much less, be put in a competition that she knew nothing of, just that she had to be the winner. Marc, was an orphan until someone took him out of this misery and put him into a new one, one that he knew nothing of, only that he must win.  They both have a part in the Cirque de Rêves.<br /><br />The main character is Celia Bowens, the illusionist of the Night circus. She has long brown hair and light skin, with dark grey eyes. Her teacher is her dad, who is also a disembodied spirit because of an accident with magic.<br /><br />Marco is also a part in the circus, but his part is more complicated than just a simple performer. He has brown hair and brown eyes, and his teacher was just someone that adopted him, out of nowhere. He works for the main director of the circus who has no idea of what he truly does for the circus.<br /><br />The Cirque de Reves has many performers, acrobats, and contortionists, trapeze, tamers, and many different tents with odd things. The contortionist is an important person in the circus, Tsukiko, is very secretive though. The tents hold everything, up to performers, to a wishing tree, to a room full of bottles with different scents in them.<br /><br />Poppet Murray and her twin brother Widget Murray are the cat tamers, and their parents are lion tamers. They both have bright red hair, which they have to cover during performances in the black and white circus. Poppet and Widget both have gifts, one to see the future the other to see the past.<br /><br />Bailey is just a boy who goes to the circus, just because of a dare from his mean big sister. What he finds at the circus can make the whole story change. After his first encounter with one of the circus performers he officially became a reveur, a dreamer of the circus.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is Stephen King as you've never read Stephen King.  He leads you into a period of time so familiar to many of us but with so many twists and turns, I had to read some chapters out loud to anyone who would listen.  If I hadn't been enjoying this book on my Kindle, it would have to be described as a \\"page turner\\".
B00280LYIC|5.0|this book is for people who love action and a little teeny bit of sadness and a little teeny bit of romance and lots of humor
0385341008|4.0|It was a different style of writing to get used to, but well worth your while to keep reading.  I enjoyed it!
B004RJMUJO|2.0|This game is really fun to play, especially for kids. It has been a lifesaver for occupying my kids. HOWEVER, I recently got a new phone that is properly rooted, and it is amazing to me the built in permissions that this so-called game has. It is basically carte blanche for all of your personal info on your phone. The game can use the phone's camera, for instance, to take pictures and collect the pictures without your consent. It can collect your contacts. It can determine where your location is. Why does a game need this access and why can't I turn it off (without rooting the phone)?!? It certainly seems like some sort of motive where the game is being used as the cover to collect information. It does not matter whether it is the free version or the paid version. I am shocked at how many apps have this kind of built in access. Let the buyer beware!
B00170MYIS|1.0|Purchased from BestBuyStation, and I do not think that they were new genuine Sony batteries. I purchased two and both packages had a hole cut in the bottom on the back, large enough to get the batteries out without opening the package further. I see no reason to have done this except to replace the genuine batteries with either old batteries or knock-offs.<br /><br />I have included pictures in the customer images section. You can review them for yourself and make your own determination about them. Personally, I did not feel confident that the batteries were genuine and so am returning them and buying direct from Amazon.<br /><br />Amazon customer service was very helpful in sending me a return mailing label. I hope that Amazon does indeed follow up on this seller and determine what they're doing to the batteries.
B005EVE8WG|5.0|Imagine the ideal mix of the greatest sounds/albums/songs of your favorite 80's releases from Toto (extra parts Toto), Survivor, Chicago, Mister Mister, Journey and Boston. Now imagine it is infinitely better than the sum of those parts. Now imagine that 'group' releases a \\"Greatest Hits\\" package that was just remixed/recorded.  Or...stop imagining and just buy this album.<br /><br />If you are even remotely a fan of Melodic AOR Rock, this album is for you. Every single song is a polished gem, without a single moment of filler or a misplaced note. The songwriting, vocals, musicanship, arrangements and production....all flawless. They manage to pay homage to some of the best West Coast AOR artists in spirit, but blows most of them away in execution and come up with something entirely unique.<br /><br />Each time I listen to it (and that is a lot), I have a new favorite song. It is simply one of the best albums I have ever owned and deserves to be heard.  Trust me, you will NOT be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|THIS  BOOK  WAS A BOOK I COULD NOT PUT DOWN. I WANTED IT TO GO ON AND ON. WITH MORE STORY LINES.<br />  It was spellbinding,  the author kept your attention throughout the entire book. I would rate this book a 5 plus, and hope this writer continues to produce books like this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app just couldn't be better. Very easy to change versions and great features. Also many of the versions have an opinion to have the Bible read aloud as an audio book.

0739308742|2.0|John Lee is the guy who reads the book for the audiobook version.  Up to now I have only heard Roy Dotrice, so it's entirely possible I just got used to Mr. Dotrice, but John Lee grates on my ear like crazy - I could not listen to him for even one chapter.  All the stresses sounded wrong and the voices were completely different.  It just lost something. Again, I don't know if it's just the shift from what I'm used to, but I would advise going with Mr. Dotrice as opposed to Mr. Lee.
B00589BMF0|5.0|This is a great movie! I remember going to the theatre 20yrs ago to it it and I enjoy it as much now as I did then. I would recommend this movie to anyone who will enjoy a classic sci-fi movie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I've been looking for a while for a good photo editing app. More tools than I planned on using, and easy access to Google images, and other image sites. For a free app, this is wonderful, and fun! Not to mention the fact that you can post the images to facebook and such, and save it to your device in the click of a button! (I, by the way, use it on my kindle fire.)
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great. It works like it should just like on a table with your grandma. It took me back forty three years.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a very exciting and fast paced book, which is not always easy to find in a romance story.  I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, their funny bantering throughout and the descriptive writing the author used to portray the resistance of Abby and Travis from giving in to their emotions.  All in all, it is one of the best reads I have had in this genre for the last few months.  Highly recommend it!
B004DSX5B6|4.0|The Gerber bear grylls multi tool is great, functions reliably. The pouch that comes with it has already torn. The belt loop ripped right off less than 6 hours after I got it. I sat down in a chair and the to stitching gave way. should be much more reliable than that.    Edit as of October 2013 the multi tool is still going strong. 1 soft grip rubber piece came off and the other 3 are on their way, but other than that no complaints. Still use the original pouch as well, but horizontally instead of vertically. 4 out of 5 stars!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I stuck with Beautiful Disaster but more than half the time it was in the hope it would get a bit better.  I know that conflict is the heart of any good story but the back and forth between Abby and Travis became annoying.  I liked all the characters individually - each was fairly well developed (the two girls back story could have been a little more developed and Abby's dad was rather flat and contrived)but I still looked for the umph of their stories. Travis was the most exciting part of the book but also the most immature I think. And all was neatly tied up in a rainbow. Recommend but blandly.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Heard the group being interviewed on NPR (something I don't usually do). Glad I happened onto the interview.  This really is a worthwhile listen.  Great quality.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|easy and very fun can be hard but all the work will pay of very good game for those who what a good challenge
B003Y5H5HY|1.0|All of the actors and actresses in this production are excellent, BUT the movie is a waste of time and money (yours and the producers).  The rewrite is not well thought-out.  I would recommend the European collection of all three books/movies (One may purchase it in a 4-disk set and the additional material is as well done as any additional production material I've seen on an accompanying disk).<br /><br />I'd read all three books before seeing the three original films, and the compromises are small and not disconcerting (like the changes in the American version to Rooney Mara's personality and belief system. They are senseless and compromise the performance of a very talented actress). I also can't believe that Daniel Craig agreed to have his name associated with the American version.<br /><br />Sorry for the rant, but I liked the books and Swedish movies a great deal.  A \\"1\\" rating is really harsh. I just read today that it means \\"hate,\\" but there's no one-and-a-half rating.  My opinion wouldn't have changed, but I personally would have felt a little better.  That's the American way, eh', ;}
B005DC68NI|4.0|David is one of those indie authors who is trailblazing his way into epubbing and lighting the way for the rest of us to follow. Both in this book and on his highly informative blog, David shares his tips and tricks on epublishing, encouraging those of us new to the game to follow in his footsteps and not to make the same mistakes as he has.<br />Only in indie publishing could an author be so helpful, encouraging and genuine.
0375805613|5.0|My mom used to read this book to me when I was little.  It was read to me so often that I just about had it memorized.  It was my first favorite I bought it for my children and now I buy this book for all of my nephews and I will be buying it for my future grandchildren.  Elmo is great and all, but Grover will always be the best!
B005KTZ05G|5.0|My brother is a very avid (read: hardcore) fan of the Assassin's Creed games. He also loves to collect figures of his favorite characters from games, series, movies, etc. Naturally, he would eventually want this one. So, after doing a lot of research into the various Assassin's Creed figures available for purchase, I finally decided on this one for his birthday. You wouldn't believe how excited he was when he saw this.<br /><br />The figure is well detailed, from the small lines that adorn the robe, to the overall look and feel of the figure. It is made of durable plastic, so I doubt it will break easily (DISCALIMER: I am not giving the go ahead to toss the figure off a five-story building as a test for durability). For your posing pleasure, the figure comes with some accessories. Included in the figure are three sets of interchangeable hands (closed hands; loosely-open hands; wide-open hands); and in addition, two removable, concealed blades located on the underside of the forearms.<br /><br />As stated on the box the figure came in, Ezio here exhibits ~38 points of articulation. Unfortunately, the bottom part of his robe prevents much movement in the leg area; but then again, I don't seem to recall Ezio performing too many splits throughout the game anyways. Regardless, he can still be put into some awesome poses, such that you could re-enact scenes from the game itself.<br /><br />Overall, I personally am very happy with this guy, as is my brother. So if you're looking for a nice, simple figure that well-represents Ezio, this figure should do nicely, since it isn't as expensive as the others, but still exhibits a nice amount of detail.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend.  I was skeptical about reading it, as I have never read a book of this genre before.  Well, I can honestly say that my skepticism was well-founded.  This book was terrible.  Not only did I find the content offensive and debasing, but I found the writing style to be unimaginative, repetitive, and generally low-quality.  If the author is going to be writing about the same thing over and over, the least she can do is find new ways to describe it.  I also found this book to be hard to believe.  There is no way that a young, smart, talented and beautiful 20-something girl would allow herself to be treated in such a way.<br /><br />I am not going to bother reading book 2 or 3.  If I have to read about Ana referring to her \\"inner goddess,\\" biting her lip, or flushing/blushing one more time, I just might lose it.
B007HJB6OG|4.0|to whom it may watch, understand this is only the beginning, i hold all actors men and women alike to carry the intelligence of a story. the  story is more heart then man and i submit, to the greateness of the story teller you a story teller and you deserve the honor. Gabriel V
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I just finished chapter 9 and already I want to delete it off my Kindle. I can't get into the book because I'm so irritated by the obnoxious repetition. If I have to read \\"crap\\" \\"biting of the lip\\" or \\"jeez\\" one more time, I just might throw up!<br /><br />For the first 5 chapters I thought I was reading a high school girls diary! He loves me! He loves me not. He loves me! He loves me not. Blah blah blah! I can only imagine that the positive reviews are coming from adolescent teenagers who have been brainwashed by The Twilight Saga into thinking this type of writing is entertaining! They wouldn't know an adult romance novel if it bit them in their butt!<br /><br />Not to mention I just read the first \\"love making\\" scene. Boo! What a letdown! How does James really expect us to believe that Anastasia is in her twenties and has never pleasured herself!?!? COME ON!!!! If this is any reflection on her own sex life, I pity her.<br /><br />I think the trilogy (for me anyway) will be stopping at book #1...possibly chapter 9.<br /><br />UPDATE - Because I had purchased the book within 7 days, I was granted a full refund! Yay! Now if I can just delete it out of my head!
B00785P2QC|4.0|good game..very addicting..got it for my son but now I cant put the game down... using amazon kindle fire and the game works great
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Don't play for relaxing before going to bed. This game is way too addictive and will keep you trying to beat it all night.
B007Q2N0HA|2.0|Rarely do I not finish a book.  But for some reason this was really boring to me!  Maybe because I just finished the 50 shades trilogy, but this seemed like a similar to that story line!  I don't mean the dom/sub sex, I mean the innocent assistant, the hot billionaire over protective boss, the dark and secretive past.  I don't know, it was just boring and weird.  The sex scenes are ok, but it's more wham, bam, thank you mame. The main story & characters are not very interesting.  There is nothing leading into the story, it jumps right in and gives you no background or dept to the characters or story, I didn't think.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I'm a ferocious reader & this book literally took my breath away.. I went back & read the final chapter twice!!! A book you can not put down & you will get nothing done until you read the last word!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|My friends begged me to read this triolgy, told me it was great & I would love it.  I downloaded the free sample first, read it, found it ok but not so compelling I had to purchase the full version right away.  I waited a couple weeks.  I mainly gave into temptation only on pure curiosity in wondering what was so erotic and entertaining about these books??!!  Yes, the writing is poor and the phrases Ana uses are annoying as hell (crap, inner goddness, etc).  The story line actually is very compelling and keeps you wanting to read more into the morning hours.  After I finished this book I definitley wanted to read the second & third.  I found the second and third to be much better than the first.  Much more suspenseful and suprising.  I like the twist & unexpected turns it took.  There are a lot of things that the second & third book get into a much deeper story line that make the books  more than just about a sex/bondage & dom/sub story.  Yes, I recommend!  But not for the shy!
B005USZYDU|4.0|I thought the book was a great piece of storytelling. To turn a 13 y/o kid into a kid that is rather normal in some respects, except for his passion to be a lawyer which I think the author plays just right. One can;t finish the book without looking for an other Theodore Boone adventure
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you are looking for a different perspective in a SF book, you could do a lot worse than Wool.  I first 'discovered' Hugh Howey through his Molly Fyde series, more of a space opera theme.  Wool is no space opera.  It is a book that examines our own views of survival and morality through a gripping tale based on nothing more exotic than a massive hole in the ground (the silo).  The basis for the story is a plausible possibility and does not require much of a stretch to envision.  Hugh's portrayal of the underground post-apocalyptic society begs the read the questions, \\"could we do this to ourselves?\\" and \\"what we we do to survive?\\"  I'd compare some of the story-telling in this book similar to my all time favorite Stephen King (re: Under the Dome, another interesting perspective on what humanity is capable of.) Others have talked about the pace of the writing which I too found difficult to break from.  I am hooked on Hugh.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I have been playing the game dealt with the time restarting on buildings. but I'm tired of it. how many people. have to complain until an update is made, oh my God!  this is ridiculous.  everyone. complains. about the MAJOR ISSUE OF ALL BUILDINGS RESTARTING TO 250 HOURS PRODUCTION.

0307951529|4.0|Author Chris Guillebeau has a lot of programs on his site including an Empire Building Kit. I signed up for it a while back, and every day for a year I got an e-mail from him on how to build my empire: solid advice, a handy tip, a new idea, bold inspiration, a profile of someone who made the leap already and more. Really great stuff.<br /><br />In \\"The $100 Startup\\" Chris gathered a lot of his awesome how-to material in convenient (and cheaper!) book format and expanded on it with new up-to-date info, tools and plans on how to get stuff done, how to build your empire. It may not apply to ALL startups (especially not ones that require a lot of cash/equipment right away) but if you can start small(er) and then build up, then this book rocks.<br /><br />I offer \\"just\\" four stars because I'm not a fan of the style of telling stories of people who have made this or that idea work. It's a bit of a cliche format for this type of book, and while interesting, many of the people have very different circumstances so their stories may not apply to me. I would have preferred more cold, hard factual information--maybe workbooks or checklists--and less of this sort of narrative. It's not a big deal, but I find it a bit distracting.<br /><br />However the bottom line is this book's a great tool to build your empire.<br />So click \\"Buy,\\" read it, then let's all pedal toward the future we want.
0345803485|1.0|I was very excited about reading the book after Good Morning America talked about it.  However, I am only about halfway through the book and cannot read any more.  It is plain porn.  There is no plot nor character development.  I am returning books 2 and 3.

B004XUMMOU|2.0|1)  In other sci-fi series, by 2500 a.d., they got lasers.  Firefly?  Guns.  Guns that SOUND like lasers.  Very, very weak move.<br />2)  Westerns and spaceships is an awful mix.  With the low budget showing.  Harrison Ford contemplated suicide after Cowboys & Aliens.<br />3)  I'd not be enticed by any female crew member of Serenity.  The ones not the \\"companion\\", are like in behavior to children.<br />4)  Companions:  This show was wrote by women.  Whores are, in fact, whores.  Having tea beforehand is awful foreplay, too.<br />5)  These things bugged me more than enough to write this review.<br /><br />Now, as in title of said review, this show could have walked with a four, or five star rating from me.  It did not, because there are no physics.  There are no references to why things like guns sounding like lasers could come to be, not enough crew members on board to alleviate your growing dislike for stagnant character interactions.  It's all so...cheap.  Star Trek: The Next Generation was cheap.  It had a horrific budget to work with, and still they turned lead into gold!  They had round a thousand crew members.  There was room in the story lines to allow you distance from the bridge crew once in a while.  They discussed the plausible physics and mechanics that allowed their tech to exist.  There were explanations aplenty.  Here, in the \\"universe\\" (with like four rooms) of Firefly, it's all spaghetti westerns with decrepit tech masquerading as new tech...fail.  And where's the inventive short dialogues to cue you in as to why it blows so much?  Why put this thing on the air while it's in such a state of...idk, incomplete immaturity?!
B007URCTOG|5.0|I've heard so much about this film and so I decided to give it a whirl.<br />I was not dissappointed. This was one of the best romantic dramas I've seen in a long time!<br />The lead actors have a wonderful chemistry. The story line kept my attention. Most of all,<br />this film is inspired by a true story, Which I appreciate. I also love how there was a bit of<br />humor added to the storyline. I LOVED every minute of it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Awesome book. Couldn't put it down. A great read. I recommend to everyone. Would appeal to different age groups. Excitement, suspense, shock and drama.
B007WV05GY|3.0|Not terrible, not amazing, it's just a decent middle of the road time waster.  The story isn't novel, the acting isn't engrossing, the special effects aren't that good, and some of the wolf behavior is just unbelievable.  Liam Neelson is the only saving grace of this movie, he's just good at this role.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Again another success after the first book in the series. Couldnt put it down. Loved the twists and turns and really drew you into the story. Worth the read!
B007PS0X0W|2.0|I absolutely loved the other Underworld films, but this one felt rushed, with poor story development, a bad pace, and some fairly terrible cgi graphics.
B005EGXTL2|2.0|Having loved the first two books in this series I was eager to read the third. Sadly I wasn't excited or drawn into the book like the other two. It was a miss match of boring and confusing scenes. For me it spoilt the series. Had the third book been a totally different theme/story line it may have been better.

0446572993|4.0|I have just one thing to say about David Baldacci's new novel, The Innocent:  I want more Will Robie!  The Innocent is Baldacci's 26th novel and it has more twists and turns than a back country road.  Entertaining and suspenseful, there are just a few issues that keep this from being the perfect thriller.<br /><br />Will Robie is an assassin working for an unknown agency in the US Government.  His targets are usually international gangsters and terrorists.  But when he is assigned a hit of an American citizen who works for the US Government on American soil, something appears very wrong and Robie can't follow through.  Instead of being the assassin, he now has assassins hunting him.  While running for his life, he hooks up with 14 year old Julie Getty, a street-smart, tough, and extremely intelligent girl who is also running for her life after seeing her parents murdered.  FBI Agent Nicole Vance ends up investigating the assassination gone awry, and Robie and Getty become part of her \\"team.\\"  The more the three investigate, the more arrows point to a common denominator: the First Gulf War.  Unfortunately, there are more dead bodies than answers to their questions.  It also appears that numerous government agencies have been infiltrated by traitors including the FBI, DCIS and the Secret Service, so that the three can't trust anyone.  Even up until the end, I had no clue how Baldacci was going to bring this plot to a conclusion.<br /><br />But while The Innocent was an enjoyable read, I had just two small problems.  First, I pretty much knew from the beginning who the second assassin was from the time this character was introduced.  And as with most thrillers, the plot was just a little too unbelievable in spots.  But still, it was first rate and I'm happy that Baldacci introduced us to a new protagonist.  The Camel Club series was starting to get tired.  So, here's hoping that Mr. Baldacci will consider using Will Robie in future books.
B007URCTOG|2.0|Everything felt fake and hollywoodified throughout this movie.  From the scenes, to the acting, to the makeup, I just could not enjoy this movie because of it.
0440243688|4.0|There's nothing like a Lee Child thriller to break up the monotony of a long car trip.  Gone Tomorrow, the 13th book in his Jack Reacher series, kept us on the edge of our seats for hours!  Once again, Dick Hill does an expert job as reader on the audiobook version.<br />Nomad and former MP Jack Reacher finds himself riding the NYC subway in the early morning hours.  A woman sitting by herself displays almost all the signs of a suicide bomber. As Reacher tries to intervene, the woman takes out a gun and kills herself.  This death sets off red flags, and soon Reacher is being pursued by the NYPD, the FBI, Homeland Security, some private investigators, and some very evil foreign-operatives.  The dead woman, Susan Marks, was a low-level clerk at the Pentagon and was being blackmailed for unknown information.  Reacher's investigation continually points to a candidate for the US Senate, John Sansom.  Sansom was a former general with Army Special Forces, and in the 1980s, he was on a secret mission in Afghanistan.  Reacher believes that what happened in Afghanistan is the key to solving the mystery, but whether he survives long enough to discover the truth is questionable.<br /><br />Once again, Child delivers with a suspenseful plot that kept us guessing until the end.  But I will add that although all his books contain murder and mayhem, Gone Tomorrow has some torture scenes that might be a little much for those who are squeamish.  Also, the evil-doers in Gone Tomorrow might just be the worst that Child has invented.  Overall, my only complaint about Lee Child's Jack Reacher series is that we only have three books until we're finished.  Unfortunately, we're going to run out of books before we run out of trips.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|it is super amazing but you should put jetpack joyride in the app store but this game is awesome. I recommend it
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|Babe is a marvelous family classic! The movie tells the story of an innocent piglet who befriends animals on a farm and becomes especially close to a sheepdog named Fly. With Fly's help and all of the animals on the farm, Babe enters a sheepherding competition. Will Babe win the competition even though he is just a piglet? Watch the movie for yourself! I liked this movie a lot because all of the animals are great actors and have personalities similar to people. At times I wondered if the animals were just extremely well-trained or if the use of animatronics was this effective. The dubbing was also wonderful. The format the movie uses to tell the story is like a children's storybook, with each chapter telling an interesting story with a moral. The movie is also well directed. I especially liked the scene where Babe is trying to steal the farmer's alarm clock because director Chris Noonan used suspenseful music to make the audience more anticipated. I recommend this movie to children ages 4 and up because very little kids will still be able to enjoy it. The movie delivers a positive message that you can do anything despite your appearance. Babe is one of the many classics brought to your home by HDnet movies on KidScene, a morning and Friday night programming block specifically for kids and families. by Gabriella C, KIDS FIRST!

B005LAIHKY|5.0|Dark Shadows is a hilarious movie about a man named Barnibus Collins, who is cursed by an evil witch when he refuses to give her his love. Turned into a vampire, Barnibus is locked away in a coffin for two centuries. Now, freed by unsuspecting construction workers, Barnibus finds that his home town of Collins Port has drastically changed. He must learn to fit into the 70s while protecting his family, restoring Collins Port to its former glory and riding himself of the evil witch, Angelique, who cursed him to be a creature forced to hide in dark shadows. I absolutely loved this movie. Johnny Depp, who plays Barnibus Collins, did fantastic! Johnny is one of my all time favorite actors and when he teams up with director Tim Burton, you know it's a film worth seeing. The cinematography was great because of the gloominess that you will often find in Tim Burton's films, but they found a flawless way to thrown in the bright colors of the 70's.  The special effects were great too, especially in the end when Angelique's skin started to crack; she really looked as if she was made out of porcelain. Something that did bother me about the visuals was that the blood in the film looked way to fake considering that it is a vampire movie. My favorite character would have to be that daughter of the Collins family played by Chloe Moretz. One; she is my favorite young actress, two; she played a moody, mellow dramatic, angsty teenager perfectly.  The acting in this film was priceless because there was a lot of over-acting, but not in a cheesy way, it was done very purposefully and it gave a wonderful comedic feel to dramatic situations. I suggest this film for ages 13 and up because of sexual situations, mild drug use and language. On a scale of 1-5 I would give this film 6 stars because it far surpassed my expectations! Be sure to see Dark Shadows in a theater near you with all of your friends!! Review by Raven Devanney, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic (14)
B000067CPX|5.0|there is not one song on here that needs to be \\"skipped.\\" I can listen to this cd over and over again in full and be perfectly content. I was a casual Chili Peppers fan until I was introduced to the song \\"Dosed.\\" I liked the tune so much that I remembered to buy the album next time I went to a store. The first time I listened to this, there was no doubt that it would quickly turn into a favorite. Try listening at, least once in a quiet environment alone as there are so many intricate parts of these tunes not to be missed. enjoy!
B00144VBBS|5.0|This was my first Toby Keith CD- and it was a great choice!  The music mix is perfect. It includes familiar arrangements and some variations to standards that are very pleasing.  Nice music for anytime and most audiences.  The songs appear to reflect most of Toby Keith's career which makes them timeless for fans.
B007A4SDCG|2.0|The book starts out promising, but about 1/3 of the way through, Pressfield completely loses it. He goes on a bizarre diatribe about \\"Fundamentalism\\" (which he fails to define, although he labels Jews, Muslims, and Christians \\"Fundamentalists\\"). He continues his dive into inanity by stating that \\"[f]undamentalism and art are mutually exclusive.\\" He makes no mention of Handel or Michelangelo, who happened to be both great artists and Christian \\"Fundamentalists.\\"<br /><br />Immediately after vociferously criticizing the ambiguous \\"Fundamentalists\\", Pressfield begins the next chapter with an absurd display of hypocrisy by saying, \\"If you find yourself criticizing other people, you're probably doing it out of Resistance.\\"<br /><br />If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time. The jist of the book is that people don't get things done because they make excuses and find distractions. He calls this trait of human nature \\"Resistance\\" and treats it as if it's a dark force permeating the cosmos. He even blames \\"Resistance\\" for crime, poverty, and disease. There is little practical application but a lot of metaphysical victimhood.<br /><br />It's works like this that make me thankful that Amazon allows Kindle books to be returned.
0307951529|5.0|The story of how I started the Grammar Girl podcast (which led to founding the Quick and Dirty Tips podcasting network) is featured in the book. Since the section is very short, Chris had to pick the one thing about my experience to highlight, and I think he showed great insight by choosing the often overlooked detail that Grammar Girl was my *second* attempt at podcasting. It's important to recognize a failure (even if it seems like things are going well on some levels), not to give up when you fail, and to recognize that most people have multiple passions. That's what's great about Chris--he finds the hidden gems in people's stories and highlights them in his books.
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|I did not know what to expect form this movie. Especially since I didn't know much beyond the basics about Mr. Chaplin. I was taken off guard by how much I enjoyed this movie. The writing, directing, and acting were absolutely terrific. I am glad I took the time to watch this movie and recommend it to anyone.
B007DJUO8O|1.0|This album reminds of the line on the back of Type O Negative's album Bloody Kisses that states, \\"Don't mistake lack of talent for genius.\\"<br /><br />If this music was put out by some no name artist that we had never heard of we would not even give it a second listen.  Instead this will be considered genius for no reason other than Wilson and Åkerfeldt's previous releases which does include some brilliant music.  On its own this is a really boring, bland album that just about anyone could create because there is so little to it.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|let's see, i have to write at least 20 words on this movie, i got it for a good price. shipped quick. love this movie and all the twilight movies and soundtracks. i'm a fan. didn't think i was gonna be, i thought it was for teeny boppers. but i was fooled. i loved it as much as any young girl.
0345803485|1.0|Like many others, I heard of this book from a book club and was intrigued to read it... I am so angry with myself for paying and actually reading this trite excuse for a novel.<br /><br />Characters are not well developed, nothing like able at all. Ana especially bothered me. And the fact that she orgasms the first and every time she has sex, while he finishes at the same time... Please!!<br /><br />Has the author ever had sex? Or is she purely writing a fantasy about what she wished she had in the bedroom... Yes I sound petty, but this book is absolute garbage. Spare yourself.

B007C4ZJ3K|4.0|Overlooked classic action spy film in the Vein of Bourne Identity. Fight scenes are awesome with out being over the top (see the transporter movies) and the story is quite good. Love to see a sequel but I'm afraid it won't happen due to box office.
0545259088|4.0|Even though the action and beautiful poetry was still here, I found Forever to be completely different from Shiver, which I thought was amazing in every way. Perhaps it was the distracting voices of Cole and Isabel, but I found myself distanced from the story.<br /><br />There were some scenes in the story that didn't seem relevant or were just added in to pass time. I found this to be true in the scene with the raccoons in the garage. Unfortunately, I never did connect much with Cole, so the descriptions of his flashbacks and memories were annoying. I felt like the romance between Isabel and Cole was forced and I honestly could care less for their relationship. What I really wanted to read about was Grace and Sam. I felt that too much time was focused on Cole and Isabel and their constant like/dislike of each other.<br /><br />Something else that also bothered me was when Grace tells Sam on page 154: \\"Just clarifying....I mean, instead of living in sin\\". That forced me to stop reading because it was so out of character for Grace to say such a thing. There were no signs in the earlier two books that Grace holds those values. I'm not saying it's wrong, but it just surprised me and distracted me from the story.<br /><br />There was a lot of death in this book, and it made the story much more dark and ominous. I've noticed that a lot of people really disliked the ending, but to me it had the promise of hope and a new beginning. Personally, I dislike it when a book tries to solve all the problems at the end, but I didn't find that to be true with this one. It's extremely hard to write an ending, and in my opinion it's perhaps the hardest thing to do. I think Maggie Stiefvater pulled it off well.<br /><br />Even though I wanted to love this book, I found myself put off by the constant voices of Cole and Isabel. I can see why other people like them, but I was never won over by them. In the end, I wasn't sure whether they really liked each other or really hated each other. With Grace and Sam, that unmistakeable bond of love and affection is there. That's what made me love this story in the first place. To have the attention put on Cole and Isabel was quite disappointing to me.<br /><br />Overall, though, it was a good conclusion to a unique series. 3.5 stars, which rounds to 4 stars.With Grace and Sam, that unmistakeable bond of love and affection is there.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Ive enjoyed each of these books! I'm usually not one for science fiction but this one struck me as very plausible.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Just once, I would like this author to finish writing a book.  This story just keeps getting longer and longer.  Don't get me wrong, I like serial books.  I enjoy catching up with my favorite characters in new and exciting novels.  What I don't appreciate is the neverending, cliff-hanger \\"endings\\" in these books.  It wouldn't be so bad if the next novel was available within a reasonable amount of time, but to wait 2-5 YEARS for a followup book, after leaving so many dangling storylines, is a bit much to ask.  George, this may well be the last of your books that I read.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|This is book has a good plot, but some of the details really ruin the story. The names are a joke. I mean who is actually named America or Brazil. Also, the characters act like they are in high school instead of college. I don't really understand what the driving force behind some of the relatively flat characters is nor do I see a point in some of the drama. Can't we have meaningful drama??? The writing is not always fluid and descriptive either. I would recommend this book if you love the premise but the writing itself isn't as good as possible. All in all, it's a decent read and an acceptable way to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very fun. there are dome challenging parts, but I would most likely recommend this to my friends

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I've had the PX21's for at least 8 months, but encountered some problems recently. It started with me picking up my headphones as I do everyday and watching them crack before my eyes on the ear piece. I did what every other gamer would do, got some duct tape and put it back together. Well it wasn't but one more week that the other side broke... Brought the duct tape back in and fixed them up. Well they were uncomfortable but they last another 2 weeks until I lost the sound from one ear. Playing deaf in a battlefield isn't my thing so I cut up the headphones and kept the wires to the ps3 but threw away the rest. Now they're resting in peace somewhere in a Texas dump.<br /><br />In a nutshell<br />-Great investment (6-8 months durability)<br />-Great advantage on MW3,MW2, BF3<br />-Poor structure<br /><br />If you want a pair of headphones that won't break in 6-8 months but have comparable sound quality, it's time to start saving for Tritton's or even Astros for you MLGs.<br /><br />***Side note: If you have a child under the age of 16, I strongly urge you not to buy these as people are not kind online and love swearing. Shooting games are rated: M for a reason :)
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really loved it I wasn't sure it will be very thick and good material with its cheap price but I was so wrong, it really protect all the equipments and lots of space to insert everything, I even can hang my tripod or pur my ipad.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Love, love, love!!!!!! I love this book! It's full of angst and right up my alley! It's back and forth and up and down and has twists I didn't see coming. I love how each character is developed and how they work together. I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I love the case! It looks great, it is easy to use and I especially like the multiple layout positions so I can prop it up to read, watch videos or play games, or I can slant it all the way for a comfortable typing position.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|[[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]  Wow, this is one scary story.  Scary because it is so realistic, so possible at this time in history.  A whole city living vertically, over 100 floors deep, and no elevators.  People who have lived this way for generations; have never known anything different.  They can see a \\"real\\" city skyline in the distance as it rusts and disolves away due to the toxic and acidic atmosphere outside.  And one Sheriff with deputies every 30 or so floors.  The ultimate punishment is having to go outside and \\"clean the lenses\\" of the cameras that monitor the outside world, and never be let back inside.  I won't give away part 5 of this omnibus as it is a surprise ending.  I'm looking forward to reading part 6!  I highly recommend this book and this series.
0439023483|3.0|I'm late to this particular game, given as how I've only just now read the book, but I managed to avoid all of the hype and chatter that apparently accompanied both the book release and the movie release, and I was able to read the book without any preconceived notions.<br /><br />In short, this book is based on an intriguing premise, but never moves beyond being mildly entertaining on the most basic level. It is a very quick and light read, but that's not exactly the best approach to take to a theme which should be filled with moral ambiguities, gut-wrenching decisions (both literal and figurative), as well as social, political and philosophical challenges. If nothing else, the main characters could have been shown to struggle with these issues on a personal level, even if the author wanted to avoid having the book be too dense for younger readers. Instead, all of the complex tension which is hinted at in the beginning is deflated when the plot twists in every direction to avoid dealing with tough issues. For example, [SPOILER ALERT] when Katniss is forced into a gladiator's arena and is faced with killing both an endearing friend/love interest (Peeta) AND a young girl (Rue) that she takes under her wing, the reader is anticipating some genuinely thoughtful drama and character development; disappointingly, the author takes the easy way out by having Rue killed by a different tribute (in a barely plausible setting), and THEN having a bogus \\"rule change\\" occur in the middle of the games. Apologists will point out that the \\"rule change\\" was later rescinded, and yet it isn't realistic that Katniss and Peeta would have fought each other to the death as the last two contestants, whereas she may have let him die earlier in the games.<br /><br />Ultimately, a braver plot would have made this a better book, but wouldn't have overcome the two-dimensional functionality of most characters in the book, nor the lack of artistry in the style of writing. Also disappointing was howpoorly the book was proofread and copyedited (at times I felt like I was reading a Yahoo News article). While three starts seems a wee bit generous, two stars would be unfair, so I went ahead and rounded up.

B005HJWWW8|1.0|The product starts off fine as in it does fairly good amplification.. its light weight but has Piss poor battery life. This thing is nothing but some Chinese made garbage that made its way into my garbage can after a few months of use. The input and output are crappy metal that would cause my headphones to be scratchy and pop in and out. This is a big waste of 30 bucks. People make it sound like its a great deal and bang for your buck but its trash.. quite possibly the worse product I have ever bought off amazon in terms of quality. A product that couldn't even provide a hundred hours of reliability. My faith in this company has just took a swan dive. Maybe if you want to buy an e 11 or something. Perhaps that may be a crap. Buy the e6 is unquestionably junk. A p.o.s. boostaroo I bought from radio shack game me better life than this thing. If its of any relevance I have used four pairs of headphones with my (in the trash) e6.. klipsch earbuds grado s80 senn 428 and audio technica m45. Maybe I should have taken some money I bought headphones with and bought a better amp.. a big failure
B0058VW36U|4.0|Cut the Rope is a modern game in which you feed OmNom. This game has great mechanics and is worth the 99 cents. It has many levels to entertain your bored mind. This game deserves to be recognized by having the most purchases.

B006ZDU7QI|1.0|Maybe this is a little premature, .... (some albums have to grow on you)..., but after listening to all the samples, the only song i like,...(actually love)... is \\"Somebody i used to know\\", it actually could go down as my favorite pop song for 2012!!!!! Not to mention there's a ton of excellent covers of that song on You Tube. Sorry to say, but the rest of the album sounds like filler surrounding that one song.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So many features! So many downloadable  versions of the Bible! I still haven't used all the features! So complete. Thank you so much.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Was a very enjoyable read. Can't wait to go on to Book Three and see how everything unfolds. This was a lot more interesting than book one but I found book one for comical at times because of Ana innocent.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is wonderful!  I had tried several Bibles for my new tablet, but either they didn't work or I couldn't search verses etc.  I love this one!  And it has so many options... languages, versions... Well done!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased the book to see what the hype was about. I can honestly say I really did enjoy it. It shouldn't be labeled erotic because it really wasn't. I have read books way more erotic than this. Anyway, its a good read. Just finished book two. Will likely purchase book three later.
0345803485|5.0|I love these books!!  I was a little hesitant to start this trilogy of books because the reviews from readers were mixed.  But after seeing the books discussed on several TV showes I decided I would start with Fifty Shades of Gray and decide for myself.  I am glad I did.  So many of the reviews I have read and the TV shows I have seen talk about this book as the relationship sex cure.  I did not see the book in that light.  To me this was a beautiful love story.  I had a hard time putting the book down and found myself reading as fast as possible to see what happened next.  Christian Grey is a controlling complex man you love one minute and hate the next and Anastasia Steel is innocent and demure and has a inner strength she did not know exhisted. I found myself at times teary hearing about Christians early child hood I know this is a fictional character but unfortunately there are children in this world that truely live it.  I also found myself cheering at times when Anastasia stood up to Christian's control and held her ground.  It is a great story of how love can heal a heart and can change a person profoundly.  Now that I know how this series ends I plan to restart the books reading a little slower.  I recommend this series to any hopeless romantic!!!
B007Z9RAX4|4.0|Gina did a much, much better job than the reviews here would have you believe.  For someone that spends her time training in the gym as opposed to acting classes, I thought she was very believable and she came across as the real deal.  I would give it 3 stars.  However, I'm giving it 4 stars in order to help offset what I feel is an unfair 2 star rating.  If you enjoy and are looking for a movie with good fight scenes, you should be pleasantly surprised.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This game was great but just crapped out on me like it did with the timer on everyone else. For the second time. I give up.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|replaying since it froze. game is fun but freezes often and totally went belly up on level 37. the door kept collapsing over and over
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Puss in Boots was good fun and clean watching for the whole family. I enjoyed the message, it is good to see forgiveness presented in a fun manner. This is a movie that a child can watch more than once and get something out of it every time. Owning this move and watching it with the family gives parents the opportunity for communication. With the ease of obtaining these products through Amazon, it can't get any better than that. No long lines, no hassle.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Let me preface this that I'm am a 71 year old Rhodesian and a South African but the movie bought tears to my eyes.  I LOVED IT.  I wish he would have read Nelson's written note...I am the captain of my fate...but for me, growing up with Rugby as my sport and southern Africa as where my heart strings are attached...I just loved the movie.  Of course the master craftsman, Morgan Freeman played Nelson to a T...what a great portrayal. But I also believe that Matt Damon's Pienaar was well done as well...they both went to the characters they were to play and sat with them, talked to them, drank them in and mimicked them reflective of their pride in the craft of acting.  Add to that the eye for detail and surround of Clint Eastwood...to me the film gave an authenticity to the times, the conflict, the confusion and yet also, the desire to be seen as a country of stature, moving forward.  I would recommend it to a fan of history and a fan of the human spirit.  Be sure to explore the behind the scenes sections of the CD...and maybe even first..so you are in the spirit of the times.  You will appreciate the movie more.
B001Q2U5B0|5.0|Well, this is certainly not your average movie for a Friday evening date. \\"The butterfly effect\\" is a dark, difficult and very shocking movie, full of sadness and suffering. DO NOT BELIEVE the regular press reviews! Watch it and make up your mind. You can love it (like me) or hate it, but believe me you will not be bored - and you will NOT forget it easily.<br /><br />I find it rather hard to believe that somebody dared to make not one but two sequels of this film! \\"Butterfly effect\\" is THE movie with conclusion. It goes full circle and ends the story without any ambiguity. This is probably one of the reasons that both sequels were so bad.<br /><br />This movie is mostly a one boy/one girl show. Ashton Kutcher may not be the greatest of actors, but in this film he is very good! And I really would like to see Amy Smart in more movies - why isn't she playing more? She is so beautiful and talented! Other actors are quite unknown, but still they perform well in supporting the two main protagonists.<br /><br />I will not reveal anything about the plot, except that at the end you will be surprised, shocked and HURT - and you will find the exact and clear answer to the question which is the title of this review...

B002ZG98LO|2.0|This movie was a let down for me. I love predator and predator 2, but this should have never been made. Horrible story with characters you don't care if they live or die. The biggest problem in this movie is that they ruined the actual predators. They aren't cool in this film. I know that sounds silly, but seriously, this movie makes them out to be wanna be tribal hunters or something. They're supposed to be technologically advanced hunters. The movie was just random and had no direction. There are a few twists, which were completely unnecessary. I'm not a judgmental or uptight movie watcher, but I have to admit, this movie was horrible.

081297381X|3.0|Other reviews are more studied and 'expert'.  I'm just an ordinary person who enjoys reading about ideas.  For over a year, I'd been reading economics out of curiosity and had finally come to the opinion that the 'discipline' was a croc, it's practitioners dangerous.  It was nice to have someone more intelligent and better educated than me confirm my attitude.<br /><br />I got over the author's overweening hubris (he does over-French the French).  After many chapters, I just chuckled at what seemed exaggerated self-opinion, made the reading of the book a sort of a Zen experience of observation rather than of judgment, and enjoyed the book for the narrative entertainment and as confirmation of the point of spiritual teachers about not living today based on yesterday's experience.<br /><br />But by the end of the book, though, I wasn't so sure that hubris and ego en grande were applicable.  Because he's right - besides confirmation of my newly born suspicions, I learned new things from this book.  I happen to be a slow walker.  I wouldn't mind a long, slow walk with Taleb.

B005LAIGZU|1.0|I really wanted to like this film. But obviously aside from the lousy acting. The writer or producer of this<br />film did not do his homework. He makes the Philippines and Filipinos as the number one terrorists in the<br />world! If he did some research he would find the Philippines is the \\"Biggest\\" Catholic country in Asia! He<br />probably thinks Malaysia, Indonesia, and even Pakistan are the biggest Chirstian countries in the world! Wow! It<br />is like talking about jihadist eskimos!! Why do you think Pope John Paul visited the Philippines and<br />not Indonesia in Asia? Go figure!! Well, duh! In the film the SEALS are attacking a village with Filipino muslim terrorists and<br />one dude says they are beside the \\"Church\\"?! What the. . . ! I thought churches are for Christians?! The writer must be on crack!<br />How can you also tell a Filipino from a Malaysian, Indonesian, even a Mexican from hundreds of meters away. And<br />a black dude is sure they are Filipinos?! What is this producers problem? Wow! Sure! Very realistic! Sure the Philippines has it's problems with terrorists just like England, France, and the rest of the world! But that does not mean they are predominately muslim too! The Philippines is predominately CHRISTIAN and proud of it! I can't hardly wait for the sequel with jihadist eskimos! Don't believe me? Google or Wikipedia everything I said. The writer could have done that first! Dumb Film!

B001A4LYN2|5.0|I watched this movie on AMC not too long ago from start to finish because of the reviews the movie got when it was released, and I will say this is much different than any movie I think I've ever seen, and I consider myself to be a movie buff. I will explain what the movie is about because if you haven't seen it and don't know what it is about like I was originally than hopefully this review will encourage you to watch it.<br /><br />The film starts out with a man named Daniel Plainview mining for silver in the late 1890's, and he uses the minerals to start his own oil business. The story jumps ahead several years, so six years later he now is moderately wealthy and successfully starts an oil well, but a young father is killed in an accident and Plainview takes in his infant son that we later discover he uses to get more deals.<br /><br />Plainview is then introduced to a young man named Paul Sunday who tells him about his ranch in California that has oil, and Daniel sets out and discovers he could potentially make a fortune and swindles the Sunday family out of their land, but Paul's twin brother Eli is wise to Plainview's plans and infuriates Daniel. Eli himself is some sort of amateur Evangelical preacher who wants money to fund his own church.<br /><br />When Plainview sets up his oil field he becomes very greedy and eventually begins to push away everyone around him, and he becomes a sad individual.<br /><br />The ending is very intense and if you decide to see this film you won't be disappointed because there is a lot to be impressed by.<br /><br />-The acting from Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano is simply incredible, Day Lewis was beyond deserving of his Oscar win.<br />-There is gorgeous cinematography in this film.<br />-The soundtrack is very eerie and yet strangely effective.<br /><br />This movie is basically an actor's movie, lots of dialog and drama, so if you like those types of movies then by all means watch this film.

1936891026|4.0|I felt a little stuck on the problem. I knew the next steps were entirely psychological, so I looked for a book not necessarily on technique, but more oriented toward inspiration and understanding. Reaching out to my artist community, this book sat atop the pile of suggestions. Here's what I discovered?<br /><br />In the War of Art, Pressfield breaks his subject into three books: Resistance, Combating Resistance, and Beyond Resistance. Book One presents and personifies the concept of resistance as an unseen force that prevents the artist from moving forward. He firmly lays out the difference between how the professional and the amateur deal with this force called resistance. The final section talks about spiritual forces, \\"angels and muses\\", which use humanity as vessels for art.<br /><br />The book is written pragmatically enough to allow your own labeling of this force called \\"resistance\\". Pressfield definitely feels this is an antagonistic entity and that we must take action to combat it.<br />Let me share an excerpt that clearly defines Pressfield's feelings: \\"Resistance's goal is not to wound or disable. Resistance aims to kill. Its target is the epicenter of our being: our genius, our soul, the unique and priceless gift we were put on earth to give and that no one else has but us. Resistance means business. When we fight it, we are in a war to the death.\\"<br />Anyone who is trying to tap into the inspiration they sense burning somewhere inside - to create any kind of art - will benefit from this read. It's not a simple self-help or how-to book. It's an examination of the human mind and the quest for fulfillment that we all feel.<br /><br />The powerful message that I took out of Pressfield's book was that of viewing yourself as a pro. You have the right, the privilege, and the ability to accomplish what you dream of; so stop giving yourself excuses. His point is that once you change how you view yourself, the universe will open doors to what you are truly meant to do. And this, my friends, is something that I truly believe. Reading this book helped me realize that was exactly what I was doing. I wasn't allowing myself to feel legitimate. Once I altered that thought process, my whole universe started changing. Soon I discovered that along with it came the confidence I was lacking.<br />Seven thumbs up from me!

B004LROMSO|4.0|If you have any interest in the tales of King Arthur, it is hard to ignore the wonderful BBC series Merlin.  It is also hard to avoid comparing Merlin with Camelot, but the two series could not be more different.  Where Merlin is a Smallville version of the King Arthur tale, Camelot is a darker, non-humorous take on the ascent of the young king.  In Camelot, Arthur is a bit of a lay about, not really going anywhere in life, until he finds out he is actually the son of the dying king.  He isn't ready (who would be?) but he must rise to the occasion.  He is ably assisted by the wizard Merlin, played so well by Joseph Fiennes.  Arthur himself is played for the obvious teen heartthrob vibe, but he starts to grow on you as he himself grows.  The skeleton of the story is familiar, as it must be, but there are sufficient twists to keep you interested.<br /><br />Now, the only downside to this version is its network.  Since this is running on Starz, rather than network or basic cable, there is an imperative to throw in irrelevant nudity and gore.  It would be improved by an adult presence in the production staff reining in the \\"edginess\\" just to make it suitable for premium cable.  Nevertheless, it is still very worth you time.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I'm not a fan of this app honestly at all. I don't like that there is really no way to log out of your email. I've searched different forums and internet searched it as well and it seems to be an android app issue and not an Amazon issue.<br /><br />I don't like the fact that you can't view deleted or spam folders either. I was fine with only viewing 10 or so messages, that part wasn't an issue but the biggest issue was not having a log out option.<br /><br />Uninstalled app.

0345803485|5.0|I totally disagree with those who do not like this book. I found Christian to be a very sweet, sensitive (SEXY HOT) man who while having a dark past, struggles daily with his issues while truly putting Ana's feelings first.  Ana, as innocent and young as she is, accepts the fact she is totally in love with a complicated man.  Their romance is sexy and fun.<br />Yes, at times the author is a little repetitious but I take into consideration the fact that this is her FIRST book and quite honestly, I think she did a great job.  I've read all 3 books and will read them again and again.
B000FC12C8|5.0|This is a very good book.  I would recommend it for any individual investors, especially those who want to start making his own investment decisions and enjoy learning and gaining experience.
0345803485|4.0|When I read a book, if it makes me forget my worries and woes for awhile, it's worth my time. I found this series fascinating. Improbable? Of course it is! A couple of British terms slipped in? Okay. Holy crap though, counting repeats of phrases and words. I agree some can get tiresome, however, the facial expressions of Chritian were Ana's barometer for his mood. Another way I judge a good read, do I go back and re-read parts? This series was definitely a repeater! Not because of the sex either! I found Christian's journey towards normal to be so moving. Why do people have to tear apart every paragraph? Can't you look at it like I did? The power of Christian and Ana's love was able to overcome obstacles he couldn't hurdle in 28 years. I have love like that in my life - maybe that's why I just enjoy the ride.

0345529057|2.0|Ask yourself, do you read fiction for entertainment and enjoyment or do you like to be angry, and depressed? There are some people out there who are probably evil themselves and get off on watching or reading perverse, evil, and disgusting acts, I recall when I was 18 watching Faces of Death with a friend and he brought over other \\"questionable,\\" friends who laughed at some of the scenes, I was shocked and couldn't stay, I had to leave, well as I was reading the first book very immoral vile things were happening to good characters that screamed for justice which never came, If you laugh and enjoy Faces of Death, Texas Chain saw Massacre, and Clockwork Orange, for example, but in a Fantasy world, boy this series is for you. Pedophilia, Incest, Murder, Scheming, Lying, Adultery, Treason, Rape, violence towards women and children, torture, all in graphic detail that I really could have done without, by the way I've grown to hate this author, The best character in the story dies with no justice being done, everyone (almost) has a lust for power and these characters get ahead, while the honorable, moral ones dies or suffers severely. Good characters that are having a tough time in a story is okay, that's drama, that's expected, but not death and story evolves around evil or petty characters. I give it 2 stars only because the author is talented, knows how to hook you into the story and is character driven, I read books 1 and 2 and I just couldn't finish, I heard 3 is even worse and 4 and 5 even more worse, why torture myself, I'm going to go back and read Conan, Robin Hood, Le Morte D'Arthur, Lankhmar series, Lord of the Rings ect. They entertain and have justice, If I want to be depressed, angry, pissed I can read Non-Fiction, there is plenty of it. Hope this helps someone not by this series, if you insist just by 1 book at a time you might not like it, and make it used, no need giving this author more money then he already has made.

B00756GKBA|1.0|I have to say I own all of Madonna's album and buying her deluxe packages was always a treat due to the always innovative design.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I don't usually write reviews. In fact this is the first one I've written, but the bottom line is the book deserves it. I have read a lot of discount books for my Kindle, and for the most part have been disappointed; which is why I took to the time to recommend this book. It's mature, well written and has some great under currents and plot twists. I have lost sleep to finish it and consider it time well spent. The characters are flawed but interesting, the action is well written and more then skin deep, and the world building is pretty flawless. Best $1.50 I've spent in a while.

1401937519|5.0|nita's book is inspirational. I have been on a path to become more & more unconditionally loving as a result of finding Greg Baer & his great book 'Real love in marriage'. He did not die to find out that unconditional love is the most important thing in life but he nearly killed himself in misery before he gradually found out how to be happy for himself & many other people.He learnt to become unconditionally loving.<br />I was very unhappy & now am much happier, more loving & more fearless in relationship to life. Anita's experience really added to this. She says what he says & it makes so much sense. As I gradually peel off who I'm not I'm getting closer & closer to who I actually am beneath my crappy conditioning. We all get caught in the illusion that money is so important, that struggle is normal but life really doesn't have to be that way. Anita relates getting cancer to having lived a fear based life. After her NDE which surrounded her in unconditional love she realised that death was no longer anything to fear so though she choose to come back she knew she was fine whether she lived or died.She choose to come back & live life fearlessly in a state of love. We don't have to die to find this out we can make the decision to live that way right here right now & that can bring any of us happiness. When we break it right down what most of us fear most is not being loved & dying. We need to really be truly connected to ourselves & each other as well as everything around us. From this state of 'being' in the present we can really be who we are. There is no fear.Anita points out that beating ourselves up is very harmful. We need to be accepting & loving to ourselves & this is so true. It is not always easy when we have had little love growing up, but it is our natural state. We need to unlearn & relearn to be love.<br />I love her views on cancer which she believes is caused by fear. I totally agree to that the medical hype & fear inducing testing makes that even worse. It just brings money to drug companies.Our bodies have an ability to heal themselves of anything given the right conditions, which basically means love & trust. If we are meant to die maybe that's OK to as it sounds like we have nothing to fear.<br />Anita you are an inspiration to me. Thank you for having the courage to tell it like it is & change this world of fear to one of love.I highly recommend reading your book.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|Its not often a book leaves cringing. The thing that i most dislike about this book, are the reactions of the characters. most noteworthy, the hero 'gasps'. This doesnt fit in with the dominant alpha image. The heroine blushing, tripping over, bumbling, totally breaking down because the hero doesnt kiss her. The heroine notices there is a pattern on the heros coffee and wonders how they do that..... What the? Im not slipping into this book comfortably, and I dont understand how it could be getting 5 stars.
B000001ELR|4.0|Creatures Of The Night was the album that Kiss were supposed to release after the poppy Unmasked album of 1980. Fans were turned off by the musical direction the band decided to take, starting with the disco leanings of 1979's Dynasty and culminating with Unmasked. Kiss promised their loyal but shrinking fanbase that the next album would be their heaviest yet. Enter producer Bob Ezrin. His judgement clouded by extravagant cocaine use, Ezrin suggested the band make a concept album. Guitarist/singer Paul Stanley and singer/bassist Gene Simmons agreed with the idea, but guitarist Ace Frehley and new recruit, drummer Eric Carr balked at the idea. The concept album was recorded, and 1981's Music From \\"The Elder\\" was released. Response from the fans was underwhelming at best. But if it weren't for this album, Kiss might not have been tempted to record their heaviest album to date.<br /><br />Released in 1982, Creatures Of The Night sold better than the previous album, but the damage to Kiss' reputation had already been done. This is unfortunate, because this was the album where Kiss had something to prove, and prove themselves they did. As mentioned in the title, the powerhouse that is drummer Eric Carr finally gets his due; he is the first thing you hear exploding out of the gate with the title track. Producer for this album Michael James Jackson gave Kiss the proper 80's sound that was sorely lacking with the previous album. With The Elder, that album sounded like it was a demo recorded on practice equipment in a garage. The Creatures album, by contrast, sounds like it was recorded in a large arena with depth charges for drums and pyrotechnics for guitars. The picture I'm trying to paint here is this album is HEAVY.<br /><br />Original guitarist Ace Frehley had departed the band after The Elder, but appeared on the album cover for Creatures. Taking his place are studio guitarists as diverse as future Kiss member Vinnie Vincent and Mr. Mister guitarist Steve Farris. It quickly becomes a guessing game trying to figure out who played what on this album (the band themselves don't even seem to know for sure), but it's irrelevant to the goodness of this album. Opening track \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" features manic drumming from Carr, machine gun guitar riffing, and an outstanding vocal performance by Paul Stanley. \\"Keep Me Comin'\\", another Stanley track, is a sleazy mid-tempo rocker. Gene Simmons' \\"I Love It Loud\\", the single from the album, starts off with what I presume to be Carr's drums, though it could be recorded cannon fire. This song is the designated anthem of the album, somewhat reminiscent of \\"All Hell's Breakin' Loose\\" from 1983's Lick It Up. The ballad, \\"I Still Love You\\"  features a rare bass guitar performance by Carr, and an emotional guitar solo from blues great Robben Ford. The album ends with \\"War Machine\\", the guitar riff of which predates Stone Temple Pilots' \\"Sex Type Thing\\" by a decade.<br /><br />So, if you've made up your mind that you're in the market for a Kiss album, this is a great one to get. It is my favorite, anyway. Fans of '70's Kiss might want to preview this one, as the production on Creatures is about as '80's as it could possibly get. Ace Frehley purists beware, the only Ace you get with this album is the cover. Fans of Kiss' later stuff, such as albums like Asylum or Crazy Nights, will be in for a delightful surprise here. Any fan of '80's hard rock should own a copy of this album, alongside Y&T's Black Tiger, Ratt's Out Of The Cellar, and Judas Priest's British Steel, just to name a few personal favorites. Overall, a hidden gem of '80's hard rock and metal, and an absolute highlight in Kiss' catalog. 4 stars
B0013O123Q|1.0|This has got to be one of the poorest piece of film making I have ever seen. Not that I saw the whole thing, I didn't need to. The essence of the film is gratuitous violence and sex. I rented this simply because it was \\"recommended\\" by Amazon's upselling and because some others rated it well. I thought I would be open-minded and watch it as I have with some other foreign films. The camera just continues to move in a dizzying fashion the whole time and the sound track does the same. This is presumably supposed to disorient us, possibly in an attempt to cover up the lack of true creativity in this film. Plot? First man loves a woman; woman gets raped by a second, morally repugnant man; first man seeks out second man and first man's friend smashes second man's face in with a fire extinguisher. I have honestly seen productions by high school students that are better than this especially in terms of cinematography. Moving a camera back and forth and showing glimpses of signs, walls on an angle, etc. does NOT make good art! This reminds me of one of those art exhibits where the artist has some \\"abstract\\" showing that makes sense to absolutely no one with an ounce of reasoning but you invariably get some individuals there who gush for it; because it is simply different. I could literally walk down some really bad parts of certain cities, while drunk and see this type of material (and I have).  The big question is why would I ever want to? If you are looking for a film which will make you think or entertain you, or demonstrate some some artistic avenue you have not explored then look elsewhere. If you think gratuitous violence and sex mashed together is an art form... well then you and I are clearly on different planes of existence so have at it.

B0059XTV4Y|3.0|Wallis (\\"Wally\\") Winthrop (Abbie Cornish) of New York City, is stuck in a loveless marriage to a philandering doctor.  She's obsessed with the story of Wallis Simpson and Edward VII  (called \\"W.E.\\") and wonders what it was like to be so loved that a man would give up his crown for you.  The movie jumps between the lives of the two Wallises following the royal romance and the end of Wally's marriage.<br /><br />Visually, there's a lot to like:  The sets are elaborate, the costumes elegant, and the 30s period is reproduced in lovely detail.  The movie falls flat, however, for several reasons:  The story jumps so quickly and randomly between the past and present that it's chaotic (and too much like \\"Julie and Julia\\") and there's no real connection between the two stories.  None of the leading characters is likable, the royals being spoiled and self-centered and the NYC folks being relentlessly dreary.  No new insights are given to the famous W.E. union and neither the royal story nor the modern story is developed in depth.  None of the actors who play royals look much like their counterparts and, worst of all, the movie is just too grim.<br /><br />Director Madonna wanted to make a story about Wallis and Edward, but when she added the modern day Wallis' story, she watered down both and made neither interesting.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had huge doubts when I was ordering. I had even ordered a back-up book because I thought this just wouldn't be my kind of series. Started reading and absolutely loved it. I suggest reading it at the same time as someone you know because it inspires discussion and debate. Note to the author: the FAQ you included at the end inspired me to actually write a review, and I am about Togo purchase something else by you because I really enjoyed your sense of humor. Well done!

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you were to combine all the MMOGs ever created, assigned a \\"planet\\" for each one of these games then included all the planets in our solar system and then threw in second life and all sorts of social networking and then squared it... it would give you an idea of the science fiction in this book. The story is amazingly straightforward, the prose is simple and clear and concise.<br />There's just enough description and the pacing is excellent. This is by far one of my favorite books and I just finished it tonight, I started it 2 nights ago.<br />My other favorites are Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, War of the Flowers, The Name of the Wind, Wise Man's Fear, Lies of Locke Lamora, Game of Thrones, Peter F Hamilton's sci-fi series, Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, Hunger Games, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Harry Potter series, Meq series, Stars are Our Destination, Wool, Terry Brooks sci-fi and fantasy series, Wheel of Time series, Night Angel trilogy, Black Prism, Abercrombie's books, Sword of Truth, Harry Dresden and many others. I hope this gives you an idea of the books that I love.<br />This book is as good if not better than any I've ready before.<br />It won't be the same for you... my background is that I love MMOGs and I was exposed to the 80s. If you're in your late 30s early 40s and you liked to play computer games especially MMOGs then this book will appeal to you GREATLY.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Full disclosure here; I do judge books by their covers and quite often by their titles. I miss out on a lot of great reads this way, but the way I look at it is that there are more great reads in existence than I have existence left for anyway, so no great loss there. I've never read, for instance, [The Corrections] because it puts me in mind of pop quizzes and I won't read [Freedom] because of a George Michael video with spoiled super models and I have never read the [The Book Thief], until now, because I had plenty of those in my life already. Every friend, acquaintance and family member who 'borrowed' a book, in fact. Luckily I had some down time away from home and nothing with me but a kindle so I bought it because it was cheap (five bucks and well worth every penny) and I was bored.<br /><br />The book does have a lot of book thievery. It begins with a little girl stealing a book about burying the dead and ends with Death stealing a book about the life of little girl. I could kick myself for not reading it sooner. This book is allegedly for a young-adult audience but it reads more like literary fiction that high schoolers could enjoy as well.<br /><br />Zusak grabs the reader's attention immediately with his choice of narrator, Death, and he keeps it by making him very charming and really kind of funny. In Death's words this is a book \\"about, among other things: a girl, some words, an accordionist, some fanatical Germans, a Jewish fist fighter and quite a lot of thievery.\\" A simple story about what makes us human.<br /><br />The girl is Liesel Meminger, an orphan whose greatest joys and greatest sorrows in life come from words. The words used to label her father a communist, the rhetoric of Hitler, the words she flings like knives to wound someone who has hurt her and the words in the books she steals that help her cope with the horrors of Nazi Germany. Her foster father, the accordionist, teaches her to read using her first stolen book, The Grave Digger' Handbook, at the age of ten and from then on she's unstoppable. Whenever she's under stress she copes by stealing a book. While stealing gives her a sense of control over her life her true love is language and literature.<br /><br />There is so much to love about this book.<br /><br />Every character in the novel is so believable that you would recognize them instantly if they ever walked down your street. Papa, Hans Huberman, a decent man who keeps his promises regardless of the cost to himself, The great-hearted, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed Rosa Huberman, Max Vandenburg, the hidden Jew who gave Liesel two of her most precious books and most of all Liesel's best friend Rudy Steiner, a vivid, funny, life-loving boy who breaks Death's heart. Even the secondary characters are finely drawn.<br /><br />And then there is the irresistible prose. In Death's diary he notes of the aftermath of the bombing of Cologne: 'Five hundred souls. I carried them in my fingers, like suitcases. Or I'd throw them over my shoulder. It was only the children I carried in my arms.' And when Liesel finally kisses Rudy, who'd been in love with her for years: 'Liesel kissed her best friend, Rudy Steiner, soft and true on his lips. He tasted dusty and sweet. He tasted like regret in the shadows of trees...'<br /><br />Not least of all, of course, is

0061537969|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a lovely story about human nature as seen through the eyes of a dog.<br /><br />Enzo is different from other dogs. He is very smart and likes opposable thumbs on humans. Enzo educated himself by watching television. He also listens to his master, Denny Swift, who wants to be a professional race car driver.<br /><br />Enzo has learned a lot about life. He compares life to racing.<br /><br />Enzo thinks about his life on the night he dies. He recalled what Denny gave up and the death of Denny's beloved wife, Eve. Enzo also recalls the custody battle for Zoe, Denny's daughter. In the end, Enzo sees his own limitations yet still believes that Denny will become a racing champion with Zoe to support him.<br /><br />Having learned what it takes to be a compassionate and successful person, Enzo can barely wait until his next lifetime when he is sure he will return as a human.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|Erik Brynjolfsson's previous book \\"Wired for innovation\\" covered the role of IT in increasing productivity. In \\"Rage against the machine\\" Mr. Brynjolfsson covers the effect on future work as a result of the increased productivity gained. He deals with questions like What will we work with, how will we work and why should we work?<br /><br />My main takeaway is that the future for successful humans are the ability to collaborate and the importance of having the right process. Weak humans + machine + potent process beats superior human + machine + inferior process.<br /><br />Building upon Ray Kurzweil's \\"The Singularity is near\\" explaining the implications from the fact that computing power will become basically free in the future, it is almost already. I can recommend this book to anyone interested in the effects of digitalization and the future of work.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I chose to read this book because I am a huge Castle fan. I loved everything about this book. It is a fun, easy read that I think anybody would be able to get into. It's a fast paced book, where you don't have to wait hundreds of pages just for something exciting to happen. The twists and turns offer the suspense that I really enjoy in books. It makes you want to keep reading until the very end. I am now looking forward to reading all of the Nikki Heat books and can't wait till the next season of Castle starts up.

0930289234|5.0|I am not going to lie, I've never really read that many comics before, but I heard how amazing watchmen was and I saw the movie. After watching the movie I thought I should read the comic to really do the source material justice. I am glad I did, Watchmen is such and unusual comic for me because it deals with a vary mature subject of having superheros dealing with retirement and guilt about what they have done. It shows superheros as almost sad people who are thrown away by society and cannot take it anymore. I am glad I purchased this comic and am now very interested in reading Alan Moore's other works like V for Vendetta. If you have never read a comic before and enjoy a good read; then start with The Watchmen
B007C4ZJ3K|3.0|The movie was entertaining and not a typically bland action flick. The fighting sequences are pretty cool, however everything in between comes of confusing and just sort of thrown out there with very little explanation. Carano herself isn't that bad of an actor the way most MMA fighters who make a run at acting, i.e. Rampage Jackson and Tito Ortiz, come of as wooden and severely lacking in being able to convince anyone of anything. I certainly don't see an Oscar in her future, but she's not a bad action star in the same vein as Dwayne Johnson. Descent film, but get it at a reduced price.

B005LAIGLO|2.0|While I'm a fan of Mark Whalberg's it's obvious that this film was a pay day. I didn't turn it off, however the film was predictable and half assed. the typical, \\"I was the best at what I did but now I'm retired and now someone in my familie's in trouble so I have to get back into the game for one last job,\\" deal. And of course one of his best friends has set him up. As always, Giovanni Robisi is awesome, however even he can't really save the film. The actors themselves aren't the problem as much as this is obviously just a paycheck for Whalberg and everyone else is there to say they were along for the ride.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|awesome game, the only thing is you have to be online to play which is not always possible.  I would recommend this to my friends.
B007Z9RAX4|2.0|Given the amount of A-List talent in this film, it's surprising how bad it is.<br /><br />Contrary to what others have said, it's not Carano's acting ability that's at fault; she's not a stuper-star, but she was competent enough.<br /><br />It wasn't the music, either, though admittedly, it was pretty bad.<br /><br />No, it was the script's fault, primarily, followed by the directing. The film just didn't have much of a story to tell: at least, not one we hadn't already seen five hundred million times before. Character development was inadequate, too; Carano's character is a cipher.<br /><br />But the fight sequences were damn good. If only there had been more of them.

B005LAIGPU|2.0|One thing that always escapes me when it comes to this supposed found footage genre, which unfortunately has long grown stale, is how when the crap's about to hit the fan, the characters would rather turn their video camera in as opposed to running away. Yet, for some reason they seem to draw a lot of audiences. Look at the 83 minute exercise in audience trolling we got earlier this year, \\"The Devil Inside\\". Found footage? Check. Made a large impression at the box office? check.<br /><br />And so we have a movie yet again that sticks somclose to its found footage guns, Chronicle. The found footage genre makes its way to the superpower realm. A bunch of teenagers encounter a strange glowy green thing and auddenly have superpowers? Sounds like X-Men, doesn't it? Sadly it's nowhere near as fun, in fact, in the fun department, it's miles and miles behind.<br /><br />The film is taken from the video camera of Andrew (DeHaan, True Blood), a lonely, bored and abused teenager who lives with his dying mother and alcoholic, abusive father who beats him to a pulp on a regular basis. His only friend is his cousin, Matt (Russell, who could very well be Thomas Bangalter's long lost cousin). For some reason, Andrew feels the need to tape absolutely everything that goes on in life, and does so for the first twenty minutes on an old school over the shoulder camera.<br /><br />At a party one night, he and his cousin meet Steve, a character who unfortunately gets reduced to being the token black guy. They go into a hole where there's a green glowy rock and ta da, because of it, they have superpowers. Big whoop. They can perform telekinesis and stuff. Then Andrew gets pushed a tad too far, he can't control his powers, he loves being dark and evil, and blah, blah, blah. Oh and I'll note there several parts where Andrew plays with the camera using his powers.<br /><br />Like I said, this film is too found footage for my liking. First off, a good portion of the movie does a fail job at hiding the films heavy reliance on the gimmick.  A lot of shots show the camera being held by telekinesis and what not. There's a one scene I actually laughed out loud- it happens before Andrew's father visits him in the hospital, and the security guard tells him \\"the camera has to stay on\\". At that part, it was clear the movie lives and breathes the gimmick.<br /><br />It's a shame because the acting for the most part is well done. Dane DeHaan is exceptional in the role and he captures the essence of a poor teenager being driven to insanity and embracing his dark side. His performance really chilling- it's like a high school shooting, almost like you're inn he mind of the disturbed killer. Russell is great too as his cousin although at the end it's too he just wants Andrew off his freaking lawn. Steve is a decent actor as well.<br /><br />So what went wrong? What happened where i found the movie to be... Well, boring? Was I even supposed to care? Either way, this was one big headache of a movie and I certainly wouldn't be recommending it any time soon.ding the films heavy reliance on the gimmick.

1439102813|5.0|Alice Howland has a wonderful life.  She has three grown children, a loving hard-working husband, and she herself is a well established Professor at Harvard.  At age fifty, she is not really too surprised when she starts to forget where she left things like her keys and her Blackberry.  She is a little more concerned when she gets lost on the Harvard campus that she has always known very well, but a brief Google check regarding menopause brings up forgetfulness as one of the symptoms.  Still... it doesn't hurt to see a doctor...<br /><br />Alice is stunned when she is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's.  Certainly an active woman like herself, can beat this.  Yet what follows is a struggle of losing ones memories.... a family in despair and crisis, and a woman who is fighting the biggest battle of her life, just to be...<br /><br />still Alice.<br /><br />I didn't want to read this book.<br /><br />When my book club voted this as our May book club read, I was not thrilled.  There are few things that truly frighten me, but the thought of not knowing who you are, or fearing people you have known all your life as they have become strangers in your mind - truly frightens me.<br /><br />I read it... in one sitting.<br /><br />Author Lisa Genova wrote something wonderful here.  Brilliantly, the story is told from Alice's perspective.  Seeing Alzheimer's through her eyes was both frightening and informing.  I cringed when she introduces herself to the same woman twice, having forgotten she already had done so.  When she is lost inside her own home desperately looking for the bathroom, my heart breaks for her.<br /><br />Page by page as a reader, you are right there with Alice through good days and bad.  This fictional story flowed so well from the very start - moments of laughter and yes, moments of tears.... this book is a MUST READ.  If you are in a book club, it is an incredible discussion book as well, with questions in the back of the book.

In almost every case, the demo versions here are better than the overblown production numbers Phil Spector inflicted upon ATMP.

B007PS0X0W|4.0|I waited to see this movie because it was so short on running time that I could not feel good about paying the same price for movies at least 30 mins longer or more that are just as enjoyable on the big screen.  That is just the practical side of my ideas about spending my money on films.<br /><br />I can only hope that this \\"movie\\" which is only 1:22 not including the credits which are almost 10 minutes long with at least three different hairdressers listed in three different locations on the credits roll just for Ms. Beckinsale.  Whoa, that's a lot of hair manipulation for someone with a short hair style.  I wonder how many \\"Trinity\\" had with the change from greased down to short and scruffy?  And it's not just that, but it seems that there are literally three entire sets of credits from the Gaffers and Grips to the CGI & FX makeup teams.  I was also surprise that Ms. Beckinsale had not one dime of her own money into this project since the franchise has been a successful one.<br /><br />But now onto the movie itself...  WARNING WARNING - SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />As I said - I can only hope this is a long teaser for a new cycle of movies with or without Ms. Beckinsale.  She is starting to get along in years and playing an immortal character that does not age or get more \\"mature looking\\" has got to be considered if the stories are to continue as well if Scott Speedman is no longer going to be the other leading immortal character of Michael Corvinus (sp?)<br /><br />The story shows Selene getting blown apart from her man Michael by some sort of UV grenade by the mortal police forces in the beginning. We next see her frozen (tastefully not naked although very obviously nude in the container) with very well place fog and other obstacles, escaping with some help from a cyro-freezer after what turns out to be 12 years into a world without Lycans, and very few Vampires.  It's told that she (Selene) is labeled Patient #1 as it blares across the warning system.  And that she has \\"some sort of\\" special connection and link with patient #2. It's announced that both can each see through the eyes of the other.  Naturally we the audience thinks it is Michael who is patient #2.  But it's actually Selene's 12 year old daughter who is a human-hybrid mostly looking like Michael with the blue/black eyes and nearly black skin color change.  She's never been outside, never fed as a Vampire, etc.  But she knows she's Mom when she sees her and vice-versa.<br /><br />Those familiar with the first two movies which of the three are the only ones with Selene in them and time line is from the beginning of movie 1 thru the end of movie 2.  One long storyline which I thought worked very well.  I'm just trying to keep with Selene/Michael for this is long enough already.<br /><br />Here are just a few of the many things I have a problem with in this movie...<br />1) Vampires are \\"dead\\" beings, they cannot have children - yet Selene has a child during her 12 years of being captured and frozen.<br />2) Michael did \\"die\\" in the middle of movie 2 but Selene fed him blood that she had after being given the 100% \\"pure blood\\" of the first of both sides of the immortal creatures in this storyline \\"Grandpa\\"  Corvinus himself (such a nice guy for an immortal who did nothing except have more money than can be counted, hire very loyal people to \\"clean up\\" Vampire and Lycan \\"messes\\", etc. and allowed himself to be killed by his Vampire son.) which gave her enough strength to beat the first Vampire ever who would be the strongest as in this storyline age equals abilities and strength as well as the blood it comes from.<br />...However, since Michael died, he might have been brought back, but he was brought back in the Vampire way of becoming UNdead.  Not alive as he found out when trying to eat solid food which caused him great physical pain - this was shown in the first movie when he was just Lycan.  So - how can two dead people produce a child???  This is one BIG problem for me and nothing was even mentioned about it in this movie.<br /><br />Then we see the Vampires are actually far worse off than the Lycans, because the Lycans kept themselves hidden during the 1st & 2nd \\"Purge\\" as the movie calls the human eradication of all Lycans and Vampires.  Really??  That must have been one bunch of sissy Vampires with no elders to lead them to be decimated to near extinction by humans.  Same for the Lycans or so everyone thought, but nope...the Lycans in the great tradition of Lucian.  Sneaky and seemingly much smarter when it comes to staying alive and powerful. Now we have Dinosaur sized Lycan due to years of experimentation by the Lycans who were thought to be humans using the blood of Selene, of daughter and yep - you guessed the ending...Michael.  The first Lycan Vampire hybrid which would make him extremely powerful, but the daughter has BOTH original Corvinus blood which makes her immune to Daylight, as well as Silver, and pretty much everything else that would destroy typical Vampires and Werewolves.<br /><br />So now we have the ultimate undead family of good hearted, but very fierce, Uber-Vampire Selene aka Mom, 1st hybrid Lycan that all other Lycans were supposed to yield to as shown in the ending of the first movie, and the Uber being with everything on the positive side for being powerful with not one single weakness...Mama & Daddy's little girl.  And with all that, it's very possible that she is also a triple threat - the daughter I think is mostly plain ole human on top of the duality of being a hybrid Lycan/Vampire.  One older doctor Vampire Lady was looking for her original bite marks and couldn't find any.  Of course not, she wasn't turned, she was...born???  How exactly did that happen, or is this a test-tube kinda thing??  Again...no idea from this movie.<br /><br />And all this with no real explanations about most things that had happened in 12 years of Cryo-Sleep (hmmm - \\"Ripley\\" was asleep for 57 years), lots of very good FX, some excellent fight scenes and very excellence kill shots and other well done gore FX.  Now what?<br /><br />Yes - all that I typed just to sum up what this movie only put into motion with an ending that certainly screams...NEXT MOVIE COMING UP!!  But who, where, what, why, etc., etc.  It's all set in the near future, but if Selene's last thoughts were of getting the Vampires back to the top of the food chain and powerful and a collective nation...Doesn't this seem a bit much like Blade 2 or 3 except that the Vampires are the \\"good guys\\"?<br /><br />Did this help or just make everything much more confusing?ne BIG problem for me and nothing was even mentioned about it in this movie.<br /><br />Then we see the Vampires are actually far worse off than the Lycans, because the Lycans kept themselves hidden during the 1st & 2nd \\"Purge\\" as the movie calls the human eradication of all Lycans and Vampires.  Really??  That must have been one bunch of sissy Vampires with no elders to lead them to be decimated to near extinction by humans.  Same for the Lycans or so everyone thought, but nope...the Lycans in the great tradition of Lucian.  Sneaky and seemingly much smarter when it comes to staying alive and powerful. Now we have Dinosaur sized Lycan due to years of experimentation by the Lycans who were thought to be humans using the blood of Selene, of daughter and yep - you guessed the ending...Michael.  The first Lycan Vampire hybrid which would make him extremely powerful, but the daughter has BOTH original Corvinus blood which makes her immune to Daylight, as well as Silver, and pretty much everything else that would destroy typical Vampires and Werewolves.<br /><br />So now we have the ultimate undead family of good hearted, but very fierce, Uber-Vampire Selene aka Mom, 1st hybrid Lycan that all other Lycans were supposed to yield to as shown in the ending of the first movie, and the Uber being with everything on the positive side for being powerful with not one single weakness...Mama & Daddy's little girl.  And with all that, it's very possible that she is also a triple threat - the daughter I think is mostly plain ole human on top of the duality of being a hybrid Lycan/Vampire.  One older doctor Vampire Lady was looking for her original bite marks and couldn't find any.  Of course not, she wasn't turned, she was...born???  How exactly did that happen, or is this a test-tube kinda thing??  Again...no idea from this movie.<br /><br />And all this with no real explanations about most things that had happened in 12 years of Cryo-Sleep (hmmm - \\"Ripley\\" was asleep for 57 years), lots of very good FX, some excellent fight scenes and very excellence kill shots and other well done gore FX.  Now what?<br /><br />Yes - all that I typed just to sum up what this movie only put into motion with an ending that certainly screams...NEXT MOVIE COMING UP!!  But who, where, what, why, etc., etc.  It's all set in the near future, but if Selene's last thoughts were of getting the Vampires back to the top of the food chain and powerful and a collective nation...Doesn't this seem a bit much like Blade 2 or 3 except that the Vampires are the \\"good guys\\"?<br /><br />Did this help or just make everything much more confusing?

B0053TMP24|4.0|Overall, The Son of Neptune is an excellent book. Finally, Percy Jackson, the son of neptune, is back! Only Percy has amnsia and doesn't remember anything except for his name and his girlfriend, Annabeth. After being chased by gorgons &#34;Beano&#34; Stheno and Euryale for slaughtering Medusa and carrying Juno, disguised as June, he makes it to Camp Jupiter, the Roman version of Camp Half-Blood. I don't want to spoil it, but worth reading, only there are a bunch of typos. I cant wait for The Mark of Athena to come out!!!!!!!

B001NEK2GE|4.0|Keyboards works very well for most games, be careful as it is programmable for macros and some games will not register it for use due to this. Of one downside, the thumb keys are much larger than the button they depress, so if you depress them too far away from center the keyboard will not register the keystroke. Overall good product.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The exploits in Hugh Howey's imaginative and detailed subterranean world of Wool Omnibus kept me guessing right up to the end. I have not been so engrossed in a work of science fiction since finishing the Dune series so long ago.<br /> Like the Dune novels, this compilation is long, with many parallel threads, stories that weave and build upon themselves while drawing upon legend and lore. Though the deep silo of Wool Omnibus is dark world with a dark past, one on the brink of bloody rebellion, Howey pays hopeful tribute the overall goodness of mankind.<br /> I strongly recommend this book.

0345803485|1.0|This is the most horrible book I have read, or should I say I couldn't even read through the whole book. I hated it. Poorly written. Content insulting.
0345803485|2.0|I picked this book up expecting something much more.  With all the early reviews being glowing and looking for a series to follow behind The Fever Series (Karen Marie Moning) I went ahead and purchased this on my Kindle...  I've read plenty of \\"sex\\" novels (let's call them what they are) so maybe I'm a little jaded and my expectations are higher than most, but this book just fell short.  The sex was the only good thing in the book.  The characters are flat, especially Ana, and when the heroine in a novel lacks depth there's really no saving it.  I spent the whole book (the whole series) wondering what the hell Grey saw in her.  Maybe there was too much internal dialogue for the author and she just failed to put it on paper, she is new to the game.  I don't know, all I know is that this book series feels like something a high school student would write.  There was not enough editing done either, too many repetitions, too much inane banter, not enough real plot or intrigue, boring characters who were sadly one dimensional.  It's a rough draft, more time should have been spent on the details.<br /><br />I recommend picking up the Fever Series I mentioned, in fact the author of this series should do so and take some notes to improve for the next go-around.  The sex was secondary in that series, but still well written, and that makes all the difference.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I love this cover for my Kindle Fire, I only wish it had a holder for a stylic. My daughter has had a Kindle Fire since Christmas (already had a cover with it)but like my cover she purchased one.
B007SGM084|2.0|I would not buy these books if I could do it again! The first few chapters it seems really steamy and that you will like it, but it is written soo poorly! I used the search bar on my kindle to look up words I kept seeing a million times and were annoying me.... The word \\"flush\\" is used 113 times in the first book and 97 times in the second. Everything he says to her, \\"I flush crimson\\", \\"I flush scarlet\\" \\"I flush bright pink\\". Next, the word \\"Oh\\" is used in the first book in the first book 424 times and the second book 526 times!!!! I've never noticed this in other books and i'm really not a picky reader. I'm sure there are more \\"mom-porn\\" books out there to read that dont make you want to throw your kindle at how it's written.
B003XTUZIM|5.0|More than 40 years ago, hearing this album when it was new, it was superb, mind-boggling, amazing, and unlike anything else I had heard at the time, including previous King Crimson albums.  Now today, let's assume that if you're reading this review, that you're already familiar with the music, and you agree that it was among the seminal albums of its time, so that from  a music perspective, it starts with 5 stars, because this review is more about the sonic characteristics of the new release, and to a lesser extent, the extra tracks.<br /><br />To be sure, the music may be a bit dated, especially to a first-time listener today.  For example, I would hesitate to play \\"Ladies of the Road\\" to a woman I wanted to impress, although I have a feeling that this song is more of a satire of a stereotypic rock star's attitude towards groupies, rather than the actual feelings of the writer of the song.  But the music behind it is amazing  just the same, even if it was more so at the time for being groundbreaking.<br /><br />THE DTS 5.1 VERSION<br /><br />Starting with Formentera Lady, which is not that dynamic, but is sonically challenging for reproducing acoustic instruments, I noticed that all of the sound seemed to be coming from the front, indeed mostly from the center.  I wondered if it was coming from the center channel speaker.  I began to wonder if this was really such a good investment for 5.1 sound.<br /><br />But the song builds, as does the album as a whole.  Sailor's Tale, the next track, is certainly the most dynamic track on the album, though it starts softly.  I had the volume up high, and was forced to turn it down at the peak points.<br /><br />It was during the Sailor's Tale that I began to notice the use of surround speakers.  And here's the thing: the use is SUBTLE.  Remember the early stereo albums, like the Beatles, and how engineers were intent on demonstrating the novelty, so we had voices on separate channels, instruments here and there, instead of anything resembling an image like we would hear live?  Later, engineers got a clue and made more subtle and pleasing mixes, where we were not distracted by their early pyrotechnics.  I'm happy to say that the engineers in this album, in going to 5.1, had the same sense in making subtle use of the surround sound.  What I hear there is chiefly the mellotron, which is perfect, as it positions a nice ambient plateau where you want it.  The Sailor's Tale has always been a standout track for me, and still is.<br /><br />The Letters is again a subtle track as it starts, but I can hear the opening guitars like never before.  There is a delicacy to all of it that simply did not show up in the old days; little clicks on the keyboard or acoustic guitars; more dynamic range when the loud part comes in.  Some of this is bound to be better equipment than I had a as a college student in 1971, and certainly a lot of it is less use of compression for digital release in 2010.<br /><br />You get the idea; I don't need to write about each track to tell you that I can hear things as I never have before, or that the surround effect is pleasant and effective, but subtle and restrained to avoid tiring the listener.<br /><br />THE STEREO MIX<br /><br />The dynamic range is amazing.  Down in the troughs of quiet and silence, of course, is almost no hiss and of course no clicks or rumble.  Keep in mind that until I got this disc set, I had not heard the album since the vinyl, and it's been a very long time, though I know it very well.<br /><br />In 1971 I could not hear much difference between bass drum and bass guitar on low notes - they were just boom boom boom.  Better equipment, or digital mix?  It's hard to know which is more reponsible, but it's easy to pick out he instruments now.<br /><br />THE EXTRA TRACKS<br /><br />For me, the real alure of this album is the album itself.  Still, there is a wealth of extra tracks included here - out takes, early takes, recent remixes, live material, an entire \\"alternate\\" album, etc.  I have not made my way through all of it.  While I find it interesting, I am too busy rediscovering this old friend of an album that I have not heard in years to spend much time on it.  I'm sure after we have caught up that I'll go after this treasure trove.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />Assuming that you ever liked this album in the first place, buying this edition seems like a no-brainer, unless perhaps you have one of the earlier reissues, or if you don't have the equipment to appreciate the sound quality.  For the price, you get a whole lot of ways to hear it - in stereo, in surround. extra tracks, and so on.  And honestly, I don't see how any reissue could improve on this.<br /><br />As for me?  I'm thrilled!  Hope you like it, too.n entire \\"alternate\\" album, etc.  I have not made my way through all of it.

B00526ZKYS|3.0|The book world has been buzzing about this book for quite a while. I was pretty leery about reading it. I really don't like romances but since this was also a dystopian book I thought it would mellow things about a bit. So I decided to buy it when it was cheap on Amazon. I had fairly high hopes for the book because so many people seemed to love it.<br /><br />The world building was a bit shaky for my taste. As a reader, I don't mind venturing into the totally bizarre in a book if an author makes the bizarre believable. The book describes a bit about (aka love) and the symptoms. Maybe I'm just cynical but I don't really understand how they are able to classify love as a disease (when we know it's an emotion) without labeling other emotions as diseases. Maybe because emotions go away when they have the surgery? I don't know. That never made sense to me. I also wondered how far they went with the precautions. Was Portland the only safe place? Just the US? The whole world? How exactly did we get to this point? I might just be overly critical but there were quite a few things that went unanswered.<br /><br />I guess more than anything I was just disappointed in the book. That's not to say it was bad though because it wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. I just had much, much higher hopes for it. I guess The Chaos Walking trilogy `ruined' me in that way. Delirium had the potential to be really good if it pushed a bit more but in the end it just kind of played it safe. Because it played it safe, it really wasn't that memorable.<br /><br />Oliver's style is beautiful and I highly enjoyed reading it. It was very easy reading. I really loved the way she started all the chapters with excerpts from The Book of Shhh and other safe books within their universe. That was a really creative idea. It would be really cool if she released a novella or short story of The Book of Shhh in the future. I'd read it. Unfortunately those snippets of info aren't enough for me. She really needed to explain more about the world for me to enjoy it.<br /><br />The bottom line? An enjoyable enough book but not the best dystopian book I've read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You might think that this is one of those self-published bargain rack Kindle books.  You know the one.  You're in the sci-fi section.  The hackneyed plot, editing possibly done by the family dog.  Yet another space cadet suddenly the Captain and all alone.<br /><br />This is not that.  The price lies.<br /><br />I will not ruin the plot for you.  This book creeps and it flies.  It explores social aspects of society when everything goes too right and too wrong.  It explores the lies you have come to depend on.<br /><br />The author is not afraid to screw up your mind without so much as a dozen roses or an \\"I had a great time tonight\\".<br /><br />We will see this author again.  I promise you that.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I find myself totally consumed by these books. They are just what the doctor ordered. Reading these books is a double edged sword for me. On one hand, my sex life with my husband of 20 years is improving by the day, however, on the other hand, my house has gone to pot. Laundry is piling up and house is a wreck.  But what is a girl suppose to do, I need more of these books, more, more, more!!! lol

B006UG90RM|5.0|Honestly, I was just hoping for a few great moments.  A few flashes of brilliance that recalled the magic from back in the day.  I thought it was unrealistic and unfair to expect anything more from guys pushing 60 years old.  But man, was I wrong.  They showed up big time.  Loaded for bear.  If you love VH, buy this album.  And if you don't love VH... why are you reading reviews about their new record?<br /><br />(Note: there's a more in depth review of the album and lead-up on my website under the \\"Tune In\\" section.)<br /><br />Rock,<br />John
B001FD5KJM|4.0|The writers and director of IRON MAN have crafted a fine comic book adaptation, skilfully combining character, action. plot, and humour (the latter is essential in such movies, with many failing as a result of self-reverence). Here the script is sharp and lean, and is confidently delivered by a top-flight cast. The set pieces are well constructed and the special effects are impressive. The story, for the most part, is cohesive and convincing. There's not much to criticise here, except perhaps the ending, which is rather predictable. All in all this is first-class entertainment from start to finish.

This is just an action movie for the thinking man. bought it thinking it would suck like alot of other cool action movies but damn it was actually bad ass to say the least.  marks acting has come a long way since i heart huckabees. sit down with some buds, have a few beers, and enjoy a real shooter that isnt watered down politically correct boredom thats been rehashed a million times. Shooter is simply a great movie and now one of my all time favorites. buy it. you wont be disappointed

B005LAIGSM|1.0|After reading the book i expected a reasonable movie version. Instead I got Paige the brat. Paige the entitled. Paige the bully. It was all about Paige and very little about her husband. He was going through ton of stress and agony that never got expressed on the screen just a nice guy gentleness and one punch. He was truly the perfect gentleman. He even learned to love the cat. Great for a superficial story but not a great movie. I would have liked him to have had more voice to express anger even at her for lets face it ruining his life and not trusting him. Instead its all about Paige and her rotten family that were trying to rewrite history. How many more secrets did they keep? So not a great movie. If you like date movies its good but don't expect any realism in the story.

B007SGM084|5.0|I don't usually read books like this, but several of my friends had read them and I thought I would see what all the fuss was about. It is graphic and VERY detailed....leaves nothing to the imagination. BUT the story is GREAT. I read all three of the novels in a weekend. I fell in love with both characters and despite the amount of graphic sexual scenes, I would read it again.

B004QL7K6G|2.0|The setup of Wonderlust will be familiar for any couple who's lived in Manhattan, battling to pay a mortgage for a closet-sized apartment and then wondering what happens if one or the other loses their jobs. Naturally, this happens here so the couple lose their apartment and then embark on a spiritual journey to find their purpose in life outside the Big Apple.<br /><br />The first 30 minutes are the funniest part of the film, with Ken Marino playing the over-the-top successful brother and Michaela Watkins hilarious as his drunk, unhappy wife. Unfortunately, this section is dispatched quickly and we're rapidly dumped at the beginning of the unfunny part of the film - arriving at the commune.<br /><br />Think of every hippie cliche you can in 60 seconds and turn them into a series of SNL sketches - this is what the rest of the movie comprises. We have sharing bathrooms, sharing wives, nudists, talking to trees into the forest, hallucinogenic drugs, drums circles - you name it, it's been shoe-horned into one sketch after the other.<br /><br />In the midst of this, the comedy quotient drops continuously and there's an uneasy feeling half-way through that the plot has officially left the rails. Every joke feels overly set up and forced and it relies enormously on Paul Rudd's reaction to the whole thing. There's notably a truly weird scene featuring redneck dirty talk that feels strangely out of place. Towards the end, the ever-important happy ending is hastily thrown together to reset everybody back to a state where they were better for the experience.<br /><br />Wanderlust is neither funny nor dramatic. It's like somebody neutered The Beach and replaced the dramatic intensity with half-baked SNL jokes. It's s shame that with the strength of the cast there wasn't any material hiding in the script to play off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|received for use on my i pad. found the whole process to be easy and the book completely entertaining.i will definitely purchase more books this way from amazon.

B006XOBFJC|5.0|Those who have reviewed this set have done a nice job.  I have owned it since the first CD incarnation and have always felt that it was undervalued by critics.  Janowski is now recording the entire Wagner canon (in the studio) and remains a solid authority on Wagner rather than a Super-star who happens to record Wagner, also.<br /><br />The one more thing I wanted to add to the reviews is that this was recorded in East Germany (before the Wall came down) by a western team.  The actual digital recording was BEFORE Sony was in the digital business -- ironic since this is a Sony release.  The masters were done by Thomas Stockham and Soundstream -- the same outfit that pioneered the Telarc masters of their first digital recordings.  The Soundstream process was invented before the Red Book CD Standard was codified.  Stockham started his venture (digital recordings) to digitally reclaim Caruso's voice from the original cylinder recordings.  The bi-product of those experiments (Stockham was a PhD sound researcher) was his digital recording process which became Soundstream.<br /><br />The sampling rate was not 41 KHz but rather 54 KHz (I believe).  Because of this the higher frequencies had much more overtone \\"juice\\" and I have always felt that the Soundstream masters (whether these or the Telarcs) had a sweetness to the orchestral sound that the later Sony Digital recorders did not match.  Soundstream masters were the \\"exception\\" to the original dry sound of the first-generation CD's.<br /><br />So another reason I love this RING set is because of the digital sound, itself.  The original CD's had one or two tracks per CD, so it was hard to find anything within an act.  I assume that this set has tracks like all modern CD's do.  I would recommend this set for the music, the performance, AND the technical achievement of the sound -- which, I think, actually outclasses all competition.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thought this was a great book.  I was a little disappointed that I have to read the next two books to find out the ending.  Would not recommend it to anyone under the age of 13.

B00026ZG10|5.0|Great storyline, great acting, great special effects, and lots of comedy. This is a movie I never tire of watching. There are just too many scenes that are complete in themselves and yet add to the plot. The outrageousness of the escapes and the number of crazy situations just keeps me entertained.
B007EC6FIS|3.0|Typically I give an album 5-10 listens before I fully judge it, and I will for my own full review for my own site, but I had to get this out for Keane fans that pride themselves on being big music nerds.<br /><br />I myself fully enjoyed their first three albums, with Iron Sea being one of my all-time favorite albums. It was dark in spots, it told a story, and each song had a different personality filled with lush instrumentals to spark emotion rather than the standard Pop instrumental.<br /><br />I was so, so, SO excited to hear that Keane had returned to form on this one, but then I heard it. I even gave it three more listens, and I just don't see my mind changing.<br /><br />Believe me when I say that I wanted to like this album so bad, to the point where I avoided all reviews until I heard it. But it's extremely difficult to get through this album top to bottom. There's just nothing that stands out. Nothing that struck a personal chord with me. No \\"Atlantic,\\" or \\"Untitled 1,\\" or \\"Try Again.\\" It's simple piano pop with a great vocalist. I understand that the band is trying to turn an uplifting page, but that doesn't mean you have to abandon all creativity.<br /><br />Iron Sea was so haunting. It took me somewhere. Maybe to the average Keane fan, this isn't necessary. Maybe you just go for a catchy tune to nod your head to. And that's fine. But for someone that wants to hear something more, Strangeland falls way, way short. Strangeland feels more like an attempt to bring back the fans that hated the Perfect Symmetry era. You could tell that Keane wanted to go in that 80's direction, and I would've at least respected them a lot more for delving deeper into their own creative imagination rather than trying to sell more records with a mainstreamed sound, even if I don't personally love that version of Keane. They're a commercial band now. They've been \\"Coldplay'd.\\" Unfortunately, new Coldplay is lightyears ahead of new Keane.<br /><br />Good songs on the album are \\"You Are Young,\\" \\"Disconnected,\\" and \\"Sea Frog.\\" Everything in between feels like filler. They all sound exactly the same to me. And these \\"good\\" songs are just that and nothing more. They certainly don't stack up with the rest of 2012's great tracks.<br /><br />I partially blame Radiohead for making me hate this album, and for that reason, I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. This band has too much talent to turn into another U2 or Snow Patrol.

B007WV05GY|1.0|I guess it's just me. But. I'm getting to the point where I can tell if a movie is going to be good, in say, hmm, fifteen seconds to three minutes. I knew The Grey was going to be bad when (SPOILER ALERT) Liam Neeson, in the first fifteen seconds says, \\"a summary killer,\\" in describing what he does. I barely could pick up what he said, but there it was, yup, \\"summary killer.\\" IMHO, one does not begin ones' movie with a difficult word like \\"summary killer,\\" within the first fifteen seconds. It's like WTF? WTF is a summary killer? Having a lit degree, yah, I know what it means. But mr. average movieguy? He turns to his girlfriend and says- \\"what did he just say?\\" She doesn't want to answer him, cuz she's busy trying to figure out WTF he just said and it goes on from there.<br />Next, there's a delicious shot of ol' brother Liam lining up on a grey wolf that (SPOILER ALERT DELUXE) that just happens to beeline out of the forest, yup, I mean that sincerely, runs, straight out of concealing woods toward three men standing around an oil or gas pipeline. GOOD THING ol' Liam was there, READY, to dust that evil toad, his mean, lean killing machine hefted at his shoulder. And he does what must be done. Cuz, he knew, that Grey was gonna BEELINE out of the woods, spring over one hundred and fifty feet of open field and attack three grown MALE OIL PIPELINE WORKERS because, well, because he was houngry... But lucky ol' Liam was there, to save the pipeline workers.<br />I guess the film deserves one star, because, as I watched it, I realized I had chores to do and, because of the depressing tone of this movie, I realized I had better get them done before some wolf did me in.<br /><br /> I really wonder how many wolves are going to be killed as a result of this movie.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|I purchased the DVD version of this when it came out, and then, of course, they later brought it out in blue-ray as well. It is easily my favorite music video and I was interested in seeing and especially hearing it in the best quality I could find so I went ahead and bought the blue-ray as well. As far as the content goes, if you like Cream, or Eric Clapton, or Blues, then you will most likely love this concert. It is not flashy, no antics, dancing ,running, leaping about, just great music from some very fine musicians. Eric thanks us for waiting all these years, that the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune cut them off in their prime, and Jack chides him that this is their prime. I agree with Jack. They might not be as nimble as in their younger years, but they play with experience and emotion that more than compensates for the fading of youthful energy.I have read reviews complaining that Ginger seems a little long in tooth and not up to his former standards. While it is true that his drum solo on Toad is not the blazing tapestry of tones from yesteryear, he still rocks the kit in a way few other drummers do. Watch him on Crossroads, or Badge or Outside Woman blues, or Sunshine of your love, and watch how the whole of Albert Hall moves with him. I have heard Eric play some of these songs with various other artists for decades, and though I enjoy many of those versions, none of them hold a candle to these. Within the first few seconds it is immediately apparent that Ginger is on the drums and it is like coming home. It just sounds right. Now, about the quality of the blue-ray compared to the DVD. The video is markedly better, as one might expect. The sound is better as well, though not as much as the video. Considering that this was the best sounding music DVD in my library, any improvement on that is icing on the cake.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game its so old school but in a new way. cant stop playing it everywhere definitely going to be a top ten gamecocks

0553593544|5.0|I think I could read this book over and over - just loved Ludlum's Bourne character. Great series that should have finished at number 3. Not a fan of the Lustbader Bourne, would rather re-read the original than try any of the newer ones again. Classic spy thriller.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love love love love love love love love love love love this game a great pass time for long trips love ittttttttttt!!
B003TNM2K6|4.0|I watched this film with the short story fresh in my mind, so I was very pleased with how close the adaptation really was. I thought the film was cast perfectly, and that the special effects were convincing. A few things were changed from the book to the movie, some because of ratings and time, but the only reason I'm not giving it a five star is because of the ending. It's not a bad ending, just left me with an \\"argh!\\" feeling. I preferred the ending from the book. I like how clever and unusual the storyline is, as well. It's not your average, everyday 'there's a strange mist over there' type of tale. Overall this was a pretty darn good movie, lots of fun if you're into thrillers/horror, and worth the money.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|Evernote is such an indispensable note taking app that is only made sweeter with the addition of skitch.  Skitch is still fairly basic, but I'm confident the evernote team will continue to expand upon and improve it.  All in all skitch just makes evernote that much more versatile.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|thank u for taking the time to make games that r actually worth playing. you did a really great job n I enjoy playing it...thanks again
B007SYWFRM|4.0|please fix so I can connect with friends. I love this game!!!! I cant get past one of the missions because I cant connect.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|So I have the original pay version of Angry Birds, since, you know...I have more than one droid device. Original Angry Birds works fine on fire, but you're trying to tell me that Space isn't compatible? Pretty shady.......
0345803485|1.0|This book was just horrible.  Not only was it poorly written, it was just so ridiculous and kind of gross too.  I think someone who would enjoy this book would be someone who doesn't read much and enjoys unengaging books.  My favorite book is \\"a thousand splendid suns\\" by Khalid housseini, so this book wasn't worth my time to even pick up.  Learned a lesson and will stay away from these kinds of books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good variety of fun games. so much better than I expected! play on my kindle fire and it was free
1590710487|4.0|After reading Tanner's biography of Chris Farley, I had to get this.  As a huge SNL geek since the late 80's I had only heard rumors of this legend.  While I feel the Farely bio was darker and more honest, this beautifully laid out book (do NOT get the Kindle edition) makes for a definitive biography worthy of any comedy fan.
0345803485|5.0|absolutely amazing.  2 days after I placed the order, the book arrived!  Started reading it already.  Excellent service. will order next book from you, too.  T hanks
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|love<br />it as<br /> good<br />as get need a lot more games like this games to play with thank you for letting me pplay angry birds for free
B0039NEINA|5.0|I thought this movie was very good!  The plot line is interesting and will make you think about decisions that people have to make, based on the information that is available.  Really good movie!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Seeing that this book has a lower customer rating than first two books in the series, I was hopeful that it would hold something special and dark.  It did not disappoint.  The book is action packed, and brings out strong emotions at times.  As someone who likes the darker side of things, I was very satisfied with the books ending.  Don't want to say too much about what happens, so I'll leave it at that.  I Highly recommend this book and rank it up there with the first book in the trilogy.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Like so many others, I was enjoying this game on Kindle Fire but the bugs are making it tiresome. First saplings won't ever grow making replenishment of wood nearly impossible. I reported this behavior and heard nothing back. Now like so many other all the timers on crops, buildings and animals are broken so there is nothing to do. What a waste. The game could have been great.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Love it! This game is very entertaining. You can continue to play until you have a perfect score on all levels.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|Good sound they have some issues to work out. Some of their songs are very chopped up, and out of tune.
0439023491|3.0|After recently reading Hunger Games, this book presents a lot of very familiar situations.  There's another lottery, another set of selected tributes, another set of interviews, another arena, cornucopia, bloodbath, pods, mutts, sacrifices, etc.  But whereas the first book had elements such as Rue's death and Evergreen's salute to District 11, this just has more fighting and killing.  Unlike Hunger Games, this book is not a full course meal.  It is a snack to be eaten between meals, a snickers bar to keep you going until you get to Mockingjay.
B006PTZNSY|4.0|Nicki Minaj, as you might know already, is the female rapper of the moment which has captured the mainstream audience with no issues the last couple of years. With some get-go hits from her major label debut 'Pink Friday' she managed to score more than 6 Top 40 hits from the very same album and getting to the top of the charts all over the world.<br /><br />This year, after a brief rest, she's finally releasing her awaited sophomore effort 'Roman Reloaded', and what an effort it is. Very diverse, as you read already in the grand mass of reviews on this site, but somehow the random listener hasn't liked the album - why you must ask? They haven't taken the time to appreciate the hard work put on this record. Have in mind Nicki is under massive record label pressure to keep her album sales, but at the same time, she wants to mantain her street cred and hip hop roots. Both things are a bit hard to mix, since female hardcore rap isn't even USA's best-selling sound of the moment, so a noble move was made by her to make this an extensive album which I'd gladly divide into two halves.<br /><br />The first half of the album is mainly hip hop influence, and consists of looped samples with fueled, blazing raps all over them. Nicki betters and even manages to create bolder songs with the handful of collaborators, which range from Lil Wayne to Chris Brown. I'm not much into the whole 'Roman' image she's trying to market to us, but the material is pristine and highly refined to be of the highest quality. 'Beez In The Trap' with its minimalistic bleeps pisses all over most of male rappers' recent output, even taking it a bit further in the risqué lyrics side of things. 'Champion' is filled with sharp raps and 'Right By My Side' takes a step back to Beyoncé's 'Irreplaceable' sample, using it with a bit more of imagination.<br /><br />The second half, and my personal favourite, is the bubbly pop part of the record. It is evident Nicki didn't have the RedOne tracks until a couple of weeks before the release date deadline, because using this magnificent Swedish producer is the first and last resort to obtain a massive hit nowadays (which artist doesn't buy Scandinavian songs to have a hit these days?). Since it is pretty evident the 'rap' singles had a crash landing and renamed 'buzz' releases (Namely all the 'Roman' tracks and Stupid Ho) she obviously turned to megapop to catch a new smash. And boy she did. The album run of Starships-Pound the alarm-Whip it-Automatic is friggin' glorious and a catchy chorus slap to anyone's face. Watching the artwork whilts listening to these songs takes the album imagery into another level. 'Beautiful Sinner' would have benefited immesely with better production, because on its current form it sounds like a bare demo, even considering the ace lyrics and their potential - Alex Da Kid needs a bit more practice with those protools. Both 'Marilyn Monroe' with its enchanting piano riff and soothing vocals and 'Young Forever' are the album smooth parts, flying from bubbly heaven to midtempo clouds, and not grey, mediocre ones. 'Marilyn Monroe' is easily the ballad hit yet to be scored, THAT piano riff will be sampled to death if made popular, believe me. From here, you'll find relatively weak tracks except 'Turn Me On', a dance tornado that has filled the dancefloors of all over the world and 'Va Va Voom', the original lead single the record company shelved in favor of the Swedish penned tracks by RedOne, which is an upbeat affair but ultimately lacks something and feels a bit empty and like non-flavoured chewgum.<br /><br />In resume 'Roman Reloaded' could be a 12 track tornado of an album, but can't be cut thanks to Nicki's big fanbases that need to be pleased desperately. I'd highly recommend it to have a buffet of current pop and hip hop sounds and also encourage to make a tracklisting with your personal favorites. Get it now.
B004QX07G4|5.0|The book was very light and easy to read. Ellen never fails to make me laugh and her book had me hooked. I tried hard not to finish it all in one go.
B007JRUCGO|4.0|The makers of Happy Feet made no secret that it was not for kids.  The first Happy Feet was full of innuendo and politics and made many parents uncomfortable.  The second one is still very political, but is meant for for kids.  Almost all of the innuendo is gone.  What remains is a story that has a lot of music and comic relief brought to us by krill who steal the show entirely.
0345803485|1.0|I was really excited about reading these books as they had been recommended to me by several close friends. I was severely disappointed, and am considering moving away and getting new friends after reading only the first one.<br /><br />My biggest issue with the book was Ana, the main character, constantly assuming something was wrong with Grey because he enjoyed the BDSM lifestyle. She is an overly simple girl who loves to psychoanalyze her boyfriend because he is not what she wants him to be; yet, she doesn't leave him because he's so beautiful (a fact she never gets over and repeats every time she sees him) and she \\"loves\\" him (a fact that is never explained because their relationship has no depth). Ana is simple and an unbelievably frustrating character. This book had the potential to be good, had Ana been a self assured woman who knew what she wanted and was interested in exploring her sexuality. Instead, the main character spends the entire book telling us how she wants to change her boyfriend.<br /><br />Another disappointment is its comparison to Twilight. Twilight was written for young teenage girls. The main character is a teenage girl. At least if you ever picked up Twilight, you knew you were going to be reading a book about teenage drama from the point of view of an inexperienced adolescent. When reading Fifty Shades of Grey I expected to be reading about a woman, not a 21 year old with the capacity of a 10th grader.
0765350386|5.0|I've read this twice now, second time being quite recently as part of a Group Read which has the natural ability to make reading almost anything fun.<br /><br />However this is a book that stands as an enjoyable and engrossing read in its own right. Sanderson manages to achieve a seemingly perfect blend of action, intrigue and character development.<br /><br />In the context of a group read, we found plenty to speculate upon and discuss as we went through. We found -- upon reflection, mostly -- a great deal of extremely well written foreshadowing for the books many big reveals and twists so that even as you experienced that, `Oh snap!' moment, it didn't feel completely out of left field.<br /><br />In fact, for one of the bigger events, there were threads linking it right back to extremely early sections of the book. So if you're wanting something to really dig your teeth into, Mistborn: The Final Empire delivers.<br /><br />This is not to say you require a degree in English Literature to appreciate the story however! Sanderson has such a way with writing that even the most action heavy sequences where Mistborn are fighting with all the powers of their Allomancy with metal flying in a storm, bodies pivoting around spires through the air and more, you can form a crystal clear image in your mind and follow it blow for blow.<br /><br />Then when the fighting is done and they're back picking up the pieces of their crew, you can see it change them. You can see the struggle to find courage in the face of what surely seems to be impossible odds. You can witness the transformation in Vin from untrusting and ill-used street kid to powerful woman struggling to trust someone yet so desperately wanting to be able.<br /><br />If you're a fan of fantasy already, or simply looking for a place to begin, Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn: The Final Empire comes highly recommended. For existing fans, Sanderson turns many of the tropes completely on their heads by asking a simple `What If?' question. What if the hero lost, and evil won? How would this world look 1,000 years later? For those looking to get started, this is a well-written highly engrossing story which won't do double duty as a doorstop and has a definite end point, being a trilogy rather than a gargantuan 12-books-and-counting-yay! experience.<br /><br />  -- Originally posted on the blog, Once Upon a Time.' question.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is definitely inspired by another popular video game series but despite that it has its own clever mechanics and approach that is pretty unique and creative. It's not too difficult or demanding but has a good amount of entertainment to it.
B006ZZAMWK|1.0|I want to tell you that I bought this for a gift but the box came damaged inside. Very disappointed
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is served up with several short stories about the exploits of the great detective.  Makes an interesting and fun read.
0345803485|5.0|I purchased the book on my kindle after reading I had to get it for my Aunt! The book came in and I couldn't wait to mother's day to give her it to her. She has not stopped reading yet! I would tell anyone to read the series :)
B001NN4162|4.0|I ordered this specific movie because it said it was a blu ray/dvd combo pack and when I received it in the mail it was only the blu ray. So I was disappointed but not enough to send it back.
B0013527I4|5.0|This is a great item, especially for the price!  My daughters, ages 7 and 9, love all of the episodes just as much as me!  I am so pleased with this dvd!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great fun game. good for passing time. simple and easy to use. like a previous comment said go to more stuff and about to get the kindle arrow to exit.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I could not stop watching this series, finished it in a week.  Would love to have watched it straight through for a whole day.  I had thought Dexter and Rita were reaching a great place in their relationship and then bam she's gone!  Thoughts of him dreaming entered my mind, I kept saying \\"Rita can't be dead\\" but yes she was.  I was so happy to have Dexter able to truly connect with another human, such as Lumen.  I felt he was truly in love with her even though she was totally aware of his dark passenger.  The end kept me hungry for season 6!  Great expectations are awaiting.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I love this movie and I decided to order online. It arrived on time and in perfect conditions. without complaints
B003L77GG0|5.0|Not much we can add to what has already been said--but we wanted our five stars to be counted and so we leave this fairly useless review.  If you've watched all the previous seasons, this is a must of course!  LOL.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Book was a fast read.  The hero was a bit too large for the personality he played.  Back ground about the military was up to date an interesting.  Not one of Baldacci best. However, I like the way he writes.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|cant go wrong when your buying a blue ray copy of a movie you . everythign i purchas trough amazon arrives on time and as specified when prdered...thank you
B0011Z76RS|5.0|Amazing album that endures the test of time!!!!  If you like hard rock music that seamlessly blends nu-metal with lyrics sung in a rap style and does so in a perfect way and enjoyable way, then you will surely enjoy this band and their debut album!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really enjoy this game!! Set up just like the original Mario! Takes me back! Recommend this game to everyone.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|EXCELLENT CHOICE, A SUPER MOVIE YOU WON'T WANT TO MISS OUT ON. I JUST LOVE DWAYNE JOHNSON AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.
B007MDB71O|5.0|It was a fun movie and worth the money. I saw this in the theater multiple times and while not completely faithful to the books, I really enjoyed it. I took my kids the 2nd time and they thought it was \\"epic\\". I cannot wait to get this on blu ray.
B007DJUO8O|2.0|In the review I wrote for Opeth's \\"Heritage\\" I mentioned the fact that, for all of it's headiness, \\"Damnation\\" by Opeth is a great POP album.  It is structured, it's catchy, it is accessible to the point that even a pedestrian music fan can enjoy it.  Let's be honest, Damnation broke open alot of doors for Opeth.  Well, you may gasp when I say this, but \\"Still Life\\", \\"Ghost Reveries\\", and even \\"Deliverance\\" are decently accessible as well.<br /><br />As for Steven Wilson, well he has a track record of making friendly, accessible, beautiful, often downright POP music.  All of Blackfield's albums, Porucpine Tree starting with \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", and even No-Man in the mid-90's appeal to the more populist realm.  The point I am trying to make as I introduce Storm Corrosion is that even as Mikael and Steven have a knack for taking their music out there, even though they love expanisve arrangements, they still know how to please a good chunk of the population with a good tune.<br /><br />Storm Corrosion is the third in the \\"Let's Go There\\" trilogy of Opeth's \\"Heritage\\" and Wilson's \\"Grace for Drowning\\".  And it is the one that really goes there...the most.  This is certainly one of those albums where the individual songs matter much less than the overall picture.  It is a very quiet and serene piece, and not even just for Opeth/PT standards, this stuff is SOFT.  There is a lack of percussion, a consistent slow to slower pace, and a WHOLE lot of accoustic guitar.  Yes, it is, to an extent, mood music, but I would not compare it to Kraut rock or new age music.  If it's aim is to be \\"ambient\\", I don't think it has done a very good job.  The best ambient allows you to get lost while retaining attention.  Storm Corrosion sounds as though something is being built up to, but that something never happens.  You keep paying attention, but why?  The vibe isn't trippy or soothing, it is dark and cold and you'd rather get out of there.<br /><br />It start's with \\"Drag Ropes\\", a song which set's a bad precedent.  \\"Drag Ropes\\" goes somewhere, no more than three times do the moods shift dramatically, and each time you can feel it.  It is almost as if this is the only fully conceived song on the album.  \\"Storm Corrosion\\" through \\"Happy\\", a large chunk of the album, are just boring.  Too quiet for it's own good, nothing here is super intriguing.  Repetative soft accoustic guitar with occasional muddled vocals, usually on the higher end of the spectrum.  \\"Lock Howl\\" brings back a little bit of dynamic, but has too many abrubt nothing's.  The album's end is...well, let's just say I didn't realize when the album actually ended.<br /><br />I will say that I can hear much more Steven Wilson influence on this project than I do Akerfeldt.  Lately it seems that Steven Wilson has been a little too busy and his products seem to be a little undefined, like early throwaways from sessions that would eventually produce better output.  I feel like \\"Insurgentes\\" was the last good album, whatever the project, he released. Hopefully it does not remain the last.  He now seems to be a man who wants it all - the best pop and the best prog.  At his best, in the past he has done it.  But nowadays when he tries to go out there, it sounds like he has become too self-aware, tries to hard, and, while not exactly failing, he misses the mark.<br /><br />Unlike others, I do not want to give a mediocre review based upon my own expectations not being met.  But when I focus on what Storm Corrosion is, I don't like it.  If it were by musicians who I'd never previously heard of and I listened to it, I would think still think it was a very boring album that did not bear many repeat spins.<br /><br />In ending I will say this -- Storm Corrosion could of benefitted from the help of Richard Barbieri.ch set's a bad precedent.  \\"Drag Ropes\\" goes somewhere, no more than three times do the moods shift dramatically, and each time you can feel it.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|This review is for the Hunger Games book.  I purchased this book for my daughter and she absolutely loves it.  I would definitely recommend this book to everyone.
0061726834|4.0|Delirium is an odd world. A unique world. Something I could have never thought of, but found strangely realistic and oh so romantic. Love is a disease. How outrageous is this? But it works fantastically well here. There's an explanation. There are strange backgrounds and science behind this. The characters are complex, and the story is beautiful. It flowed seamlessly and I am not afraid to admit that I cried at the end.<br /><br />This world is scary. Love is a crime. It's a disease. You have to be cured of it by the time you're eighteen. You're emotionless after this. It's heart-wrenching to think of a world like this. My head was constantly spinning at the emotional turmoil in this book. I adored the characters that were strongly developed with each their own unique personality. I'm really at a loss of words of how to properly review this one. I should just leave it at this and say that if you haven't read it, love Dystopia and looking for an interesting new, world, read it. This idea could have gone really bad, but Oliver did a tremendous job with it. I was captivated from the first page until the last. Speaking of last: insane cliffhanger. Must have Pandemonium soon.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B00785P2QC|4.0|decent for the price of &quot;free&quot;.  too many ads and I had to reinstall twice but all around a decent game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|the book holds my attention and I cannot wait to see how the characters continue to develop. Putting the book down has been neigh to impossible at times.
B003UESJH4|4.0|No question Mr. Darcy (oops) Colin Firth deserved every accolade, including the coveted Oscar, for his performance as the stammering King George VI (the current monarch's father). Anyone from king to kid (including this writer) who has had even a passing acquaintance with stammering can relate to the story line here, and the sheer talent necessary for an actor to convincingly produce such a realistic portrayal (especially that climatic pep talk speech to the empire). And hats off to Geoffrey Rush as the unorthodox tutor who sees the king through his travails. However, at the end of the day and as the good king himself was painfully aware, good republican that I am I was left with the gnawing feeling that the  monarchy (and the monarch) portrayed add nothing to our accumulated historical experience. Old Oliver Cromwell and his boys had it right in 1649-and it hasn't been right since 1660.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first book was very good.  (Wish I had stopped there).  The second book was okay.  And the third book was not very good at all.  I found myself skimming to get to the relevent parts.

B004P8JPS6|4.0|Waited a while to buy it but was worth it. Usual, enjoyable Reacher-antics in a good story. Wish Amazon would've lowered the price though.
0345803485|1.0|As someone who loves chick lit and voraciously read the Twilight novels (with complete awareness of how bad they were) I expected to love this book. But it's awful. It's so awful, I'm writing my very first amazon review ever to come and tell you how awful it is. At least the first half of it, because that's all I could stomach.<br /><br />The other reviewers have pretty much covered it but I just have to say again that there is no plot. The plot is like a hollow shell to allow for the sex scenes, which would be cool I guess if 1)the sex scenes were good or 2) this wasn't a book. There's no suspense, there's nothing surprising, and there are no elements that make a story compelling.<br /><br />Neither of the characters feels realistic in any way. They refer to each other formally and by name with every sentence they say to each other. \\"Miss Steele, you need to submit to me.\\" \\"Mr. Grey, I'm blushing\\" \\"Miss Steele, you're biting your lip and it's driving me crazy\\" \\"Mr grey I had no idea, I'm so innocent\\" \\"Anastasia, will you ever do as you're told?\\" \\"Christian you're so intimidating.\\" You get the idea. Actually I think that pretty much sums up the entire novel, so you're welcome!<br /><br />Christian bounces back and forth between being charming and boyish to cold, hard, and demanding, for no apparent reason and the lack of consistency makes it hard to care at all. Ana... is a senior in college in 2011 and doesn't have a computer? Doesn't think she'll need a computer in life? Even if this was set in 2007 when MacBook Pros first came out, it's unbelievable. The writing suggests that she JUST GOT HER VERY FIRST EMAIL ADDRESS. Does the author know anything about college and technology? IT MADE ME SO ANGRY I HAVE TO TYPE THIS SENTENCE IN ALL CAPS. Luckily I had a safe word (which was \\"sucks\\") and was able to end the torture.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|The reviews mention freezing.  I've been playing for the past five days and the screen froze just before level 47!!!

I am hoping I can resist actually buying coins.  We will see.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|ahhhh this is so awesome!!! I love this game and I am sooo happy that the kindle finally has it!<br />it is so much easier to play on my kindle because the screen is bigger and its easier to draw.<br />thumbs up :D
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was quite the interesting read. Great book to read with your sweetie. Sexy but not sleazy. However, that being said, I think the first book holds up on its own; there was/is no read for the sequel.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|its a good game and i like it but i think its a little over priced. I should have gotten the ad-free version for 0.99.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Christopher Nolan is brilliant! Heath ledger r.I.p but, that performance was your finest. You will be forever missed. I wish he could keep the series going and going past the upcoming the dark Knight rises but, excellent work clap clap whistle.
B0077ATSU4|4.0|I was very pleased with this films co-star, and the subject matter, as along,with the JFK assionation I reemember where I was when the news hit the TV screens around the world, also the first shuttle lossm boy it sure is fun getting old. Actually ths is a good moviem you might enjoy it also.....YMMV<br /><br />P.S. Seemed a little long, to me<br /> [[ASIN:B0077ATSSQ Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (DVD + Ultraviolet Digital Copy)]]
1455508977|4.0|Like all of Nicholas Sparks's books, I thoroughly enjoyed this story. I was, however, a little disappointed in how he wrapped up the ending. Still I would definitely recommend it.
B007SGM084|2.0|I agree with the others, I would love to own this kindle trilogy but I can purchase all three books in paperback cheaper. I have never paid over $22.00 for kindle trilogy set. Even the Hunger Games set was not this expensive.
B007BRJYF2|4.0|I really enjoyed this game and played through it all in one evening as it was hard to put down. I think it took about 3 hours, prett decent for the price. Would be 5 stars except can't seem to unlock bonus material. I recommend the game to hidden object and adventure fans, it's pretty much exclusively hidden object stuff, but surprisingly fun.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Christopher Nolan is brilliant I love his vision and the way his mind works if only he could keep the series going and going past the upcoming the dark Knight rises!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It makes it incredibly easy to keep my commitment to grow spiritually. I can dedicate to a reading plan &amp; listen &amp; reflect on the Word of God just about anywhere! Especially like listening when driving alone or just before going to sleep.
0307716546|5.0|Another wonderfully told family story by this author. A most unusual concept to handle the family relationships indeed. But it works for better or worse. As I think Lee Child commented on the cover something about this book touching everyone. Handling the crime and mystery through mother and daughter's tragic accident in this way cannot help but show the author's unique and perceptive revelation of the family love and devotion. I was attached from the beginning, and the end only added to what a wonderful view the author showed for the family's resolution. Just great and recommended. (Bring tissues)  (pasted in from Goodreads review) (so I'm in a hurry ok?)
B005EGXNLS|5.0|This may not be the best book in the series, but I can honestly say Bernard Cornwell has yet to write one that is bad.<br /><br />With the old king dead, there are some new twists in Uhtred's struggle with allegiances which keep it very interesting.  Another new dimension is Uhtred's fame in the lands.  Cornwell seems to be purposely playing up Uhtred's reputation, which makes sense considering the time that has elapsed since the story began (Uhtred is now in his 40s) and the number of critical roles he has played in major historical events.<br /><br />Now I am looking forward to getting more of Uhtred's focus on reclaiming his birth right.  I am sure that my only disappointment will be when the series ends.
B004J88SGC|5.0|if You Are A Billy Joel Fan this DVD has to be in Your Collection. Great Concert......We didn't start the fire, Captain Jack,Piano Man and Let it Be......Outstanding!
B00005R5G9|5.0|Love love love it Hollywood snap snap and extra snap! A super cute fun movie it never gets old a must see.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry birds is an amazing game it gets old after a while but I would recommend this game to a friend its awesome.
B00479SVBU|4.0|What I wanted; a reliable, simple way to play podcasts and music on long trips in a car without an AUX input, mostly with my iPod, but also with the flexibility to use SDHC as my source.<br /><br />The Pros: This met the basic needs quite nicely. Signal strength was sufficient for good quality sound. Controls are straightforward, though some are only available via the remote. Delivery was as expected. An e-mail from Satechi inquiring about the delivery experience was a good sign. The unit worked immediately and the product video was informative.<br /><br />The Cons: There are a couple of minor downsides: the USB connector will not charge an iPod. I upsold myself to this unit from the Ultimate which does charge, and this was a mistake on my part;The Shuffle function works on the whole file system, and I would prefer it shuffled within folders a la playlist shuffling. The display is quite small, and almost impossible to read from a normal driver's position, so navigation requires being stopped unless you want to endanger yourself or others. If you want to switch to FM radio, the unit needs to be off or there is interference. I would prefer that the navigation function overrode shuffle, but it does not, so you need to adapt to that. There is no way to delete played items, though that might be a Pro for some. None are deal breakers.<br /><br />Bottom line: seems well made, would not hesitate to recommend. Pay attention to details when buying; this is not a case where paying more gets you more, it gets you different.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|Another great instalment. Just when you think the have ran out of ways for people to die, they make another one and surprise the hell out of you. I especially like the ending, totally threw me for a loop.
B0012IWNTA|5.0|I had great time watching both concert and bonus extras. It was really fascinating to watch how the Beautiful World concert came to life, what ideas led to its creation. Overall, it's not JUST concert, it's a very theatrical  and sometimes conceptual show that you gotta see. Extras disk provides alot of information about the process of creating the show, follows band members on their tour in Europe, shows plenty of backstage action, which is hilarious at times, i loved it!
1573300403|5.0|Purchased both of the History Films. If you are looking for a perfect collection of MJ's most popular videos. These DVD's will be the perfect collection. It inlcudes the full length version of his exteneded videos (which is something many other's don't). So if you are looking for a DVD collection of his best video's this would be the one. 5 thumbs up!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved Wool so much, I read all five books in just a few days.  Unlike many other lame Kindle reads in this genre, the author gives you just enough detail to piece things together as the characters do, rather than knowing for hundreds of pages exactly what is going to happen.  I had so many moments of genuine surprise at moments I didn't see coming that I couldn't put the book down till I'd finished it.  I'm about to buy [[ASIN:B007UAUPZS First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) (Wool)]] and I can't wait to read that too!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|only issue is that I keep having it do weird things at a higher level.<br />  keep having to restart the game.
B005KA188S|5.0|I hope there is a sequel just so I can see Colin Farrell reprise his role. He did such a great job of playing a vampire, I is actually kind of creepy how good he was at it. Having McLovin in this movie didn't hurt either. Lol. Check this one out and sit back and enjoy!
0345803485|1.0|Seeing a book like this on the \\"Bestselling\\" list really makes me wonder about the marketing process involved with a novel. After reading it, I really don't understand its appeal. Is it the simple language? The grammatical errors? The utter lack of personality in the heroine?<br /><br />If it were about the sex scenes, I can list dozens of other books from quality authors. I really don't understand how this book became so popular.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|The fourth volume famously drove us fans crazy -- Mr.Martin said it was half of a too-big book, and the other half would soon follow. He lied. It was five years later. And that danged fourth book had NO TYRION. I liked what it did have, but no Tyrion??? Well, we get plenty of Tyrion in the fifth. Though i'm not sure Mr. Dinklage will want to do some of those things. Oh, well. I do wonder what the tv version will do. You can bet that they won't do season four without Tyrion.
B007SY3CEW|5.0|[[ASIN:B007SY3CEW Piano Master]]. First off, let me say that I do not know how to play the piano. This app is awesome!  I can actually play music with it and my wonderful husband loves to listen to me play.....even with my flubs. :-)
B00005V9HH|5.0|Out of the mind of Christorpher McQurrie comes this incredible story of a man in search of the devil. The film is called \\" The Usual Suspects\\" and what could be more appropriate than an unusual movie about five suspects who are anything but usual. The story originates with the only survivor of what the police conclude was a murderous and explosive drug deal gone bad. His name is Roger Kint (Kevin Spacey is perfect) also known as 'Verbal.' From the mouth of this innocent storytelling, con-artist comes the fantastic tale of how he and his fellow criminals, Stephen Baldwin, is Michael McManus, Benicio Del Toro is Fred Fenster and Kevin Pollak as Todd Hockney were originally assembled and then set-up. Beginning with a mix-up by law enforcement to put several guilty men together in the same line up, the tale proceeds cross country and culminates with a powerful, but mysterious kingpin by the name of Keyser Soze. It's through his attorney, Kobayashi (Pete Postlethwaite), the men learn they are marked for death unless they undertake a dangerous assignment. The center piece of the Unusual group is their leader, a remarkable individual named Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne, incredible performance). What transpires in this movie from moment to moment is a lesson in sleigh of hand. What we and the police Dave Kujan, (Chazz Palminteri) are told is not what we see. Conversely, what we see is not what we have been told. In the end, this film with it's haunting theme by John Ottman, is nothing short of incredible. A superb classic in both mystery and action entertainment, by Bryan Singer. A great film indeed. ****
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|What can be said about this movie that hadnt already been said? This is a great movie with wonderful acting by the late Keith Ledger. If you havent seen it already, shame on you what are you waiting for check it out.
B000077VR3|3.0|Moulin Rouge is a musical and I want to say that again. Moulin Rouge is a musical that contains no more than half dozen lines outside of lyrics. The songs do carry the story of a young man (Ewan McGregor) in love with a working girl (Nicole Kidman) and the tragedy that follows.<br /><br />The songs are love songs taken from popular hits over the years. Lacking was the famous chorus line that Offenbach had in mind when he wrote \\"Gay Parisian\\" (or \\"Can-Can\\"), as it is sometime referred.<br /><br />Overall the film was good and entertains well.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book was amazing!!!! Very strong story, touching love-SERIOUSLY GOOD ROMANCE!! No smut-just love-its safe for younger readers!!! Loved this book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Holy cow, the skinny lady HURT me!  I try to \\"work out\\" (or so I thought) at the gym regularly and Jillian still kicked my butt in just a fraction of the time.  I am sure I will see results through continuous use of this video.  Like others have said, she is a great motivator and made me keep going when I just wanted to curl up in a ball.  I would high-five her but I can't lift my arms anymore.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. basically the more you play the more points you get. the more points you have the more animals you can buy. you can also win animals by passing each level, which you do by collecting points. with each animal you can buy a companion, and then two babies to complete the family. with each family completed you get so many extra points for each family. you can also decorate your village, play side games, and visit other peoples villages. the only down side is that once you get so far in the game you need a lot more coins and acorns to buy things, which is costly. also when you buy a baby they each take so many hours to hatch and you can only get one baby at a time. also I am having a hard time with the assiagnment of liking and visiting other villages. no matter how many times I visit and like them the game is not saving it every time I go back to home it doesn't show that I liked or visited amy of the villages. so I ended up buying acorns so I could pay to skip the challenge. overall it is a fun game to play, it just takes time to buy and accomplish families if you don't buy points.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|This was one badass, hold on to the edge of your seat action movie. Plenty of gun fire, fights, and explosions even for the most die hard action fans, and the cast definitely doesnt let you down. From Rambo to the Terminator and from The Texas Rattle Snake to The Punisher, just about every great action hero is stuffed in here and wrapped with a bow, just ticking to explode. This is a must see! P.S. If your fav action hero is missing check out number two, everyone they seemed to miss in 1 they got for 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is slightly difficult sometimes but once I start playing it I never want to stop until I complete it! !!! I play this game every single day only because I love it
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great product. Works well. I have enjoyed playing.there's a lot of things to build and upgrade.very cheap.its excellent for kindle fires. That's what I have it on.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|Sam Harris writes clearly and succinctly, explaining how and why the concept of free will is actually an illusion.  As a leading neuroscientist, he knows what he is talking about.  It is easy to read in one sitting, and offers a different outlook than I've heard before.I highly recommend it!
B00471JSR4|5.0|This was a kickass movie. The suits were awesome and Channing Tatum was at his best as usual. That dude is awesome, if you havent seen him in fighting check out that one to.
0307949508|5.0|This was by far my favorite book of the trilogy. The reader gets to learn more about the intriguing Lisbeth Salander and each new tidbit leaves you longing for more. In so many books, the action is led by the male hero and the heroine is the one who investigates, researches and theorizes. Not so in this book. Salander drives the action, while Blomkvist rides shotgun as the quieter researcher. Both are important to the story, but the gender reversal was refreshing.
B006UG90RM|3.0|Look, I first saw VH live when they were an unknown, hard-working struggling backup band.  I'm pretty sure I have all of their albums: some hot, some not.  This one *sounds* like Van Halen, but the song writing, production and the mix are all a swing-and-a-miss.  I'm not sure who they made this for - but it wasn't for the listener.<br /><br />Next?
B007BZM3HK|1.0|This song is catchy, and gets in my head, BUT the lyrics!!!!!  My daughters love the song, but I end up just laughing!
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This is the best fast and furious movie by far! Awesome stunts, great acting, and plenty of star power, and with number six approching the star power seems to be growing. If your a fan don't miss this one, you will be kicking yourself if you do.
0060873027|2.0|An odd mix of nanotech and \\"Fantastic Voyage.\\" It bogged down in the middle, and I was tempted not to finish it. In honor of Michael Crichton and how much I've loved his books, I plowed through. I found that the micro-view of the characters to be unbelievable. Seen from a bug's perspective, a tree isn't a tree as much as it is a wall, an obstruction, a monumental object to be overcome. The characters weren't particularly likable. Decent resolution but overall not an outstanding effort.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am very pleased with this product and with the price. Would recommend as a necessary go along for any Kindle Fire purchase.
0312641893|4.0|Review originally published on my blog: [...]    Marissa Meyer's first installment in the Lunar Chronicles, Cinder, is the classic story of Cinderella with a sci-fi, dystopian twist...I must say, it's unlike anything I've read before. And quite honestly, I'm not sure how I feel about it. I didn't hate it, but neither did I fall in love. Obviously, going into it, I knew that Cinder (a cyborg) was the Cinderella-figure, and that Prince Kai was supposed to fall in love with her, just like Prince Charming did \\"back in the day.\\" The whole cyborg-thing was a little weird, in that my basic understanding of robots and etc. didn't identify cyborgs as being able to feel. But apparently, in the world of Cinder, cyborgs are humans who've been injured, or \\"damaged,\\" somehow and have steel/robotic parts installed. (Sort of like high-tech prostheses, with a slightly creepy twist).    So basically, we have a Cinderella story set in a world with droids and cyborgs, and other crazy advanced technologies, that still has a major weakness: the inability to cure or even treat The Plague ravaging the country. Not to mention some crazy tension between Earth and the Lunars (a colony of people living on the moon. And I thought the cyborg bit was weird; these people are creepy-devious!). It's a complex little environment, and obviously deals with a lot more issues than \\"just Cinderella\\" - but Meyer does a good job of integrating Cinder's story into the bigger picture. Even though I figured out the twist of the story very, very early on in the book, it was an interesting read.
B00447G2PM|5.0|This was a great 3D movie. It looks like you are under the sea with the fish. The only downside was the length of the film. It sucks shelling put twenty bucks(thats what I paid for it at best buy) for a 40 min movie, but if you are looking for a quality 3D movie, then its worth it
0007447868|3.0|I REALLY love the first three books. They kept me wanting more and I even got headaches because I couldn't just stop reading.<br /><br />But this 4th book kind of bored me. Why, i ask, keep adding characters? Do I want to know about more people, still? I am sure that it all has a purpose at the end but I chose to read the end without having to read Brienne's perils and those new stories he added.<br /><br />I pretty much just want to know what happens to the original characters without having to read through new ones. That said, it looks like we will know the end of the series by the year 3000.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm waiting for the price of the 5th book to go down to buy it and am ready to skip pages like crazy....
B004I744AS|5.0|This app works well on my kindle fire.  I wanted a dict. that I could use to look up words without getting on line.  I enjoy the daily word games and the extra information for each day.  Excellent work developers.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|Maybe I didn't read the fine print.  I got the app for my son to play since he's a big Angry Birds fan, but it won't open on the Kindle Fire.
B001GCUO52|5.0|I am a big fan of the Final Destination films ever since the first one. I have watched everyone and they keep the thrills alive in each one. After the first two they start to get a little cheesy but thats what makes them so fun, they dont take it so seriously, they come up with new cool, sometimes very painful ways for people to die. If you enjoy 1000 ways to die, you have to check these out.
B004I744AS|5.0|The word of the day is great. This Day in History and Article of the Day  are very good extras for this app. More than just a dictionary.
0307951529|5.0|I love that this book doesn't just \\"talk\\" about what you can do to start or advance your business but actually gives you step-by-step advice.  It's a non-fiction book that almost reads like a workbook (except for the fantastically applicable anecdotes).  The checklists and one page templates are simple enough to get you to take action yet thorough enough that you won't get yourself into trouble.  I particularly love the Decision-Making Matrix.<br /><br />If you're naturally a systems-loving person you'll be happy that this book speaks your language, if you're not, you'll be ecstatic that someone has created the systems for you.  All you have to do is follow them!<br /><br />I recommend this book to all entrepreneurs, new and experienced!
0345803485|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I read the entire series in one week (while I work a full time job :)  It's a great read for anyone who like an out of the box sexual fantasy laced with a love story that, for me, was oddly tender and touching.  Buy the books, buy into the hype b/c it was a great read and fun excape into a sexual fantasy of a love story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app. It allows me to switch versions when I encounter a bible study or message being presented in something other than my preferred.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great game after the recent update.  was glitchey but much improved.  u don't need to buy stuff with real money, u can manage to do well without those upgrades.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|pretty fun game. kinda reminds me of the army of darkness game. but it is good nonetheless. plus its free
B000QRIGLC|5.0|An incredibly motivating and inspirational book.  This book draws you directly into the action and you feel as if you suffer with Marcus through indoc, hell week and all they way through their stand on Murphy Ridge.<br /><br />He takes a couple of very well aimed shots at the Liberals and the Liberal media and I think hits with deadly accuracy.<br /><br />Anytime I'm going through a rough time in life I'll pick this book up and remind myself, tough guys never quit, never!
0143121006|3.0|As a serious reader of non-fiction history/military I found this book read like a novel.....a mystery novel at that.  That is not all bad if that is your style. The book  redeems itself as a quick read  and I  enjoyed how the author threaded  history, people and feel of Peking at that time.  Glad I did not spemd  more than  an evening reading. Book just didn't do it for me.
0451457994|5.0|I bought this same book when it first hit the book stores. Read it, saw the movie<br />(I got a much better understanding of the movie by doing this), and lent the book<br />to someone, never to be seen again ! I have the DVD of \\"2001\\" and looked for another<br />copy of the book, for the same reason stated above. Found the best deal here. The<br />book was in very good condition as stated. Now I will better understand the movie<br />the next time I view it. Checked the local book stores, none to be had, only by<br />online purchase, which brought me to Amazon. It pays to look here first !!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this now for months. It has taken me awhile to figure out how to use it. The learning curve is a bit steep. The effort has been well worth it! Praise the Lord!
B007SGM084|4.0|This Trilogy is why I am so glad I own a kindle.  When I finished one book I started the other.  I have never read a romance novel like this.  There is intrigue, suspense, but most importantly it is sensual.  You will be hot and bothered all the time.  It is humorous and inventive.  I did think that the wealth of the main character was over the top.  I wish that having money did not always go hand in hand with good romance reads  and movies.  But oh well. other than that it was great. I finished the series in 3 days and have enjoyed them immensely.  I have to see what else this writer has authored.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The movie was excellent and that is what the rating is for. Great story, plenty of laughs and the visual effects are absolutly spectacular on blu-ray!  Both hard copies of the movie are excellent!  I must admit though, the digital copy is absolutly worthless.  The resolution and quality of it is soo bad as to be nearly unwatchable. Its really not helping to stop all the illegal torrents flying around the internet when the quality of the purchased digital copy pales in comparrison to the illegal copies.  I am not in any way condoning the illegal downloading of coprited material and I DO NOT take part in illegaly downloading material, I'm just saying it would make sense for the records companies to put a little more effort into the quality of their digital products.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|very fun and addictive game, I just can't seem to put it down, come and join the fun and be my neighbor
B007IJEMAA|5.0|Though for real collection, this is not as good as the CD version, high quality mp3 is still a good choice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am a rather picky reader, but, this book had me glued; I was constantly turning the pages to find out what was happening next.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THis book was extremely, edge of your seat exciting.  Highly recommend reading it before seeing the movie!  It kept me reading and reading nonstop.
B00634GHJA|5.0|absolutely a must-have if you have numerous devices.  its quick &amp; effort-less.  love...love....love it!<br />definitely a 5 star app.  I'd give it more stars if possible!
B003QSOFFO|5.0|Awesome movie rental! I enjoyed watching as much as my 2 year old did! Would definitely recommend to others too!
006117758X|4.0|It is an interesting book in the sense that I didn't really like any of the characters, especially the narrator, but I couldn't put the book down.  It was was written, funny where it needed to be and poignant.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you're a dog lover, this one is for you.  Based on a true story,  while  at times very sad, it's also a feel good movie.  It's about the adoption of a lost puppy and the bond that develops between the the dog and his male owner.  Watching them train each other as they become inseparable.  Towards the end, it's the dog's story of love and  commitment that grabs at the heart.
B002ZG997C|5.0|The most amazing & clever movie. A movie that portays the power & importance of reading, hearing & obeying God's word. Amazing acting performances from all the actors. Thank you Hughes brothers for coming up with the brilliant idea to makie this movie. I dont know the purpose in which you guys made this movie but I believe God used you & Denzel in a special way. I read the Word of God sometimes & mostly listen to preachers but since Ive seen this movie Ive made a vow to read the Word of God more consistently &  as much I can & it has blessed & changed my life. Now I can see who I am as a Christian in Christ Jesus & I can finally grasp entirely what my pastor preaches. Thank you guys so much for letting yourselves be used by God!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I thought this game was really fun.  It puts a different spin on the angry birds game.  Very fun and entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|its your classic bible i love it it is soooo awsome like the real bible i love it and we all have our own opinions this is just mine
0062119044|5.0|I've just finished reading this and have already began re-reading it.  Like watching a movie twice because you missed something the first time.  In my first reading of this very clever novel, I was horrified by the blatant coldness of the main character.  However, the more you read it you begin to understand, and then you understand more, and more, and more.<br /><br />Both my daughters are reading it as well.  One of them has finished it and the other is still reading.  The phone calls back and forth discussing this book have been nail biting, suspenseful and wonderful.<br /><br />My daughter said it best...\\"It was horrifying to read, impossible to put down\\".<br /><br />Well done Ms. Shriver!!
B0058UXHHK|5.0|(Written under my husband's name) This book was delightful! It's difficult to find what I call \\"well-written fun fiction.\\" You either get literature concerning deep spiritual or psychological struggle/trauma, or a light-hearted story with shallow characters, poor plot development, and sloppy editing. Denise's story achieved the perfect balance. It has great characters, great plot, and great romance. The contrast between the innocent Rose and her worldly, complicated adversaries worked well. The story line was well thought out, and I appreciated that it flowed seamlessly - enough to keep me turning pages and unable to predict the exact outcome. For the most part, none of the characters did anything that didn't make sense. (I get annoyed with characters who do things simply for the sake of the plot, leaving me indignantly thinking, \\"Why would they do that?\\") Even though the story begins with a murder and I found myself tearing up at times, I never felt manipulated or sucked into a deep drama. And some parts were downright funny! Had I not grown up in the south, I might have found Rose's naiveity unbelievable. But her thoughts, language, and experiences were genuine for me. Definitely recommend it for both the romance and the suspense!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This moveie was stellar!I found it totally captivating unlike other Mission Impossible movies this keeps you in your seat,I didnt even microwave popcorn,A Bravia!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|But i wish they added new words. I've become  an  expert  at drawing pokemon and jumpropes. Also, I haven't figured out how to delete games.

0393057658|5.0|Reading this book was a breath of fresh air! Michael Lewis is able to show how rational and objective thinking can be applied to all areas of life, business and even in baseball. Narrated in the manner of a novel, it engaged me to a point that I couldn't put it down. I finished the book in 3 days, that's how engaging it is! I pride myself in being rational and objective as possible, but this book was able to motivate me to push those facets even further, especially in applying math and statistics to objectively find out rational solutions.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is a true time killer it looks as if it's simple but, once u get into it the challage begins. All is needed is a few more levels..

B003LSTK8G|4.0|I guessed all along that a kindle edition is identical to a real book.<br />No, not really.<br />On page 32 (25th line) of 'The Big Short'(real book), it reads 'even though' which is mis-typed in kindle edition as 'even thought'.<br />For foreigners like me, this addition of un-necessary 't' causes a headache to figure out what's happening.<br />If you have to type everything again to make a kindle edition, please be more attentive not to confuse your customers.
B0007152JG|4.0|Wonderful collection of real letters between an American book collector and an English used bookseller.  Quick, funny read.  They only sad part is that if you go to 84 Charing Cross Road in London, there is a Pizza Hut there now.  But there are several used booksellers nearby to give you the flavor of what might have been there.

B000002GYR|5.0|I've had this disc for years and for some reason or another I never played it until now, May 2012. I have most of Toms albums but this evaded me. WOW!

It's now my favorite  by Tom.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I have never listened to a soundtrack, never in my life. Never thought I would, for that matter. But, after watching Tron:Legacy, I wasn't the biggest fan of the movie, but I loved the music! It is amazing, as this review's title says. :) I usually always have playing on my mp3 player Thousand Foot Krutch and FM Static, my favorite bands. So I thought it was kind of weird for me to like this electronica-pop-synthesizer stuff (since TFK is hard rock), but I have already listened to the whole CD four times since I bought it this morning. I would definitely recommend this album. Get the whole thing. It rules. And, BTW, I am becoming a very big Tron fan, thanks to this awesome CD!! And I watched the first Tron, and I really really enjoyed that one. I think everyone needs to watch that one if they've seen, or are going to see, the second one, because it really helps to understand it all. Thank you all you Tron people!!
B003K15INU|2.0|This is the fourth Philip Roth novel I have read, and it is by far the best.  In presenting the story of the effect on Swede and his family of his daughter's terrorist bombings during the anti-Vietnam war protests of the 60's, Roth intersperses the narrative with what are, in effect, essays about the immigrant experience, the decline of American cities, race relations, the violent student anti-war protestors/terrorists, and others.  Roth is an incredibly articulate and forceful writer, and this book deserves all of the critical praise which it has received.<br /><br />I was VERY disappointed with the Kindle e-book version of the novel.  It is riddled with errors (e.g., symbols for letters, divided words, run-on sentences due to missing punctuation, and the like) which seriously interfered with the reading experience.  I would have given the book a 5-star rating were it not for these errors.  Whoever was responsible for creating the digital edition of this novel should be ashamed of themselves.  If they had hired even a literate high school student at minimum wage to proofread the book before publication, most of the errors could have been eliminated.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|First, I should say I have loved everything they have done except 'Night Train'('My Shadow' would be the only real exception...); the natural progression from album to album has been both joyful and challenging at times, but each one seems to reflect how the band is feeling at that point; Perfect Symmetry was hard to adapt to at first, but after many listens, I finally get what they were doing: having fun after all the 'Tom Turmoil'(which made for great 'UTIS' songs...)...<br /><br />This CD continues in that direction, but is def a return to earlier sounding days at times; there are plenty of Keane trademarks throughout this CD, songs that reflect everything from 'She Says She Has No Time' to 'Nothing In My Way'; The first 5 songs pretty much establish the greatness of this album('You Are Young' is pop perfection...), only to be sidetracked by a more Mt Desolation sounding tune('On The Road'...)there are 2 other songs on here that I feel could have been cut, but songs like 'Black Rain' and 'Neon River' make for some very nice surprises.<br /><br />Tom has rarely sounded better; his range and ability are more than apparent, and while there are a few moments of somewhat contrived lyrics, he never misses a note, and his melodies always take you on a different path than you think they may be going; the production is solid and rich; Tim's keys are intricate and layered, and the presence of Jesse on bass adds a layer of drive to a lot of the songs; Richard is just a fantastic drummer, truly underrated I think. Excellent harmonies by all, and lots of note/chord progressions to supply a chill up your spine.<br /><br />Also, I am kind of tired of hearing people say it's not 'Hopes & Fears'; No, it's not; it's 8 years later, and the band has been thru some hard times & changes, inc the addition of a new band member; I don't think they have ever lost touch w/their roots(except Night Train...)and what made 'Hopes...' great; and while it sometimes is a challenge to hear those influences on their later work, they are there.<br /><br />This album marks another step forward w/a slight step in an expanded direction; but the Keane roots are there on this album just waiting to be found and enjoyed; they make the albums they feel like making at the time, and I can live w/that.<br /><br />I LOVE this CD!!!!nfluences on their later work, they are there.<br /><br />This album marks another step forward w/a slight step in an expanded direction; but the Keane roots are there on this album just waiting to be found and enjoyed; they make the albums they feel like making at the time, and I can live w/that.<br /><br />I LOVE this CD!!!!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|As a high school English teacher, I heard a great deal of buzz about The Hunger Games series. My students were constantly bringing the books up during discussion, and they frequently suggested I read the series. I was admittedly skeptical since I knew the type of literature (if one can call it that) my students tended to gravitate towards. I ended up purchasing the trilogy as a Kindle book for a trip I took in April just so I would have something to read and a possible point of reference to use with my students.<br /><br />It turns out I thoroughly enjoyed the trilogy. The writing is compelling; I had difficulty putting my Kindle down. The plot moves along at a brisk pace without sacrificing attention to detail. The story itself is a gripping read; I found myself drawn in to the conflicts faced by the characters. The characters, while somewhat stereotypical for literature directed at young adults, were engaging and evoked a range of emotions within me from sympathy to anger and everything in between.<br /><br />I will not go so far as to say the trilogy represents a significant moment in literature or that I would consider the books to be worthy of teaching in a school curriculum. However, for what the trilogy is (escapist literature...the kind of read one would bring to the beach), I consider The Hunger Games trilogy to be an excellent option. If one is looking for a gripping story full of dynamic characters and unexpected plot twists, The Hunger Games Trilogy is a sure-fire winning pick.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I used to be so addicted to angry birds! I payed for regular seasons and Rio. those were all great! but now angry birds isn't like it used to be. the original was plain and simple and addicting. I played this on my friends phone and I hare it. I think Rovio let all the money from advertising and merchandise go to their heads. this is a poor excuse for an Angry Birds game if toy ask me.
0571279163|5.0|I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads.<br /><br />The Expats is a fantastic spy thriller that kept me hooked from beginning to end. I was initially unconvinced by the flashback/flashforward presentation of the story, however as the story went on this helped to clarify the situation Kate was in while still allowing the author to throwing twist after twist at the reader, until the ending was as unpredictable as anything that came before it.<br /><br />Kate and Dexter are your average American couple, raising 2 young boys and struggling to make ends meet, until Dexter informs Kate that they are moving to Luxembourg where he has unexpectedly received a lucrative job offering. Having known she wanted something different in her life, without quite knowing what that is, Kate agrees and begins tying up loose ends. Although it's a littler harder for her than it would be for most wives, considering that her loose ends revolve around a 15-year career at the CIA.<br /><br />As we follow Kate's journey across the ocean and into a new country, we soon learn, as does she, that nothing is as it seems. Sweet unassuming Dexter has more than one secret he is keeping and some of the Expat wives Kate meets and befriends are not at all what they seem to be on the surface. In fact soon Kate finds herself embroiled in a mystery that rivals anything she encountered in her years with the CIA. She'll need to brush off her rusty field skills to figure this one out before it destroys her family.<br /><br />My only reservation about this book is the very very end - literally the last 2 pages. The rest was pure enjoyment, with fleshed out characters, interesting twists and turns in the storyline, and a heroine that readers are invested in. Kate is smart and funny and determined and dedicated to her family and not at all perfect, which makes her relatable and easy to spend time with - and spend time with her I did, once I sat down with this book it was very hard to get back up!p!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Unlike most students, I did not have the pleasure of reading this classic and well-loved novel at school. And to be honest, it would not normally have made my reading list. But having read the Twilight novels three times, and Wuthering Heights being featured and quoted so many times, after a while I got curious and thought the only way to better understand the comparisons made by Stephenie Meyer, I just had to read it. At first, the old fashioned language took some getting used to, but once I'd gotten over that, the first third of the book started to really interest me. The characters created by Emily Bronte are certainly very unique, and the depths of their evil surpassed any characters I have come across to date. I was intrigued and started to really enjoy the novel, to the point where I was quite unable to put it down. In the end, I have to admit I was totally disappointed. What promised to be quite an exciting tale of unusual characters and a touch of haunting, left me completely unsatisfied, and questioning why this has become such a classic. I thought it was extremely well written, very interesting characters and well thought out, but in the end it was just someone's life story, that never really \\"got going\\". Given when this was written, I can certainly understand the waves such a novel would have made in the world of literature, but it just does not measure up to the modern day offering. I would say it is a good novel to read to have a better understanding of how this has shaped authors over the years, and perhaps us as readers too. I was just left feeling like there should and could have been more...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was Twilight fanfiction called Master of the Universe and is/was online for free. It galls me that the author simply changed the characters' names and now charges money for what she used to give away. She used the fanfiction community as her test audience and to create buzz/hype for what, at best, is badly written porn. I've read other fanfiction authors who could write circles around Ms. James.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I finished this book within 24 hours of purchase! But why not a 5 star review?? It's certainly a page turner, but I'm extremely conflicted about this book.  The writing is awful, the characters are just so ridiculous- I don't really LIKE any of the characters, the protagonist is extremely dense and naive, the book is written from her perspective and there are times where her thoughts, wishes and insecurities are just painfully repetitive.  The positives about this book is that its very descriptive with very frequent adult situations presented.  I really do think its changing millions of bedrooms around the world, probably for the better.<br /><br />This is a book thats for adults, not to be taken literally or too seriously... don't think too hard or try to analyze this story too much just enjoy it as imaginative foreplay, inspiration for your fantasies or your bedroom.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT GREAT LITERATURE AND NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.<br /><br />I am not a Twilight fan, I don't mind the movies, however I despised the first book.  Sorry Twilight fans but it had the most mind numbing dialogue, I couldn't get through half the first book though I tried several times and even being somewhat entertained by the first movie I attempted to pick it up again... so anyways my point is you don't have to be a Twilight fan to be enthralled by Fifty Shades of Grey.  I'm going to read the whole series but do have a love-hate relationship with it.  Its a relief that the author admits she's not the best writer, she's not but I respect that she's brought something so successful and buzz worthy.  I've bonded with women of all ages over this book, its getting a dialogue started, getting people to read, and its awakening peoples sensuality!

B003GK2216|5.0|This sequel was everything I had hoped for and yet so much more! I first fell in love with the Kingsbridge characters when I watched the Channel 4 mini series of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" a few years ago. After that, I had to read Pillars of the Earth, and like most book-to-TV adaptations, there is just so much more in the book that just does not get featured on the small screen. World Without End is the sequel to Pillars of the Earth, and it was just as well, as the first book was only enough to serve as an appetiser for what became a thirst to know more about these weird and wonderful characters. Well over a 1000 pages long, this was by no means going to put me off. If anything, I would just as happily have started the book, had it had 5000 pages. The story of World Without End is set about a hundred year after Pillars of the Earth, so it is not a sequel in the common sense of the word. Once again I was in awe of Ken Follett's way in creating such complicated and interesting characters, the story is mesmerising and totally gripping. There is some reference in the novel to Pillars of the Earth, but you do not have to read that first. Set in medieval England, the characters live simple lives, which serves to contrast the extraordinary buildings they set to construct throughout the novel. The novel is complete fantasy, but I could not help but feel that this could so easily be an historic account of this fictitious town's history, and the way these simple people felt the need for buildings such as cathedrals. I absolutely loved this book, I could not put it down and I am already considering reading both novels again.
0385534639|5.0|The book looked promising after it had been chosen by a book group. I had not heard the advance reviews but when I began reading I checked the book jacket more than once. I initially found the characters creepy, entirely unsympathetic and the story a bit bizarre.<br /><br />Thankfully the terrific writing combined with short chapters kept me reading. I'm glad I did because I was entirely caught up in the story. The characters and context became clearer. I began to note the time changes and thoroughly appreciated the narrative.<br /><br />It's a tough title to categorize. At times I certainly though of Harry Potter but at others was reminded of the many characters, twists and turns and fantasies of the writing of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Whatever images are invoked for you the book is well worth the time and is ultimately a riveting read.

6305511055|5.0|When this movie first came out, I was an engineering graduate student.  Bell Labs was a mythical land that all engineering and physics graduate students knew as the center of the world for electronics research.  The hero, as an omnivorous reader who had worked at Bell Labs (where I would eventually post-doc), was therefore the sort of person with whom I could identify, and imagine capable of wondrous deeds.  He also epitomized the \\"hacker,\\" similar to the upperclassmen physics and engineering majors I knew in college--guys whose exploits including designing and fashioning master keys that could open almost any door at the university, misdirecting incoming phone calls to the jock dorm, and perverting the timekeeping function of the computer science building's Univac 1108 to grab free computer time.<br /><br />The Watergate Era hero finds himself as the lone survivor of an onslaught upon the CIA think tank where he works--an attack that fortunately occurred while he was out.  Accordingly he disappears into the city to plot his revenge.  With the help of a random girl who he initially holds captive (Faye Dunaway) he finds a way, though his Bell Labs acquired wiretapping skills and strategic vision, to turn the tables on his enemies!

B003QSMC18|2.0|This was definitely not one of Disney's best. It lacked the humor and originality that all the older Disney movies used to have. I would have said that this is good enough quality for your young kids to enjoy it, but I would not suggest any pre-teens watch it because of it's extensive dark undertones that would frighten young ones.
1466401885|5.0|Since there has been many reviews already written about this book I'll only say, \\"Abby & Travis's story of finally finding love and happiness was a Beautiful Disaster\\". An Absolute pleasure to read.

030788743X|5.0|This book was surprisingly exactly was I wanted, and I didn't even know it.<br /><br />From the start with Wade revealing his living situation to the epic,(albeit completely predictable) ending, this book is one large John Hueghs, Robert Zemekis, 80's trivia thon.<br /><br />I admit that there were parts in the story that I wanted to just get beyond, and there was a slight break in my suspension of disbelief with how good Perzival was at classic video games, but even with its flaws this book had me hooked the second \\"Ready Player One\\" appeared on the protagonists screen.<br /><br />If anyone out there loved Scott Pilgrim vs The World, any video game in the late 80's, Dungeons & Dragons, ore anything else from their childhood, you will appreciate the obsessive nature this book portrays.<br /><br />I recommend this book to everyone who wants to have a nostalgia rush.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|12/2/2015 - Still going strong. This watch is easily one of the best purchases I've made. Battery life is still VERY good - 5 to 6 days with daily use; GPS location is quick (within 1 minute). Awesome, awesome watch!<br /><br />Update: 9/25/14<br /><br />Over two years since I first started using this device; I'm thoroughly satisfied. Definitely one of the best purchases I've made. The watch continues to work accurately, I've had to empty out the internal memory once, and replace the HRM battery twice. The rechargeable battery inside the watch still holds a charge for 3-5 days with daily use. Garmin updated their website a while back, I had to delete the software from the computer and reload it, no problems since.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />I purchased this about a month ago; after doing a fair amount of research on GPS watches as well as reading several of the reviews. I had been using the Nike+ foot pod with my IPod for about a year (found out that the distance measured was literally off by a mile - I thought I had been doing 8 mile loops, only to have the GPS measure the loop at 7 miles. I used both devices one day to test the difference, 405CX said I ran 10 miles, Nike+ said 11.25 mi; Google maps confirmed it was 10 mi).<br /><br />I have since then used this for several runs and a couple of bike rides. It works extremely well! I'm not a racer; on average I run 15-20 miles/week and do some cycling as well.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Extremely quick GPS location, usually immediate.<br />-Immediate HR monitor detection<br />-Great functionality.<br />-Website (connec.garmin) is AWESOME! plenty of geeking out on the data.<br />-Functions I don't yet know how to use.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Having never owned a GPS watch, this thing is a bit larger than any other watch I've owned.<br />-Functions I don't yet know how to use. The owner's manual doesn't cover much. The videos on the site are VERY helpful, and taking some time to play/navigate through the options is the best way to learn about it.<br /><br />There were several people concerned about the bezel and the sensitivity. It does take a few tries to figure out the sensitivity for the the 'tap' and 'hold, then drag' uses; just like it takes a few tries to understand the sensitivity of touch screen phones or any tracking device on a computer. I always lock the bezel, as I don't really need to be fiddling with my watch while running or cycling (akin to texting while driving)<br />The option to select 3 data types on 3 different screens works well for me. I have one screen set up for running, and another for cycling. I do not use the auto-scroll function.<br /><br />All in all, this watch is AWESOME!

0345803485|1.0|My inner goddess wanted to smack every single one of the characters in this book. And not in the fun way.<br /><br />Anastasia (picture me saying this name in an intense stern way with hooded eyes) was quite possibly the most obnoxious, doltish heroine I think I've ever read. Christian was unsexy and completely unbelievable. As a Portland native now living in Seattle I felt almost insulted that the author decided to situate this awful story in my towns, but that is neither here nor there.<br /><br />I could have almost (maybe) put up with this as a pure erotic piece if only the sex had been, uh, sexy. It's not. It's awkward. Clunky. The kind of sex that any sane girl of 21 would have done a whole \\"let's be friends\\" conversation after. Also, for a \\"BDSM\\" book, how vanilla can you get? \\"I'm not going to have sex with you until you sign this sexual dominance contract\\" \\"Okay, never mind, let's do it on the bed\\" Over and over! All hat, no cattle, I say.<br /><br />Terrible, horrible, juvenile. Don't bother. If you want some sexy and sweet erotic BDSM books with a STORY (here's one of the many places where Ana or Christian would *gasp!*) Try another James: Lorelei James. [[ASIN:B004AYDJM8 Slow Ride: A Rough Riders story]] Go ahead and look, I'll wait.<br /><br />Two final points: if anyone bit their lip as often as Ana does her lips would be horribly chapped. Her Carmex bill must be astronomical. Last, E.L. James: It may very well be that occasionally a lover does the favor of pulling a tampon out before ravishing his gal pal, but nobody wants to read about it. Nobody. Gross.
1401223176|5.0|This was my first Batman story, and it has remained my favorite. Jeph Loeb crafts a great tale here, mixing in intrigue, mystery and brutal action, all hallmarks of the Dark Knight. Nearly every major ally and villain in Batman's mythos comes along for the ride, and even Superman comes into play. The story is paced perfectly, keeping the reader on their toes as to who, exactly, is the mysterious Hush, and what motivates his grand scheme to bring down Batman?<br /><br />Art is handled by Jim Lee, and it is handled superbly. The detailed, gritty style suits Batman perfectly, and meshes seamlessly with the tone of the story, right down to the colors getting brighter in Metropolis (it always seems to be dark in Gotham and sunny in Metropolis). Batman and his cohorts all have a certain style in their fighting, from the rough brawling style of Huntress, to the graceful acrobatics of Nightwing and Catwoman, to the savagery of Killer Croc and the epic might of Superman. Everything looks and feels just right.<br /><br />I will say, however, that this may not be the best `first Batman story' you could pick, as significant knowledge of Batman's allies and enemies is required to really understand the scope of what's going on. Here is a rundown of who you need to know:<br /><br />Heroes involved: Batman, Superman (and some of his support cast, including Krypto, Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Perry White), Catwoman, Nightwing (Dick Grayson), Robin (Tim Drake), Commissioner Gordon, Huntress and Oracle.<br /><br />Villains involved (spoilers contained): Hush (who is introduced here), Joker, Harley Quinn, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Riddler, Scarecrow, Two Face, Clay Face and both Ra's and Talia Al Ghul.<br /><br />Obviously with a cast this big some characters get a little short on page time. Nightwing in particular has little to do, showing up for one issue to have a little (well done) character development with Batman and helping him kick some ass before returning to Bludhaven, which I found a little sad as Dick Grayson is actually my favorite member of the Bat-Family. On the other hand, this story piqued my interest in Huntress, whom is quite badass when she shows up, and she is slowly growing on me. Catwoman is also well done in this book, and this story provides a big turning point in her complicated relationship with Batman.<br /><br />For Batman fans, this is absolutely a must have. The story is superb, the art is great, and if your familiar with all the mythos involved, this is a very rich book.found a little sad as Dick Grayson is actually my favorite member of the Bat-Family.

B005LAIGSM|4.0|Romance movies (often times referred to as Chick Flicks) have a tendency to be fodder for Kleenex advertisements: too often these movies are judged by how many times the lacrimal ducts give a stimulus response instead of the nature of the film itself.  THE VOW for all intents and purposes seems and sound and looks like a Nicholas Sparks recipe film, but the fact that is NOT by Sparks should alert the audience that there may be more here than expected.  Based on a true story, rendered by Stuart Sender and Jason Katims and adapted for the screen by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein, knowing that the concept is based on reality helps ground the film.

After an accident, Paige is left unconscious, and when she awakes she doesn't remember Leo. Her physician (Wendy Crewson) reassures her that her memory will likely return if she resumes a normal life. Her parents (Sam Neill and Jessica Lange), whom she hasn't since she and Leo got together, come and visit her - a rather strange situation since Paige has not had contact with her parents since she left law school (we later find out why the personal motivations) and moved to the city (Chicago) to pursue a career as a sculptor. For some reason Paige remembers her parents and her old friends (including a sister (Jessica McNamee)  with whom she broke ties five years ago, ditto an ex-boyfriend (Scott Speedman, remembered for his brilliant performance in 'The 24th Day') she abandoned. Leo and Paige's new family (Joey Klein, Joe Cobden and Shannon Barnett) want to bring her home with them but her parents demand she return to their expensive home to prepare for Paige's sisters wedding to a nice guy (Dillon Casey). She goes with Leo but when she doesn't recognize anything, she goes to her parents. When Paige returns to her parents she is puzzled as to why she left five years ago. Meanwhile Leo tries to win her back by courting her again.

0670022950|1.0|This book is very misleading.  When it comes to statistics there are a plethora of ways to come up with them.  Statistics are known to be biased and his statistics are cherry picked to push this theory.  Just because torture and violence are condemned and against the law doesn't mean people aren't still doing it, it just means they are good at hiding it and they wouldn't come out and say yes, I am breaking the law.  The numbers can never be accurate when it comes to calculating statistics based on criminal activity.  Torture is still practiced in the U.S.  Abortion is on the rise, abortion = violence.  While it may look like we are in a less voilent era that is not true, humans have recognized violence is wrong and are better at hiding it.  America has fought many wars in the last era including using nuclear weapons, where were the numbers behind those?
0307951529|5.0|Picked this book up in print from Amazon. Yes, like YOU, I have always thought of starting my own business. But never really had the nerve to get up and 'just do it'. Well, I couldn't put this book down. Two days later I have started putting a plan into action. I am inspired. I am now in action and am going to make this happen. I love the details that come out in this book. The players (mattress guy, yarn store owner etc.) are excellent examples of how regular people can actually start a self sustaining business. I admire the author and I admire the people he profiles. people who have chosen self employment. The author stays away from the MBA/business plan talk that I read about in many of these \\"entrepreneur\\" books. This is written in plain, simple language, with clear, specific examples from real people starting real businesses. The other thing that is very cool about this book --- the businesses are NOT high tech start ups that require millions in venture funding. Refreshing to read about tangible, real-life business start ups instead of the usual gambles on untested products with venture capital backing. Well done Chris G! Highly recommended.

I thought it was a little hokey and had us rolling our eyes several times, even as science fiction and fantasy movies go, but I bought it for the 3D and that was great, the best I've seen so far. The movie was filmed in 3D so there was lots of attention paid to those effects.  The scenery was beautiful and there were a lot of different scenery changes so it gave us a good idea of what is possible with passive lens 3D glasses [[ASIN:B003ZU0WCI 3D Glasses - Circular Polarized Clip on 3D Glasses for RealD and Disney Digital Theaters and Acer 3D Laptop - Stepup 3D- Dispicable Me, Toy Story 3D]] on an 3D TV.<br /><br />There were some great scenes in the movie and the 3D added to them, like the man eating plant that attacked the characters or the roller coaster type ride on mine shaft cars in the beginning.  There was another scene where the boy is climbing along a path of suspended rocks leading from one land mass to another over a VERY deep chasm.  If you don't like heights, you'll probably be covering yours eyes during this part! My five star rating is for the filming and the 3D effects rather than the story itself.

B0059XTV4Y|1.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />W.E.althy people.  Beautiful people.  W.E.ary people.<br /><br />The year is 1998.  Wally Winthrop, a rich, married and miserable New Yorker, finds solace in an exhibition recently opened at Sotheby's celebrating the circa 1930's romance of then Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson, an American woman for whose love he forfeited his throne.<br /><br />And by that feeble thread hangs this hollow bauble of a film.  From Cartier jewelry boxes and bottles of Chanel No. 5 to repeated flashes of uncorked Moët, every frame is a page from Vanity Fair.  The present-day Wally seemingly exists for no other purpose than to justify these gratuitous advertisements: she once had a job at Sotheby's, yet even the unhappy marriage for which she gave it up has not dulled her eye for the finer things.  Indeed, when she's not moping about her impossibly posh apartment she's moping about in Sotheby's, bringing herself to tears as she covets the luxurious artifacts from Wallis's and Edward's life together.  And once their romance is (rather quickly) established as the excuse for Wally to indulge her predilection, it only takes one awful dialogue - there are many of these, but the one that follows is perhaps the most audacious (and therefore the worst) - to drag the film from rather absurd into quite absurd: a security guard from Sotheby's has developed a crush on Wally, and he approaches her one day after an auction:<br /><br />Guard: So are you or aren't you?<br />Wally: Huh?<br />Guard: Going to bid on something?<br />Wally: Oh god no!<br />Guard: Why?<br />Wally: Too nerve-wrecking.<br /><br />And that's as tense as it gets, I'm afraid.  No wait.  The next day Wally bids $10,000 on a pair of Wallis Simpson's gloves.  Some pantomime spousal abuse is then shoe-horned in to give Wally's story some gravitas.  As for Prince Edward, his devotion to Wallis Simpson becomes so slavish that it's embarrassing.  Historically accurate or artistic license?  I haven't bothered to check, but it's cringingly insipid either way.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is an altogether pointless film in that, when it isn't advertising in its artistically artless way, it depicts improbable persons suffering unbelievable traumas.<br /><br />Clearly intended as a stopgap for Sex and the City 3.
B0069UV0LS|4.0|Let me just say this film took me totally by surprise because it hails from good old England. A land I have always regarded as courteous a place where the Government pays for refugees, a place where a lot of people from Africa find a convenient refuge. The Government is most pious and the tax payer's money is put to rather generous use. Now again this is just something I have grown up knowing because the English are a rare commodity in their own land. They have somehow been tight lipped about the whole thing too. As a common man who's been there a few times I just feel the English take too much from the world. Do correct me if I'm wrong, intact throw stones at me in the comments column. This is also possibly why films like THIS IS ENGLAND and TYRANNOSAUR right here hit you so hard in the face. While the subject matter is mostly not akin to what i have written so far about England, I found this film to be particularly driven, angry, violent, relevant because come on England, isn't the levy supposed to break?<br /><br />**SEMI STORY SPOIL BUT READ IF YOU'RE DARING**<br />Ty is a film based on a lonely woman who runs some sort of an everyday clothe shop and a middle aged bald angry drunk man who runs away from hooligans chasing him. He is being chased and he seeks temporary refuge in her shop. He enters the store and simply hides behind a line of clothes while she calls him out very politely. This is how they both meet and the story follows suit. NOW I MUST COMMEND the director for he made such an empirical film about very subtle downplayed lonely people who actually have a sea of anger inside them.<br /><br />This film was a joy to watch because despite it's strong slaps of violence, it is very human and relatable. I will not like to compare Tyrannosaur with any films that you have seen except maybe THIS IS ENGLAND because it is such a memorable film, an instantly memorable classic for me that comes once in a way.<br /><br />I loved it and it killed all my expectations.

The authors view with alarm the fact that since the last edition of this work was published, there has been further amendment to insolvency law by the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010 and other secondary legislation, which, as they mention `often goes through on the nod' without adequate consultation or scrutiny by Parliament'.<br /><br />All these developments are of course reflected in, and incorporated into, this latest edition, which has been completely updated and expanded to include much new material on liquidation practice and procedure, including the Insolvency (Amendment) Rules 2010 to changes to the rules governing administrations.<br /><br />New case law covered in includes: BNY Corporate Trustee v Eurosail...Contex Dreuzhba v Wiseman...Re Kayley Vending...Mourant v Sixty UK Ltd...Holland v HMRC...and Gray v G-T-P Group.<br /><br />For your further research into this fraught area of law, the book offers extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and other time-saving reference materials, including five appendices -- and all this in a single convenient volume.<br /><br />So, if you're a practitioner in this or related fields, \\"Loose on Liquidators\\" is both an authoritative and completely updated reference work which should be considered as an essential addition to your library.

1846613043|5.0|A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO THEIR TAXATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're a practitioner, or in any way involved professionally in advising internet businesses on matters of taxation, this practical guide from Jordans provides an up-to-date overview of the corporation tax and VAT issues relevant to the main aspects of internet business.<br /><br />Writing in an appropriately businesslike fashion, author Julian Hickey -- a partner at Bird & Bird LLP --  first examines the nature of internet business itself -- which we are sure most readers would find useful --  i.e. the structure and terminology of the e-commerce, IT, e-infrastructure and internet world, adding that no specific scheme of taxation pertains directly to internet business transactions.<br /><br />Therefore, as he explains, the setting up of and the day-to-day operation of internet businesses and e-commerce transactions have to be slotted into the general framework of tax law.  Consequently, a number of questions arise, of which the following are just two examples.  Can a non-UK e-tailer be taxed in the UK, for instance and under what circumstances?  And here's a complicated one: what are the VAT consequences when a UK customer accesses a website via a smart phone whilst travelling abroad and orders goods and/or services to be delivered in the UK?<br /><br />If you have cause to wonder or ponder over these complexities, you obviously need this book, which also considers potential tax issues that arise for shareholders in an internet-based company.<br /><br />As it has been ten years since the publication of the first edition of this volume, the emergence of this new second edition is indeed timely.  The proliferation over the past decade of internet business as well as consumer opportunities and social networks - Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, to name just three - has meant that most forms of business and services, including the law of course, could not possibly function without the use of information technology.<br /><br />Lucid, readable and meticulously footnoted the book is divided into six parts, which together constitute a practical guide, with  practical advice designed to steer the practitioner  down the most efficient, most accurate route to dealing with -- and ultimately solving - the tax problems of internet-based business clients.<br /><br />As you'd naturally expect, this new and up-to-date second edition contains new chapters and new material to reflect changes in the law over the past decade and the evolution and proliferation of internet activities. The author expresses the hope that this erudite and user-friendly volume will act as a first point of reference on this complex subject, both for those new to it and for more experienced advisers as well.<br /><br />Impressively researched, the book also contains extensive tables of cases, statutes, and statutory instruments, as well as tables of EC and other materials. There are nine appendices and a useful index at the back to facilitate ease of use.  For lawyers, particularly tax advisers, this book has to be an essential purchase.

0871404133|3.0|\\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" is Edward O. Wilson's latest book, published this year. Wilson is a leading myrmecologist who went on to become the grand old man of sociobiology.<br /><br />In my opinion, Wilson's book is over-hyped by the publisher. It's interesting, to be sure - you can take it from me, I'm a critic of sociobiology, while being somewhat fond of ants! However, the book is to a large extent simply a summary of Wilson's earlier books and scientific papers (which he often references). I consider it to be an introduction to Wilson, rather than some kind of dramatic, super-genial work on par with Darwin's \\"The Origin of Species\\".<br /><br />[GROUP SELECTION AMONG INSECTS]<br /><br />The main point of the book is to rehabilitate the concept of group selection, 36 years after \\"The Selfish Gene\\" by Richard Dawkins made the public aware of its burial by the Neo-Darwinists. Wilson no longer claims that W. D. Hamilton's ideas about kin selection can explain the evolution of eusociality among insects. Instead, he believes that complex insect societies (e.g. among hymenopterans) are a product of individual selection of queens, with the worker-castes being a kind of robotic extension of the queen's phenotype. There's also group selection targeting the entire colony. The chapters on insects are rather technical, but if Wilson is right, I wonder why inclusive-fitness selection was upheld for so long. Apparently, the concept never worked for termites, which evolved eusociality independently of the hymenopterans. According to Wilson, the concept didn't work very well for hymenopterans either, to the point where \\"kin\\" was defined in a completely arbitrary manner. Kin selection among social insects turned out to be a theoretical, arm-chair construct which simply didn't square with realities on the ground. Wilson was an early defender of Hamilton, but now believes the theory is erroneous. Personally, I'm not surprised: what makes us think that nature can be reduced to an exact mathematical formula of genetic kinship? (Here's a clue: reductionist materialism, which Wilson still upholds.)<br /><br />[GROUP SELECTION AMONG HUMANS]<br /><br />But, of course, nobody really cares about ants or termites anyway. The really contentious point of \\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" concerns us humans. Traditionally, sociobiologists have emphasized kin selection as the mechanism behind much of human evolution. By contrast, Wilson proposes a combination of individual selection and group selection.<br /><br />I admit that this makes a lot of intuitive sense. Once again, I wonder what took the Neo-Darwinists so long to revise their theories? Marshall Sahlins pointed out long ago in \\"The use and abuse of biology\\" that many human kinship systems aren't based on genetics at all. They might pit siblings against each other, while counting second cousins or completely unrelated persons as close kin. Since Sahlins was a Marxist constructivist, he was duly mocked by the sociobiologists, who preferred to remain oblivious to these basic anthropological facts.<br /><br />And what about Malinowski, hailed by sociobiologists as a precursor to their own theories due to his \\"functionalism\\"? Malinowski described how men among the Trobriand Islanders are (voluntarily?) cuckolded into adopting and rearing children of unfaithful wives, something incomprehensible from a kin selection viewpoint. The religion of the Trobrianders claim that sexual intercourse has nothing to do with procreation - instead, babies are born when free-floating spirits enter the womb of women. Thus, men would gladly adopt even children who couldn't possibly have been their own. Similar notions also exist among some groups of Aborigines. Group selection would explain all this rather neatly.<br /><br />Wilson points out that individual selection would tend to promote selfish behaviour, while group selection tends in the opposite direction. Selfish individuals usually win out over altruistic individuals in a group, but groups of altruists always outcompete groups of egoists. Since humans are targets of both forms of selection, we are eternally split between egotistic and altruistic impulses. This is Wilson's explanation for the constant conflict within each human being between virtue and vice, between our desire to help others (including non-kin who can't pay back) and our \\"sinful\\" attempts to use others to our advantage. In a sense, group selection is responsible for what we call morals or morality. However, Wilson also believes that group selection has a dark side. Humans are tribal by nature, and competition between tribes has frequently taken aggressive forms throughout human history. Basing himself on Le Blanc's and Register's book \\"Constant battles\\", Wilson argues that war is a constant condition of mankind. So is genocide. Indeed, the roots of war go all the way back to our primate ancestors, since chimpanzees (our closest evolutionary cousins) also wage territorial \\"wars\\".<br /><br />[SOME CRITICISMS OF WILSON]<br /><br />As you might imagine, this is where I tend to part company with the author. It's not at all clear that war has been a perennial companion of Homo sapiens. Many Neolithic cultures were peaceful, including the famous culture at Catalh&ouml;y&uuml;k, which lasted for 1,400 years. Even peaceful high cultures have existed: the Indus Valley Civilization, the Norte Chico culture in Peru and (arguably) Minoan Crete. And what about the Semai in Malaysia, a culture Wilson and other sociobiologists (absurdly) attempted to use as evidence *for* warfare being a human universal during the 1970's? The comparison between humans and chimpanzees is striking only if we decide already before we start that humans really are perennially war-prone. Bonobos, who are mostly peaceful, are also close evolutionary cousins to humans. Besides, chimpanzees become more peaceful in captivity, and even change their \\"gender roles\\", suggesting that their genes have a certain flexibility presumably lacking among, say, Hamadryas baboons. The implications for humans are obvious.<br /><br />Wilson believes in gene-culture co-evolution, and is thus a \\"moderate interactionist\\", as I believe Ullica Segerstråle called him in her book on the sociobioloy controversy. My problem with the author is that, in practice, he seems to be a very moderate interactionist indeed! In effect, Wilson is always veering towards genetic determinism (in the vernacular sense of that term). In fact, he complains about his co-evolution theory being misused by people who want to place heavier emphasis on culture. Now, I don't deny that there are \\"human universals\\" - I'm not a pure constructivist. But which are they? At one point, Wilson reprints a list of purported universals which include government, private property rights, law, inheritance rules and status differentiation. However, it's almost too easy to demonstrate that these, of course, are *not* human universals at all. Government? Law? Nor is patriarchy a universal, for that matter. The interactionist hypothesis needs to take the actual cultural variation into account, or be replaced with something else entirely.<br /><br />[THE PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM]<br /><br />This brings me to the more philosophical parts of \\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\". Wilson is a reductionist materialist and atheist, and several chapters of the book attacks religion in a very forthright manner. (Unless I'm mistaken, Wilson actually claims to be a deist in \\"Consilience\\", but if God is simply a prime mover who creates a reductionist-materialist world, it's difficult to see the difference between deism and outright atheism. God and Elvis have left the building!) At the same time, Wilson clearly believes in objectively valid morality. However, without a transcendent dimension, it's difficult to see how he can coherently believe in morality at all.<br /><br />Thus, Wilson writes that virtue, honour and altruism are \\"moral\\", while selfishness is \\"immoral\\". But why? Ayn Rand or Max Stirner would say the opposite. Besides, Wilson believes that warfare and genocide are immoral, yet they are obviously connected to virtue, honour and altruism. They are all products of group selection. There is virtue even among thieves! Why is one product of group selection (e.g. genocide) immoral, while another product (e.g. helping the poor) moral? At one point (p. 252), Wilson actually extols the virtue of individuals who refuse to bow to immoral peer pressure, but why is *that* moral? Note also that this kind of behaviour seems to go against the grain of both individual selection and group selection. Imagine a soldier who under peer pressure participates in the gang rape of a female captive. If a product of individual selection, he should participate in the gang rape for selfish reasons, perhaps to save his own neck. If a product of group selection, he should also participate out of loyalty to the group or the group leader. But if he refuses and is court-martialled, what selection pressure is he under? A cynic might simply argue that the soldier is maladaptive (if executed, his genetic line will be extinguished) but Wilson clearly regards such a person as a hero. But what is the basis for seeing his actions as moral or as heroic?<br /><br />Wilson, of course, regards religion as grossly immoral. He mentions Paul VI's encyclical Humanae Vitae and religious opposition to homosexuality as two examples of such immorality. He also expresses support for the West European welfare state (thank you, Eddie!), thereby suggesting that \\"free\\" market politics are somehow immoral, as well. But once again I wonder what the basis is for his moral decision? Presumably, religion is a product of group selection, since it gives cohesion to the tribe. Thus, it enhances the altruism and survival value of the group, yet Wilson sees it as a potentially evil force. In the last chapter, Wilson expresses the hope that humanity will one day lay aside its petty differences, unite in peace and save the environment. However, if the rest of \\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" is something to go by, there is absolutely no ground whatever for such a hope. One also wonders what selection pressure created this vain hope in the first place!<br /><br />[THE ANTHILL SOCIETY]<br /><br />By the author's own logic, his hopes are maladaptive. Indeed, in most of the book, he strikes a decidedly more pessimistic note. But this, too, is illogical - if humans will be forever torn between egotism and brutal altruism, why not embrace the world as it actually looks like? Why not become a fascistic Neo-Pagan? Or something along the lines of Oswald Spengler? Wilson wants to avoid this conclusion, and in that he's surely right, but there's little or nothing in his worldview to militate against a misanthropic pessimism. I have an involuntary sympathy for pessimists, but the fact that egalitarian, peaceful or \\"matriarchal\\" cultures have existed, shows that Homo sapiens isn't doomed to remain a brutal, altruistic anthill society...enes have a certain flexibility presumably lacking among, say, Hamadryas baboons. The implications for humans are obvious.<br /><br />Wilson believes in gene-culture co-evolution, and is thus a \\"moderate interactionist\\", as I believe Ullica Segerstråle called him in her book on the sociobioloy controversy. My problem with the author is that, in practice, he seems to be a very moderate interactionist indeed! In effect, Wilson is always veering towards genetic determinism (in the vernacular sense of that term). In fact, he complains about his co-evolution theory being misused by people who want to place heavier emphasis on culture. Now, I don´t deny that there are \\"human universals\\" - I´m not a pure constructivist. But which are they? At one point, Wilson reprints a list of purported universals which include government, private property rights, law, inheritance rules and status differentiation. However, it´s almost too easy to demonstrate that these, of course, are *not* human universals at all. Government? Law? Nor is patriarchy a universal, for that matter. The interactionist hypothesis needs to take the actual cultural variation into account, or be replaced with something else entirely.<br /><br />[THE PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM]<br /><br />This brings me to the more philosophical parts of \\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\". Wilson is a reductionist materialist and atheist, and several chapters of the book attacks religion in a very forthright manner. (Unless I´m mistaken, Wilson actually claims to be a deist in \\"Consilience\\", but if God is simply a prime mover who creates a reductionist-materialist world, it´s difficult to see the difference between deism and outright atheism. God and Elvis have left the building!) At the same time, Wilson clearly believes in objectively valid morality. However, without a transcendent dimension, it´s difficult to see how he can coherently believe in morality at all.<br /><br />Thus, Wilson writes that virtue, honour and altruism are\\"moral\\", while selfishness is \\"immoral\\". But why? Ayn Rand or Max Stirner would say the opposite. Besides, Wilson believes that warfare and genocide are immoral, yet they are obviously connected to virtue, honour and altruism. They are all products of group selection. There is virtue even among thieves! Why is one product of group selection (e.g. genocide) immoral, while another product (e.g. helping the poor) moral? At one point (p. 252), Wilson actually extols the virtue of individuals who refuse to bow to immoral peer pressure, but why is *that* moral? Note also that this kind of behaviour seems to go against the grain of both individual selection and group selection. Imagine a soldier who under peer pressure participates in the gang rape of a female captive. If a product of individual selection, he should participate in the gang rape for selfish reasons, perhaps to save his own neck. If a product of group selection, he should also participate out of loyalty to the group or the group leader. But if he refuses and is court-martialled, what selection pressure is he under?

1846612756|5.0|THE ESSENTIAL REFERENCE<br />FOR THE BUSY FAMILY LAWYER<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />For the busy family lawyer, whether experienced or inexperienced, this book is a boon.  A comprehensive step-by-step guide to conducting all the most common types of family law application, this indispensible guide saves valuable time and ultimately, costs.<br /><br />As mentioned by President of the Family Division, Sir Nicholas Wall in the Foreword, this new fifth edition of the work `is established as part of the essential material available to the Royal Courts of Justice, the Principal Registry of the Family Division and all divorce county courts.'<br /><br />Since the publication of the fourth edition of the book, some significant new developments have emerged, notably the creation of the Family Procedure Rules 2010, (in effect from April 2011). Important to note: amendments implemented to the FPR in April 2012 are also included.  Large parts of the book therefore have been significantly re-written. The aim is to help the busy practitioner avoid the most common pitfalls encountered across the full range of family proceedings.<br /><br />Concise, clear and thoroughly dependable, the book is divided into five parts, with Part I covering such issues as divorce, judicial separation, nullity, civil partnership, legitimacy and legitimation. Do note that Parts II and II deal, respectively, with financial applications and children, while Part IV covers the fraught areas of injunctions and enforcement. Part V is the Court Record and there are five appendices which include precedents and forms and a wide range of other relevant information, particularly contact details of helplines and useful websites.<br /><br />Appendix D -- Rules and Supplementary Practice Directions -- contains the Family Procedure Rules 2010.  Appendix E provides the relevant European Regulations. Extensive resources for your further research abound, including tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, forms and EC and international material, (all referenced to paragraph numbers), plus a table of abbreviations and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />While not intended to replace the major works of reference such as the Red Book (The Family Court Practice), this compact volume of over 1,000 pages has become known as a practical and easy to use `how-to' guide to the varied subject matter of this complex and sensitive area of law.<br /><br />The publication date for this title is March 2012, although, as mentioned earlier, reference is made to reforms in effect from 6th April 2012.  If you're a family law practitioner, you really do need this latest edition to ensure that you are up to date with the most recent developments!arch abound, including tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, forms and EC and international material, (all referenced to paragraph numbers), plus a table of abbreviations and a detailed index at the back.<br /><br />While not intended to replace the major works of reference such as the Red Book (The Family Court Practice), this compact volume of over 1,000 pages has become known as a practical and easy to use `how-to' guide to the varied subject matter of this complex and sensitive area of law.<br /><br />The publication date for this title is March 2012, although, as mentioned earlier, reference is made to reforms in effect from 6th April 2012.

This excellent book will help you understand the role and practice of the social worker, just we are sure it will be equally useful in familiarizing social workers with the mind-set of the lawyer and the intricacies of court proceedings with which they are frequently involved.<br /><br />Its primary function, however, is to function as a guide and reference book for lawyers and other professionals who seek a fuller understanding of social work policies and procedures.<br /><br />Taking a practical approach, the book aims to define and describe what constitutes good social work and of course, good decision making.  As assessment is the social worker's crucial and pivotal role, the focus of the book is on the decision making process, including how the lawyer may assess whether or not the social worker in question has come to the right conclusion or possibly the wrong one.<br /><br />Written by two experts in childcare law and social work issues -- one a barrister; the other a children's guardian and trainer -- the first edition of the book, published four years ago, was conceived originally in response to requests to the authors for, we would assume, a systematic explanation of the principles, procedures and terminology used by social workers, as an aid to professionals unfamiliar with them.<br /><br />This new second edition, which reflects the past four years of legal, social and political change, has been completely updated, with all relevant changes to law and practice included, in particular the Laming Report 2009... Family Procedure Rules 2010 and Practice Direction 12A... Recommendations of the Family Justice Review 2011... the Munro Review of Child Protection 2011... and much more.<br /><br />Also within this clear and very readable volume, there are extensive research resources, including meticulous footnoting and tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments, plus a detailed index<br /><br />As the authors point out, this is a reference book, intended to `demystify the inner workings of social work practice' which you can refer to selectively, whenever you need to prepare a case.<br /><br />If you're practitioner who deals either frequently or occasionally with childcare issues, this book can certainly provide invaluable assistance to you in your day to day practice.

1846611946|5.0|A CLEAR, DETAILED AND UP-TO-DATE ANALYSIS OF THE LEGISLATION<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />When is a gift a bribe?  When is `corporate hospitality' a bribe?  In the light of the new anti-bribery Act which came into force in July 2011, it has become a matter of urgency to find out.  `Although it is a criminal statute'...the main effects of the Bribery Act will be on the conduct of business,' says the author, Eoin O'Shea, adding that `civil law will keep breaking in to most discussions of the criminal law of bribery.'<br /><br />Brand new from Jordans Publishing, this book (as the subtitle promises) provides a practical guide to practitioners, particularly those who act for clients in the commercial and public sectors.  The book commences with some interesting historical, moral and fundamentally practical perspectives on bribery, pointing out that distaste for bribery occurs across a wide range of societies and cultures, even though in certain countries it continues to be regarded as an unpalatable, but tolerable evil.<br /><br />However, as the author asserts, `it is widely acknowledged that corruption is a major contributor to poverty and conflict in developing countries.' Furthermore, `corruption distorts markets... increases the cost of trade, raises the credit and political risks of overseas investment, (and) contributes to economic instability...'<br /><br />Following this thoughtful introduction, the book's subsequent chapters contain clear and detailed analyses of the legislation. Compliance procedures are explained with respect to the new Act -- and worked scenarios and hypothetical, but illustrative examples are frequently used to clarify particular points.<br /><br />Certainly the text identifies difficult issues of interpretation, as well as issues of enforcement and prosecution. There are chapters on active bribery and passive bribery, for example, followed by examinations of such topics as improper performance...bribery of foreign officials...failure of commercial organizations to prevent bribery...accessory liability and civil liability.<br /><br />This of course is only a taste of what this erudite and readable book contains.  It's the last chapter which examines the particular problems of hospitality, promotion, facilitation payments, extortion and mergers; issues which will be of concern to many a business, or public sector organisation in the UK.<br /><br />For further clarification, discussion and research, there's a useful section at the back with an extensive list of websites and blogs on the subject.  And as you would expect with a work of this stature, further avenues for research abound, including tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments, European material and international material. The nine appendices include the text of the Act plus additional explanatory notes and guidance.<br /><br />If you're a practitioner in this field, the practical approach taken by this guide will familiarise you with this important new legislation and its many implications.

The way she orchestrates the end of the war and the rebellion is brilliant, and her imagery far exceeds what you would expect for a \\"young adult\\" novel. Hopefully there will be some sort of follow up to this series. I definitely want to read more!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Being recently bereft after finishing the 7th and final book in a series that I could not put down, I was picking up and putting down other books but feeling unsatisfied with anything I started.  THEN I stumbled across the Wool books thanks to the exceptional reviews of other readers.  Once again I was up into the wee hours unable to put it down and loving every minute of it.  How lucky to find another series that so completely engrossed me.  Original, imaginative, and compelling.  Who was this Hugh Howey and how had I not heard of him sooner?  I gobbled this book up and immediately downloaded Wool 6 Legacy.  I can't wait for 7!  I'm now into the first of the Molly Fyde books (which is excellent) and have also downloaded Half Way Home and Hurricane.  I didn't bother with samples - I know they're all going to be great.  I've also been urging my book-loving friends to read the Wool books.  You will NOT regret it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella and have read all of her books. This latest by her did not disappoint, in fact it was a very interesting book all the way up until the end which even though it was satisfying, seemed a little contrived. The whole time I was reading this book I kept thinking what a great romantic comedy this would make with maybe Hugh Grant as Sam and I am not sure who should play Poppy. It was a very modern romance basically the whole story takes place because of one cell phone. Something that would not have been a plot device even ten years ago. It was an interesting spin on modern relationships and I always love Sophie Kinsella's Heroines. I was so disappointed when Confessions of a Shopaholic finally made it to film just because the actress was not at all what I imagined she should look like plus they made her American which was totally wrong. A lot of the charm of these books including this latest is they are very British. I highly recommend this book as a great way to spend a summer day. Take it along to the beach and just relax. That is what these books are really all about. They make you happy and want to read another.

0893860220|5.0|This book consists of dialogues between people who come from around the world in search of self-realization and the nature of consciousness , and Sri Nasargadatta  Maharaj, one of the greatest mystics  of India.<br />His answers have the depth of the most sacred texts of the world.<br />This is a book for someone who has no fear to plunge into the  unknown with the tool of his or her own awareness, awakened and sharpened by Maharaj's insights, which carry our consciousness far beyond its persistent perception of reality.<br />Since my twenties I was searching to find the nature of reality in philosophy, quantum physics, cognitive science.  For all of these domains, as awesome and  beneficial as they can be, consciousness is still the \\"hard problem\\", still  the mystery they cannot measure or resolve. Maharaj did... not simply by investigating consciousness with sophisticated instruments to find its correlation, its geography, its location in the brain, its processes, and not only by discussing about it, but by going directly through and beyond the feeling and consciousness of  `I Am'.<br />While meditating on his insights, I discovered what were the feelings and conditionings which veiled my mind from Maharaj's outstanding experience . Experience which, as he claims, cannot emerge from an anthropomorphic projection, a fear of dying or a dualistic vision of reality.<br />This is a book for the one who is not afraid to free his/her consciousness from its traditional or cultural brainwashing, and for a mind sharp enough to grasp the deep meaning of Maharaj's  insights, by going beyond our usual meaning of words -like `God' -and beyond the apparent contradictions involved in his answers. I must add that the cleverness of the people who ask him challenging questions is quite amazing, and is representative of our most brilliant minds.

And not for the highfalutin theories about capitalism, funding, and instant millions; they're intentionally absent.<br /><br />You should read The $100 Startup if you favor, as I do, an everyman's guide to everyday business. This isn't the stuffy and stale rhetoric of traditional MBA programs. This is the first-hand knowhow learned from a variety of entrepreneurs just like you - alive with a dream of self-employment, fueled by self-determination and coffee, and eager to absorb the heart-of-the-matter concepts that make small businesses successful.<br /><br />The New Demographics were particularly interesting and useful. The $100 Startup teaches you to see your customers in a whole new (and better) light - one of shared values, interests, mindsets, belief systems. The old school ways of target customers merely on age, gender, income level are ... well ... old. Thanks to the digitalization and democratization of entrepreneurship, your loyal customers are those that share the same psychographics.<br /><br />That chapter alone will empower you to begin observing your customers different, thereby granting you the insights necessary to evolve your business offerings to be in better sync with your ideal customers.<br /><br />From the One Page Business Plan to Creating a Killer Offer, The $100 Startup removes the hype and hyperbole from running a small business, leaving you with a resource you can use everyday with ease to improve your business operations and enjoy prosperous growth.

So in that regard it works as planned.<br /><br />Unfortunately, if you are wanting to boost the signal from your laptop to a set of external speakers, to watch a movie or similar, the results don't seem particularly noticable.  Perhaps the boost strength is too minor for these kind of speakers and is only suitable for the very small speakers of headphones/ear-buds/etc.<br /><br />The build quality is OK, but does not look/feel top of the line.<br /><br />So for the size and price of the item they work quite well with headphones; not so great with external speakers (at least in my experience).

The thing that is most appalling is that, as a long time reader/writer of fanfiction, I find it hard to believe that this trash would end up on the NY Times Bestseller list. There are a hundred, or so, fanfics out there that I could think of that would make better original, also way better written, stories out there than this could ever be. The fact that they have more class then this woman makes them even better, in my eyes. I am not a fan of Twilight, I only read it to know what my own daughter was reading, I truly believe that Stephanie Meyer should at least get some kind of a nod for her 'inspiration' to this so-called original work. As it stands, I call this author and her trilogy a fraud. I find her completely unethical and I can completely understand why some authors dislike fanfiction so much.<br /><br />P.S. Why does Amazon not allow you to give it 0 stars? They should definitely make that feature possible. This book wasn't even worth an 'I hate it.'

0670023329|2.0|Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West by Blaine Harden is the third account I have read about life in North Korea's prison camps, after The Aquariums of Pyongyang and Eyes of the Tailless Animals. Unlike those two accounts, however, Escape from Camp 14 was not written by a prisoner. Shin Dong Hyuk was interviewed by Harden after he escaped to South Korea and then after he moved to the United States. Using the preceding two books as a reference, I have my doubts about the veracity of the testimony made by Shin. Harden writes:<br /><br />\\"In writing this book, I have sometimes struggled to trust him. He misled me in our first interview about his role in the death of his mother, and he continued to do so in more than a dozen interviews. When he changed his story, I became worried about what else he might have made up.<br /><br />\\"Fact-checking is not possible in North Korea. Outsiders have not visited its political prison camps. Accounts of what goes on inside them cannot be independently verified. Although satellite images have greatly added to outside understanding of the camps, defectors remain the primary sources of information, and their motives and credibility are not spotless. In South Korea and elsewhere, they are often desperate to make a living, willing to confirm the preconceptions of human rights activists, anticommunist missionaries, and right-wing ideologues. Some camp survivors refuse to talk unless they are paid cash upfront. Others repeated juicy anecdotes they had heard but not personally witnessed.\\"<br /><br />So caveat emptor. Although any eyewitness story to the horrors of the North Korean prison camps should not be denied, I nonetheless found Escape from Camp 14 the least believable. The story was lightweight and since Harden and Shin needed to communicate by interpreters, I got the impression that much was missed and padded by Harden's own imagination. Since the story was told in the third person, it actually detracted from my own sensitivity toward the horrors of the camp. I would have had a dripping heart had the story been told by Shin himself.<br /><br />Unlike the authors of the two preceding books, Shin was actually born in a prison camp. He was the product of a \\"reward marriage\\", a rare privilege awarded to exemplary prisoners. Shin's mother and father were selected to marry by prison officials and although they were not allowed to live together, they were given a few conjugal visits per year.<br /><br />Shin and an older brother lived with their mother in Camp 14 in central North Korea. Unlike all the other prisoners, the Shin boys never knew life outside the brutality of the prison camp. This was their life from the day they were born: starvation, witness to executions, beatings, sleep deprivation and unbearable labour.<br /><br />As Soon Ok Lee says in Eyes of the Tailless Animals, the prisoners were like animals, acting without feeling or compassion for anyone. It was a constant fight for survival, and no one was exempt from being a victim, not even one's own mother:<br /><br />\\"When he [Shin] was in the camp--depending upon her for all his meals, stealing her food, enduring her beatings--he saw her as competition for survival.\\"<br /><br />Shin despised his family, and when he discovered that his mother and brother were planning to escape, he sneaked off in the middle of the night and reported them to a guard. Instead of being rewarded for his vigilance, Shin was taken to an underground prison and tortured for seven months as the guards sought his role in their planned escape. When he was finally freed he hated his mother and brother even more. Once taken outside to see daylight for the first time in seven months, he was led to the camp's execution ground, where he was forced to witness in the front row the executions of his mother and brother:<br /><br />\\"When guards dragged her to the gallows, Shin saw that his mother looked bloated. They forced her to stand on a wooden box, gagged her, tied her arms behind her back, and tightened a noose around her neck. They did not cover her swollen eyes.<br />She scanned the crowd and found Shin. He refused to hold her gaze.<br />When guards pulled away the box, she jerked about desperately. As he watched his mother struggle, Shin thought she deserved to die.<br />Shin's brother looked gaunt and frail as guards tied him to the wooden post. Three guards fired their rifles three times. Bullets snapped the rope that held his forehead to the pole. It was a bloody, brain-splattered mess of a killing, a spectacle that sickened and frightened Shin, But he thought his brother, too, had deserved it.\\"<br /><br />Not a single tear shed.<br /><br />Fellow prisoners Shin meets give him ideas of what life is like on the other side of the electric fence. Shin learns about his own country--he had never even heard of Pyongyang--as well as other countries and foods. He never tasted meat except for rats and frogs he would catch in the camp to quash the constant hunger pains. One new prisoner tells him about the delicacies of meat, which took on a different meaning for Shin:<br /><br />\\"Freedom, in Shin's mind, was just another word for grilled meat.\\"<br /><br />Shin latches on to a new yet much older prisoner and they devise their own plan to escape. The escape is the best part of the book. It is suspenseful and I will not spoil the story of their flight from Camp 14, other than to say you will be riveted to each page and your eyes will not blink as you read how they got past the deadly electric fence. Shin then makes his way through the northern part of the country and into China. Harden left a chunk of the story on the editor's floor as he does not inform the reader how Shin managed to get into South Korea from China. It was one sentence he was in China, and the next sentence Shin was in Seoul. Harden did write about other defectors' travels from China through Asian nations like Thailand, Laos and Vietnam, and he did write about defector-smuggling organized rings. Perhaps he did this in lieu of reporting Shin's own story. Shin has a habit of clamming up during Harden's interviews and it is possible he never told him any of these details.<br /><br />A lifetime since birth of being in a cruel, loveless society as a prison camp causes untold harm to a human being. Shin may be living in freedom but he still sees himself as a prisoner:<br /><br />\\"I escaped physically. I haven't escaped psychologically.\\"<br /><br />He has difficulty trusting anyone, as trust always betrayed him in Camp 14, nor can he look anyone in the eye when speaking to them. Shin acknowledges that he is on a slow road to recovery, yet his current role as a speaker for North Korean human rights groups is helping him seize control of his life.ed her to stand on a wooden box, gagged her, tied her arms behind her back, and tightened a noose around her neck.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|First off I'm an advid reader of Stephen King, and I was around when that sad day happened. I to this day feel there was much more to the Kennedy assaination then what our government let known.  It would be so neat to be able to go back in time and change some things.  Not only ones that could change history but maybe those where you might have said or done things to loved ones that you didn't have a chance to change at the time

B000056HE9|4.0|This movie was made the same year I was. It was brought to my attention as the one on which Whitney Houston's terrific \\"The Preacher's Wife\\" was based. The story is somewhat similar, but the style is altogether different. For one thing, this one is lily white.<br /><br />Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven), who is presumably an Episcopalian, has a beautiful wife Julia (Loretta Young) who loves him enough that she is concerned with how obsessed he has become. He's supposedly building a cathedral, and must kow-tow to the wealthy of the parish in order to do it. In fact, when he finally prays about it, he does not say \\"help me build the cathedral\\" but \\"give me guidance.\\" And that's exactly what he gets, in the person of an angel named Dudley (Cary Grant). Not, however, to help him build the cathedral, but to improve his relationship to his wife and the ordinary people instead of the high power society snobs.<br /><br />There's quite a lot of religion in it, of course, but not enough to turn off this hard-core old atheist. The only thing that really annoyed me was a lovable agnostic, Professor Wutheridge, who ends up in church after Dudley works his magic. Ah well, it's fiction.<br /><br />It's a charming movie, if not terribly deep. I'm OK with that.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This is an easy to read, attention keeping book.  I loved it.  The first time I read it, I couldn't put it down.  I finished and then began again because I wasn't ready to be through with the book.  It's amazing how the author captures the emotions of the characters.  It actually made me cry!
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|Nikolai 'Kolya' Rodchenko (Mikhail Baryshnikov) is a dancer who defected from the Soviet Union years ago. He and his manager are on their way to Japan, and in Soviet air space, when the plane's cockpit catches on fire and they are forced to make an emergency landing at a Soviet military base. Kolya is, of course, captured by the KGB, and is held a prisoner, albeit in a gilded cage. The whole idea is that he will return to the Bolshoi and they will use him as a propaganda puppet. Of course he resists.<br /><br />Set to watch him is Raymond Greenwood (Gregory Hines) and his Russian wife Darya (Isabella Rossellini). Greenwood had deserted the US Army during the Vietnam War, and defected to the Soviet Union. So there is an odd sort of parallel to the two men's lives. Greenwood is also a dancer, a tap dancer. When we first see him, he is playing Sportin' Life in a Siberian production of \\"Porgy & Bess.\\"<br /><br />One of the fascinating things about Baryshnikov in this film is that he dances real ballet in what appear to be running shoes. I'm guessing they were specially designed for this film, but it's quite disconcerting. It fuels the theory I have long had that Baryshnikov can do anything when it comes to dance. Or rather could in 1985; he's very nearly my age, after all.<br /><br />It's a spy story, but it's even more a story of friendship and ultimately, of trust. I suppose it's not much of a spoiler to say that Kolya escapes, but the details will give you quite a few surprises.<br /><br />Why four stars and not five? It drags a bit in places, especially when the focus is on the Soviet authorities. Still, it's very intense emotionally, and the dancing (both Baryshnikov and Hines) is terrific.

B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is quite a fun little game but as many other reviewers have noted it has some bugs.  On my kindle fire the visiting friends function does not work.  That would not bother me but one of the goals requires you to visit friends.  It asks if you want to exit to get the needed update but it still does not work.  Try Tiny Village instead.
0385343175|5.0|I have over 100 of her books and have been reading hers for over 20 years. I am now waiting for the 3rd installment of the \\"Innsboro Trilogy\\".
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|I loved the movie. I like that Selene had a daughter. I'm wondering what will happen to Eve. Who she will meet, what her life will be like now that she is not a science experiment????? Will Michael find out about Eve?<br /><br />What I do not like about the movie is that Michael was nowhere to be found. The romance between Michael and Selene is dry. I know Selene and Michael never had a chance to get to know each other because of all the vampire and Lycan war. Which opens more questions?? Everyone knows that Lucian and Sonja Viktor's daughter fell in love and that is why the war started to begin with. We all read the books and saw the movies. The love between them was made believable. I fell in-love with the characters to the point that it saddened me the Lucian died.<br /><br />In the case of Michael and Selene there was no love not like Sonja and Lucian. They had a child together but that is it. Why did they fall for one another????? Why is Selene so obsessed in being with Michael???? Sometimes I think that they are together because they are attracted to one another. They got caught in the heat of the moment, and Eve was created. I believe that Michael does not love Selene but only is attracted to her. She the only one who is keeping him alive.<br /><br />Why did they fall in love so fast? I like an explanation to all this.<br />I want more of Viktor and Llona history.<br />More about Marcus life as a vampire and what about Marcus son, what ever happened to him?<br />Bring Viktor back, and Lucian I don't care if there dead.<br /><br /> Michael and Selene meet and in 3 days Viktor, Lucian and Amelia are dead. Marcus is dead as well, but they never had time to stop and think, hey is this love I feel for you or is it something like a one night stand. Michael was pushed into this Lycan and Vampire war. He never imagined that he'd be in some strange underworld with a VAMPIRE named Selene with super human strength. In the next movie I like more love and action fighting parts too, but more love. What will happen to them will their relationship last when everything ends? Bad idea leaving Michael out of the movie. Not good.<br /><br />The Underworld series was great and the plots were fabulous. A WOMAN saved a human Man's life hundreds of times. That is the reason why I love the movies. I mean, this man runs for his life gets into trouble and Selene the warrior Death Dealer comes to the rescue. That's great! No more Twilight NICE Bella with a male vamp who comes to help, helpless Bella.parts too, but more love. What will happen to them will their relationship last when everything ends?

0817439390|4.0|I am a amatuer photographer with an entry level DSLR camera. I enjoyed every bit of this book. Best part of the book is the explanation using examples. This book has seperate sections for the three fundamental constituents of photography, their effects, and when to use it; thus justifying the title. I haven't read many books to compare this one with. Overall as a beginner I loved this book.
0385534639|5.0|What a wonderful book. I couldn't put it down... this book is so well written. I love how the story is told through many different eyes. It's definitely lived up to its reviews... throughout the whole book you are rooting for a love that is so pure and the end ties it all together nicely. A must read for sure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book has captured my attention so much that I already finished book 2 and am now on book 3.  Barbaric but compelling!  It captures your attention immediately.  I will recommend it to all!

At some points I'm ashamed to say but I couldn't read it when my husband wasnt home. This is a must read for any book lover, in particular mystery lovers.

1455518999|4.0|By now you now that Zero Day's John Puller is actually Jack Reacher, and not too far away from Will Robie (The Innocent) although the latter is actually human.<br /><br />So, first the conclusion: Zero Day is fun to read. Sometimes when I come back from the office I grab a Big Mac or a Double Whopper, gerasy and all, they deliver what I wanted, and they do it right there, right then. Same applies to Reacher and Puller, the Big Macs and Whoppers of the mass-market paperback. Incidentally, Reacher seemed to be heading to higher literary ground until Puller appeared on scene and consolidated the late-forties-ex-military action man category with the same determination they sip their black coffees day and night.<br /><br />Nothing wrong about reading Puller and Reacher adventures, competition is part of a free world and therefore welcome. And now we have two drive-ins to choose from.
B006LTP9QY|3.0|Being a huge fan of the \\"Trainspotting\\" movie, I of course, wanted to read the book that has become a cult classic of epic proportions.  Sadly, this is probably only the 3rd time in my life that I have uttered these words:  I think the movie was better than the book.  The book isn't bad, but many of the negative reviews of it are true.  Yes, you have to decrypt the dialogue because it is written in a very harsh Edinbourgh english; Yes, there are chapters that run on for 50 pages where nothing really happens; and Yes, the book is more of a series of loosely connected plot-lines, rather than one coherent plot (again, like the movie).  However, the book is very immersive, and the chapters where things happen are very good.  I think Welsh perhaps needed a good editor, and maybe a few less hits from the bong and this could have been the greatest novel in history.  However, its not, and compared to the movie, its a bit of a mess.  I hate to give it 3 stars, but thats what I'm gonna do.  Sorry Welsh, but seriously, the movie was better.

B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Based on the true story of WWI hero Alvin York, this classic biopic, starring Gary Cooper provides one of the most inspring films ever churned out by Hollywood. Garnering 11 Oscar nominations, and winning two, for best editing and best actor, the film is univerally ackowledged as a true classic! The DVD has clear picture & sound with some nice extras on the 2DVD set. The actual physical packaging of the plastic DVD case, seemed really cheap & flimsy (come on Warner Brothers, how much extra would it cost to produce a better plastic case?). The bonus documentary on the real Alvin York and the making of the film was almost as great as the movie itself. For educational viewing: the film could be shown to help teach about WWI, faith, courage, and patriotism. It is the ideal Memorial Day movie!<br /><br />My advice: Find the best price, and make your purchase!
0439023513|4.0|I enjoyed the book as a whole, though I was perhaps a bit less captivated than with the first two books. I thought the overall story arch was very believable and well done. There were some plot elements I could see coming a mile away, but others that caught me completely by surprise. One of the biggest differences I found was that while reading the first two books I felt like there was a definite point where the story would end: you knew that the book would basically end at the end of the Hunger Games. Even if you didn't know how the book would end, you knew where it would end. With this book, I could never really pinpoint where it would end. I knew where the characters hoped it would end, but I never got the sense that \\"ok, as soon as they get to Point A and this happens, the book will end.\\" Which brings me to my biggest problem with the book: the ending.<br /><br />I am perfectly fine with the way this book, and therefore the series, ended, but I did not enjoy how this ending was presented. The ending felt like one of those movies where we get a sentence or two telling us what the characters did after the movie ended. For a book approaching 400 pages, and a series well over 1,000 pages, trying to wrap everything up in a couple pages felt rushed and hollow. The whole series felt like I was there with the characters as the events unfolded, but the ending felt like someone telling me a story years later, which to me definitely took away from the impact the book could have had.
1440503257|4.0|I am an avid fan of both the Harry Potter books and movies.<br />When I saw this book, I was grateful for the chance to have some more Harry Potter in my life.<br />I dove into the pages like a hungry monster.... and was a bit disappointed.<br /><br />Where oh where is the Butterbeer recipe?<br />Where oh where are the pictures?<br /><br />Now, if you are the type of cook that can whip a recipe into shape with no picture to guide you, then disregard this.<br />If you are like me, on the other hand, who needs to see what the food SHOULD look like, then you will agree with me.<br /><br />The chapters are:<br />1.

Bacon is not from the legs, it comes from the pork belly.<br /><br />Besides that, the recipes are decently easy to gather ingredients for, and reasonably easy to prepare.<br /><br />It IS, afterall, the \\"UNofficial\\" Harry Potter Cookbook.... accept it for what it is, and go from there.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0015DROBO|2.0|I'm not one to usually bash on the popular, but I kept on hearing how great this book was and I must agree the writing of the book is amazing the author does a very good job at setting up the premesis the characters, and makes the story very compelling leaving you to figure out what is going on. The real problme that I have with The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is how long it takes to get things rolliing. The book doesn't get intersting till about 150 pages in. And once it does its slows down way to much too often. I just wanted the mystery solved. Larsson dives to much into the sex life of his character and frankly I don't care. I felt as if I was reading more of a soap opera than an actual murder myster. While I'm glad Bjurman got what was comming to him I felt Lisbeth Salander's rape and her revenge were added in as if that could have been entirely a short story of it its own. I don't discredit the authors ability to write he is very good, but this book is marred with to much sex and it gets old after a while. I guess if you enjoy much sexuallality then this is your book.
0143035711|5.0|Bob Mason is a \\"natural\\" - or he's been told so when he started helicopter flying school with the Army. After reading his book, I would have to add that he's not only a \\"natural\\" helicopter pilot but also a \\"natural storyteller\\".<br /><br />There are many reasons why you could fall in love with \\"Chickenhawk\\", and many more why you should read it. Reading this book (as with any other good one) is like going into a journey in an unknown country. If you can adjust to the changes and enjoy any new experience, you will have a good time. Only if you are too sensible (it's war without censorship), skip this book.<br /><br />\\"Chickenhawk\\" is a personal recount of Mason's time in Vietnam, with some information on the time before and after his service in SEA. In his very gifted manner, he will take you along the ride of his \\"slick\\" (unarmed Huey) and show the at-times impossible flying performed by these guys in order to do their daily task. War is rough and crude, and so is Mason's description and language, and somehow he makes it all nicely fit together in an easy-reading procession of missions. You get to feel the vibration of the overloaded Huey, the sound of the howling turbine mixed with the door-gunner blasting the bushes, the smell of the hot and humid jungle breeze, it's all in there.<br /><br />This is one of the rare books that for me just could not have been written differently (or better); it's Mason's history, told by him in his words as he remembers it, in a gripping and entertaining way (even if it's nestled a terrible war). Everybody with even a remote interest in the subject should read it - highly recommended.
0062082353|5.0|This is the Iraq war book that you have been waiting for.<br /><br />I have read several books about the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and although good and worthy of our attention, they never seemed to be very patriotic and often went out there way to criticize the US or Americans in general.<br />This book not only gives a first hand account of an amazing SEAL's personal story, but it is from the personal, very pro-American perspective of a sniper with an amazing instinct and skill set.<br /><br />The author(s) also understand what to include in a story and what not to, so each story easily comes across as a tall tale, even though they are all true and verified by witnesses and NCIS lawyers.

Just reading the first few pages i had already discovered the 'cue' of all my non-desireable habits.  Now all I had to do was change the routine and i would get the reward.  I'm hooked.

0345803485|1.0|The first in a trilogy by new author, E.L James, has been dubbed \\"Twilight for adults\\". This nickname suggests a daring comparison.<br /><br />It seems hard to imagine how one could mimic the story of stubborn, unadulterated, mortal, teenage girl commits to angst-filled, dreadfully attractive, vampire, teenage boy in a way that could appeal stronger to the adult demographic. Well, get ready female adult population because James's first novel, Fifty Shades of Grey, is spattered with Stephanie Meyer's fame-making elements--but ignores the vampire bit, plants the protagonists in their twenties, and thrusts in an erotic fancy for bondage, discipline, submission, and dominance.<br /><br />So, TwiMoms, are you buying it? Some of you are. In fact, Fifty Shades of Grey, which has sold more than 250,000 copies, has quickly become a book-club favorite among women. Is it the promise of a Twilight-inspired novel written to female adult tastes that is so tempting to readers? What are female adult tastes anyway--James's novel suggests kinky interests.<br /><br />Personally, I knew close to nothing regarding the book's synopsis prior to reading. It was essentially Hollywood's recent and ongoing hype about the novel that caught my eye. For the past two weeks various blogs have been feeding off the debate about who should play the main characters now that the movie rights to Fifty Shades of Grey have been acquired. In an effort to keep up with the flow of the pop-culture current, I plunged right into the trilogy, skipping any pre-commitment secondary research, beginning with less than I have already given you.<br /><br />Meet virgin heroine, Anastasia Steele. She is a few final exams away from her college diploma and really needs time to study, but because of her roommate, Kate's, untimely collision with the flu, she finds herself conducting an interview on the only man she has ever been attracted to, Christian Grey. Anastasia knows nothing about billionaire humanitarian, Mr. Grey,apart from the fact that he is comparable to Adonis in sex appeal, this she just startlingly discovered.  But it doesn't take long for Anastasia to become disgustedly captivated by Mr. Grey's admitted obsession with control, and it continues to haunt her even after a whole day of trying to put it out of her implausible innocent mind.<br /><br />As it turns out, Christian Grey can't get Anastasia out of his head either, for she is not like anyone whom he has ever met, and he has to have her. For a virgin, Anastasia is pretty easy. A little obvious stalking paired with a prodigal and prophetic gift, is all it took for Christian to get Anastasia right where he wants her: on a tour of his \\"red room of pain\\", contemplating a legal contract that would make her his 24-hour submissive sex slave on the weekends.<br /><br />Although they have seen little mainstream success, erotic books have been around for a while. However, Fifty Shades of Grey isn't locked behind closed doors; it is generating a lot of publicity. This is quite puzzling though because despite its emphasized sex appeal, the book is not very stimulating.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is disappointing, hardcore, erotica suspense that has the characteristics of a novel that could have been written by a sheltered teenager whose only impression about sex and relationships is based on accidental S&M porno exposure at a young age. The prose is lumpy, it doesn't branch much, and James overuses italics to emphasize Anastasia's obvious internal thoughts, which often disconnects the reader from the main action of the scene and does little for the story. There is little story to begin with, actually. In both short and long, Anastasia just wants to hold Christian's hand, but Christian doesn't do the girlfriend thing, he just wants to dominate a contracted sexual business partner.<br /><br />My hopes were held high while reading this book. I was anticipating and longing for that unexpected surprise with every flip of thepage, waiting to see what conflict would be introduced, waiting for the revelation that would validate there being two more installments to this otherwise dry and vague, twisted Twilight rip-off--it never came. Instead, the first part ended without any detail compelling enough to convince anyone that Anastasia and Christian's X-rated, arguably abusive, unconvincing love affair would develop into anything satisfying in the sequel.<br /><br />Even the kinkiest of readers will be let down by this book, and perhaps even left with feeling like they were seduced into a thankless, lousy love affair. Expect to be both flustered and intrigued, but this book is just a tease--no climax ever comes.<br /><br />Letter Grade: WTF (Worthless Twilight Fiction)
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Unfortunately, I stumbled upon this guy, Groban in Home Depot. You know, the retail store music that gets shoved in your ear when you're trying to work. Yes, I worked as a contractor in Home Depot stores and almost got sick after hearing his moaning. This kind of music style should be advertised in another fashion. Not everyone is going to like Mr. Groban's depressing vocals. I live for good music. I wouldn't be paid to see Josh Groban in concert. I've never heard him on the radio and don't know of any stations that do. I'm into a lot of different music, but Josh Groban?

630542845X|5.0|I don't know how I missed this movie for so long, but I'm glad I finally saw it. Although there are some fantastic and sci-fi elements to it, the real story is about how the people of a small town are affected by a young man with special abilities whose albinism causes him to be the target of suspicion, hatred, and abuse. It's basically the story of the pink monkey that was put in a cage with \\"normal monkeys\\" and got torn apart because he was different. The acting, cinematography, musical score, and script are all just top notch. This is a film that all young people should see (and probably most adults as well). The movie has so many memorable moments, but rather than my talking about them here (a verbal description couldn't do justice to the real scenes anyway) you should just see this wonderful movie and see for yourself. Five stars but that's only because I can't give it ten.

0061726834|5.0|Delirium was the first book on my Dewey's Read-a-thon list. It is a book I bought at V-Stock using credit because I kept hearing about it and its sequel that had been just coming out. It also turns out goodreads.com had kept recommending it to me over and over, but the cover hadn't caught my eye or I must of not read the blurb very well, because I kept rejecting it.<br /><br />What was wrong with me? This book has elements that remind me of The Giver by Lois Lowry and \\"Stupid Perfect Love\\" a short story by Scott Westerfield in the anthology Love is Hell, and coincidentally the work by him(it is a fantastic story) that got me to actually go and read Uglies, but I digress. The element that hormones and love are a disease is a theme that is ingrained in the human consciousness. We as humans find ourselves falling in love, and therefore becoming vulnerable to those we love giving them the ability to tear our hearts out and stomp them rather visciously on the floor, causing all sorts of symptoms (And I'm not just talking about significant other, I'm talking about all love, family and friend love included. You know you've been there before readers). So logic of course says, why don't we get rid of it? And that's where these books are fantastic. It weighs in your mind, is love a good thing or a bad thing? Would you live without love? So many people would say yes, and so many others would say no.<br /><br />Delirium goes through this point beautifully, showing us people \\"cured\\", \\"uncured\\" and as with Lena's mother, \\"uncurable\\". We are shoved into a world of propaganda against love. A world that is fleshed out an highly detailed in its belief system, thanks to blurbs at the beginning of each chapter that help to flesh out what these characters are brought up with: a combination of religion, science and forced propaganda, the twisting of Mary Magdalene being a perfect example of that.<br /><br />The characters are a variety of types and we see how each one reacts when faced with the reality that the \\"cure\\" is not as amazing as they thought it would be, and will they risk their lives to keep the love and passion? Or will they just skirt the borders and rebel only if it seems safe?ith the reality that the \\"cure\\" is not as amazing as they thought it would be, and will they risk their lives to keep the love and passion?

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very addicting!!  just wish there was more energy due to the amount of things needed to be done. overall a great game!
B000001DWG|5.0|I was unsure of this album at first having been used to the usual Seattle sound, this album has a hint of glam to it and doesnt seem to be as heavy as others. It just makes me wonder what could have been if Andy had of lived and what other albums they would have released. Love Andys songwriting and you can hear Ament and Gossards signature sound as well. A very interesting part of Seattle Grunge history. Faves are Stardog Champion, Bone China, Stargazer, Man of Golden Words, Come Bite the Apple and Chloe Dancer/ Crown of Thorns. This album has that it factor to it with a touch of sadness. Come Bite the Apple!
1582701709|5.0|I have this book and my friend needed it so i ordered a copy for her.  it isn't a how to do this book.  but a book reminding all of us that its mind over matter. we attract what we want in life . Everyone has this in their brain to do . but some of us are so buried in past teachings that we tend to forget out this principle. yes, its working for me in ways I cannot tell you how.  From a totally negative back ground to a totally positive future. and allyou have to do is beleive!  real hard for me to do.  Right after my friend got her book she attempted to follow thru and things happen to her as well.  Now we are both Wiccan so the matter of mind over matter might work for us better than you. but all you have to do is beleive.  Things I need and want are dropping in my lap without much effort and I believe that yes, the things I need, the money i need are coming , are already coming and its like?? everyone needs this book ! i recommend it if only you can put down your past notions aobut life and just believe init!

B004UID2LC|4.0|Does NOT support MP4 like it says and if you try any of the download options on the Fire nothing happens.  Yet another app certified by Amazon ans Kindle Fire compatible that is NOT.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I originally rated this a 1 because it just didn't work.  I looked through a lot of reviews relating to the Fire and many loved it ans said it worked great for them.  So I uninstalled it, rebooted the Fire and installed it again.  This time it seems to work properly.  I rated it 4 not 5 because there are no instructions and it isn't terribly intuitive.<br /><br />Now I know to long press the video you want to download and select \\"download as video.\\"  You can check status under settings>downloading or settings>downloaded.  Then you can watch it in either this app, or the Gallery app.  It is stored in this app's folder but the gallery will find it as will the ES File Explorer app which I HIGHLY recommend if you have experience with file explorers like in Windows.  The video files are saved in mp4 format though you cannot choose the format.  The MP4 and VP8 are the only video formats that the Fire can play with native apps.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Picks up right where The Hunger Games left off and jumps right into the action. This book had me reading every spare minute I had to see what was going to happen next! You can't put it down. A fun read.
0345803485|3.0|The book is pretty good. Sure the sex scenes are toasty, but more importantly is the relationship between the characters, which are all good, if not a little too easy sometimes.<br />My biggest issue with the books is the fact that everyone is always rolling their eyes like they are 10 years old. I thought these were supposed to be adults. Seriously, it's so bad it's worth writing in the review. And the constant talk of her 'inner goddess' makes me want to smack her myself.<br />Many women seem to find Christian Grey crazy sexy but I just find him to be a stalker and a control freak. The author writes that all the time anyway so it's hard not to agree with her. Someone can be dominate without being a stalker. The BDSM is light at best. Mostly he's just a overly flawed tyrant with a lot of money.<br /><br />I'm not sure I'll read the other two books, truth be told. Right now I'm just not curious enough to continue the story.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I like how small and compact it is.  It kind of difficult to hold though while running your knife through.  Because of small size you gotta be careful to not slice a finger, but it does get the job done.  Pretty neat little sharpener for the most part.
0307592731|5.0|A perfect memoir. This book was like a blazing neon sign to me, as a memoirist, saying Here's your model. And as I reader I just inhaled it.<br /><br />The foreground narrative of the arduous hike Cheryl Strayed took is compelling and compulsively readable. The backstory about her mother's death, Cheryl's unconventional upbringing, and her descent during grief into promiscuity and drug abuse greatly deepens and enhances the book, especially since she feathers this parallel story in so artfully. Many would have read and enjoyed it just for that, but the physical journey she took to externalize her suffering and to heal herself gives the book a powerful narrative arc. And the hike is worth experiencing with her as she ponders her old life. So the two stories together--wow, Wild is a double whammy.
030746363X|4.0|Some of the information is very interesting. Learned s great deal. I use the slow carb diet a lot when I need to trim up, mostly cause of this book. The information about cold was fascinating too. Interesting tips to hack your body.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I became completely enraptured by this story.  It is so much more than just sex.  It is about the evolution of a relationship and person.  It is about getting to know your partner and the character traits needed to have a trusting, loving relationship.  I started the triology on a Thursday and ended up putting my life on hold to read all three books in 5 days.  I was up until 5am reading on Friday night.  The ending is crushing - you'll want to immediately pick up book 2!

0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is on fire just like Katinss Everdeen. From the victory tour to the Quarter Quell Catching fire is amazing. It gives you some romance and drama. I love this book because it is when Katinss finds herself through fame from the Hunger Games and hate from President Snow. Suzanne Collins has created a book with many wonderful signs of rebellion and love in all of the chapters. Just the way that she writes the words makes you want to read more. See what happens when Katinss in placed in the Quarter Quell. See if Katinss can survive a game of love.
B004GYY714|1.0|When I first installed this app it worked just fine, then about 3 weeks ago it couldn't get a stream from my radio station. Some, but not all, other stations worked. I contacted the station and they told me that it seemed to work for people at the station. They were using BlackBerry's but I don't know which carrier. The station even stopped and started the stream for me. I removed and reinstalled the app with the same results. I contacted TuneIn via email which they replied to 3 days later. They said to uninstall and reinstall the app which I already told them I did. They also said to install another app which will do a data dump of everything on my phone and send it to them. ARE THEY CRAZY?? I am using an HTC EVO 3D on Sprint and I have since found 3 other people with the same issue. This app might work for you but for how long?

0307951529|5.0|Many people dream of doing something different. They punch in at their 9-5 job and push paper while daydreaming about the really cool business they'd love to start and are pretty sure would work. Trouble is, there's a whole lot of ambiguity between their dreams of something different and the squeaky office chair where they think about it.<br /><br />If that sounds like you, then you should buy this book.<br /><br />The $100 Startup strikes a fantastic balance between inspiring stories of people who have taken the plunge and pragmatic advice from a guy who has done it. You already know that you want that different thing -- this book talks you through how to get there (and it's easier than you think). It's a small investment for what will almost certainly assuage your doubts and make the journey toward \\"different\\" a whole lot less frightening.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I loved this movie, and you may also, but keep in mind it is a movie about bird-watching (or \\"birding\\" as a character points out in the movie).  It has some interesting character development, beautiful scenery, and some laughs--but be aware, it ultimately is a movie about competitive birding.<br /><br />Also, for Instant Video Customers-- the sound and video were great.

B004RSCWZ2|3.0|Ever since I first learned that Tedeschi and Trucks were married, I wondered why they didn't record together.  Be careful what you wish for.  I've heard both these artists in concert more than once, which should have tipped me off.  Tedeschi knocked me out all three times I saw her.  While I respect Trucks'skill on the guitar, his music and style never quite grabbed me.  I started wondering if the guitar stuff I liked on the Allman Bros. cd years ago was Warren Haymes instead of Trucks.  Anyway, this is not one of my favorite cd's.  I miss Tedeschi's blues guitar and voice.  I like her a lot better when she's raw, not polished.  And this, to me, is a polished effort.  Trucks' guitar work is masterful, but it just doesn't work with his wife's voice.  And the only song that really grabs me is \\"Midnight in Harlem,\\" partly because of the organist as well as DT's guitar.  The cd is OK; I just expected more.
0151003084|3.0|This book is really great and I love Edward Gorey, but make sure you look at the Product Details before you spend more than you feel you should for a tiny book. This book is crazy short. Like five words per page short. It's also about the size of a CD case. There is one illustration per page, each page has a short sentence, and it goes in alphabetical order. So 26 pages of actual content. It is a really nice book but make sure you don't spend more money than you think 26 short sentences and pictures are worth.

0307595579|5.0|After completing this trilogy I can only say this is the best trilogy I have ever read. I was left wanting more after completing the third book and a little sad knowing Stieg Larsson can't put forth any additional literature.<br /><br />I knew very little about this trilogy until I saw a trailer for the U.S. movie \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", originally thinking this series was aimed towards girls. I was wrong. After reading the synopsis on amazon, which certainly intrigued me, I realized the first book was centered around a murder mystery. I stumbled upon this trilogy box set and decided to go all in and I'm thankful I did. Mr. Larsson's writing style, character development and plot depth dragged me into the story about Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander and made me feel as if I were experiencing the action.<br /><br />I waited to watch \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" movie until I completed the book series. I thought the movie was mediocre only because I had read the book first. The reason I say this is because the books provide so much more of the story, so much more background and really illuminate the characters, their personalities and their inner thoughts. I realize in a two and a half hour movie it's incredibly difficult to squeeze in the kind of detail found in the first book (not to mention it would probably be boring to watch!). Watching this movie only reinforced my belief that Stieg Larsson created something very special with this book trilogy. Bravo Stieg.

0439023513|5.0|After reading some of these reviews, I feel like I need to defend this book a bit.  I will try my best not to give anything away!<br /><br />When I completed my reading marathon of this trilogy, I initially felt a little down.  Everything seemed to end so quickly and felt somewhat empty.  I felt like I should have felt worse about some things that happened, and other things bothered me more than I thought they should.  I wondered if it was a problem with me because of how it was written, or if the author did this on purpose.  Finally, I had to go back and re-read parts again.  Then I had to re-read the book again.  Then I had to re-read the entire trilogy again... and again.  Each time I read it, I came more and more to the realization that the ending is perfect.  Mind you, I have been indulging in this research for the past 2 weeks.<br /><br />These books are written in the first person.  The author is limited in her ability to go into character descriptions.  But she does a wonderful job of capturing their essence in the limited time they are mentioned, leaving enough clues to figure out how and why people do things.  Look for them!<br /><br />Katniss is a soldier.  I feel like the author is trying to illustrate the strains of war (the first war being the Hunger Games), and what it is like for a soldier to come home from the battle field.  In addition, she pulls things from previous books into this last book.  There is no doubt in my mind that the sequence and detail giving to experiences were purposeful, trying to relate a war-time experience from the eyes of a soldier trying to get through a battle, and then having to deal with it after it is over.  Her father was in the Air Force during Vietnam and that must have had a profound effect on her.  She ties it up so nicely, the story feels complete.  The questions I had when I finished were about things that happened in the book, and I was able to go back and figure out what happened.<br /><br />*** Possible Spoiler****<br /><br />If you feel like the ending isn't happy, it really is.  It is her dream coming true.  Refer to Catching Fire.  It wouldn't be right if she came out of everything unscathed and sunny.  But she is happy, and it is a good ending.  I absolutely love the reviewer who referenced Band of Brothers.  I have heard of many soldiers having nightmares, and having difficulty relating their battle experiences.  I truly think the author was paying tribute to soldiers out there who have similar \\"happy\\" endings and illustrate to readers the lasting effects of war on soldiers.
B0074EIQUG|2.0|As a lover of Dr. John, I need to be the contrarian here. This is without a doubt the worst Dr. John collection I have ever heard. It's hard for me to imagine a Dr. John album (or for that matter, any session that he is party to) that does not make me want to dance. Until this one. There is no funk. The drummer just doesn`t swing, and the bass player, who has nice lines, also has no sense of what funk is. Normally, I think the good Dr. would overcome this by his pounding left hand, but since he is not playing stride, this is not available.<br /><br />I like the notion of putting him on different keyboards, and enjoy his Hammond work. I lived in New Orleans through the 50's and 60's, grew up on the Meters, the Neville Brothers, Radiators, with large helpings of British invasion and straight on blues. I get excitement from musicians stretching their boundaries. This whole CD sounds like it was just phoned in to me. I should also say that I like the Black Keys, and have followed some of Auerbach's side projects with interest. I mention this because I'm really going to dump on him here. The CD is also a horrible production sonically. Not nice to listen to. When it came in, I was excited, and decided to listen to it first during a workout, over earphones. Big mistake. The instruments and voices are flat, located in a mono-panned position, with bad reverb applied. (That's the problem with good earphones...) So I bought it downstairs to our big stereo. It sounded better, but still flat and disjointed. Not great vocal equalization either.<br /><br />The songs are so-so, and in this I don't find fault. With a musician of his calibre, I'm happy listening to almost any song, as Dr. John can bring life to a tune that I've never thought much about before. But even played loud, my wife said it was lifeless--hollow, no soul. If you want to listen to Dr. John in a bit different zone (not radically so) I would recommend \\"The Brightest Smile in Town\\" or one of the Bluesiana CDs.

This is some of Mike Oldfield's finest work captured the way he likes it - live and on stage.  The only drawback to this recording is that it is only presented with Region 2 DVD coding. (Thank Goodness for Region-free software patches!) Apparently his producers seem to think Mike is only popular in Europe.  Just be warned that this DVD is encoded to only play in either Region 2 or region-free DVD players.  It is well worth the effort for us Mike Oldfield fans!

B007JQLNXG|5.0|Peter Gabriel first gained fame as the flautist and lead vocalist for Genesis. Formed in 1967 by Gabriel (Phil Collins joined as the drummer in 1970), Gabriel became famous for his costumes and theatrical performances. He shocked the band, and his fans when he left Genesis in 1975 before the tour began in support of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, which had seen Gabriel take  on the bulk of the song writing, which alienated the band who had always seen themselves as a collective. \\"Solsbury Hill\\", Gabriel's debut single as a solo artist, was written specifically about his departure from Genesis. From `76 through `85, Gabriel did very well commercially as well as critically, but he achieved his greatest popularity with songs from the 1986 album So. The album charted at number 1 in the UK Album Chart, and number 2 on the Billboard 200 in the US. It is certified triple platinum in the UK, and five times platinum in the US. The album produced three UK Top 20 hits, \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Big Time\\", and \\"Don't Give Up\\" -- a duet with Kate Bush. The album also produced three Top 40 hits in the U.S., \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\" (featured in the John Cusack film Say Anything), and \\"Big Time\\". \\"Sledgehammer\\", peaked at #1 in the U.S., coincidentally knocking Genesis' \\"Invisible Touch\\" off the top spot.<br /><br />In 1989, Gabriel shifted gears, and sounds. He released Passion, the soundtrack for the movie The Last Temptation of Christ. For this work he received his first Grammy Award, in the category of Best New Age Performance. He also received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Original Score - Motion Picture. From this point on Gabriel would explore more and more World Music as well as multimedia, particularly movie/video projects, which lead to more Grammys for long form and short form videos.<br /><br />In 2010, Gabriel released Scratch My Back which is entirely cover songs by artists such as David Bowie, Lou Reed, Arcade Fire, Radiohead, Regina Spektor, Neil Young, and more. But, probably more striking than a star of Gabriel's stature doing covers is the departure from the  guitars, drums, or electronic elements and power rock that had become Gabriel's trade marks. The album is entirely performed by orchestral instruments. 2011s New Blood , follows the same formula as a collection of his earlier songs recorded with an orchestra.<br /><br />Live Blood Live In London  is a newly remixed and re-mastered live 2-CD set recorded at London's iconic Hammersmith Apollo on March 23rd last year. The album is stunning and immediately grabs the listener, no matter if you were ready for the stadium rock sound that was most familiar on these tunes. They come as familiar but even more emotionally `grabbing' as Gabriel<br />and the 46-piece New Blood Orchestra re-imagine some of Peter's best known songs with breathtaking orchestral arrangements that include \\"In Your Eyes\\" \\"Red Rain\\" \\"Rhythm of The Heat\\" and \\"Biko\\" - written in honor of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko (1946-1977). In addition, there are interpretations of Paul Simon's \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" and Lou Reed's \\"The Power of the Heart\\". Gabriel is a renowned live performer whose onstage charisma and instantly recognizable voice combine brilliantly with the orchestral sound palette to breathe a new sense of wonder into familiar songs.<br /><br />With this `new direction'  Gabriel at once pays tribute to a career that has now spanned 40 years, and also seems to not just pay tribute, but to mature and blossom into a realm where the music takes on even deeper emotions and  beauty.<br /><br />The Dirty Lowdown.

They come as familiar but even more emotionally `grabbing' as Gabriel<br />and the 46-piece New Blood Orchestra re-imagine some of Peter's best known songs with breathtaking orchestral arrangements that include \\"In Your Eyes\\" \\"Red Rain\\" \\"Rhythm of The Heat\\" and \\"Biko\\" - written in honor of anti-apartheid activist Stephen Biko (1946-1977). In addition, there are interpretations of Paul Simon's \\"The Boy in the Bubble\\" and Lou Reed's \\"The Power of the Heart\\". Gabriel is a renowned live performer whose onstage charisma and instantly recognizable voice combine brilliantly with the orchestral sound palette to breathe a new sense of wonder into familiar songs.<br /><br />With this `new direction'  Gabriel at once pays tribute to a career that has now spanned 40 years, and also seems to not just pay tribute, but to mature and blossom into a realm where the music takes on even deeper emotions and  beauty.<br /><br />The Dirty Lowdown

1860467687|5.0|Forget the movie; the book is so touching.  And it is not as much about devil worship as it is about love and the need for people to be around other people.  Also, the end is so shockingly weird that it confused the heck out of me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|First off all I just loved this book and always will, it kind of has a bad theme to it but a great book.  I am already finished with Catching Fire and reading Mockingjay!

0060558121|5.0|I admit that, being a mythologist, I started out reading this book with a certain level of bias. However, aside from a mildly anti-climactic ending, overall I found the book to be well written and interesting. As usual, Gaiman has brought readers something that other writers wish they'd thought of first.
1439107955|5.0|Written by an oncologist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Columbia University, The Emperor of All Maladies is a history, what the author calls a biography, of cancer. He wrote it to better understand the challenges of his chosen profession. Indeed, from 1970 to 1997, despite the \\"War on Cancer\\" launched in 1971, there appeared to be virtually no progress as death rates held steady.<br /><br />But, this sobering fact belied the underlying truth that some cancers had indeed improved in outcome, namely stomach cancer and children's cancers. The sad counterpoint was that an increase in deaths from lung cancer had virtually wiped out and obscured this progress.<br /><br />The author ends with an overview of the potential in cancer research that may yet hit physicians' offices in the next few years. If you want to understand your enemy, cancer, this book gives you the grounding you need to understand what has been an intractable disease for hundreds of years and reason to hope that it may not always be so.
0062082353|5.0|Great book! Chris Kyle is a true American patriot and hero. This story and many others should've been broadcasted during the war but with Bush in the white house there was no way the media would do that. Would've put too much of a positive spin on the war and may have caused a swell of patriotism in our country. Nonetheless, many Americans were grateful then and still are. God bless Chris and his fellow soldiers. We are so grateful for your sacrifices. Thank you.

B005MYEQ4U|1.0|Been there, seen that, and it was called \\"Play It Again, Sam\\".  Honestly, Woody, didn't you already do one movie with some schlub seeking advice from an imaginary friend?  At least there was only one imaginary friend in PIAS; there were a whole herd of them in this movie.<br /><br />There wasn't one single likeable character in this movie.  Not one.  And if his visions were supposed to be real - well, if I were to meet my historical idols, I'd ask them questions about their views on life, the universe and everything - rather than spend the whole time talking about myself, which your character did.<br /><br />And am I the only one who's tired of watching movies about Hollywood writers being contemptuous of their own profession and yearning to write the Great American Novel?  Just sit down and do it and stop whining.

B005LAIGLE|1.0|What a convoluted (plot) waste of time.  Although Mark Wahlberg plays what he plays best: A low IQ blue-collar worker/thief, it still does not save this mediocre action doper film from the waste can.  And poor (blond, tattooed -- WTF!)Kate Beckinsale has absolutely nothing to do in this film other than to say stupid wifey dialog.  Any C-rated actress could have filled this role (e.g. Lindsey Lohan stoned).  As they say, Kate couldn't resist a payday for 6 days of work, so she took the money and ran.  Even the bad guys in this film are pathetic, non-menacing.<br /><br />Mark has to stop thinking he's a great producer, actor, and judge of scripts, and fire his agent & manager, and return to being a simpleton sidekick of real A-list actors (e.g. George Clooney in Three Kings).  Dumb, dumb, dumb movie.  Don't buy, don't rent.  Watch on HBO for 15 min. and then take your wife out to dinner.  Now you are guaranteed a happy ending.

0316098329|5.0|I despise books like \\"A Child Called It\\", supposedly about the triumph of human spirit over adversity, but more usually poorly-written accounts of detailed abuse.  This book actually did have that triumph against adversity.  Some of the plot points and decisions made by characters ARE unexpected, but life happens - things don't always go by the script society has.  Loved this book.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Like many people, I did extensive research on the MDR7506 before making the purchase.  Just about everywhere I'd seen, for this price break the comparisons fell on the MDR7506/V6 and ADH-M50's.  I had previous experience using 7506's in studio production applications, usually in university setting; so I recognized their value as the \\"industry standard\\".  I consider myself a musician and have extensive experience with sound production, DSP, and psychoacoustics-- the only reason I mention this is to say that I can generally tell the difference between \\"good\\" audio and \\"poor\\" at least in the sense that I know what to look for.<br /><br />For three weeks preceding my purchase of the 7506's, I used my roommate's M50's ~10 hours a day while studying for my exams and working on projects.  In this time I became well acquainted with them not just for studying but for audio processing purposes which required pulling important details out of audio clips.  I have to admit, they are great headphones.  The response is super flat, they put out good volume w/o distortion and are comfortable to boot.  One would certainly not do wrong to buy a pair; however, the M50's do have a few short-comings for which the Sony MDR 7506 has it beat.  Most of my gripes are largely personal preference, but valid none the less.<br /><br />First and foremost, the 7506's are better engineered.  They are way more durable (the M50's needed constant repair at the cable connections), the quality of the cable in the 7506's is great and coiled cable is a very undervalued feature.  With the M50's, the cable was constantly getting caught on my chair; with the 7506's the range is comparable but 90% of my use will be right next to my computer/ ipod so it's a valuable feature for me.  Additionally, the quality of the headband and speaker housings is much sturdier metal.  The exposed wire running to the speaker cups really doesn't bother me, and the accessibility of the screws should make repairs a breeze.<br /><br />The M50's did have more comfortable ear cushions, but they were heavy enough that they were fatiguing after a few hours of wear.  Most of the comfort comes from them being bigger and completely encompassing my ear.  The 7506's are much flatter in profile and tend to pinch the upper cartilage of my ear.  That said, the noise canceling provided by the 7506's is far superior.  You could play music at painful levels with the two cups pressed together and not hear a thing unless you put your ear up to them.  This is not the case with the M50's which have significant bleed.  The 7506's have much denser foam and are designed for this purpose, they work so well that I can barely hear my own voice when I'm wearing them and talking.<br /><br />As far as frequency response and dynamic range go, if you know enough to tell the difference between variable frequency responses, then you know how to use a multiband equalizer and can more than compensate for any speaker/environment.  I do feel though, that I'm getting more detail out of the 7506's because less is washed out by the bass.  In fact, it's almost annoying as low bit-rate MP3's are now virtually unlistenable.<br /><br />In conclusion, for practical purposes I'd choose the MDR-7506's every time.  They've been around for 20+ years of industry use and are still kicking, and are likely to last more with easy maintenance.  I wouldn't think twice about shoving them in backpack (although I always pack them neatly in the rather high quality leather carrying case).  I'm wholly impressed by these and while the M50's are good in their own right I don't see myself ever using them again for any reason.

0393088774|3.0|In this book Dr. Krugman puts forth the very conventional neo-Keynesian argument for monetary and fiscal stimulus written in a non-technical manner. The intended audience is laymen. For those, even with one macroeconomic class under their belts, this book would not present anything new. It also does not discuss the causes of the current economic crises but, instead, only solutions within the neo-Keynesian framework.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman's posited solution is the mainstream \\"middle of the road\\" advice that would be given by the overwhelming majority of academic and professional economists. Due to the fact that the economy is currently in what is called a \\"liquidity trap\\" (a combination of a lack demand for products and an accompanying and associated lack of demand for capital [i.e., loans]), monetary policy alone does not suffice. Even if interest rates are very low, as the currently are, as little or no sales are expected, low interest rates cannot, per se, prompt businesses to borrow and invest. Hence the need for an expansionary fiscal policy.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman makes this argument well (and in terms a non-economics major can comprehend) but the book does have a number of serious weaknesses. For one, he does not make explicitly clear how much simulative spending (as a percentage of gross domestic product or otherwise) is needed. This is ironic as an important thrust of this book, if not the main one, is that there has not been enough of a stimulus.<br /><br />A second major problem is that he does not discuss what form, in terms of spending, the stimulus should have to maximize its impact. The answer to this is in spending which ends up in the hands of those with relatively high marginal propensities to consume (i.e., unemployment compensation, propping up employment for state employees such as high school teachers) as opposed to spending that eventually makes its way into the hands of those with lower marginal propensities to consume (i.e., highly paid software engineers who would spend smaller percentages of money than the unemployed).<br /><br />A third problem is that Dr. Krugman also does not state how long this spending has to continue other than to say when the economy is out of the recession. This sounds nice but the fact of the matter is determining this is, until well after the fact, is extremely difficult. Even Dr. Krugman would agree with this. Additionally, and related to this, is that there is no discussion of a point at which debt levels may reach which may slow down future growth. Reinhart and Rogoff, in their \\"This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\\", posit that at 80% of GDP debt starts to negatively impact growth. A short academic paper and book that this book itself was based on is \\"decade of debt\\" and can be found on sale on Amazon. This reviewer has posted a short review of it for those interested.<br /><br />Despite the above stated problems this reviewer still recommends this book. It provides a short succinct non-technical case for expansionary fiscal stimulus written in a manner that makes the argument accessible to laymen, unlike so many other books written on the subject.
0143121006|4.0|I think some of my favorite kinds of stories are about unsolved mysteries - books that return to murders, lost treasure, and the like years or decades after all the witnesses of the time have been laid to rest, and bring a new eye to the scene.  French takes an unsolved murder in Peking in 1937 and paints in a city on the edge of a new and unknown era - the looming Japanese threat of invasion, hard-partying high life, the foreign bureaucrats lost in internal feuds and their desire to not sully the reputation of their little community, and finally a man and his savagely murdered daughter.  It would be easy to get lost in any one of those threads but the author managed to balance them all as the story moves through the unravelling of the Chinese rule in Peking and the public and private investigations of the crime.<br /><br />Pamela Werner was just nineteen when her body was found at the Fox Tower, a locale believed to be haunted by the Chinese. The uneasy partnership of the Chinese police who had jurisdiction over the site, and the British concession detective appointed by the Legation opens the story.  Quickly it comes to light that the Werner household isn't the usual; Pamela's father is a former Consul living in a hutong outside the Legation grounds, a solitary scholar away on his explorations for months at a time.  And Pamela has her own secrets as a young woman looking to shape her own life as she comes of age...<br /><br />Thoroughly researched but never academic, always lively, a good read if you enjoy mysteries, Chinese history or just an engaging tale and excellent sleuthwork by the author.<br /><br />Maps, photos, an audio walk of the relevant sights, and other extras are available on the Midnight in Peking website.

B003O86FMW|5.0|In my lifetime I don't remember ever reading books that are written in a series that captivated my attention like sequels to the [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]]. I could not put the second book, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] down because it was so intense with suspense.  I really thought there could not be a story to follow the first book, but the author really does a creative job in making the reader believe that this story could come about. It is an exciting book that leaves the reader wondering if the main character is going to come out of her challenges alive. I would recommend this book to everyone who has read the first one.

B0040JHXT8|4.0|Finally found a copy of the vinyl release of this amazing album. It's a 3 disc set, each a clean 180 gram pressing.<br />It's a revelation, far better than the CD. Highly recommended and well worth seeking out.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I must say that  this  book,  as  well as  all of Jody Picault books, is a real page  turner.  I simply couldn't put it down and finished it in only two days.  It  kept the reader's  interest  and expectations in every single sentence. My first reaction was WOW!!  Even  after I finished reading it, I couldn't put it out of my mind. The subject is so disturbing!<br /><br />That said,  now, a week later,  the impact of my reading is beginning to fade  and I can think objectively and I can  see the many flaws of this book. Sorry to say it, but the book isn't reliable.  I was unable to follow the discrepancies in Chris behavior:  If your girl friend  declare time after time her intentions of ending her life and you are so committed to save her life, instead of running and yell for help you steal  the revolver and put the bullets in it and put the revolver in her hands. How dumb can you be? And such  lack of sensibility for a boy that intelligent, didn't he realize that his sex with her was  like rape?<br /><br />Another thing that is at the core of the book: Em's behavior. She acted as if she lived  in the nineteen century. didn't she see any other options open to her but a forced marriage? please, at the end of the twentie's century and  coming from a rich suburban and modern  family? and why she went on and on having sex  with him and hating it?  because she was supposed to have it? Not to disappoint  him? again, we are not in the fifties any more.  Miss Picault only touched in the surface the issue of the sexual attack  Em  suffered as a a child and doesn't  connect it with anything. May be that is her way to let us, readers,  draw our own  conclusions. I am very sorry to say, it doesn't work.<br /><br />The parents characters are well defined, each one with his or her reaction, but are a a little two dimensional.<br /><br />After I finished the book, I felt like a child who was promised a present and didn't get it. My expectations were up and I was sure it was goingto have an apex, but nothing happened. it ends in a casual way. Even the final revelation didn't risen the interest  and  didn't answer  anything.  It seems to me the writer got tired  and finished the book in a rush, leaving us not satisfied.

0307594165|4.0|When I heard that Toni Morrison was coming out with a new novel, I was absolutely excited. I loved Paradise and Beloved (so much so that I've never written a review of either of them) so I pre-ordered a copy of Home as soon as I could. I got my copy yesterday (the release day) and I finished it this morning. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but this novella was different altogether from any of my expectations.<br /><br />This novella was very different from other Morrison books that I've read. It was, first and foremost, easy to read. Beloved took me over a month to get through because it was so dense and so difficult; Home took me only a few hours. I was, I have to admit, a little surprised and even disappointed at how easy the prose was. Though the chapters switch between narrators, with a majority of the chapters being from Frank's perspective, the narrators of each chapter are always characters that have been previously introduce and are always identified in the first few sentences of their chapter. The reader never has to figure out who is talking or what is going on, so long as they can remember names. The chapters alternate between the story itself, told by the various narrators, and chapters in which Frank addresses the author directly, telling them what really happened, how he really felt, and occasionally correcting things that the author previously wrote. I really enjoyed those chapters, because they called attention to the act of storytelling itself, to the fact that someone who is not the characters is writing these things, to the idea that sometimes the author messes things up. I thought that technique was very cool, and it isn't something I've seen Morrison do before.<br /><br />Possibly because the book was so short, I had a hard time connecting to the characters the way I have with her other novels. While they are good round characters, they aren't nearly as fleshed out as Sethe or the women from Paradise. I feel like this was more a novel of setting and theme than of characters, which is usually ok by me, but since this book was about Frank finding his sense of home, I wanted to connect with him a bit more. While it let me down in character development, it was great in setting. You get a good sense from the writing of what life was like for poor black people in the South, the way that injustice and violence from whites and the police was normal, an everyday hazard to be avoided rather than something surprising or unusual. Home includes a lot of the things that were happening at the time, segregation, eugenics, bebop, and obviously the Korean war. Mostly these elements are woven into the story seamlessly and organically. To balance out the injustice and sadness there were always communities, churches, and helpful strangers who supported each other where law and prejudice let them down. I loved that this book showed the ways that black people rallied and helped each other. So often we think of blacks before the civil rights movement as being poor downtrodden helpless people, but the reality is that they were often very strong, supporting each other and getting through with hard work, community, and a refusal to let poverty and hate grind them down. I think this book did a great job showing that without watering down the real pain of injustice and violence that comes with war and segregation. It's a delicate balance, but for the most part I think it's a balance that Home strikes very well.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, the writing in Home is much easier and simpler than in the other Morrison novels I've read. The themes were generally just as subtle and nuanced as I expect from her, with the situations, problems, and solutions feeling real and honest rather than contrived or pedantic. That said, some parts of the last few chapters felt a little too obvious for me. Unlike in Beloved, in Home Morrison basically hands the reader the solution or moral that Cee and Frank have to find, explaining it tous in clear language. While this isn't always a bad thing, and in some novels those revelations are often the most beautiful parts, in Home it felt a little too easy. Maybe it's because I was expecting something more like her other novels, but the simplicity of those last few chapters left me a bit disappointed. They were beautiful, thematic, and they structurally balanced out the novel, but they just felt too easy.<br /><br />So, after all this, what did I think of Home? It was good, definitely, but it certainly wasn't her best novel. I think it would be a perfect introduction to Toni Morrison for people who haven't read her books and don't want to start with anything too difficult. It has all of her usual themes, her lovely use of setting, and her realistic characters, but it's shorter in length and has much easier prose. For people who don't usually read difficult literary fiction, this is the perfect introduction to Toni Morrison. For those of us who love her partially because of her difficulty, this probably won't stand out as one of her best novels. The writing was much more mature than in The Bluest Eye, but it wasn't as complex or as moving as Paradise or Beloved. I would definitely recommend it, but it isn't going to join her other works on the list of my favorite novels of all time.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars<br />Recommendations: Readable prose, realistic setting, ok character development. A quick, enjoyable, and contemplative read from a wonderful author. Not as substantial as some of her other works.us in clear language.

0062082353|2.0|It is sad when a young American soldier revels in killing other human beings and tries to have us believe that it's the right thing to do.  Granted, it's the enemy, but this is not a description of how to catch a fish or how to fix your bicycle.  This goes into great detail in the planning and execution of murder.<br /><br />BTW, this young man is now back stateside and what do you do when your craving for killing is no longer fulfilled?  I worry about the next chapter in this man's complex life when one of his frequent bar fights gets out of hand and another person or persons end up dead.<br /><br />I am truly sorry that I put money into this man's pocket by purchasing this book.  I recommend that people reading this critique seriously consider passing this one by and make a donation instead to World Hunger or some really charitable organization.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Very minor spoilers below<br /><br />A lot of the criticism regarding this second entry to this series is likely relating to the pace and the slightly mundane nature of events that take place, and honestly those or very valid critiques. The Wise Man's Fear isn't quite as gripping as book one, and does lack some of the spark in the flow of the narrative. That being said, it is still very well written, with a rich writing style that manages to keep you involved. Kvothe does grow as a character, and you see a lot more of a rounded view as to whom he was as a youth, and understand a bit better how he has fallen since.<br /><br />There are areas that drag on too long (chasing the bandits, training to fight...), but they still feel important enough that I understand the reasoning for the inclusion. No, it's not quite as good a read as The Name of the Wind, but I think that there is a reason for that, and it will come into light a bit better in the next book. The only real complaint I have is that none of the secondary characters received any further exposition. I was hoping to learn more about the support cast and actually get a feel for them, but they all pretty much remain little more than support pieces for Kvothe. I understand the reasoning, but it feels a little like a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />All in all, it was a good read and kept me interested for the next book to come. It suffered a bit from sequelitis, but cam off better than most sophomore efforts do.
0679731725|5.0|by Kazuo Ishiguro<br /><br />This worthy Booker winner first published in 1989 and later made into a successful movie, starring Antony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, still maintains its power to move and fascinate.  It tells a first-person story of a humble and dutiful butler, Stevens, whose slavish loyalty to his master, Lord Darlington, exceeds the call of duty and even, perhaps, commonsense.  In calm and dignified prose Stevens describes his journey to interview Miss Kenton, once the housekeeper at Darlington Hall, and now a disconsolate woman separated from her husband.  Although he never admits it to the reader, Stevens is secretly regretting the fact that he did not develop his budding relationship with Miss Kenton many years ago.  The back-story of his interest in the housekeeper and his present regret is fed into the account of his journey to the Cornwall to meet her.  Typically, he refuses to admit his interest in her is rather more than professional and that under his politeness and dignity lies a stifled passion, and a sadness at a life that is gone, never to return.<br /><br />To talk about the novel's style and to use such meaningless clich&eacute;s as `beautifully written' or `wonderfully crafted' would be even more critically useless than usual.  The fact is that this elegant, restrained prose account, with all its circumlocution and repetition is the perfect mirror of the butler who has disciplined himself to suppress any unseemly emotion or light-heartedness; in a word to fear the `bantering' which he frequently encounters from his new employer, passing strangers and above all the Miss Kenton he recalls from the past. In place of bantering, Stevens offers us dignity, without which no butler can ever be called `great'.<br /><br />I have now read the novel three times, and with each reading derived more pleasure from it.  It is one of the most unsensational and yet moving stories in fiction, about a small man's struggle to become a moral being; something achieved at considerable cost to his emotional life.ed at considerable cost to his emotional life.
B003L77G8I|5.0|This TV series has everything: Action, adventure, romance, comedy, excellent plots, and great characters. This is one series I will hate to see end. Warning though: once you watch one or two episodes, you will have to watch them all. The writing and acting for Bones is superb.

B004EPYZV2|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie. I did not get to see it in the movie theaters when it came out in Dec 2012. The reviews were great and I did like the 3rd movie that was made in 2006. But with all the positive reviews this movie got I expected this to be the best one but it was NOT. I like Tom Cruise and love a lot of his films. When he had that whole backlash thing I thought people were being dumb. But I was BORED. And even if I felt some action scenes were good and creative I kind of felt that I have seen this all before. I would say the only reason to see this is if you liked the other movies and do not care if you are seeing the same old thing again and again.  I think this should be the last Mission Impossible film but with it's big box office I do not think it will be.
B0041D843M|5.0|As of 05/10/12, why is the Kindle edition of this book no longer available?  About a week ago I downloaded the preview to my phone (Kindle app).  Now that I am ready to purchase this book, the Kindle edition is no longer available.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|best Glu app I've played. the frozen start menu was fixed with an update and I did have to restart at level one but that's the only bad thing I can say about it. I don't like games that require real money to advance in. so I'm glad to see that it's possible to earn coins in the game. also I like the &quot;pinchenco&quot; &quot;plunking&quot; game to earn prides between rounds. what ever it's called, it's a nice touch.
0439023513|1.0|This series premise seems to bear much debt owed to Battle Royale - much like the Lion King did to Simba (each case Japanese original to US \\"(wink, wink, ) homage\\".<br /><br />The concept, admittedly, owes much to 1950s and 60s science fiction authors (Robert Sheckley for sure and I hate to admit I have forgotten the other - but the story appeared  in a late 50s issue of F&SF  -  wildly, the F&SF one bore an uncanny similarity to the King/Bachman book that was turned into a Schwartzenegger movie some years back.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I was going to rent this movie online through Amazon but the reviews mainly stated the movie was horrible.  So I decided to save a couple bucks and rented it through Redbox.  Geez, I should've listened to the reviews and not rented it period!<br /><br />I forced myself to watch at least half of the movie before turning it off.  The few fight scenes I viewed are so slow, it literally looks as if the actors are saying \\"ok now you hit me\\"...\\"ok now I kick you\\".  The music during the fight scenes make it even more boring.  The only thing I can get out of this movie is that Gina is beautiful...but I could google pics of her for free.

B006RED4GA|4.0|This was indeed a horror movie of which I personally would like to see more of. While some of the questions you get in ur head during the movie are not all answered it was a good thriller and scared me at times and that's not easy.We never find out why the old man offed himself but I think he had something to do with the jilted on ur wedding day thing, not sure. Its just made in a way that ghost stories should be and not some guy with mental issues killing ppl with an axe, ya know. Definitely a good good movie.I didnt care for the end the last shot with the slight outline of \\"Claire\\" at the end before the door slams was cool but u have to be told to look for it. Hated that she died she was cool.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|In 2008 the movie IRON MAN was released. The film was a major gamble. It was the first of a series of movies Marvel planned to release that would lead up to an eventual release of a multi-hero live-action adaptation of The Avengers. Had it bombed, some of the planned films in the build-up might never have happened (not to mention the resurrected career of Robert Downey, Jr.) and THE AVENGERS would never have been made. Thankfully, the film was successful and four years later, THE AVENGERS movie is a reality.<br /><br />The Tesseract (Cosmic Cube) from CAPTAIN AMERICA and seen in THOR, is being studied by S.H.I.E.L.D. as a way to provide free and endless energy to the world. It is also believed that the device can be used as a portal to other worlds. The Tesseract starts reacting strangely and then, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) appears. He begins killing off agents one after the other with a powerful scepter. He also uses the scepter to turn people into his mental slaves. Loki is chased by Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) through S.H.I.E.L.D.'s underground complex, but is able to escape.<br /><br />Even though he's been ordered to disassemble the group, Fury begins gathering together the band of super heroes of the Avengers Initiative. Steve Rogers (Capt. America-played by Chris Evans), Tony Stark (Iron Man), Bruce Banner (Hulk-played by Mark Ruffalo and voiced by Lou Ferrigno), and Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow-played by Scarlett Johansson) are all on board and are joined by Thor (Chris Hemsworth) who has been sent from Asgard by Odin to collect his brother Loki. Well, things don't exactly go as planned (well, duh) and Loki escapes again and an invasion of Earth by an extraterrestrial army begins in the middle of New York.<br /><br />For a movie that has been planned for years and has a cast list that is truly star-studded, THE AVENGERS is an impressive bit of filmmaking. SUPERMAN ushered in the modern superhero movie and X-MEN illustrated that a super-team movie could actually be pulled off. THE AVENGERS has now illustrated that you can actually make a series of very distinct, yet connected superhero films, then bring them all together in one massive movie and still make a highly-entertaining and enjoyable film that appeals to filmmakers across the board.<br /><br />There's something for everyone in the movie: a little romance for the ladies, plus several attractive men. There's all kinds of references to the comics for the comic book geeks. There's lots and lots and lots of action, but none of it is gory. There are several different layers of humor: physical comedy that appeals to kids and witty one-liners referencing classical works that will appeal to someone with a more intellectual humor.<br /><br />Captain America emerges as the leader of The Avengers, Iron Man/Tony Stark get most of the best lines, Thor hasn't given up on seeing Loki redeemed, and Hulk finally gets his cinematic due (someone finally got the Big Green Guy right) and emerges as the real hero of the film.<br /><br />The script does a wonderful job of explaining the techno-babble of what the audience needs to know without getting bogged down in unnecessary details. Also, since the previous movies in the Avengers line-up focused on introductions, the film doesn't have any exposition and gets right into the action.<br /><br />Speaking of action, there's a lot of it. There's the opening sequence that ends up destroying one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s land bases, there's some infighting with the heroes (what's mightier Thor's hammer or Captain America's shield?), and there's the climactic battle between The Avengers and the invading alien army from another universe.<br /><br />Visually, the film is gorgeous. It has a perfect blend between fantasy and the real-world.<br /><br />I only have two criticisms about the film. The first is that we really don't get an understanding of how Loki got to meet the aliens that supported and financed his attempted takeover of Earth. The second is kind of a minor spoiler.<br /><br />***Spoiler!***<br /><br />A major character apparently meets an untimely demise. ? I realize that for the plot of the film, a death seemed necessary. But, was it really? Wouldn't the escape of Loki and the destruction that ensued as well as the deaths of countless other agents been enough to unite the heroes together as a team? Or how about one of the lesser known Avengers (Hawkeye or Black Widow); their death could have been just as poignant. The demise appears real, but because of some dialogue earlier in the movie and the reactions of a couple characters, there is speculation that this was all part of a game by Nick Fury. A Life Model Decoy, perhaps?<br /><br />Overall, THE AVENGERS is a great movie. It's one that you'll enjoy watching again and again.nd is kind of a minor spoiler.<br /><br />***Spoiler!***<br /><br />A major character apparently meets an untimely demise. ?

B000002HJR|5.0|The plain black cover gives no hint to how purely cool and hard this album really is.  This fuggin album is very perfection in every way.  Do not hesitate to buy one for each disk player you own.<br /><br />The drumming is so damn sweet and I'm completely blown away everytime I turn this on. Guitar work is completely awe inspiring.  The sound of Nola is perfection in my feeble little mind.<br /><br />I'm going to revise my other ratings to remove a star to pay homage to this album.

B004OEMRGI|5.0|We bought this CD after having  the pleasure of hearing Bombino last week at the 2012 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival. We were walking by the Blues Tent and became transfixed by this sound that reminded me of Ali Farke Toure.  But Toure had died several years ago, so I thought maybe it was his son.  We went in and there was this young guy with a Stratocaster and long flowing robes pumping out this hypnotic sound.  He worked out for at least ten minutes on \\"Another Life,\\" a simple two note riff with complex fills and relentlessly driven by his drummer.  I felt like I could run across the Sahara desert with that song set to repeat on my Ipod.  He has a joyous stage presence and dances and spins as if he can feel God's pleasure in every note.<br /><br />Another reviewer here commented that his singing in his native language was distracting. Well, Mick Jagger sings in English and I can only understand about half of what he says.  I find Bombino's soft voice an important element to the melody of his songs, but his guitar playing is really his strength. If you were to describe him like a fine wine, it would be a base of Ali Farke Toure with hints of Mark Knofler, and an occasional Carlos Santana channeling the rhythms of Mississippi Fred McDowell.  Bombino grew up as a refugee in central Africa, but was prohibited by the government from performing in public.  Great music is often created from political repression (e.g. Delta Blues) and Bombino now has the opportunity to express himself freely.  I envision him collaborating with other musicians such as Ry Cooder which will allow him to become more mainstream with western audiences.  I give this bottle of fine wine a 92 and look forward to more.

B003YL4L0W|3.0|This book starts like any other Jodi Picoult book, creating the ethical dilemma the reader is supposed to think about- except there isn't much to think about. One side is depicted as human and worthy (the gay couple) the other as stupid and brainwashed (the religious). I don't have anything against this, and I've met plenty of religious people who have been brainwashed, but for that reason I wish Picoult had kept religion out of it and just made it about the ethical dilemma of a man finding his ex-wife wanting to have his baby with someone else. There's no sides to take in this book, unless you want to side with stupid. Still it was not a bad read, if you can get through the very cheesy parts (every time music is mentioned, or the last chapter which is almost sickly). A bit rushed towards the end, feels like the author wanted to finish quickly and move on to more interesting characters. I don't blame her.
0345803485|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey<br />Fifty Shades Trilogy Book One<br />By E.L. James<br /><br />Anastasia has never found a man who has interested her enough to even go on a date with until she meets highly successful young entrepreneur Christian Grey, and immediately she is lost in his dark eyes. But Christian has a dark secret, domination. As Ana soon discovers there is more to this man than just his vast fortune she finds herself falling in love with him but can Ana come to terms with his eccentric desires?<br /><br />I was a little weary to read this book I had some vague idea it would just be dominatrix sex and though interesting I love there to be a good story line. I was surprised to realize this was actually a fun book full of witty commentary from Ana's Subconscious and Inner Goddess I found myself giggling. Though I must say there were a couple of scenes I could have lived without, but E.L. James did a wonderful job writing this novel the romance was strong and the obstacle they must face is believable and intriguing. This book reads like a young adult novel though it is certainly not for the faint of heart. I kept thinking to myself \\"It's an erotic, modern day, more realistic version of Beauty and the Beast.\\" I am certainly curious enough to see what happens next.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book. I am looking forward to reading the next few books following this one. I have 2 small kids and it is hard to find time to read, but I seemed to manage finding time with this book.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Overall an engaging read that keeps one guessing as to the nature of its ghosts: real or imagined? A well thought-out and intricate braided plot with only one tiny plot-hole that I noticed (I won't give anything away by saying that the small-town doctor would surely have known that the gardening boy did not have a grandmother). An intriguing read (though sometimes a little slow), though I was never truly creeped out the way I was with Sarah Waters's modern take on the gothic with The Little Stranger. The heroine's obsessive agonizing over her [you'll find out soon enough if you read it] felt a bit heavy-handed to me, but definitely a good rainy day book.<br />--Jennifer D. Munro, \\"The Strangler Fig: Stories\\" author

B003O86FMW|3.0|I was not as excited about this book as I was the first one. It was good but it didn't leave me wanting to read all day like some books.
B005LAIGLE|3.0|Andy (Caleb Jones) is a want a be drug smuggler who messes up and tosses the coke into the water of New Orleans harbor as the Customs agents start to board the ship.  Now he is in real trouble with the drug gang leader who wants his money or Andy dies.  Chris Farraday (Mark Wahlberg) is a retired smuggler gone straight as he is happily married and has two children.  Andy is his brother-in-law and now Chris has to go back into the smuggling business to help Andy pay the drug debt he owes before he gets killed....<br /><br />What follows is a convoluted and multi-tiered plot that is so predictable that you can even guess where the drugs are hidden 70 minutes before it happens.  The storyline basically gives away many of the movies key elements long before they occur and if you listen closely to the dialog you can figure out where the plot is headed before you get there.  I like to be surprised and this movie's events were easily foreseeable.<br /><br />The acting seems just award at times and this combined with the storyline make this just an average movie.  Overall it is a 3 or maybe a little better but I wanted Mark Wahlberg to shine in this movie as I think he is a good actor.  The movie and Mark never really achieve their top performance that should have been possible to carry this movie to a higher quality.<br /><br />If you like Mark, watch the movie but don't expect one of his best performances.  I think the script was just too limiting for him (or the Director)!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good read.  Very stylized, excellent characters with an original array of storyline and situations.  Story moves along at a snappy pace and keeps you riveted and guessing what will happen next. Left me with a \\"hunger\\" to read what will happen next, chapter after chapter.
B006WZIETG|5.0|Warner Bros. Home Entertainment gives \\"Gremlins \\" enthusiasts what they've been waiting a long time for. \\"Gremlins 2: The New Batch \\" finally gets the high definition treatment. Joe Dante's sequel still thrills with its great balance of camp, gore, comedy, and horror. Fans not only get the feature film, but some nice extras as well. The \\"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\\" Blu-ray release will please consumers waiting for this to makes it way into the high definition realm. This is one release well worth upgrading and spending your hard-earned cash on.
0345803485|5.0|I first heard about this book from an SNL skit. My curiosity about the book brought me to Amazon, I read the other reviews, but it wasn't until I read the preview pages that I NEEDED to order the book. Here it is 24hrs since I've received and read Fifty Shades of Grey that \\"I want more\\". Unfortunately, I am going to have to wait until next week to order the last two installments of this Trilogy. This is an easy read, so I just might have to reread it over & over until then.

B001V5CIFI|4.0|Very nice, light entertainment.  Good family movie.  I enjoyed this on an evening when it was too cold to be anywhere and just wanted a fun movie.
B000JML7EC|3.0|I saw this available and thought to myself \\"Hey, it's a classic\\". I thought it would be a treat. So predicable, it was painful. My guess is it was for a childrens audience or there just wasn't a lot of choices to read back when this book came out. My opinion: move on, do not waste your time.
B007GE2H3G|3.0|I really loved the beautifully animated characters, but the story seemed choppy and slow.  I don't think kids would really like this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|i like it! it does exactly what's needed. thanks for the good work! ok i guess it could use a few more backgrounds and card designs.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I would've enjoyed the book more if the author had written it better. There was no transition in-between paragraphs and sometimes I would have to go back and re-read certain sections. However, the writing started to get better in the mid section of the story.<br /><br />I didn't consider this story erotic. Yes I understand that some readers would call it erotica due to the BDSM scenes, but I didn't get stimulated by it. Although, there were certain scenes that were sensual and even a tad bit erotic but this story is more psychological than erotic. It was very emotional and I plan to continue reading the next two books.
B003EYVXVE|4.0|I loved the movie, but I thought it was missing something special that the book had. You barely saw Gale, and the scenes with Rue were too short, it was like you barely got to know her and then she died. They did not spend enough time on the game, and the berry scene, the most important, was too short and quick.<br />But the actors did a GREAT job and the graphics were good. I'll buy the DVD and see the second movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Never read an erotic novel. Super exciting page turner. The writing was superb! It was humorous and filled with thoughts and musings many people have and I truly enjoyed it! This book is clearly not for \\"uptight\\" women and deserves to be shared to young and old adult women one should never pass through this earth not experiencing enjoyment from a loving, caring and very fun partner. The fact that they moved and changed each other to the point of the ultimate committment of marriage. Excellent read. Well done E.L James. I'm only sorry I am on Book 3 and it will be a memory! Can't wait to read all her writings! Leave it to a Brit to know what it is all about!! Loved it!<br /><br />The only negative is the childhood hang up. That was disappointing and quite frankly should have been left out...it wasn't neccessary.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I was hooked!!!  I could not put it down.  The characters just came to life in my imagination, which is exactly what I love about books!

B003ZSH606|5.0|This album is a spectacular representation of the versatility of Jamiroquai's capabilities, ranging from the newly expressed rock tones to the classic acid jazz style, also adding some reggae and funk vibes. It is purely a work art, also portraying numerous viewpoints on love, religion, and the thrills that life has to offer. Although it is a fresh mood in the music Jamiroquai, it still retains the sounds that they are most well known for. It is an album to be bought.

B005PTQPU0|5.0|I too have been a huge fan for a long time.  Kate has the imagination and will to twist the road she has you on until you are either shaken off the way or drawn into a trance.  50 Words is amazing but for many it may not be so upon the first listen.  If you sit down quietly, warn off everyone to leave you in peace for an hour, and shut down the PC and close down the smart phone, you will find it fascinating, if you let your ears search for it.  That illusive thing that some albums have, in which you are drawn into the silences as much as you are the sounds of the music and the meanings of the words, 50 Words lets you drift Earthward like a snowflake and pulls you under the waves of Lake Tahoe.  You are in love with winter and can't remember if it is today, yesterday, or someday.  As you focus you fall.  You can simply leave it on in the background, allowing it to register somewhere just above the hum of the world outside and the beating of your senses, and you will catch its drift.  50 Words For Snow is like a painting that follows you around the room or a scent that whispers just behind your shoulder.  Truly lovely, with moments of brilliance, again it is the silence as much as the music, that speaks and hypnotizes the fortunate person who bothers to listen more than twice.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Loooooooved this book!<br /><br />Is it great literature - no.  Is some of the dialogue stunted - sure.  Is this book for everyone - maybe not.<br /><br />But if you are a child of the 80's and you were into games and movies of that time, this book will give you a geekgasm.  It will feel like being able to carry around the best part of your childhood with you.  If you haven't bought this book yet - you're crazy.
0545265355|5.0|Excellent!  If you enjoy fantasy/fiction (as I do), then you will also enjoy these books. I like sci-fi.  These books are a cross between sci-fi and real-world.  I enjoyed reading them, perhaps you will too.

We never watch the interviews, etc., so this collection was a perfect gift for the amount I paid for it. The attractive plastic case contains all eight movies in a convenient arrangement. I know some folks are waiting for the release later this year of a super special-edition, but the set I ordered is really all you need for owning, watching and enjoying the Potter collection in Blu-Ray.

0345803485|5.0|I love this book best I've read all year, beautifully written. El James writes a well written story and I fell in love with the characters. Its not just about sex, and bondage--this book is actually about romance.
0307949435|5.0|Now I know why I have gotten so fat in the past 15 years:  I ate low fat everything, ate plenty of \\"healthy whole grains\\" (whole wheat breads, brown rice, oatmeal & oat bran, whole grain pasta, etc.), tried to follow all the nutritional \\"wisdom\\" but I just kept getting fatter.  So now I know why.  Gary Taubes did the research and shows very clearly the error of the conventional dietary information foisted on us for the past 30 plus years.  I am now in anger mode - I will no longer jeopardize my health by believing that it is my fault.  I am not a glutton; I am not a sloth; I am an ordinary human being who has listened long enough to lies.  I started even before reading \\"Why we get fat and what to do about it\\" to eliminate all wheat, grains, sugar and high carb. fruits and vegetables.  I eat real food: meat, fish, poultry, eggs, cheese, nuts, green vegetables, berries, cream, butter, olive oil, coconut oil and I am regaining my well-being (no more IBS, no belly fat, no insomnia, no brain fog, no skin eruptions, no joint pain).  Thank you to Gary Taubes for spending so many years of his life to dig for the truth and write this book so ordinaary folks struggling with obesity, diabetes, arthritis, intestinal distress, etc. can change their lives.  This book should be required reading for all dieticians, doctors, gastroenterologists and parents. The companion book should also be required reading:  \\"Wheat Belly: lose the wheat, lose the weight\\" by Dr. William Davis. I highly recommend these two books for all who want to say goodbye to obesity and diabetes and live a life of health and well-being.
0061726834|5.0|In this book, i really liked the storyline, and well everything about the book. the only reason i say i dont like it is because of a certain thing that happens at the end. lets just say, i was really sad, but i would deffinatly, and already have recomended it to someone... :) enjoy

1451627289|3.0|When King first started writing he was madly brilliant and then we all know what happened after he was in that terrible accident where he was basically run over (almost out of a king novel), since then he has been up and down with more downs than ups.  This novel started out great after all who does not like a time travel mystery especially one concerning the events of JFK! WOW this is going to be dynamite.  for the first 100 pages it was, where King talks about time travel and the story unfolds, how it came to be and his decision on how to save JFK, it was all very fresh and exciting.  Well---- then it took a turn for the worse, in his last 10 novels or so King has started to write some really soap opera prose and this book is no different.  What could have been an exciting who done it, how did they do it, why did they do it, turned into a bland mellodrama, the time machine aspect could have been put to great use but about a third of the way in was abandoned and turned into a kind of bland love story.  Love stories are nice but I want a king with bite(Salem's lot please), the old King had an attitude the new one just wants to find happiness.<br />  The first 100 pages are worth 5 stars and the last 100 pages are worth 4 stars the rest in between 2 stars and that is why sadly this book is 3 Stars.
B007L4HET8|1.0|Really Sony? Why keep releasing blu-rays with no extras? Do we look stupid to you? We buy films mostly because of the special features, not for the film itself. Just to watch the movie, I'd rather see it on cable, Netflix or download.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What's wrong with our country is the fact that anyone considers this literature. This \\"novel\\" is trash. The writing is wretched and the story is repulsive and unrealistic.

0345803485|2.0|I had to read this book after all of the \\"hoopla\\" going around. I saw it advertised as \\"Mommy Porn\\" and also saw the skit about this book on Saturday Night Live. I thought it might be something different and worth reading, but I was mistaken. I got the same feeling reading this book that I had when I attempted to read Twilight and I assume that those adult women who swooned over Twilight would be the same who will swoon over 50 Shades. It is too bad really, there are so many great authors out there who can't get published and something like this hits the best seller lists. There was so much repetition in this book, not unlike Twilight, that I became bored and had to force myself to finish. Definitely another Cinderella story gone wrong. Don't waste your time.

1563523302|4.0|Do You long to be a millionaire? Doesn't everyone? Well being a millionaire used to be everyone's dream. I can remember back to when I was a kid. It was more money  than most people could imagine. But this was in 1948 and we had just moved to Boulder, Colorado. The folks put all their savings into buying a house at the edge of town. It cost $6,250. Dad found a job and made about $100 per week so he could provide for our family and pay off the mortgage. Plus, we needed a new car and a fully (radio, heater, turning signals) equipped new Chevy cost about $2,000. We were fairly well off, much better than average, but being a millionaire was just beyond our imaginations.<br /><br />Things have changed drastically. About five years ago I read that one out of every 50 people in California were millionaires. Hmmmm. Imagine! How did they all get so wealthy? You know, all sorts of people might even be a millionaires and not even know it. I live in a nice part of town and our modest tract home is said to be worth about $500,000. Can you imagine? I suppose a lot of people have the mortgages paid off and the houses only cost about $30K when they were new. All of this everyone-being-rich started in the late 90s and it first came to my attention in a book titled \\"The Millionaire Next Door: The Surprising Secrets of America's Wealthy.\\" I purchased the book in 1997 and it's been resting on my bookshelf ever since. It's an interesting book. Now, a bit dated, I'd say. Thomas J. Stanley and William D. Danko discuss the millionaire thing and explain how people got that way, how you might join them and how to recognize them. The book has a lot of common sense observations and advice. Sure, It's possible that the average Joe/Jane on the street is within reach of being a millionaire, if he/she has a bit of good fortune and puts his/her mind to it. The book gives all kinds of good information and advice. It's a useful thing to think about.<br /><br />However, the basic problem that we're all facing is not ever-increasing wealth, it's our ever-decreasing currency. If you're young and start today in the accumulation of your first million, you're probably going to find that a new modest house will cost about a million by the time you accomplish the task and a car to park in the driveway will set you back another $100K. Anyhow, the book is worth reading, even at this late time.<br /><br />Gary Petersonl facing is not ever-increasing wealth, it's our ever-decreasing currency.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game to play. I have always enjoyed adventerous games. It reminds me of my child hood when I used to play Super Mario Brothers.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|I had planned not to write a review for this, because the short time I have cannot do the work justice, but it seems that some folks are inevitably misrepresenting this album.<br /><br />As another reviewer pointed out: this is not Porcupine Tree; this is not Opeth.  If you listen only to metal or prog rock, you will probably not like this album.  If you need music to feel good about while driving down the freeway, this is not it.  If you love a good dance beat or at least heavy percussion, look elsewhere.<br /><br />On the other hand, if your musical tastes are eclectic; if you think the spaces between notes can be as important as the notes themselves; if you sometimes make time to put headphones on and really listen to music; then this album is for you.  As another reviewer noted, both of these artists have made pop music on occasion, but that is not what this is.  This is an intricately thought out, finely crafted work by two artists at the peak of their creative power.  It is the kind of album that one still listens to for years after first hearing it. The word the comes repeatedly to mind when I listen to this is \\"exquisite\\".<br /><br />I think many PT and Opeth fans love those projects because of the intense musical thought behind them, rather than the noise and excitement they evidence in their realizations.  If you are one of those people, then listen to this album.  This is music for musicians.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|First, I would like to ask what is up with all of the negative reviews here?  This album has to be Keane's finest since the days of Hopes and Fears and Under The Iron Sea.  If one truly is a diehard fan of Keane's original sound, such as I am, then one will clearly see that Strangeland is where the band has gone back to the very same basics that made them famous in the first place.  Just about every song contains the deep, melancholy, piano driven tunes that echo quite nicely Hopes and Fears. The stand out tracks for me are just about all of the songs, save for Watch How You Go, which sounds just a bit too Beatleesque for my blood.  My personal, all time favorite off this album, though, is Silenced By The Night, which is destined to become the next Somewhere Only We Know. It's a song that offers that Keane sonic excellence that we have come to love over the years.  I think the Brit reviewers are getting the clue about this album, because if you go to Amazon.UK, you will see that this album has a very high rating, unlike here on US Amazon.  (Guess Brits on average must be a lot less tone deaf than us Yanks!)<br /><br />So, please, fellow TRUE Keane fans.  Don't listen to the negative reviews on this one.  Strangeland is destined to fall in the same category as H&F and UTIS, and is definitely light-years better than the horrifying Night Train EP and the just above average Perfect Symmetry.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a very addictive game. I cant believe its free. and you can play without having to buy acorn's . unlike some games you have to spend real money on.
B007DJUO8O|2.0|I am a huge fan of Steven Wilson.  I am also a huge fan of Opeth.  Wilson and Akerfeldt have been talking about a collaboration for years, and I've loved most of the material Wilson has released lately (\\"Grace For Drowning\\" and \\"Insurgentes\\" are both superb).  When Wilson described Storm Corrosion as part of a musical triangle, along with \\"Drowning\\" and \\"Heritage,\\" I was certainly intrigued (although \\"Heritage\\" didn't blow me away, I still enjoyed it).  Intrigued enough that I pre-ordered the $50 deluxe edition without having heard a single note.<br /><br />A couple weeks ago, they released the video for the opening track, \\"Drag Ropes.\\"  It would be an understatement to say it was not what I was expecting.  It is very mellow, and it seems to drag...but it has some nicely layered vocals.  On its own, it's not a terrible track, but it's not as good as anything on \\"Grace For Drowning.\\"<br /><br />Even a seemingly weak preview track didn't wreck my expectations.  Over the last few years, I've been listening to a lot more acoustic/folk music than progressive metal.  Perhaps a mellow record with interesting musical passages and nice melodies would be a truly unique and treasured contribution to the catalogs of two of the most interesting musicians in the world.<br /><br />This record, unfortunately, contains few interesting musical passages; it favors soundscapes over rhythms.  \\"Lock Howl\\" is the only track that actually provokes any thought.  Melodies are few and far between.  Storm Corrosion is, in effect, very expensive background music.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll find a few things to appreciate about this.  It is, after all, Wilson and Akerfeldt.  When I get a chance to play the 5.1 version on my stereo, I'm sure it will live up to the usual Steven Wilson level of aural magnificence.  If this were any other artist, however, it's hard to deny that I would've shut it off half way through.  This is the first time I've found anything from these two musicians to be a chore to listen to; and considering the \\"musical triangle\\" argument they made, this has to be the most disappointed I've ever been with a new record.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't even finish the first book. I've read far better romance novels. I didn't think the writing was that great and the  \\"Oh My's\\" drove me crazy. I like good romance and steamy scenes, but this does not fall into that category. I would not recommend this.
B003L77GRY|1.0|If you want a good series that involves a seriel killer/psychopath as the main character check out Death Note. It has a very unique storyline that deals with both Japanese mythology, crime drama. Also that show has something this show is really missing and that is a foil 2 the main character. In the Death Note Series it is a character that goes by the nick name of L, an easy going, ecentric, but extremely intellegent detective that tracks the moves of the main character seriel killer Light/Kira. That is what this series needs a very witty and clever detective who will target and eventually catch Dex when it is all said and done with. But anyways this series doesn't offer anything really, and this season was just as pointless as the others.
B002MG2RG0|5.0|What a truely great old horror movie. We can see here why Bela Legosi was the revered actor of his time. The way he used his face, hands and movements was unlike anything I have ever seen.<br /><br />Even though this was made way back in 1931, don't let that stop you from seeing this. It still sets a standard that most more modern movies can't live up to.<br /><br />Wonderful sets in an old castle which apparently the spiders have taken over, along with an insane asylum and an old abbey, again draped liberally with spider webs, and the biggest winding stairway I have ever seen, give this a horror even without the Count. Every night the fog rolls in.<br /><br />Count Dracula had an amazing power to control people with only his gaze and his claw like hands. And once he could bite them it was all over for them.<br />Men and women alike became his slaves, and developed a sudden craving for blood.<br /><br />I've seen many much newer horror movies that didn't creep me out like this did. It's almost like I fell under Count Dracula's spell myself just watching this. Once you see the face of Bela Legosi, putting the evil eye on you, you can see how his victims became powerless in his presence.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the adds come up to much but its still a good game ... you should try it. just click close when they come up.
B00003CXAW|5.0|In my opinion  this the greatest movie ever made. When i first saw it i was spellbound. It has a great story,great special effects. One of the first movies to have a soundtrack and it,s done by the great Max Steiner. Storytellig at it,s best. A larger than life fantasy adventure that takes you to a world of awe and wonder. There has been remakes of this film but nothing is like the original although Peter Jackson,s 2005 version comes close. My favorie movie of all time.

0345803485|1.0|Ok, the only reason I can consider this to be \\"good erotica' is for the housewives of america.  This is baby erotica, sorry but it is.  If you want to enter the genre try a true erotica artist not EL James. I can see how Stephanie Meyers \\"Twilight\\" saga influenced this. I mean guess what that series wasn't that well written either.<br />If you want to read some good erotica, read anything by Laurell K Hamilton.  Her Merry Gentry series is addicting, beautfiul with action.  Now if you prefer vampires & lycanthropes goto her Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series.  Guess what this has what made Twilight popular but actually is well written. to boot.

I know SLAMMED wasn't written just for me, but you did a damn good job making me feel as if this book came along at just the right moment in my life to be an eye opener and make me appreciate so many things. Thank you.<br /><br />Okay, now that part is over. Hoover's debut is amazing. It was surprise after surprise. Emotions ran rampant. One of my favorite parts were the lyrics from songs of a band that Hoover obviously loves. From the lyrics alone, I'm now a fan.<br /><br />Hoover swept me away with her debut. My mother kept trying to distract me because I was so invested in this book. She's evil, ain't she? Anyway, it only took me a few hours to read this book and I think every single one of you reading this should buy it and read it.<br /><br />Addict's Last Words: Slammed revived me of my reading funk.

It was neat to see the thought process of some of the character, creature, levels that were designed. Seeing Straga as a almost elemental creature rather then a giant skull monster thing dude was really cool.<br /><br />Currently I am creating a game and I try to find all types of inspiration and ideas and this book has so much content within its pages that fans of Joe, Darksiders or art would enjoy this book.

0375842209|5.0|I just completed \\"The Book Thief\\" and I never take the time to review books, but this book was incredible.  It was a book that I thought about during the day and even told my friends about.  I thought it was so creative and beautifully written.  I loved the relationships in the book - subtle and real.  The love and joy in the midst of such tragedy is what the human spirit is all about.  It is rare to read about a pure and deep love between a father and a daughter.  I loved how much Hans loved Liesel and vice versa.  It was magical.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the human spirit and the strength of people of all ages.

0307742997|3.0|I don't read a tremendous amount of suspense/thriller fiction because I find the violent imagery lingers longer than I'd prefer. It doesn't help at all that I'd have to go all the way back to books from the 1980's to avoid the ubiquitous focus on torture and/or child sexual abuse. Subsequently, in the recent past I've only read about 1 or 2 thrillers a year and would not consider myself well read in the genre. That said, I find Jo Nesbo's writing to be on par with that of Jeffrey Deaver and Chelsea Cain. Competent, readable, and fairly engaging. However, there is something very wrong when someone like me who does not read much in the genre is able to pick out the killer before the author dangles out the first suspect. Instead of mounting suspense, I read with mounting resignation that the author was not more clever.

Her book helps one make the psychological leap from exiting corporate America (or wherever you may be) and The $100 Start Up provides solid, nuts and bolts advice and step-by-step information on how to build and launch a business. Even if you don't have a day job to quit (which was my situation) it is still a must-read.<br /><br />I have lots of friends that are thinking about starting businesses and 'doing something on the internet'. While it is true that it has never been easier, you still need a starting point and guide to point out the realities, pitfalls and opportunities along the way - especially if you are a right-brained, creative type. This book is that guide.

When this issue is fixed, my review will shoot up to five stars. It is really frustrating when I work hard on a pic though, and lose all my work due to a freeze.

Actually I was quite surprised with some of the artists he worked with as I am not a fan. Talk about being surprised with Lady Gaga and Amy Winehouse. This CD hasn't made its way out of my car since I bought it. ENJOY!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I read the first book, the hunger games, over 2 days and then went to see the film. I'm glad I did it this way round or I may have not understood the film. I then read the book again plus the other 2 in the trilogy. Went to see the film again and really loved it. I saw things I did not see last time. Now my mind is blurred with the book and the film, and that's a nice cozy feeling. I also looked up the actors before seeing the film so I did not get any shocks in what they looked like. That was good for me. The book is amazing. I am 50 years old and I could not put it down.  I brought this as a e version from amazon. Great service.
