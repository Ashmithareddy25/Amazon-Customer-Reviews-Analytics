B00A81MV3U|5.0|I loved the book!  The movie was great too, but not even close to the book!  IF you loved the book, you'll love the movie.  I did!
0689815816|2.0|Every night I read this to my 2.5 year old he ended up having nightmares. He kept talking about the scary bear at the end of the story. I think it is a classic/cute story but maybe for an older child.
B004UID2LC|1.0|While this app worked well for itself. It is malicious in that it will change your settings and try to change some of your information as well some of the password protected apps such as my Netflix and Office docs. Beware!!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It's Season 2 repackaged.  I was disappointed. If you're going to call it season 3, it shouldn't contain the same shows.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It was a little slow moving but the story line was well done. It kept you wondering and the end wasn't what you would expect.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I love all Amazon apps but this is my favorite for creating custom play lists depending on who in the family is listening.
0316023744|3.0|I've been reading and studying WWII history for some time and enjoy reading Antony Beevor's books. He is very knowledgeable, informative, writes well and has a singular writing style which has never failed to pull me so deeply into one of his books I have often read far later into the night than I should have. Quite simply, he writes a good book.<br /><br />But I have an issue with this book. My current readings have been centered on the battle of Leyte Gulf, including, among other readings, \\"The Battle of Leyte Gulf\\" by Thomas J Cutler, \\"Last Stand of the Tin Can Sailors\\" by James D Hornfischer, and Anthony Tully's \\"The Battle of Surigao Strait\\", each one great in its' own respect. When I got this book about a week ago I was just finishing Mr. Tully's book and opened it up to this area to see if Beevor may have included any different maps concerning ships' positions that I hadn't seen in my other readings. He did include a general map of the battle area, on page 625, with the initial tracks of the 4 different Japanese battle groups which are labeled with their commanders, and this is where my concern arose.<br /><br />The map in this book correctly shows Ozawa positioned in the Philippine Sea, the track of Kurita through the Sibuyan Sea and out at San Benardino Strait then down the coast of Samar, as well as Nishimura's movement from the Sulu Sea and entering Surigao Strait. The movement of the fourth group, the \\"Fifth Fleet\\", which had sailed from Coron and was close behind and following Nishimura through the Mindanao Sea was also correctly shown, but its commander is labeled as Nagumo.<br /><br />The \\"Fifth Fleet\\" was commanded by Vice Admiral Tiyohide Shima. Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo had no involvement in this battle and was in fact dead by the time the Sho Ichi Go operation, the Japanese defense of the Philippine Islands, was initiated. Nagumo had been a co-commander of Japanese forces on the island of Saipan when it was invaded by American forces and committed suicide in July, almost 4 months earlier.<br /><br />I do not by any stretch of the imagination mean this to demean or criticize the overall works of Mr. Beevor; I clearly believe this error was not so much his fault but that of his editorial and proofreading staffs, but it is saddening that it occurred in one of his  many masterful works. I am sure I will enjoy this book as much as I have Mr. Beevor's others but it leaves me wondering if there might be other oversights in the book that could cause me to doubt something I thought I knew and have to resort to my reference materials for verification. It also causes me concern that somewhere along the line proofreading errors of a similar nature could cause confusion or give misinformation to someone whose initiation into WWII history is that book they are then reading.
0440246016|3.0|I had never heard of Jack Reacher until I saw the Tom Cruise movie. I enjoyed the movie so checked out two Reacher novels from the library. Being a US Navy spec ops vet I liked the Reacher character. I picked up two more novels today including the one I'm reviewing and got to page 12 when I read &#34;Reacher hated Alaska Airlines. They put scripture cards on his meal trays. Ruined his appetite.&#34;<br /><br />That, to me, is a gratuitous attack on religion and contrary to the feelings of most people I served with.<br /><br />I put down the book. Won't finish it. And won't get any more.<br /><br />Don't give a damn what anyone thinks either.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A very impressive piece of writing. I was introduced to this series by a book review in \\"The Washington Post\\" and was rewarded by the imaginative story and by the wonderful writing. I look forward to more delights to come.
B001GE6L0M|5.0|This is an amazing recording of David Gilmore and shows who the real Pink Floyd is. I would recommend this to all Pink Floyd fans and guitar icon lovers.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00957T6X6|5.0|After watching the game of Thrones tv series on hbo I became hooked. The red wedding shook me in a way that no tv show episode has ever done before and I decided I no longer wanted to be caught unawares so I purchased the five book package. GOT is very well written. The characters are compelling & I've had sleepless nights because I stayed up until dawn reading these books. I recommend them to any fantasy enthusiasts.

B003ASLJPY|3.0|Overall, the movie is superbly photographed and acted. The viewer feels like they're in the caves with the Japanese defenders of the island.  You feel the courage, the determination and towards the end, the despair of the Japanese soldiers from the lowest privates up to the commanding officers. The one very strange, upsetting event it when the two Japanese soldiers surrender and then murdered by the Americans assigned to guard them. What fool added this scene? It adds nothing to the story and turns the whole movie into a political statement of &#34;America/Western Culture is bad, Japanese/Eastern Bushido culture is misguided but more honorable than evil Americans.&#34;  That one peculiar scene utterly spoils what would be and outstanding movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was a big fan of the Firefly series, and was very unhappy when it ended. I live having the complete series available to watch any time I want. I must have for die-hard Firefly fans!
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Horror movies are like lasagna. They're easy to make but easy to screw up. This is near the top of the pile.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. High-finance dad has gone off the deep end and put bullets into his two business partners and his ex-wife. He's grabbed his two daughters and high-tailed it, at high speed, down an icy road. The car careens over a cliff. They survive, head for a nearby cabin, and as dad is ready to do the girls in someone intervenes and the girls are left on their own. Five years later the girls are found and put in the custody of their uncle Lucas and Annabel, his punk rock girlfriend. They try to bring the children back to normalcy but something is lurking in the background and putting a worm in the apple.<br /><br />I liked this movie a lot. It is shot and directed nearly as well as any movie I've ever seen. Director Andres Muscietti plays one scene with a split screen using a wall in the house as a divider. Watching both sides (one with the action in the foreground, the other with the action further back) is sensational. One of the best scenes anywhere, anytime. The story moves logically and the relationship between a reluctant Annabel and the sisters develops well. It's not a Disney type transition but one that turns out of what Annabel is inside. It feels good. The unraveling of the mystery surrounding mama is pretty good. Not great maybe, but better than I've seen in similar movies. Jessica Chastain is great as Annabel. Nikolaj Coster-Waldau in the Lucas/Jeffrey role is Okay. He just doesn't have that much to do. The girls are outstanding. The older Victoria is remembering her previous normal life while the younger Lily has spent more time with Mama than with her previous folks. The knowing glances between the two and their behavior will creep you out.<br /><br />The downside here is that Mama, and the way the girls move and behave, is too derivative of Japanese horror movies. And jump scares are considered cheap by today's horror standards. There are a couple of cheap ones here but a few others are really good because they are in tune with the way the characters are.<br /><br />This is one of the better horror movies to hit the streets as of late. I like producer Guillermo Del Toro's sensibilities and he must have liked the director's shorter version of this because he put up the bucks to make it feature length. For my dollar, the investment paid off. If you're a fan of the genre, have at it.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|The story is twisted as can be, but you'll be bored to tears before you ever get to that.  The first hour is just plain awful, then it finally starts to catch your attention.  I don't recommend this movie
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I was going to wait until I went through all the experiments, but I couldn't wait any longer! :-)<br /><br />Experiment 1 (The Dude Abides): I got a call from a friend I hadn't heard from in months. (Of course, I missed the call, but that's my problem. After all, she didn't have to call me.)<br /><br />Experiment 2 (Volkswagen Jetta): I changed it to green cars but kept the yellow butterflies. Most of the cars I see are either silver or black, but I found 5 green cars and 4 yellow butterflies - the first butterfly on one of my birthday cards! :-)<br /><br />Experiment 3 (Alby Einstein): This worked, too, to the point where it almost creeped me out. I mean, I turned my head to the left, toward a clock on the wall, and both hangers turned that way...<br /><br />Experiment 4 (Abracadabra): I was utterly specific here. I was having problems with getting a vendor paid a specific amount of money for an event from 2 months ago. I committed the exact dollar amount to memory, and 27-1/2 hours later, everything came together. YES! Major worry taken care of. :-)<br /><br />Experiment 5 (Dear Abby): This is where I'm currently at. God/the Universe has until tomorrow night to say Yes or No to what I asked (something personal). It's something I've been thinking about for months but haven't been able to do anything about. All I'll say is that though the time limit for this is tomorrow night, 6/28/13, I have another time limit within what I asked (\\"Should I _________________ in the next 2 weeks?\\")<br /><br />These have all been successful for me, so I really couldn't keep my excitement bottled up. I'm also following the ideas in [[ASIN:B008EED35I Happy Money (Increase the Flow of Money with a Simple 2-Step Formula)]], and trying to learn how to meditate (never been successful at that, despite really liking to do yoga), all in an attempt to make myself into a better, calmer person.<br /><br />But even if the answer to Experiment 5 isn't to my liking or doesn't work, I know that I can go back at some point and ask God/the Universe again. The idea, to me anyway, is to FOCUS on one thing at a time, instead of flipping from one thing to the next to the next.<br /><br />ETA (1/16/14) - I'm doing Experiment #4 again, this time with a 96 hour time limit (the book gives 48 hours; 96 hours makes more sense in my case). Again I'm being very specific, and it has to do with the task of getting a vendor's project okayed by sourcing & legal, to finalization with signatures. It would make my life less stressful, and no doubt the people on the other end will be relieved to stop receiving the emails they get from me ;-). Even though the one I originally did in June 2013 didn't work out *at that time* (very important IMHO to make that distinction), the others did work, so there's no reason not to use these again; after all, it's another period of time & a different thing I'm asking for. I'm looking forward to it working out!n go back at some point and ask God/the Universe again.

B001EBWIRW|5.0|One of my ultimate fave musicals. I've seen it a million times since I was a kid, and I haven't grown tired of it. It's now a sing-a-long for me. Love it!!!!!
B008OIQYTG|1.0|Very disappointed.  Too many vocals and not very upbeat.  Too bad feel like I wasted my money, not one of his bests.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love the Crossfire novels. Sylvia Day is amazing ! Can't wait to read the next in series  She writes I such a way that you just can't stop reading.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Fun and clever show. Always fun to watch what Lisbon and Patrick Jane is up to next. Sorta similar to Elementary.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love Actually is worth seeing - and seeing multiple times.  Bill Nighy is wonderful, as are the other actors.  The young boy is also fun to watch.  Though the premise would seem to be over-done, the way this movie brings people's paths together makes a happy story you'll love.
B0064W652A|4.0|Although not as as great as Killing Joke or Court of Owls, Loeb creates a mysterious and suspenseful story that's perfect for people new to Batman comics. Although more hardcore comic fans might get annoyed with the constant stream of characters, they can't deny how awesome it is to learn another piece to this puzzling plot. As for Lee, he has drawn some of the most beautiful characters and action scenes in comics to date. This really is a pretty novel. For more great artwork, read Justice League. For more great Batman stories, read Death of a Family.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for up to four players, and endlessly playable. I'd recommend getting the expansion pack (or making one of your friends buy it), because this game is kind of viral at the moment, and there will be times when six people are going to want to play.
B004K58GSO|4.0|I enjoyed John Wayne's character . A young James Caan  who is still acting today, liked him in Vegas and now he is going to take on a lighter role this Fall on television.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good movie. Watched it in the theater and then streamed it to my personal devices, then kept watching it on my tv at home.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day is by far a great writer! She has outdone herself... can't wait until the next one comes out!
B009DH379C|5.0|I won't ever get tired of Queen concerts. Great picture (1080/24p), DTS HD sound, highly recommended for fans and casuals.
0802473156|5.0|Great book! I would recommend this book to everyone.  My husband and I both read it and it has helped put a whole new procpective on out relationship!
B001EC3JME|5.0|fits my streamlight strion nicely.  only 1 hand to remove and replace light.  did take a little time for it to stretch out for a perfect fit though, like a week.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|this game is awesome. you get to wash her hair, clean her face,  and get her dressed . I recommend this game for every girly-girl in the world.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Have been looking for this DVD for my residents in the nursing home I work in. They really love this movie. It's always moving and has lost of music in it as well
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is so much fun! I figured out all ten levels on my own and can't wait for more! If you like 100 Floors, you'll LOVE this!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|±DOWNTON ABBEY IS A GREAT SHOW.  THE CHARACTERS ARE SO FUN TO FOLLOW. YOU REALLY GET INVOLVED IN THEIR LIVES.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|If I had paid to see this in a movie theater I would have been seriously annoyed.  Talk about self-indulgent drivel.
B003XE3G0Q|3.0|I think these shoes will be great for my time in the Philippines, where it will often be very wet.  I like them, but one of the rivets on the strap was protruding a little, rubbing against my instep, until I tightened it up with pliers.  (No time to return them.)
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Great acting combined with a strong story line...the Master of Suspense himself would have been proud of this movie.  loved it!
1439190275|5.0|Lots of studies on this diet plus anti-inflammatory assurances. Very impressed with quick weight loss. Feel better with this way of life. Eye opener.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book and I can't wait until the next two. Different from the first two, but still an amazing book :)
B0063IH60K|2.0|The game is easy to play. I like the feature that allows you to choose what kind of deal you want (random, winnable, etc.)  I hate that with each new game, immediately after the deal an ad pops up that won't go away unless I exit the game and then reopen it.  As far as I'm concerned, not worth the effort.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Shame on you Ms. Day--I expected all loose ends to be tied up and a happy ending for Gideon and Eva, and now I can wait another 6-8 months for a 4th book. Kudos to the publishers of 50 Shades as they definitely got it right by releasing all 3 books at the same time.  Please finish the series with #4.
B00CEIGYAG|3.0|I only got this because I pre-ordered the CD from Amazon and they gave me a $1 credit toward an MP3 purchase.  I decided to pay the extra 29 cents out of pocket because I needed this song in my life to be on repeat 50 times in a row.  Now that the album has released, just buy it.  Even if you hate every other song on there, just buy the single track.  I don't care, just don't get the radio edit because you're missing 2 minutes of the song!
B00CATSONE|5.0|It is interesting how much information is contained in this book. It's interesting how the industrial world and the world governments did not take him seriously, in fact seemed to campaign against Tesla. One can easily see how the US Government many years after seizing his work upon his death put his discoveries to work decades later in the HAARP project in Alaska. In my opinion the author in a brief time expanded my knowledge of the most important researchers of all time, earning praise from no less than Albert Einstien.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Really enjoyed this series.  Can't wait for the next one to see where this relationship goes and what the future has in story for them.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed the book but not as much as the first 2.  It was for me what it was meant for and was the fire I needed.  However all the games the two of them played got a little annoying at times.  Can't wait for the 4th!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|great app, presented very professionally. you may judge for yourself or take everyone's comments as a true reflection of one's own truth.
B005OKTPKC|3.0|I enjoyed this legal thriller with it's weird characters, an off-beat crammy law firm and a burnt-out corporate protoganist who joins them because he had no choice! The plot develops around a suprising class-action, and grew as steadily as the claimants grew and various aspects of the legal environment are pulled in from employment for immigrants to arguing without experience in the Federal Court. If you need a few good laughs and lots of fun with the illogical logic of the legal world, unethical 2nd class lawyers as well as unethical corporate lawyers and their larney firms, you will definitely enjoy this roller-coaster legal fiction.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|A fun book, with no real story line.  Read it because it was part of a series.  Would not recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game challenging enough to keep you entertained but easy enough not to get you frustrated. Cannot wait until more levels are available.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This story is truly powerful and beautiful, but be ready to lose nights of sleep (actually, not that many nights, as you can't stop reading, and you will quickly reach the last pages) and shed many, many tears.  Jojo's books are wonderful!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv! I can't believe it took me this long to find it. The acting is great love the setting a must watch series.
B0036UO56G|5.0|This is a classic movie from the 70's that you'll enjoy watching over and over again. And over and over again!
B001K3ENEA|5.0|These are the best fitting headphones I've owned.  I am a mobile DJ and use these to pre cue upcoming songs.  They seal nicely around my ears so I don't have to crank the volume to hear the music I'm cuing.
B003Y6EL5W|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect here but this movie is original and hilarious!! I thought it was a kids movie but I was wrong.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Great quality and easily could be given as a gift! What can I say? Green Lantern is a terrific movie choice!
0061950726|5.0|I could not put this book down once I got reading it. I love how it follows the 2 lives throughout the book. The fact that it has historical basis to it makes it an even more interesting read. I am a huge bookworm and this book left me wanting to read more of her work. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a new good read. The author made the story come to life and I felt like I was a part of the characters lives.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Really captures the tension of the time. Only drawback was ginning it up when it really wasn't necessary (vehicles on the runway). John Goodman and Alan Arkin nearly steal this movie.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I always like legal thrillers, and this one had such a twist that I was even more enthralled than usual!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I have never seen any of the previous movies not read any of the books, so I did like this and found it entertaining and made me laugh out loud several times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app. It provides an awesome way to play minecraft where ever you are. If you are thinking about getting this app defiantly get it.
1463707606|4.0|Some of these pieces turn out to be surprisingly large and not easily reduced due to math format, and author assumptions.<br />Like many experts it is difficult getting from A to J sometimes.  Interval steps occasionally go unaddressed in my opinion.<br />This book could use higher color differentiation and information about size of completed pieces.  I absolutely would buy it again because it is fun, and recommend it.  If I were a better folder, I perhaps would find this perfectly lucid.  Any fan of modular would appreciate this.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoying this series immensley. Keeping up with all the family and staff is sometimes challenging but always intriguing. Oh how the times must have been in England.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Fast delivery,DVD was as stated, my toddler loves the movie. it was money well spendt. we wacth it almost every day!!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was a &#34;soap opera&#34; book.  Certainly not as good as the first two books in this series.  Hopefully the next in the series will be better and similar to the first two.
B00371V91S|5.0|Seth challenges the normal boring thinking and makes you push it and get out and break the rules, start your own thing and live the life you were designed to live
B001I45UFC|5.0|This book was so amazing! The Chronicles of Narnia series joker my favorite series of all time and it was written so well. My favorite character would have to be Aslan; the lion. Of course. I loved how much the characters changed from beginning to end. They went from being scared to heroes that helped to restore peace to Narnia. The book was  even better than the movie! I highly recommend this book and the entire series to anyone who is looking for a good fantasy novel. (Even though it was written in the 1930's it is still so awesome!) The movies also are so true to the book and represent the books in a great way too.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is just like the tv show but better, and its creepy and plays with your emotions. Awesome story
B0001LJC2K|4.0|This is my first CD from Muse.  Very solid - concur with many of the other positive reviews.  Looking forward to buying another one of their CD's.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This one has lots of sentimental value for me... Not only did I see the Broadway Play but also the movie several times and have visited the Inn in the Vermont Mountains.
B00A4W3AJC|1.0|I rented this movie on Blu-Ray from Netflix. The menu looks like the trailer for the movie, but never gives me the option of playing the film. And it just repeats again and again. I can't figure it out. I tried all the buttons and nothing worked, and I couldn't find any answers online. Does anyone know the problem? I can't watch it on Blu-Ray when it is like this.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Have watched most episodes to date and really have enjoyed the entertainment as well as the education value to learn more about British culture during this time period.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I don't listen to much of Daft Punk but this one is really catchy. Any pop lover will enjoy this all summer long. Pharrell is awesome.
B008VBYN80|4.0|From experience from other games I find it unneeded to put in the energy sector, which makes gameplay shorter, and I think the collection of resources should be easier.
0783219598|4.0|I like this movie, I haven't really gotten a chance to see it all the way through yet, but from what I have seen, I like it a whole lot.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game gives me incentive to play find myself looking forward to collecting my coins hearts and acorns only wish I could find more friends to play with
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|From reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to watch this movie but I decided to give it a try because I like Jermey Renner as an actor. I was actually pleasantly suprised when I found myself being drawn into the plot. Pros.... There are a couple of really funny one-liners  worked into the movie that I really enjoyed, special effects are very believable and not fake looking. Cons... some of the action scenes are a bit drawn out and I think they could have done more to set up the storyline in the beginning of the movie. There was a bit more gore than I was expecting, but for the most part it fits with the movie and it is, after all, classifed as a horror movie.
B00AQ70O1M|5.0|The original American theatrical trailer for Sergio Leone's classic THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY (Italy/Spain/W Germany-1966) has Eli Wallach as the Bad and Lee Van Cleef the Ugly, while the film reverses these. Practically all three leads are interchangeable, as Clint Eastwood's character, mysteriously nicknamed \\"Blondie,\\" is certainly a bad guy, plus after his desert ordeal, he's quite ugly (for a while).<br /><br />A bit overlong at 162 minutes, yet there would be little fat to trim here (perhaps the bridge sequence?) if cuts had to be made.<br /><br />Saw this in first run a very long time ago. With the advent of home video in the '80s I've been able to reexperience it umpteen times since. During the most recent viewing, I looked beyond familiar characters, plot and dialogue and studied other details, such as camera panning during Eli Wallach's worried search for a gravemarker while Ennio Morricone's magnificent \\"Ecstasy of Gold\\" plays, also Leone's timing of facial closeups and quick edits during the climactic three-way cemetery showdown. That all these guys are grimy, sweaty, unwashed and unshaven is certainly accurate for an age and place where fresh laundry and bathtubs could be few and far between.<br /><br />Although filmed in Spain, backgrounds suit the American West nicely. How much of the Civil War was fought in this country's more arid places is a legitimate question.<br /><br />Morricone's main theme is heard throughout, always in variation. As a very amateur musician and singer who favors harmony, bassline structure and counterpoint to melody, an almost-syncopated downscale string countermelody in this piece, especially as Eastwood gallops off at the end, is a real attention grabber. It's an inspired bit of orchestration, at least for me.<br /><br />Few movies stand up to the scrutiny of repeated viewings as well as this one, and not many American westerns have ever been as good. Bad and/or ugly, maybe.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. The puzzles really make you think and you feel really awesome about yourself when you can an figure out how to open the door. It's a good game for when you want to challenge yourself. The levels get really challenging but that just means you're better than you thought you were.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|it has a few bugs but it ok facebook on the kindle it is quite convinient i use it everyday i  love the features of the new facebook
B00847KFDS|2.0|I was thrilled to find out about this new release. I am a huge Creedence fan and was excited to hear this album.<br /><br />I was very disappointed. The originals are much better and this cd was re-gifted after two listens.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I cannot believe they had this in theaters.<br /><br />Great love story and you will not feel there is never a dull moment.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|While not super challenging,this is one of those games that you will pick up and say..&quot;I'll just play a level or two&quot;..meanwhile an hour or so later you realize how time has flown while you are having a jiggly good time!<br />Highly reccomend for kids of all ages<br /><br />The only issues I have had with it are:<br />It is occasionally finicky when it starts up (that could just be my equipment)<br /><br />I had a hard time putting it down!
B0042FZOFU|4.0|We wanted a great set of movies to keep in the Kid Cave (where our three grandsons stay when they visit.)  All three of these are appropriate for our little ones and the price was right.
1426209584|5.0|Had seen Tim Laman in person and knew the book would be a perfect gift for my sister.  She loves it!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|After months of waiting for the  final book in the  Crossover series, I was grateful when it finally downloaded to my Kindle.  Turns out, the book was slow moving, lacked excitement and a conclusion.  The trilogy I  no longer a trilogy.  Apparently the  author has decided to keep things going.  In this  book, Day leaves too many little things unfinished, probably just to continue to another  book about very little.  I like the characters in this  book but was ready to  it to come  to a close.  I'm not sure  if I will purchase the  next one.  Not the best in the series.
1932100660|4.0|Didn't really know how things worked in the food industry, and was surprised by some of this information. Good purchase!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A lot more fun then expected for a free game, pretty challenging at times which was unexpected which was really nice
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Found it bit simplistic and a thin plot. A beach side read while watching the children play in the shallows.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I had seen Michael on TV a few times and liked him. I bought this CD not knowing what to expect. It's not Michael it's I just didn't find a song that I would want to hear again. Must be my taste in music. Gave it to a friend who really likes it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This app only had ten levels.  I completed the first three levels in about ten minutes.  There is only about three things you need to find and four or five areas to search.  I felt the game was to simple, but then again it was free.  It would have been nice to have a short tutorial on how to search, pick things up, and use them.  I only did the first three levels it was to easy and boring for me so I deleted it.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Along with \\"Before Sunrise\\" this film is of the most intelligent, organic, and realistic of the genre. Long walking shots through the streets of Paris with what feels like a natural conversation between two people in love. Highly recommended.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|But it was not as enthralling as the first 2 of his historical novels, which I loved and rank as two of the best books I have read (Pillars of the Earth; World without End).  This one did certainly keep me interested in each of the main characters, but it was not quite the same.  Perhaps it was because it was set in World War 1, so much closer to our time.  I don't want to take too much away from it, as I do recommend it as another of Follett's very good books.  I don't think many books can match those first 2 of his that I read.
B0009P66TK|5.0|Good size watch/clock!  Like that it's bigger so definitely need to match the individual wearing it...no mistaking its manliness.  Really like it over my other smaller faced watches.
B00CFNUMD0|5.0|As soon as my almost 2 yr old daughter sees my iPad, she yells BAAAAAAAAAA.  She loves Shaun the sheep and it's fun for us adults to watch as well.  I'm hoping new seasons will follow!!
B004GYY714|4.0|I have enjoyed the flexibility of having music choices with me all the time through my phone.  Can't always access it though.
B0095VP8D4|1.0|Up Date Dec 2013: This item failed in Feb or March of this year. After many RMA's sent to AMD. I still have not heard a word except the usual email saying we'll be in touch, but no RMA yet.<br />I will never buy an AMD product again. They will not stand behind their warranty. I mean the processor just quit working and no response from them in over 8 months. Sorry way to do business. I own and run a computer sales and service and have used their products many times but no more. I cannot recommend this processor, but only because of terrible customer service.<br /><br />BM
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|the controlls are too hard and the crafting takes a while to get use to but still a fun game like minecraft
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book definitely has you wanting more.  Not as good as the second but keeps me anxiously awaiting the fourth installment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It is really good and exiting and sexy all the way to the end, I have already bought the third one of the trilogy and looking forward for the movie. Even better I downloaded on my kindle fire HD and also have the option to download the app on my phone so can continue reading on my lunch break :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Enjoy this game when I'm waiting around for something just wish items weren't so expensive but still a fun little game overall with great graphics. Keep up the good work
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is pretty awesome. If you don't like coffee and you can't wake. Then play this game. Most likely. With a friend. And if you really want to wake then play on hard. I haven't beat hard yet. =(  =]
B008ODZNLG|4.0|This was a very excellent, quiet movie. Unless you speak Japanese, you have to read the subtitles. It was an hour and a half of focusing on this man and his art using sushi as his medium. And not worrying about my phone
B003QSLDTA|4.0|Good actors, not over the top.Everything came full circle in this movie. I really enjoyed it. Not bad at all.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|Watch them on youtube and then get the DVD. These guys are great to watch live too if you get the chance.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I enjoy this collection very much. It's an amazing record of the London concert. Cohen is the best!!! Songs in it are in nice quality
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I liked the leopard better, but this book is also very good. It was an interesting read to understand the Harry Hole character better.
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This is a great movie depicting the last hours of Christs life.  I highly recommend it to any and everyone.
0062082353|5.0|Great book about a true American Hero!! You can not go wrong buying this book. Also, the book was shipped and delivered in great condition and on time! Thank you.
0545265355|5.0|Let the games begin. I believe the choice of words are a remarkable tribute. I listened to the story as the words flowed right along. I like the Harry Potter storyline better. But this book has such a better writing style. Thank you Suzanne for toping Harry Potter!!! It was invigorating experience to read your choice of word$.
B003WKOU0G|4.0|Bought this for a college course. I really like the process of being able to buy it online, watch it online. But it gave me 30 days to start watching it then a full 24 hours to complete it. Great for the bust person.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome you can do everything on it, you can explore create etc. It was worth the 7 dollars. This is truly the best game in the universe
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome<br />U change places like Rome Miami and Paris<br />How it is free and awesome<br />everyone should by it this just my opinon<br />Ummmmmmmmm ya
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is very fun,but I have one con... the game takes literally forever just to get one quest done without real cash... overall, all you bronies get this app asap!!!!!!!
B000T06172|1.0|The Beach Boys were my era but most of these songs I never heard and most of those are no good. These must be some of the Beach boy archived music or released songs that flopped. I am a fan but hated this album so much that I deleted it as soon as I listened to all of the songs.
B008XG1X18|5.0|really good great crafts for me I like it I would get it any day download now don't wait....... go
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Using this on an AMD 1100T, dropped my temps 8-10 degrees Celsius at idle from the stock cooler, I have been able to achieve an overclock of 4.0ghz from stock 3.3ghz.<br /><br />One thing of note, the Amazon photo for this product shows 2 fans on the cooler, but it only comes with 1 fan.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This product is awesome. I would recommend  battery pro to everyone. After you get this product you will love it too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Masterful continuation of Eva and Gideon's story.  The evolution of their relationship is told brilliantly and you still get updates on the other characters.  Looking forward to the next book already.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hey u like to race this is for u<br />The only problem is that the game is cool<br />So know that u hear this review u should get<br />Da it is free
B009P13RQY|5.0|Just saw them open for Clutch, blown away!  Modern day early Black Sabbath, simply amazing.  This album does them justice, ROCKS!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a wonderful book. So interesting to be told through the eyes of a dog.  A must read for any age.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I can watch my favorite music or tv that I can not get anywhere else. It is pretty cool. I love watching my favorite music.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Love this game. Great way to pass the time. Been playing it regularly for about 2 weeks without any glitches.
B000SXJMRQ|5.0|One of the best albums I believe Korn has came out with even though they have several albums in cirulation I will buy more for the price is good for what you want to buy
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging enough to make your mind work but not too difficult that I couldn't figure it out...can't wait for more levels.
B00DBSZ6ZC|4.0|Overall a fun, campy with very gory scenes not recommended for 17 and under. Hansel and Gretel Witch Hunters is a movie is based on great computer imagery and special effects. Again Gemma Arterton is a true looker,
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Fast delivery! Great quality of the DVD! This was my birthday present to myself. Love the movie, now I can play it over and over now.
1781162646|5.0|And he thought he heard the echo of a penny whistle band<br />And the laughter from a distant caravan<br />And the brightly painted line of circus wagons in the sand<br />Fading through the door into summer<br />- \\"The Door into Summer\\", The Monkees<br /><br />As I hit the midpoint of the Joyland, Stephen King's latest novel, I began to fret that I missed the plot. Based on the gorgeous Glen Orbik cover and flavor text, I anticipated a ghastly killer fun-house or a crazed madman ripping through teens like cotton candy. What I didn't expect was the most profound reminiscence of youth and growing up since King's The Body (later titled Stand By Me).<br /><br />For 135 pages, we watch Devon Jones learn the ropes of the carnival circuit, reel in the wind after the loss of his first love, and leave youth for adulthood. And to be honest, I stopped caring if a crime story ever developed. Certainly under all of the character building a lone ghost haunts the House of Horror crying out in the darkness, but that's just an apparition. The flesh and bones of the novel are built around friendship and the unparalleled value of life.<br /><br />As the second part of the novel picks up speed, there is a touching moment when Devon mispronounces one of the victim's names and is immediately told that these were living souls and that they deserve the respect of their names said correctly. It's a sublte statement, but in a society were we race to shove news down the throats of anyone who'll listen and sell violence on 15 minute prerecorded loops, we forget about humanity. We forget that victims had lives with their own history and their own stories and their own voice. In today's timeless news loops we silence the victims and reduce them to caricatures and carnage. King's Joyland seeks to remind us about their humanity and the stories we carry.<br /><br />Stephen King has not written this summer's best selling thriller. He has written this year's finest work of fiction.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|great story line; great acting! it is a rare movie gem. I read the book and this movie has rendered its story and characters extremely well.
1400034779|5.0|I have read all of the books in the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series from my library.  Now I am purchasing some to pass on to my friends.  They have excellent morals and life lessons besides being entertaining.  Very good reads.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A profound read that grabs you with every word and tear. Everyone can see their life, their family in this book.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The only bad thing i could say about this book is that i don't know when the next one is coming out. I'm addicted.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm in love with this book! Howey keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole book, wondering what's going to happen next. I can't wait to find out the future for silo 17 and how silo 18 handles the truth! Thank you Hugh Howey for such a great read.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game but somewhat glitchy at times.  A room with rotating patterns would be fun. Don't like the new change in the powerplays.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I realized that there are some who feel this superhero stuff has been overdone, but I can't get enough. It is so hard to find movies that are suitable, and entertaining for the whole family. I love it, and have watched it several times.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this series after hearing great comments about it on TV.  I did marathon viewings so that I am now caught up through Season 3.  I have thoroughy enjoyed getting to know the characters and getting a glimpse of life in the early 1900's in a British aristocrat's home.  Can't wait for season 4.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Didn't hold my attention like the othe books did. Also did not like the ending, it just left you hanging.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|It's first photo backpack and I was leary of the $100-plus models from other brands. This one meets my needs,
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was very happy with this book, can't wait for the next one now!!! I love the Crossfire series, and was happily surprised to see that it won't be a trilogy anymore !  4th book won't come out soon enough for me, I love Gideon and Ava !
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is so good and so fun! It is a great addition to the cut the rope family and can be labeled as the best cut the rope game out there (other than cut the rope original).
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|I love this movie because it succeeds in being very scary without guns and blood; just a creepy old house, ghostly figures and dark moody weather.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I loved this app. until a new update. now they have the title of the video while playing it and if it has lyrics on the top then your out of luck trying to read them. please change it back.
B001FA0NZ6|4.0|Bobbi Brown makeup is incredible and I've always admired Bobbi brown so reading her book just gives an insight into her makeup style. This was a great book. I still love her and the makeup! Great tips from this book.
B005LAII80|5.0|This is an excellent action flick that has everything you could want: killer effects (especially with the slomo sequences), a fitting sci/industrial rock soundtrack, and a great cast--Karl Urban is PERFECT as Judge Dredd. I mean, he never even takes off his helmet. That's unheard of these days for a leading man to do. It's just one of the ways that this unique comic book adaptation is truly unique. It deserves a sequel!
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Having read the original book and was delighted with the 1939 movie version (My Standard); this version, while full of wonderful effects, did not come up to my expectation with a new telling of the story.  I was looking at buying it on BlueRay but when I saw this offering on Amazon for rent at a 5th of the cost I dove right in.  Sorry to say I won't be buying a copy for my collection to watch every couple of years.  One viewing was enough to make that clear.  If you buy movies just for the effects then go ahead.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Acting is superb and the story is engaging and exciting.  The best television since The Wire and Madmen, although very different subject matter. I usually do not like this type of imaginary adventure drama. However, this drama is brilliant. Loved each  season and look forward to the next.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I enjoyed the authors writing style but the story took a weird turn for me at the end. I would recommend as a good read.
B005FPT51K|3.0|I don't know if it was completely worth the money but its definitely better than most of the monitors out there. However, I got it for my son who is 2 and around the camera are red lights for the infrared so you can see in the dark. And he was is so scared of it we hardly use it..
B000HL093A|5.0|If you read the script and the movie, the script is better. But, as a movie, it's an awesome commentary on how the media glorifies violence and makes heroes out of villians to sell chips and beer during the commercial breaks. The indian scene should have been removed and the trial included. Get the bonus footage for Ashley Judd's scene.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Outstanding series. Great entertainment...hard to find these days. Watching it, I feel like I'm right there and experiencing all of the emotion of it.  And I love the dry humor.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Loved it, can't wait to read the rest!  This book has Great characters and amazing settings.  Erikson is a master story teller!
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Had not seen this movie in years and bought to add to collection. Great movie with a good cast of characters.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My grandchildren are 4 and 6. They both play this game and love it. My 15 year old likes to play it too. They think it is great that they can earn points and buy things to upgrade their car.
0470876417|5.0|This book is awesome, a must read for every entrepreneur. I really enjoyed it and still re-reading it sometimes. The team did amazing job explaining complex things in such a simple way. Thank you!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The lower levels of the game are good preparation for the more challenging ones.  Lots of levels.  A very addictive game. Fun but makes you think logically.
0671510991|5.0|Great book. I wanted to read it for years! Enjoying every page of it. I'm glad my book is signed by Henry Kissinger :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|You will not be disappointed because this is a delightful well-produced series. The program offers a talented cast who deliver the writers' words with believability as you get transported to British life 100 years +/- ago.  Enjoy!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This movie was very good very entertaining you will feel every emotion that the characters are feeling and you will find yourself watching it over and over again.

B00DHRLK84|2.0|I was disappointed with the whole reshot WHO event and ending.<br />Hopefully, they will release this blu-ray with the Alternate scenes they shot in Russia and Pitts characters family trying to survive in the refugeee camp...Otherwise I wont' buy it. This is a Zombie movie, not a cartoon ,and their should be some similarity to the very successful Book, not too much to ask?. Too boring, ridiculous to inject themselves with deadly disease to fool the zombies, and the ending was blah....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game for horse lovers. Wonderful graphics and realistic sounds. My teenage daughter and I love to play this game.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I have to admit I had not heard of Lindsey Stirling until I came across a video of her performing with the acapella group Pentatonix. Being a lover of violin music (classical, Celtic, even bluegrass} I decided to check her music out more thoroughly. I am very glad I did! Her album is filled with skillful playing, beautiful melodies, and playful creativity. Ms Sterling is a gifted musician, and her arrangements cover the range from traditional to club music. I put her up with Vanessa May and, my personal favorite, Rosie Shipley. I am really enjoying this purchase!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the subject line says it all!! I had a great time using this app. only wish there were more levels!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|That was my thought on the first day of doing Workout 1. Day 3, I'm thinking, \\"okay, this might be a good thing.\\" Day 5: I'm really liking this. Day 7: I can't wait to get home and work out. I am getting results very quickly, which is always motivating.<br /><br />Jillian talks you through those moments when you just want to say, \\"this is too hard; I give up.\\" Don't give up. Do what you can and build up more each time. The key is consistency.<br /><br />One thing I wish she would do, though, is give us a little longer cooldown at the end of Workout 1. Haven't seen the other two workouts yet so I don't know how long the cooldowns are, but I keep moving and stretching for a couple of minutes after Workout 1 ends because I just feel like it stops too quickly after all that intensity.
B003O86FMW|3.0|This book seemed like the first installment with minimal repackaging. Here's the similarities plotwise:<br /><br />1. Reaping, which is rigged in this one because only previous winners are included. Katniss is the only female victor from district 12. Sucks to be her!<br />2. Tour of the capitol/pregame events- Peeta and Katniss once again are paraded in front of a large audience before their grand entrance into the hunger games. They are also required to do the skills assessment portion for a grade, same as last time.<br />3. Interviews- Once again, Peeta takes control in this segment with his wit and charm. Katniss makes a lasting impression thanks to her designer, Cinna.<br />4. Hunger games- Peeta and Katniss against the world, or at least those participating in annual hunger games. This time, they join a group.<br />5. Aftermath of the hunger games.<br /><br />There are some differences within these 5 segments, which is to be expected. Still, it is essentially the exact same formula from the first book. Sure it worked then, but I was expecting something more and was sorely disappointed.<br /><br />The beginning and end are definitely the most different, but then again they had to be out of necessity. Katniss' betrayal of the capitol and president Snow is exploited, which I felt was a nice start to the story given the ending of the first book.<br /><br />The ending of this novel seemed extremely anti-climatic. After escaping from the hunger games, Katniss once again wakes up in a strange location with tubes and medical equipment all around her. Deja vu from the first book, right? Again, the similarities are uncanny. She finds out about the horrible destruction of district 12 and the novel ends. This seemed like more of a segue into the third book than anything (I haven't read it yet, this is simply a guess). I think the story should have ended in the Hunger Games, with more of a cliffhanger approach. That way, you leave the reader at the pinnacle of excitement, rather than stopping things a scene or two after the action has concluded.ather than stopping things a scene or two after the action has concluded.
1590171993|5.0|This is the novel that has recently become famous because it never became famous when it was first published back in 1965.  It's been at the top of European best seller lists for months now, and is gaining popularity here in America thanks to Twitter and other social media buzz.  I loved it.  The main character annoyed the living be-Jesus out of me from time to time, but he nonetheless got to me.  I liked him so much and wanted to see him get on with things and find happiness. I also enjoyed the crystalline prose although there were times when Williams's simple and straightforward words about his characters and the human condition plumbed to depths that went beyond my ability to grasp. I may not be smart enough to have gotten all of what Williams has to say, but I got most of it.  And what I got was mesmerizing.  I greedily consumed this quiet little book in just a handful of sittings.<br /><br />Let me say that in spite of what you ex (or present-day) hippies might infer from the one-word title, this is not a novel about a drug addict!  It's about a farm boy who goes to the University of Missouri in the early 1900's to study agriculture but decides instead in his Sophomore Year to take up English literature. He goes on to earn his PhD in some arcane medieval literary genre and becomes a professor at the same university that graduated him.  He enters into an unsuccessful marriage, has a beautiful daughter, trundles along with his various professorial pursuits and duties, gets embroiled in a nasty inter-departmental feud, stumbles into a steamy affair with a woman half his age and dies.<br /><br />I can't fully explain why I found this book such a page-turner.  Hardly anything happens and yet you can't wait to see how all that `hardly anything' gets worked out.  The feud Stoner is drawn into with another professor adds a touch of compelling drama, but let's face it, the combat between two middle aged English Lit professors doesn't exactly sizzle like the scenes from Star Wars. His crazy star-crossed love affair gets your heart pumping for a chapter or so, but the long stretches before and after thump along at a languid, meditative pace.  This is a novel full of unlikely pairings and ironies. Its main character is as cold and hard as granite and equally as warm and tender as a summer's breeze. It's all so lonely and sad and yet so exhilarating.<br /><br />By the end of the book you come to appreciate that buried beneath Stoner's serial passivity lurks a heroic core.  He remains true to a deep reservoir of integrity. And while he screws up royally with a lot of things and has nothing much to account for himself, he is without question the enduring hero of his own entirely ordinary yet fiercely unique life.<br /><br />We should all hope to accomplish half as much.Star Wars.

B000PKX2KA|5.0|Used this with my Delorme 2013 Street Atlas, the cord was long enough to leave the antenna on the dash of my New Beetle and plug into the laptop in the front passenger seat.  Delorme bundles this receiver with their Street Atlas so I was sure it would work ok.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|When I read I like to escape. That is what happens when you read these books. Yes, it's an adult dysfunctional fairy tale but who cares!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Nice idea. But the number puzzles and color combinations were predictable from level to level.  Also the hiding places could use more quirks. More variety please.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game has some fairly impressive graphics but it does take up a lot more room than the average game.

1451637500|4.0|CryoBurn is a good solid espionage science fiction piece that relies a bit too much on coincidental meetings, but remains an interesting tale of corporate misdeed and heroic action.  As one of the later installments of the very popular and award winning Vorkosigan series, it is best read after the others (as that it contains spoilers of the earlier episodes).  Even so, it can be read enjoyably on its own, something that is very hard to do.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any fan of Science Fiction, and to any Spy Thriller reader who doesn't mind a science fiction setting.<br /><br />You can read my complete review at [...] or follow the direct link to this review at:  [...]
B000AP04OM|5.0|The DVD is in great shape.  I bought this for my Grandkids and they are loving it.  The shipping was fast. All in all a really good deal
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love using the YouVersion Bible app. It has so many versions to choose from. I can switch between them as I study.
B004WR125O|5.0|Don't bother wiring your Onkyo receiver to your home network or router.  This works like a charm for connecting the Onkyo network receivers.  I am using a signal amplifier so I can move my internet devices pretty much anywhere in my house and yard.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Now this was a story I read many years ago about how much mischief two boys could get into without hurting themselves or anyone else
B003UYV08E|5.0|This was a great buy.  It plays flawlessly.  It has met all my epectations then some.  I like the product.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|This game is awesome. Enough said.<br /><br />But when you are looking at the ratings wondering, is this worth it? and you see this comments that are like,  &quot;ohhhhh this messes up the glory of God ahhh &quot; or &quot;This is all about religion don't get &quot; you just need to ignore them because they are not about the actual gameplay. I REPEAT, IGNORE THOSE COMMENTS!!!! THIS IS A GREAT GAME!!:
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has great ideas and is beautifully written. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to fall in love, cry, laugh, and think. It was amazing.
B00D23GXB2|4.0|This collection of short poems will have your imagination running wild. The images portrayed in each poem are steamy and sexy causing the reader to want more. A wonderful collection of short poems every lover of poetry should read!
1742200508|5.0|In a few weeks I'm heading to England for a wonderful vacation.  This book is filled with useful information about the country, places to stay, places to visit, hotels, restaurants--you name it, it's there.  I would recommend it to anyone who's headed to England on vacation, or as the English would say, &#34;on holiday.&#34;
B005OYKI1I|5.0|Once again theses movies suprise me how they keep getting better every time!!!Excellent movie ......get this movie for your collection.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|Stuck at rental cottage in Montauk during first the Tropical Storm of the 2013 season we opened an Amazon account and rented Jaws everything work perfect. In my opinion this inter-net thing might catch on.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|\\"If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun.\\" Gerry (Pitt) and his family start the day like every other day. They wake up, eat breakfast then head off to school and work. That's where the day begins to take a strange turn. When explosions happen and people start running no one is sure what is happening. After given safety Gerry is told he must go and find a way to stop what is fast becoming something that could end the world. I have never really been a fan of zombie movies. I really liked Shaun Of The Dead, but I'm not sure if that counts. I have to say that while the movie was a tad slow in a few parts this is a very good, exciting and fun movie to watch. The one complaint with this movie that I have is that it got a little repetitive, but that didn't really hurt the movie too much and the movie was exciting enough to keep you watching and tense almost the whole time. If you are a fan of zombie movies you will really enjoy this. If you aren't give this a try, I did and I enjoyed it. Overall, one of the best serious zombie movies I have seen. I give it a B+.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I have read his 2 books ,.kite runner and a thousand splendid suns. excellent writer. this book I could not get into as much. kept going to different stories.i could not keep track of it. but I do like this author.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|In my eyes as well as others this is the ultimate cult film. It's age and the bloops and history with this film is nothing but enjoyable. There is a reason the movie is still played in theaters around the country. There isn't a dull moment in it but I would advise watching the UK version. It is just complete that way. I don't want to give anything away. I would go and watch it for yourselves and hope you enjoy it as much as I have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is an excellent look at how humans adapt and survive.  The characters are well developed and the story line amazing.  I just wanted to keep reading and not put it down until I finished.  I can't wait to read about the other silos
B005HSL626|5.0|it is amazing!!! there is only one tome this app has let me down and it was only cud I had to update it... this is the best app ever!!!!  I highly recommend it... :) get it!!!  don't hesetate... no second guesses... get it now!!!!  what are you still doing reading this press download... NOW
B003UESJH4|3.0|Probably a good movie to watch, but does not meet the review consensus and given the option, I probably would not buy this flick again ?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is an awesome game you go to different places and explore places I never went. And its good to know that you can learn about these places like Paris , Miami, New York , Rome and other places. So thank you for letting me play this creatively game.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I looked forward for many months to reading this new book only to be reading a recap of the last book. Share on the author
B009G41CG2|2.0|I really like playing this game, but it does not have the option of reshuffle, or hints, or pause, nor can the background be changed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This is a great book.  I am aware that many people were upset because it is supposed to be a trilogy but I look at it as a nice surprise to have another book to look foward to.  It's a great story couldn't wait to read it !
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Requires some skill to navigate the courses, which makes it a very entertaining way to pass time.  You can stop at any time and resume playing later
B0014DW3OS|5.0|If you love Denzel Washington (and who doesn't?) you've got to see this movie.  I don't remember seeing him in a part like this one before or since.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thank you so much! This game is so addicting I love it. Just needs to update better on the kindle fire.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Although not as good as the books, these movies are very good.  Matt did a fantastic job playing Jason Bourne.  He wouldn't have been my first pick to play the part but he really pulled it off!
006226303X|4.0|I brought this book along on my family's beach vacation. When I found myself standing in the bathroom reading it after midnight, after everyone demanded lights out, I knew it was a winner! A 40-something man returns to his boyhood home in Sussex, England for a funeral. He cannot remember the last time he returned, but does not seem at all surprised to find himself at a pond at the end of the lane, the ocean of the title. There he remembers things both fantastic and frightening from the year he turned seven. The pond is on the Hempstock farm, and the Hempstock were not what they seemed then and are not now, but that summer the youngest Hempstock led him on an adventure that revealed how very fragile the world we perceive actually is. This is an enchanting, mesmerizing tale of the true courage of childhood and the fears adults bring forth from those years that can sometimes cripple and stunt our personal growth.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|I give this album 5 stars. It certainly has a different sound to it and it is far from the status quo. Its prob not the type of album you'll listen to the first time and think, &#34; instant classic.&#34; I think this is because the sound is so different. There certainly are a few tracks that when herd the first time are infectious and will grab your attention. After a few listens you will (maybe just my opinion) gain an appreciation for Ye' lyrical word play, organization/arrangement of songs, creative beat selection , and at times the message. My favorite, and probably the most infectious song, is &#34;Blood on the Leaves&#34;. I am in my mid 20's, but a huge fan of jazz, funk, and old school R&B and hip hop. The Nina Simone sample of &#34;Strange Fruit &#34; (originally by Billie Holliday I believe) is fantastic. One, 'Strange Fruit&#34; is a deep and painful metaphor describing the aftermath of the brutal practice of a lynching. A common reality at the time. It (for some) will force listeners not already familiar with the original song to do their homework and possibly find a new appreciation for the genius of the Artists of yesterday. Ye's rendition takes the song in a different direction leaving up to the listener's imagination to tie the sample and Ye's lyrics together and figure out the message he's trying to convey. Solid album, different, and will be counted as one of Ye's greats.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|works really well, just wish it didn't expire! the trial is done and now i can only desktop connect and control if im on my wifi not on the network
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|This album is a slight change of sound for VW with the exception, pretty much, of Step and I think this change is mostly for the good.  If you're looking for the regular VW sound or if you don't like Paul Simon (since it seems like that was where the change came - in other words, they sound a little like Paul Simon), you'll probably be a little disappointed.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|it works well but still has glitches to tease out. Wish it had more integration with google docs and others
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|This is a fantastic album and I wish I had known about him before Somebody That I Used to Know.  While not everything is perfect here, this a pretty good album - even if you got sick of Somebody That I Used to Know - since the rest of the songs aren't exactly the same (although they have a sound in common, if that makes sense).<br />The one thing that could be annoying is that, for a decent amount of the songs (maybe 4 or 5), he has a breath-y singing style.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|its a great game. it is usually 20 bucks for other devices like nintendos but its only a dollar! buy it!
B00BF2UKDE|4.0|Even though I might not have liked the following things if someone else had done it, I like the gravely-ness of his voice and the spareness of the songs works here for the most part.<br />The spare-ness didn't always work, and it kind of made the songs seem lacking in music sometimes, and that's my only real problem here.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. waiting for the next book. Hope it's soon. Love Sylvia Day's work. Keeps you wanting more.
B000W1586S|4.0|I know this came out a while ago, but I think this is a good album.  It has a foundation in rock, and also mixes and layers on a lot of pop.  The combination works pretty well - you can still hear the rock under all the pop and keeps an earthy feel in a sense.<br />If you liked the sound of the Killers' later stuff, you might not like this album so much, though.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I've been a big fan of Kanye's last three albums and, I have to say, this one is just as great!  I am loving the Justin Vernon/Kanye West collaborations, too.  I love the song that samples Nina Simone's Strange Fruit... and the entire album has some great, dark samples.  I highly recommend this one.  Best rap album I've heard this year, so far.  It's not as amazing as MDBTFantasy but close.
B002A5WQ8W|4.0|This is a classic, and while most of the songs are good, I didn't actually like everything.  Definitely worth a look if you want to get into jazz.<br />If you don't like jazz, this is definitely not for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very mind binding, challenging game. If you like to put your mind to work this game is for you!!!  Go ahead try it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed this book from the 1st page to the last. It was a story I was said to see end & WOW! what an ending it had. Did NOT see that coming. I would highly recommend this book & have, to many of my friends.
1476734941|5.0|I have never been on a diet before, saw the PBS documentary and then got the book. This way of eating really works for me. I was able to lose the baby weight that would not come off no matter how much I exercise, which is a lot. I eat a lot healthier now and feel a lot better. Love this book and way of eating.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The passion between Gideon and Eva is amazing. I can't wait to read more of their story. I know some are sorry the story did not end, but I am so excited to read more. Please just hurry and finish the next book......
B008XG1X18|5.0|It takes my mind to a place of peace, creativity & laughter. There is something for everyone if u just took the time to peak some interest
B005CAATXG|5.0|I first heard Icon for Hire on Christian X 2012. It was an instant favorite on the album. I was unsure about buying the whole album for some time. Once I finally bought it I kicked myself for not buying it sooner. It is one of those albums that you can listen to every track from start to finish.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|All TED apps seem to have occasional issues with spontaneously closing, but it is rare. Having TED Talks available on my new Kindle HD  is great. If you haven't wandered through TED, prepare yourself for great talks on a tremendously wide variety of brainy topics. Get lost in TED apps and have fun while broadening your world.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Once again I am rating this series with 5+ stars. I love Gideon and Eva and I will shout it from mountaintops, tall buildings or anywhere else someone will let me speak. Sylvia Day has done it again, completely capturing my heart with her writing. I truly loved every single minute of this book, every single one!<br /><br />I have to say that I had high expectations going into it since I have been crazy in love with the series so far, and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Their story picks up right where we left off in Reflected In You (thank you for that Sylvia Day!). Eva and Gideon are trying to pick up the pieces of their relationship after Nathan's murder and find their path.<br /><br />The love that is between Eva and Gideon is so powerful it takes my breath away! These two are just meant to be together, like there is some force that has brought them together and will keep them together no matter what challenges they have to face. I think that's one of my favorite things about these two, they fight through it all together, even when they don't realize that is what they are doing.<br /><br />Their crazy passion for each other continues to burn red hot in this book too! They are struggling with external issues that threaten their relationship as well as their internal demons that they continue to deal with.<br /><br />\\"He was all things to me, everything I wanted and needed in one imperfect man.\\" ~Eva<br /><br />I loved the continued growth we see in Gideon in this book. I really felt like I learned so much more about him, and his love and pure need for Eva.  Gideon has changed from the playboy, walking sex god we first met into such a complicated and beautiful man. He is that perfect damaged, tortured alpha male and yet he is vulnerable in a way that just squeezes your heart and steals your breath. He has come to understand his need for Eva and that is not just about great sex but a love so deep he can't live without it.<br /><br />\\"You'll never lose me, angel,\\"he vowed. Wherever you go, however far, I'll be right there with you.\\" ~Gideon<br /><br />Since the very beginning I admired Eva's strength, she is definitely a tough woman who won't put up with shit from anyone, including Gideon. She stands up to him when needed but also knows when he needs the softness and love from her. She has her own issues to face in this book with her family, Cary and those around her and she works so hard to get through them even when she's ready to break.<br /><br />I also loved the continued stories of many of the other characters in the series. The depth of the other characters makes the story feel whole.<br /><br />I was thrilled with the end of this book, although I was practically jumping up and down when I found out that this is not the end of their story (Squeeee)! I'm so excited to see where Sylvia Day will take them next because it so clearly NOT over! These characters still continue to grow and learn from each other.<br /><br />Another heart squeezing, scorching hot book from Sylvia Day that I will re-read over and over again. This isn't a simple love story, but a journey of two people finding love and hope and learning how accept it from each other.<br /><br />\\"It'd been that way with us from the very first meeting, both of us inexorably drawn together. We'd mistaken our ferocious mutual captivation for lust until we realized we couldn't breathe without each other.\\" ~ Eva<br /><br />You can also find my review at http://thegeekerybookreview.blogspot.com/
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Great story about an unknown singer songwriter, who deserved a lot of recognition. One of the best movies I've watched in a long time!
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is the most epic game u can ever play it beats all the other games in the world ....<br />Minecraft. is awesome respect it and the the butter called gold and the diamonds. well just want to tell you guys that.peace minecraft creepers rock
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire and it has to be one of the most useful apps available. Has standard and military time, wakes with music of your choice or different sounds, can set multiple alarm times, snooze alarm can be set for different lengths of time, and alarms can be set to go off on only one day or multiple days. More than I really need, but the options are there. Great app!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|For a free application it works good. Helps keep track of my battery<br />life.  There aren't any fancy features to deal with.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|fun game but prone to freeze and lost my progress data three times in the first two days. not worth the time if if FGOL doesn't get it fixed
1582406634|4.0|The book had many finished drawing as well as work in progeess. Which is very insructive on the inking process.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the book!!  Can't wait for the next one!!!  Please Sylvia Day When is the next Crossfire book coming out????
1608871819|5.0|The book is a well put together. I have bought simular book and had them to fall a part at the binding. Not this one. The images are stunning though as a fan I wished to have see more of the thought process than just finished concept drawing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a good game to help you pass the time liked looking for things to has a zoom feature I would recommend this game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game would also recommend it to any one. Keeps me interest. Would try other games like this one.
B00005JKZV|5.0|It arrived in a timely manner and was wrapped as if I'd just brought it home from the store. The discs played through without a hitch!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was tragic and sorrow full,but filled with happiness. All the characters are so lovable and you can't help feeling sad for them. This book is quit exquisite in many ways.
0880796863|5.0|The designs on the cards are very intricate and well done. The instructions are easy to follow for those who are new to the craft as well. Just make sure you actually read it all before you begin! Happy reading!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a nice set. The puzzles are tricky enough to take some time, but not so ridiculous that nobody can figure them out. I'm on about level seven or so now, and enjoying them quite a bit.<br />I hope they come out with another such game!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is great for young people (grandchildren) to use. Excellent for problem solving and practicing patience. I'be been stumped a time or two! Thanks.
B005C4ERHQ|5.0|I love to read this book repeatedly since it will remind where my strengths it.  Also to know my weakest as well
0765337541|5.0|This is a well-paced & exciting read—my 13-1/2 yr old grandson LOVED it—like Hunger Games & Harry Potter & Knight School... I am reading the sequel, Speaker For the Dead, but at half-way through I don't think I'll be giving it to my grandson—it lacks the structure & visceral involvement of the first, even though it also won the Hugo & Nebula Awards like Ender's Game... Janice Kim, who co-wrote the excellent GO series, recommended Ender's Game for game strategies...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Enjoyed it very much.  Brings you to the end and gives you the understanding of the Jedi and the destiny for the empire.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Great book! It has suspense and intrigue in every page, filled with excitement, perfect for young and old readers, just magnificent.
B001BVRNPW|5.0|It doesn't get much better than this.  Lots of action and the story concludes a incredible series or should I say several series.  I've watched this 4 times and enjoyed it more and more.
1401940676|5.0|Anita Moorjani was brought to light by Wayne Dyer (see gushing of my hero in previous reviews) when he came upon her story.  It was Wayne who encouraged Hay House to publish her experience, knowing that there are millions out there who would benefit from her near-death experience.  And millions have.<br /><br />Anita is a testament, a living, breathing testament to what Wayne has been talking about for decades.  These things are true.  They are reality.  It is our false sense of what is 'real' that has gotten the entire world into such a mess.<br /><br />If you are wondering about what comes next (after life here), then buy and read this woman's account of her experience.  It is beyond profound and is so painfully truthful and at once, liberating as to be the most powerful 'NDE' book out there today (near death experience).<br /><br />I had to skip the chapters outlining much too vividly the excruciating detail of her cancer journey - up to the point where the doctors declared she had only hours to live, deep in a coma.<br /><br />I knew there was more to this story, so I had to go to the next chapters that began her journey of enlightenment.  As a Dyer fan and a believer of removing that which is unnecessarily toxic from our lives - I found her lead up to the part where God takes over much too painful and descriptive to read through.  For those who are cancer survivors or have known someone who is, perhaps it will be easier to read, but I'm thinking it won't.<br /><br />But, once you get past that part (which sets up the foundation of her journey grandly), you are dropped kicked into a reality so surreal and so joyfully freeing as to almost make you 'ready to go' just so that you may experience what SHE experienced.<br /><br />Anita's story has removed any vestiges of fear or doubt for me of moving into the great beyond.  I know now, as I have suspected all along, that it's merely another stage in the journey.  What we do HERE will determine what happens THERE.<br/><br />So simple, so clear and so logical that I find it hard to understand how everyone on the planet doesn't see this as the truth that it is.<br /><br />But I know that isn't the case.  I know that there are millions who are so steeped in their own caustic and rigid beliefs as to render our world a terror and prejudice filled place - hell on earth is it were.  While the exact possibility exists for us to create heaven on earth.  It's within each one of us.<br /><br />Anita will guide you through the maze (being raised in the caustic and rigid belief system of her own culture) of what is on the other side and what joy you can create while still on this side.<br /><br />It's a must read.  Simply put.
B000PMG16U|4.0|Enjoyed it very much. Brings you to the beginning and gives you the understanding of the Jedi, Darth Vader and the emperor.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This is the cheapest-looking, most embarrassingly primitive-looking CD I have seen in my 50 years of buying CD's - no cover art, no insert. a cheap piece of plastic holding the CD closed!!! I would not have even bought a bootleg CD on the street that looks like this. And imagine this was intended as a gift...<br />I respect Kanye West's art. I cannot believe that he would associate himself with this piece of garbage. I certainly shall not.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Our family is hooked.  From young to old we love to gather and watch an episode or 2.  Great writing, acting, scenery, costumes!
B009UZBLSG|1.0|Do NOT believe in the rave reviews.  I bought this for my Nexus 4. The idea behind it is great but actual functionality is deeply flawed.  As many have posted, battery drainage is a BIG problem. Not mentioned much is that it works only with certain short length HDMI cables.  I was thinking that I could sit back on my couch with a long HDMI cable attached.  Will not work.  Also, Wi-Fi gets knocked out once you plug this unit in.  If you are planning on using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard as well, that will also knock out your Wi-fi.  So basically you have to play videos that is locally stored on you phone only.  Your phone screen is always on when this unit is on as well.  After using it about 10 times the unit stopped working.  I think the flickering caused it to break down.  This unit causes your large screen to flicker when you attach it to an HDMI cable during the \\"hand shake\\" process.  It also sometimes freezes your phone and or cause it to restart.<br /><br />Buyer beware.  WAIT till 2nd or 3 generation on these types of devices.  There is a reason why there are not too many companies making \\"slimport\\" adapters.<br />Do a search and basically there's just 1.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. You get free games everyday and have lots of wins. I try to play every day.  I also share this with my friends. It gives me my bingo fix.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read it twice and told all my friends and family about it!  Can't wait for the next book to come out!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Pretty good and is better suited for kids. I enjoyed it, but a little disappointed. My grand-kids would like it.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book so much. I just couldn't put it down it was so amazing. Looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Completely enjoyed this game 100%! So much that I am leaving my first review ever. Wonderful graphics good story line challenging but not too hard. Downloading more apps by icoolgeeks as I am typing.
B007XCH150|5.0|Her beats were top notch.  And an awesome voice.  So glad I bought this CD.  Kills my Rockford Fosgate factory cat stereo.  Comparable to Kim Wilde.  Huge fan!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is very entertaining and will give anybody hours of enjoyment, maybe even some frustration.  At times it might make you want to quit and just go somewhere to take a nap.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|It was a good movie even though it was very similar to Battle Royale. I could tell that this movie was more geared towards teenagers. I thought the ending was a little awkward but it'll be interesting to see how to sets up with the sequel.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The author develops the characters and places them into the history of the period with an unbelievable story line.  It's a page turner and very hard to put down once you get into the story.
B002RZZIXU|3.0|It was an enjoyable easy read and the premise of the book was interesting. Unfortunately there were many loose ends or threads that did not seem to lead any where. I didn't feel convinced that Eva would have become a spy just because of the circumstances of her brother's death. I also feel the conclusion was a bit to straight forward given the twists and turns in the rest of the book.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Family fun.<br />Funny movie.<br />It's a movie the whole family can watch together.<br />Very entertaining.<br />Highly recommend it; makes for a good laugh.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I've read this series, and I love it!! I was so excited about this last one to come out, I  reread the first two so I could refresh my memory of them! I hated that it took so long for the third book, and now I'm left hanging for the fourth book!!  This is tourcher!! I will NEVER again read another series again, until all of them are out!! I'm really disappointed!
B000000OPZ|4.0|Whitesnake's self-titled album, was great when it came out in 1987, but it has sled a little since.  The bluesy Whitesnake had become part of the hair rock scene in 1987.  David Coverdale, Aynsley Dunbar, John Sykes, Neil Murray and Adrian Vandenberg (who had a hit in '82 \\"Burnin' Heart\\").  Their 9th studio release broke this band like wildfire.  This album gave us, the rockers \\"Children Of The Night\\", \\"Crying In The Rain\\", tremendous track, the Zeppelin clone song \\"Still Of The Night\\",#79, still one of my favorites from these guys.  The melodic rockers in, \\"Give Me All Your Love\\", #48, and the ballads that got played to death \\"Is This Love\\", #1, and \\"Here I Go Again\\", #2.  They would release \\"Slip Of The Tongue\\", in 1989.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Complex story line woven together with creative imagination and exquisite figurative language that captures the reader between multiple time periods
0525953728|5.0|I initially bought this for my boyfriend. He read it and has since passed it around to my two sons and son in law. I'm not a reader but just maybe....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you use your brain.  My daughter and I both finished the first 10 levels in one day because we couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for other levels to open.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and wanted to have one...as of now enjoying this app:). .a half dream come true for me...

B009JZWO3I|4.0|I only wish that this series had not been discontinued.  It's an interesting view of a professional woman and her marriage.<br />'
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Not very interesting, I feel Sylvia Day is just trying to prolong the story and making more money by adding two more books to the series.  Will not be buying anymore Crossfire Books.  The first two were excellent, the last one was a let down.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I would recommend to anyone who likes to stay engaged in the story. Page turner, kept my interest. I really liked the writing style and description/detail of characters. Well try other books by author.
B004N44SOI|5.0|Great cd. Didn't know what to expect beyond a couple of their popular songs, but I ended up really liking the whole album. Highly recommended.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have been waiting months for this book to come out.  I tried to stop myself from reading it because I was expecting it to be the last of the series, but boy was I surprised and happy that there will be more to the story.  Now, I'm anxiously awaiting for the next book to come out.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I read this book last week - i'd put it on a par with The Observer Effect, by Kieron Dowling...absolutely phenomenal! Period. I completed the 'experiments' recommended in the book (in my own little way) and my life has literally changed overnight.  If you are like myself and at were at the crossroads, then reach inside to the heart and soul of your being, kick back and hide away with this and you'll come out a new person.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Maggie Smith is wonderful as usual.  Good story that goes well with &#34;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.&#34;  Who knew that Dustin Hoffman directed films?
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|this app is a good app it makes you turn up the base or treble the best app ever I will get another one though because it froze on me

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved the game, challenging yet not too much so.  Kinda wish it had more levels...also wish it had a hint button on game.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Disappointed that instead of looking forward to an ending, the story continues.  Getting a little bored now!!  How can it continue for two more sequels?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Don't be fooled by the first level. The challenge increases with each level. Can't wait to see what is ahead !
B002LVVCQM|5.0|Verygood overview of evolution from macro to micro. I learned a number of interesting things. The book title says it all...
B00D2K40WY|4.0|I really like this app , and am glad it's free. I think the full version is a little pricey .
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great for people that like Iron Man. Iron Man is my favorite avenger. This Minecraft wiz411 speaking for my fans!!!! Have a good time playing this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Why do people do terrible things?  Why does Society allow such awfulness?  Is it because the poor are despised, kept down for the good of the rich?  Because if they rise, they will have too much power?  What choices do people have but to try and fight back?  Or maybe the odds are stacked impossibly against them, leaving no way out.<br /><br />Is Fate dictated by money?<br /><br />Reading this sad, yet illuminating story goes some way to exploring the terrible and maybe wonderful things people do - their hatred, their jealousy, their lack of understanding of the plight of others or just plain cruelty.<br /><br />Well written and certainly thought provoking - a story filled the good, the bad and the ugly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Same as title and anyone who is able maybe 10 and up I'm really not sure not a bad story almost anyone who could stand it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|IT MAKES YOU DETERMINED TO FIGURE IT OUT. I LOVE IT and can't wait for more! I can't put it down until I have figured it out.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|This movie is sure to be a classic for Christmas. Our family loves it. It has so much heart in the main character Arthur.
B004EBT5CU|3.0|I bought this CD because I liked one of Adele's songs.  I heard another song that was good but the other songs weren't too much to my liking.  I was finding myself listening to just those two songs so I ended up trading this one in.
1569242739|5.0|Lots of different vegan cupcake recipes to choose from! You can go fresh with fruits on the cupcakes to a rich, silky  chocolate heaven. Great easy to follow directions, but note that the recipes use oil and soy products. If you're trying to avoid either one of those ingredients, substitute or find another book. For sweets that are an occasional treat, we're very happy with this book.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|A good movie but I think it would be something I would purposely watch again. Definitely worth the 4 dollar rental but glad I did watch it at the movie theatre. Would have been disappointed not worth the extra money I would have paid.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|Whether we like it or not, we all have our own \\"Master and Commander.\\"  If you're a philosopher, you probably believe that it is nature.  If you're religious, it's probably divinity.  And if you are in military service, it's probably the government.  If you're Stephen Maturin -- the surgeon and naturalist on board the ship, played very well by Paul Bettany -- you probably feel that your \\"Master and Commander\\" is the first in that list.  If you're Jack Aubrey -- the captain on board the ship, and played even better by Russell Crowe -- you probably feel obligation to the last two.<br /><br />I got a real feeling for the Theory of Evolution here, especially since the crew makes a trip to the Galapagos Islands.  I'm not sure if this film is set before Charles Darwin came up with his \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" but no matter.  I'm sure that people way before him were thinking about some of these same things, and Mr. Maturin seems to fit that bill.  He wants to know why some birds on the island have insufficient wings for flight; why some insects look like sticks; why all of the species there have changed to fit their environment.  He's thinking about the \\"natural order of things,\\" or perhaps \\"the survival of the fittest\\" already, perhaps even before Mr. Darwin.<br /><br />But Captain Aubrey is thinking about the same themes, but from a different perspective.  To him, the survival of the fittest involves humans in combat.  After all, humans are animals, and if only the strong survive amongst non-human animals, why should the same not apply with humans as well?  We evolve too, perhaps more in intelligence than anything else.  (I'm not sure modern-day man is all that intelligent, but I digress.)<br /><br />Mr. Crowe reminds me of Captain Kirk here a bit from \\"Star Trek,\\" although Mr. Crowe's character isn't chasing women across the galaxy, but is rather chasing another ship across the ocean.  And Mr. Crowe uses his intelligence at least once to gain advantage over another,just like Captain Kirk would always seem to do.  And this happens around about the time that our two main characters seem to finally start truly understanding and respecting each other; after all, before that, each has his own priorities, and each has his own \\"master and commander,\\" and those \\"masters and commanders\\" seem to be mutually exclusive.<br /><br />But with Mr. Crowe, it would be only the natural order of things for him to give a fine performance in a fine movie.  He just never seems to devolve as an actor to me.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love everything about this show.. The characters, the dialogue, the historical information, Can't wait for the next season. Good television. PERIOD.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I used to live in the Emerald City.  But there were just too many witches there, and it just rained too much.  So I decided to move south from Washington State to the sunshine in California.  There may not be a Yellow Brick Road in the city in which I now live -- I haven't checked on Google Maps yet, however -- but at least it's sunny about 300 days a year.  That's surely better than raining 300 days a year.<br /><br />My \\"new\\" house was built in 1938, or probably the same year that \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" was being filmed.  The bad things about an older house:  it's creaky and it constantly needs work.  The good things:  it has charm and it was built to last, unlike the houses built today.  And this is about exactly how I'd compare the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\" with \\"Oz:  the Great and Powerful.\\"  The latter just doesn't have much charm, while the former was overflowing with it.  And this prequel will most likely be almost forgotten in only a few years, while people will be talking about the original through the next century.<br /><br />Oh, I did really like Michelle Williams, of course.  She's always good.  The only problem that I usually have with her in a movie:  I actually think about Heath Ledger the whole time.  I'll bet the same might go for her.  He definitely died before his time, and he had several roles where he was terrific.  And I really liked the little porcelain doll here as well; she seemed to have more humanity than almost any of the other humans in this picture.<br /><br />But while watching, I started thinking about the potential that this film had, and I thought about how much this film owed to the original \\"Oz\\" to be good.  I would argue that \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" while surely not being perfect -- no film ever is or will be perfect -- was probably a masterpiece.  And I started thinking about how the producers could have almost guaranteed that this film would have been great.  So let's go back in time and remake this film right this time . . . .<br /><br/>1.  Make Tim Burton the director.  This film either needed to be lighter or darker, and I think that Mr. Burton would have gone the latter route but simultaneously given it more humanity, as he always does.  2.  Put Johnny Depp in the main role.  You can put him in almost any lead male role and it'll be better.  3.  Keep Michelle Williams in it.  She's always good to great.  4.  Beg Charlize Theron to play the Wicked Witch.  Pay her whatever she wants.  She was terrific in, well, every role she plays.  But she was doubly terrific in \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" as the Meanest Person Ever.  5.  Make Patton Oswalt the monkey.  6.  Finally, producers, just get the hell outta Mr. Burton's way and let him make the picture!<br /><br />But unfortunately, we don't have a time machine so we will be \\"stuck\\" with this, although it has a few moments here and there.  It seemed to be influenced by \\"Willy Wonka\\" (the original) and \\"Mary Poppins.\\"  And I somewhat liked the themes:  Deception, Greed and Redemption.  Oh, and \\"Dance with the One Who Brung Ya'.\\"<br /><br />Not a total disaster.  But you know what?  They just don't build things the way they used to, not even movies.
B00006FDCD|5.0|A great classic film that my sister tortured me with when I was a younger, impressionable chap.  This movie will forever be one of the BEST films adapted from King's novels.  The terrible acting, and effects only add to the excessively long made-for-TV movie.  Purchase this with pride.  Makes for a great 'Guerilla Drive-In&#34; feature.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini once again captures the spirit and the heart of his precious characters. He allows the reader to become one with the story and to experience the love expressed on every page.  This story makes me glad to be alive because I have experienced the dose of reality Hosseini truthfully and artfully portrays.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game gets updates every month and keeps on adding stuff that's in the Pc on to the kindle fire. just a amazing game for kids and older ones.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|One of the best marvel movies made, i definitely recommend to watch. awesome action scenes, and was cool to see all the stars together.
0312380852|4.0|This is a very nice book to work from.  Has several nice tutorials.  I made a couple bracelets from it and one of them sold within an hour of it being on the table.
034580404X|5.0|I loved reading these books. I was unable to put these books down while reading them. They draw you in and capture your heart. You fall in the love with each character (or hate specific characters....) Of course, the draw to the book was the sex, but once you start reading the book, there is more to the story. The love Christian and Ana have, makes most couples envious. On the other hand, it does give couples more ideas on how to spice up their sex lives. It's amazing and anyone who is questioning whether or not they should read it, do it!! You will not regret your decision to read these books!
0425263924|5.0|Excellent book worth the money. Easy to follow especially after such a long wait. Sylvia day is a terrific author.
B0088W7VNG|5.0|It's a shame that the show ended here, as the ending is cool.  But it certainly went out with a cool bang.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I loved Temple Run 1 and this one is even better with great graphics quality, amazing new obstacles and new areas to run through. There is one major problem though: I had been playing for a while and decided to close it and do something else, but when I went to play it again, it would not open. I tried everything I could think of, including deleting and reinstalling the app, which was the one thing that worked. this happened to me twice, and it's quite annoying, as it results in the loss of all of my progress. It's a great game, but what's the point if you can't play it?
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Average of about 4 hours of game play or less.  But it was very satisfying and enchanting.  Recommended it to everyone.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A spellbinding novel with an intriguing look at life in North Korea. It takes you on an incredible journey  of unbelievable hardship and cruelty,yet leaves you strangely  uplifted. A must read.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|it can get very addicting but it seems to crash ALOT really pisses me off when I'm playing the game it crashes the most online please fix.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A game to bend your mind but wish it could have been a little harder. I felt like I went through it too fast.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I was a little worried to see this movie because I was so disapointed with their #2  because it was #2( haha potty humor)<br />But Number three was a lot better and very sentimental, funny and interesting. If you are like me and had lost faith in the franchise at 2, give this movie another chance and watch #3. Worth owning.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The Calculator Plus is basic, simple and meets my need for general computing while balancing my check book and adding up bank statements. I like this app and will continue to use it.
0515125024|3.0|I decided to read the Reacher novels in order. I really enjoyed the Killing Floor but Die Trying, not so much. I find the pace excruciatingly slow (as I do with Tripwire right now). When I enjoy a book I can hardly put it down. This one took weeks. I normally don't finish a book that I can't get into but I really wanted to like this series.<br /><br /> Child likes to go into every minute detail and thought of the characters. What they see, what it reminds them of,  etc. It can go on for pages and adds nothing to the story and goes beyond simple exposition. I admire the way he takes seemingly unrelated characters and storylines and at some point have them intersect and come together but it takes longer than I'd like to get there or to even catch a hint in how it all comes together.<br /><br />Also, each book take place in different parts of the country, yet everyone constantly ends sentences with 'right' and 'ok'. And he is fond of the phrases \\"No doubt about that\\" and \\"You bet your a$$\\" Petty complaint, I know, but it's a bit annoying. Perhaps this is just the English author's view of how Americans speak?<br /><br />Overall, I like the character and I may try one more book if I come across one in a used bookstore but I don't think  I will get through the entire series.
B0050DZ8J0|3.0|I was not a fan of linkedin . It was difficult  to delete my account from within the application. The app i found hard to navigate
B0026Q8EWW|4.0|Interesting movie regarding insurance fraud and robbing from the poor.  It's highs and lows will keep you in suspense and involved.
B001NA6096|5.0|I was curious as to the prequels of Before Midnight. Before Sunrise is the 1st in the series of 3. It kept my attention throughout... What an ending!  Now I have to rent &#34;Before Sunrise&#34;!

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Addictive is right!! I have tried several bingo games and always end up back at Bingo Blitz(BB). BB is an overall very creative game. And having a different accent in each room is genius! I've laughed so hard while in Tokyo, that I missed a bingo! The game has purpose too. Completing rooms, awards and crowns.<br />I gave it 3 stars because:<br />  1)Changes to the power-ups was devastating. Power-ups are soooo much slower than any other bingo game out there. And not being allowed to purchase the power-ups you NEED is horrible. Allowing the system to select what Power-ups you should get, instead of having an even \\"arsenal\\" throws the game out of wack. The POWER UP SCREEN says I have:<br />  ZERO Instants,<br />  2 Super Charger,<br />  3 Double Daubs:,<br />  14 Double Winnings,<br />  44 XP,<br />  99+ Single Daub, 99+ Coin Square and 99+ Treasure Chests. 99+ means the program won't tell me exactly how many I have.<br />  2)You should be able to purchase ANYTHING with the coins. Currently coins can get you everything but Bingo Credits. At some point you WILL run out of something. And you should only have to deal with one currency.<br />  3)Not a super major issue but... even if you can only receive one \\"freebie\\" per day, it should be ok to request as many as you want. This allows your friends to figure out who is sending what, on a particular day.<br />  4)I understand Buffalo Studios is working on this, but the glitches are very frustrating. The game will kick you out, just as you won a htg (hard to get)item. On the Kindle this happens more often. When a number is called, you should be allowed to daub that number. There should not be a \\"GAME OVER\\" announced unless it is truly over. This is how bingo is really played.<br />  5)When you purchase credits, etc from the app store, they should be sold in a nice round number. What is 1320? How did you come up with that number? Why not sell 1400 or 1500.Show us you really appreciate our loyalty by having a credits \\"sale\\" once or twice a month.<br />And finally...Some bingo games don't allow you to see the numbers that have been called. Some games only allow you to see 2 cards when playing 4, and you have to scroll between them to daub. And although many bingo games now have \\"rooms\\" from different locations, none of them, are as organized and put together as BB. Keep up the good work.nce or twice a month.<br />And finally...Some bingo games don't allow you to see the numbers that have been called.

0062255657|5.0|It has been some time since Neil Gaiman handed over a novel for adults. You'd have to go back to 2005 for ANANSI BOYS to find the last one. Since then, he's been busy with kids books, film adaptations and television. He says he escaped to Florida thinking to write a sequel to AMERICAN GODS. What came out of him instead was the beautiful, chilling and bittersweet THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE.<br /><br />Our narrator is a grown man, making his way through a funeral on autopilot. Needing to get away from it all, he drives. He leads his car to his old haunts, driving past what was the spot where his old house once stood when he was seven, and bringing himself to stop at the end of the lane, where 11-year-old Lettie Hempstock lived with her mother and grandmother. And where Lettie showed him the small duck pond she insisted was an ocean.<br /><br />There, on the shores of the water, our narrator begins to recall his youth, and the horrors and wonders that occurred when he was seven. Things he had long forgotten begin to rise to the surface and gaps start filling in his memory --- memories of loss, heartache, friendship, magic and fear.<br /><br />THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE is a glorious work. Reading through it, you can find hints of AMERICAN GODS in the timelessness of the three Hempstock women, and you can see traces of CORALINE with the introduction of Ursula Monkton. Yet, while you can find those pieces woven into the fabric of the tale, Gaiman does what he always does: weaves magic and makes new what seems aged and familiar.<br /><br />The narrator, unnamed through the entire novel, is the perfect connection for readers, drawing on the past and on childhood memories, recalling the fears of those tender young days, and touching that part of us that has felt those same fears. He is alone, without friends, but embraces books and reads voraciously, using some of what he reads to get him out of his scrapes. He has a mistrust of grownups, and in some cases theyfrighten him. All it takes is for Lettie Hempstock and a touch of magic to change his entire life, but not without walking a dark path in return.<br /><br />The Hempstock women are solid, strong characters. At times they are humorous, while at others they turn a simple phrase that calls up a memory of long ago, which causes a smile. Lettie, in particular, is an adventurous 11-year-old, but very protective of our narrator. When she speaks, you believe her. When she tells you her pond is an ocean, you know she would not lie.<br /><br />What Gaiman excels at, and where THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE truly succeeds, is in its honest examination of youth, and the very real scariness of being such a tiny soul in a world so vast that you cannot comprehend it. Yet, ultimately, being big doesn't give you all the answers, and many times you're still just as scared. All you can do is live, and strive each and every day to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />Reviewed by Stephen Hubbard
B009XIXVU6|5.0|this book was wonderful and uplifting.  i would recommend to all as anyone can relate to the story in one way or another

B000IKQK7E|5.0|This movie is a classic, and extremely funny. This in my opinion is one of the best comedy ever made.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|World War Z is Brad Pitt's zombie epic about the spread of a virus that turns people into the undead, but instead of walking they sprint and create chaos with every step. Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who is called into action by an old friend when the human race is on the brink of extinction. While he risks his life to look for a cure, his family (with his wife Karin played by the incredible Mireille Enos) is on a US Navy Carrier out at sea. Nations fall, people turn on each other, and it seems all is lost. But, this is not the case as Gerry begins piecing together clues and starts a search that will change everything, leading to the \\"war.\\"<br /><br />WWZ is a truly impressive movie, especially considering it's a PG-13 zombie movie. While I do like the gore in a zombie film, this movie proved you don't need it. The zombies were frightening, the realistic science was there, warfare is taken into account, and overall it just felt like what would really happen if the zombie apocalypse happened. Marc Forster's directing was superb, showcasing both the epic scale of a global panic and war, while showing us the smaller battles and struggles that are happening everywhere else. This movie has the perfect transition, going from the massive blockbuster to a classic zombie movie setting. When it comes to acting, it was great. There were only two moments where the dialogue didn't quite match (when Gerry talks to Warmbrunn about the wall in Jerusalem), and even though there won't be any Awards the acting was still great. The visuals were happily polished, being more realistic, especially having both CG and practical zombies, with amazing make-up. You can see my review of the musical score on the soundtrack's page (by Marco Beltrami). But then there is the cinematography. Words cannot describe how impressive it was to see all the locations and sites, especially Jerusalem. Plus, this is only the start. WWZ kick-starts what should and can be a trilogy, just showing us the outbreak, spread and beginning struggles with the undead. There is so much more to come. World War Z is not for everyone, but anyone who appreciates well-made action movies, a thrilling epic, or some good freak-out moments, this is your treat. The beginning of a new epic, and it paid off in full
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this series - I can't wait for the next book to come out!  LOVED IT!!!<br />50 Shades of Gray was a very good series - but I liked this set better!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game I love its addicting. It gets you thinking and you find things and put them in order to solve the puzzle. I would recommend more levels for this game.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It is very glitchy.  I buy or build something &amp; when I return to the game it does not show that I bought or built anything.  The notifications seem to work, but then I return to play &amp; I have to start over.  Bummer cuz it seems like a neato game, so many things are consistent with the movie.
B003UYV08E|4.0|The only thing wrong with this movie was that there wasn't enough ScarJo!  She was only in a few short scenes, but other than that it's a quality flick if you like comic book movies, and enjoy action.  RDJ is great as Tony Stark, and very cocky/funny.
B009L7MD44|3.0|i have similar to this product which are more user friendly as well as cheaper but i must say this does do a bit more but it is features that you do not use often also a bit big compared to pqi
B005CMSDKA|4.0|The story here is excellent. What better than a teenage girl as the protagonist in an action thriller! I enjoyed the story immensely. For the most part I enjoyed the video; the quality is top notch, but some of the camera shots are a bit dizzying and disconcerting. I realize it's meant to heighten the emmotional pull of the movie, but let the story do the work. It's not like the new thing of using the 'Blair Witch Project' technique of the hand-held amateur camera shot that really turns me off.<br />If you haven't seen the movie, it's a great action thriller. I don't know how the bluray quality compares to the dvd, but it's quite awesome! I did enjoy the alternate ending and interview with Ronan. There are quite a few extras if you're into that thing. (All listed elsewhere.)<br />That's my two cents. Enjoy!
B006LQQ1GE|3.0|I bought this CD basically for one or two songs.  Nothing earth shattering about it, just play my favorite songs, that's it.

B0090KZDSK|5.0|Love this book and based solely on the book and not the waiting time for this book I loved it and didn't want it to end. Only annoyance is Eva and her wanting to be friends with Brett when she clearly knows that he wants her
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day has truely captured the essence of an erotic romance.  She allows the reader to become &#34;Entwined&#34; with the characters and makes you want more.  I hope she continues this intense relationship over and over again!
B0095P31L6|5.0|I rented this to watch with my granddaughter who was sleeping over.  She was totally captivated by the movie.  She sat through the entire video without a peep which never happens.  I would recommend this, it's a good storyline and its done very well.
B004YW4L5K|4.0|This book was an enjoyable read, but I am not quite sure of the point it was trying to make . . . in general it seems to be a critique/study of America's current gods, like the media, but I think the comparisons are often clumsy. However, it has a bit of an eerie, disconcerting feel overall which I enjoyed quite a bit. It was an enjoyable read overall.
B000YABS8E|5.0|This movie will keep you in 'stiches' laughing! Your tummy will be hurting from non-stop laughing!!!!<br /><br />If you need a 'pick me up' from feeling a little 'down'..... THIS MOVIE WILL DEFINITELY MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER!!<br /><br />Don't miss this GREAT MOVIE. So happy I found it!! I already ordered it as a gift!<br /><br />ENJOY !!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I've had trouble lately making it through books, so I was so pleased when this book held my attention and made me laugh on practically every page! Very entertaining.
B000SEI230|5.0|I have enjoyed all books written by  Nicholas Sparks as he writes of believable human issues.  This could be considered a &#34;girl&#34; book, but men would enjoy the story, if they have  a heart, or they would appreciate the lessons they would learn  here.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As usual this book didn't disappoint and was a great read just like its previous titles. I will most certainly be ready for the next one! Love the Crossfire series!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This was a very imaginative story about the introspections of a boy named Pi who struggles with staying alive on a small boat with a tiger.  I never read the book but it was recommended so I'm going to download that and read it on my Kindle.
1608871819|4.0|I was pleased with the book for the most part . The book has a beautiful textured cover and thick glossy pages with very well rendered art and super sharp photos and silver text . The book covers the characters and actors who portrayed them and includes conceptual art for some things in the film The book is not as in depth on some other aspects of the film as i would have liked but i still would say it is a must have for Man of Steel fans . At under $30 dollars on Amazon i think it is a bargain as well . Enjoy !
B0071FBARY|5.0|Great album, awesome music. Got it for one song, was happy with the entire album. A great buy, I would highly recommend.
0399255370|5.0|Award-winning writer/director of film and TV Drew Daywalt, and New York Times bestseller Oliver Jeffers, deliver an entertaining children's story that is playful, and packed with fun. This delightful story will have children laughing, reading, and sharing their own thoughts, while giving crayons a whole new meaning. The colorful, stunning illustrations come to life as each colorful crayon gives their complaint, while protesting about their color. Orange and Yellow are not speaking to each other for their own reasons, Beige doesn't want to compete with Brown,Blue is tired of coloring lots of water, and it seems that only Green has no complaints. What complaint does Black have, and will Orange and Yellow learn to compromise? A colorful solution must be met as all the complaints pile up, so that the crayons never think about calling it quits again. Poor Duncan just wants to color, and he wants his crayons to be happy. Does Duncan solve all the crayon problems, and get an A+ for coloring? There are several Dear Duncan letters to solve as children giggle their way to the end. Fascinating, inviting, and entertaining throughout. Highly recommended for teachers,parents, and child-care providers!
0375869026|5.0|This book really is special. Its a story that most kids wouldn't read. Its not about dragons or aliens or anything else supernatural. The book teaches children what its like to be different and how you should be accepting of everyone you meet. My daughter had a huge smile on her face while reading through this book. After every few pages she had to put it down to tell me every detail. I really am glad I purchased this item.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|I saw this the first time on demand and really didn't know what was in store.<br />What a wild idea, too think what if something did happen on a reality based game show, would the camera crews just disappear without telling the game show participants ?  You never see them interact with the contestants, just see them pointing the camera.<br />It's a British made show and sometimes with the accents it took looking at a scene twice to catch what was said.<br />But excellent overall.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this is a great game. it is confusing and frustrating but a great thrill when you finally figure it out. needs more levels though.  I will wait patiently.....hopefully.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Excellent series.  Very intense filmography, characters, and engaging.  Vikings is awesome!  Highly recommended.  I look forward to watching the series over and over again.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Tons of fun especially with all the suits to play with!!!<br />Definitely would recommend to ppl to play. Love playing this on my train ride to work.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love this game it is g r e a t I want to play it every moment ( if I'm not watching tv sadly I hate how this game always freezes up it drives me CRAZY sometimes it's so bad to where I can't pay:(
B000MQ58VI|5.0|My boys love this movie!  It is cute and entertaining even for the adults!  A good life lesson for all of us to remember....believe in your kids.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I would recommend this show to anyone who liked the original Stargate SG-1 or just Sci-Fi in general.  Its great for older kids, with only mild violence and no inappropriate behavior or language.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this movie. I don't remember crying this hard in a long time. I wasn't sure in the beginning of where things were headed, but once you realize what's about to happen there is just no way to stop the tears. Benedict Cumberbatch is just absolutely fabulous, and so is the rest of the cast. If you need a good cry and something to think about for a few days, this is definitely a great movie.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this and Cross Me Color. Please, developers, add puzzles more often! Varying levels of difficulty. Hours of enjoyment. It'd be nice to let players make puzzles and submit them for everyone to download.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Not my usual read.  did  he ever recognise his own symptoms  for the dessert he study.  A good result in the ene.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've been using Arctic Silver compound for over a decade. It always delivers excellent heat transfer, it doesn't deteriorate over time.<br /><br />This is the real deal. Get it.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|I really like this series of books. John Scalzi writes entertaining, fun but also serious books. I'm a big fan.
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|Great movie, my kids can't get enough of it and I love watching it with them.  This is definitely a movie to share for generations to come.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Definitely not up to the standard of the Kite Runner......parts are difficult to follow, especially if one discontinues reading for a day....
B008602KQI|5.0|I can't say that I'm a fan of sick plots where children are killing each other, but the movie was so well done, I thoroughly enjoyed it...the second time around.  The first time I saw it in the theater I found it to be quite disturbing... I had a hard time getting past the blood and gore.  The second time around, at home with a rental, I was more intrigued with the characters and the eclectic mix of lore.  It's scary to think that our world could advance so much as to wisk along on a 200 mph high speed train with children that are taken from human prison camps that mimic life before Christ into a city full of very colorful, hungry citizens that enjoy creating a playing field for these children to fight each other to the death.  It seemed so silly at times. Talk show host style coverage of the &#34;games&#34; that were orchestrated by a roomful of technicians amped up the excitement by using virtual images that came to life.  It was over-the-top and ridiculous in some ways but still managed to keep a strong human element. When Rue's father witnessed the death of his daughter it actually made me cry.
B008220DIC|5.0|I don't know exactly what it is about this film, but I love it. The visuals are stunning of course, I originally saw it in 65mm and it was incredible. The blu-ray version seems to have retained that beautiful image although I can't be sure as I don't have a 30' screen to watch it on.<br />This film isn't for everyone, but the acting and direction are strange and wonderful, and together with the beautiful images make for a magical experience.
B00000255F|5.0|This is a great Bruce Springsteen album.  It has several of my all-time favorite Springsteen songs, including Born to Run, Thunder Road, and She's The One.
B000SEJHRA|4.0|I've never picked up a book by David Sedaris, but I was looking for something light to read during a month in Europe.  I have a bunch of friends who love his work and enjoyed this book.  I will definitely order another book by this author soon.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|So far so good, up to level 10.  It's a fun game with increasing difficulty. Challenging without being distracting. I've been tempted to look up cheats but persisting and solving it has been rewarding.<br />.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I really liked this movie. There was parts that was really funny. But great fan movie<br />Try it. Karla Febus
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great songs. Good talent. Everybody should hear these. Some songs should be released for radio to play! I recommend it.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|im a big twitch fan and I got so exited for this I watch people who tell you if a stream is happening and I can never ever find them I would say it would be barely half decent with a search function but right nowise absulutly bate it
B003EYVXTQ|3.0|This movie gives a good impression of the South during the time period projected. It held my interest well and I will watch again.
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|I have been a fan since day one... This album by far is my favorite.... They did a fantastic job on it! I am hoping that the main stream will embrace them again...but knowing that they are STILL putting out music for their true fans is nothing short of an honor to listen to. Thank you Hanson!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|looks good and easy way to calc fractions.  good concept as I haven't seen anything similar out there.  Good for baking, school, etc...i would recommend this app!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I got this app so I could search the internet more easily.<br />It seems to work ok for me and I am happy with it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book!  Love the series.  Can't wait for the next book to come out.  Better than Fifty Shades of Grey.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I got this app to be able to see files on my kindle fire in a manner more similar to windows.<br />I works fine.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I love this movie, it's one of my favorites. Great fun to watch for both adults and children. It's really great to watch Gru change and grow by the help of these three little girls. Vector cracks me up every time I watch it!
1936608898|4.0|Interesting defense for the theory of the Paleo Diet.  I am putting the concept to the test and getting results!
B002OR0RP0|5.0|The most enjoyable film in this series with a very good storyline about dinos.  The graphics and voices are terrific.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The development, suspense, intrigue and emotions are forever allowing one to get caught up in the plot and unfolding of the story.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|A near-masterpiece of science fiction film making and one that will be studied and analyzed many years from now.  Lots of ideas are presented and the execution is remarkable.  Part II will have a lot to live up to.
B0035LJY6C|2.0|Very disappointed. It seemed as though the director took a 30 min TV episode and stretched it into a full length movie. Very boring.
B00005KAQP|5.0|I first saw this delightful video while working in Kenya and saw beyond the humor the creative adaptation of someone thrown into a foreign environment.  The beloved of her world adapts, as seen in the songs, to create a new message and deep relationships.  I love it!
B00028491G|2.0|The information that this dvd only played in certain areas would have been more helpful at the top of the screen.  I look at the seller's rating, but do not always read their whole page.  Money lost, lesson learned.
0767903374|5.0|If you buy the book don't buy the work book.  It's a duplicate, I find that either or would be helpful. I plan to sell mine back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. its FUN ENTERTAINING ITS JUST AWESOME..!!!! YOU SHOULD REALLY DOWNLOAD THIS APP ITS OUTSTANDING!! GET IT!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|So much fun....I wished it were true!  Better than any pirate story with some real scary stuff thrown in just for fun.  I held my breath more with each chapter
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game stinks all you guys who have are a bunch of losers it stinks even for free waste of money if you think I'm wrong tell me at the bottom of mine I know the people who made my cousin is the one who made no joke if you do believe me I'll ask my cousin to make it better if you don't I'll make sure it's not a game and more I'll just text her on my iPhone the new on or email on my iPad or kindle fire it is kinda cool this out to you peeps got it think you do oh and check me out on youtube or Twitter to my best friend save Bearden all right so coll game only two star though minecraft and worldcraft and survivelcraft are awesome games  that's what I think oh and watch silencer 775 on youtube he's pretty cool
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Why isn't this two year old movie included in Amazon Prime? I will keep this in mind when renewal comes along.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|This is just a gripping, monumental movie that anyone who loves music, people, or just movies in general will love.  It's both happy and sad.  The music is amazing.  This rings true to the saying that truth is stranger than fiction.  What an incredible story and an incredible man.  It's humbling to watch this and it's moving and inspiring.  Wow.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed the book like the preceeding two, except it doesn't end, it only leaves you in suspense awaiting the next book. Previous books were complete themselves.
B005LAIGLO|3.0|DVD WAS TOO DARK IN SOME AREAS.  I WAS GOING TO THE DVD RETURN,  BUT THE RETURN WINDOW HAD EXPIRED...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love these games! hope for more levels asap! great time waster! easy enough you don't get too frustrated and go looking for cheats!
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|This is Bowie after all.  So I am trying to play and replay this CD to familiarise myself with the lyrics etc.<br />Some of the songs seem very similar to each other.  Interesting sound effects, but at this point, &#34;Heathen&#34;<br />is still a much more interesting and better CD.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I never had a thing for horse games before, but after I downloaded my horse, it was really fun. It looks so realistic!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Thought I would read book after seeing movie. And while I really liked World War Z movie, the book and film have very little in common. I hope for next film, they use some of the great imagery and details from the book. I hope there is a follow up fir both mediums
B0062QRTKA|2.0|This game is supper cute and fun but it freezes on you and has to be force closed. I had to take it off my kindle fire.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I love documentaries and this one hit the nail on the head for the FOO FIGHTERS.  Great story, tells how each member got started in life, and how they joined together.  MUST have for any FF fan.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was very far in the game and had just beat my high score when it froze up on my Kindle Fire HD. I had to re-download the game and all of my game status was erased!!! Not at all happy!
B003XUKVXK|5.0|Best live CD I own, besides Nirvana - Unplugged in New York of course ;).  Great sound, professionally done.  Tons of tracks.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This game is so awesome! But I miss the bonus waves from the first one. They gave me a chance to get extra charms :/
B005FHXB0O|5.0|There was something in this movie for everyone...romance, comedy , a ton of action and more blood then i needed to see but it was an excellent movie..will watch it again..!!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Diamond Dash is a great game once u start its hard to stop as special when you are playing against a friend or friends This is one game you will love to play So enjoy it I am..
B0094K20FK|5.0|I loved watching this movie again.  It was a lot of fun.  I know in today's age of high tech scifi movie making this movie looks a little cheesy, but you have to love the old Star Trek!
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I'm a big star gazing buff. I have been looking for a good app for my Nexus and gave this a try. Well unless i was looking straight down or straight up all it would do is look south. I could barely get it to go far enough east to see the Moon (00:00 CST tonight), and if I turned to the north it would just flip back to a southern view. App looked great so for those that it works for good on you. I will just have to keep looking.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I grew up watching the Star Trek series and never thought I would be able to watch any other people play the characters, however, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I really like this movie, kind of original thematic with a dressing of a some action backed by great performance
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I liked this movie.  It wasn't the funniest movie I have ever seen, but I would recommend it.  I would use the word &#34;okay&#34; to describe it.
B00BB3UYS8|3.0|Because it needs a professional editor. Other than that, loved the read- had no idea it was going to end up on Mount Shasta, where I live!!!!! Now I must know more :)
B00BHU261S|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It was interesting and surprising to see the story behind Psycho.  I would recommend this movie.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|A young man (Nicholas Coster-Waldau), distraught at the 2008 economic collapse, guns down his ex-wife and kidnaps his two young daughters, dragging them to a deserted cabin in the woods, planning to kill them and himself in a horrendous murder/suicide. But before he can enact that horror, he is dispatched by some strange, supernatural force residing in the house. Flash-forward five years when the girls are finally discovered by the killer's twin brother and brought back to civilization, having been \\"raised\\" by whoever or whatever it is that resides in the place. Needless to say, the girls are a mess psychologically, but that's only half the problem that the uncle and his girlfriend (Jessica Chastain) face in trying to re-acclimate the children to life in the real world.<br /><br />\\"Mama\\" is a horror movie with a lot of elaborate bells-and-whistles but not a great deal of originality or insight. For beneath all the fancy genre trappings - the creaking boards, the creepy voices on the soundtrack, the half-glimpsed figures in the background, the high-tech CGI effects - it's still just the same old hooey about the spirit who simply can't rest until some personal injustice from the past has been rectified and who believes that scaring the bejeezus out of the living will somehow bring that outcome about.<br /><br />Yet, despite a really dopey finale, the scare tactics work reasonably well for most of the duration, and the movie succeeds in developing and sustaining a creepy atmosphere thanks to the direction of Andy Muschietti and the cinematography of Antonio Riestra. And Megan Charpentier and Isabelle Nelisse are very good indeed as the haunted youngsters.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|After waiting FOREVER for this book (several changes in the release date). I was very unhappy to get to the end and find out the story was not over.  If the love scenes were cut back a bit the story could have been completed in this book.  Just aggravated!!!!!
B004478AS4|4.0|... but otherwise, what a wonderful story, excellent view of a world I have never had the privilege to visit.  And the bigger social issues of change over time and generational disconnects are beautifully woven into this simple tale.  Many difficult scenes are delivered clearly and void of emotion.  It's a feature of Achebe's writing -- and perhaps whole culture -- that I will seek out again.  As a reader, I was kept alert through the entire novel because there was no normal American fiction template at play.  What felt like foreshadowing of a potentially terrible moment often softened into a scene of comfortable domestic ritual.  So too, a terrible event might spring from nowhere to throw the unguarded reader completely off.  The novel requires a certain amount of open-mindedness in reading it, and I think the pay-off is well worth it.  Looking forward to reading another of this remarkable writer's books.  Lucky students at Brown to have had him as their instructor!
1490313370|4.0|I started to read articles by James on Quora and I enjoy a majority of his work. This book was a decent read and had some good pointers in there. IMHO, this book is not a game changer but found it to be motivating in some areas regarding entrepreneurship, getting more sleep, and just getting shit done and cutting out the BS.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the reviews on this book but I'm sure some people will find it to be your typical self-help book and that's true to a degree. It repeats what others have been pushing for ages. However, James can be funny and has more of a personal way of speaking to the reader instead of \\"Do this, do that, and you'll be this\\" information.<br /><br />I suggest reading the book for yourself and seeing what it is all about. You'll get some valuable knoweldge out of it. If you don't like it, you're losing an hour or two of your time from reading it. There is my .02.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I like the way the Hulk saves the day! I would watch it again. I told my kids to watch it and they liked it too.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Wow do you have to have a light touch on the gas and it is so easy to flip over!  It's a challenge and fun.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Great season & quality. Purchased while waiting for the season to be released on Netflix. Very glad I did. Matt Weiner did great with this series!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was well worth the time and lifted my spirits.<br />I would recommend the book and I know you will enjoy it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I simply cannot wait for the 4th and 5th books of this series. The quality of these books keeps getting better and better. Still hooked!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can you Escape is a challanging and fun game. and its hard to put down. I couldn't wait to see the next room and find the clues!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this because I read 50 Shades of Grey, like most other readers & reviewers. I give this 5 stars and 5 stars to the entire Crossfire series because I am absolutely a huge fan of these characters. Eva is a headstrong, driven, and independent woman, whereas Ana in the 50 Shades trilogy just didn't have enough of a backbone for me. These characters are very developed and the story line is very deep (& dark). Sylvia definitely does her research and has a niche for writing addicting books!! Thank you Sylvia!
B00B769XB8|5.0|This movie is great. We watched it on Father's Day.  It was a great pizza and relax day!!  Watch it!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|He is a master storyteller, and this is a luminous, intriguing, complex book filled with characters who emerge and then disappear, only to re-emerge later.  But in the end, it's all about a small group of people whose lives intersect in ways you will NOT be prepared for.  I love this book, and this author.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|More detailed history than I have ever known about Henry the VIII.  If you like historical fiction this is for you. Spicy tales of the decadent English nobility.  Well done TV series.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but it's hard to get keys and towers other than that it's an awesome game it's fun and cool
0545157617|4.0|It was so cute and darling to anthropomorphize a piece of wood. You were rooting for him all the way.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|An inspirational book filled with common sense. I found that it described my situation and helped me get out of my own morass.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|There are a lot of these games out there but this was by far my favorite.  It wasn't so hard you give up but hard enough to be fun.  Only complaint is there aren't more rooms yet.  Great game!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Awesome and fitting end for the trilogy. I really enjoyed these books, I couldn't put this one down. My heart goes out to those<br /> who had to participate in those games.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|A friend had me listen to Darius's new song Wagon Wheel and I loved it.  I then had to get this CD.  He is a fantastic singer and I recommend this CD .  I love the songs on this CD.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|I love this app but after a while of not using it, when I try to open it it is black and closes! PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!
B001BR7CZW|5.0|Defiantly a classic in my eyes. I wish they still mad movies like this. That and the cast for this movie was great. A must watch movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the characters; I like all the obstacles - it is challenging, and  it is an addicting game to play!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved it to me it was helpful to have this dictionary around for the rough times .my life's story
B00BGZ8TVA|2.0|When I purchased this item, I was trying to buy the DVD.  Instead it was placed in a video library and the only way that I can watch it is on the computer.  I have a large screen TV and was looking forward to watching it on the TV.  Since my Amazon account has been charged for the price of a DVD, I would like to have the DVD.  I have not yet watched it on the computer, so I don't know if it is a good movie or not.  I don't like watching on the computer because of buffering.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|alsome and cool<br />close to me for this I pass my starr test then I loved reading so then today was alson
B000JQU4TW|4.0|I've read this book before but found that I only remembered the highlights so it was worth a fresh read.  It was worth revisiting.  It is a book dealing with good vs. evil and how the subtle changes of each choice we make impacts us and our future choices.  It has a wonderful, surprising ending.<br /><br /> Is beauty only skin deep?  Read this.  Then  you decide.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome but not like the Xbox nice graphics you should get it 7 bucks i though that it was going to be bad but its not
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like the story line. The game has great graphics and you don't just move the pieces to make 3 but at the end of each city you have to put the pieces you collect where they need to go
0307455874|1.0|In full disclosure, I did not read the book, and I'll tell you why.<br /><br />When a man, ALREADY A SENATOR, says he believes there are about 57 to 58 states in the United States of America, he drops down to the level of a moron. Knowing that there are 100 Senators in the Senate, and that there can only be 2 senators per state, what kind of a moron becomes a Senator thinking we have more than 50 states??<br /><br />In any profession, there are simply certain BASIC mistakes you are NOT allowed to make. Imagine an English teacher who tells his class there are 30 letters in the alphabet. Who would respect such an English teacher?
0810993139|5.0|The book came in excellent condition and it is a good read for my daughter. She loves these books. k
B00847KFDS|4.0|Fogerty can still wail, both vocally and on the guitar. This is awesome fun with a cast of guests artists.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have not played this, but bought for my 10 yr old.  He loves it and spends much time creating things on it.  Engages his creative energy in a positive way.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book did something extremely necessary; it gave me great insight into how I communicate, and helped me understand what I want and need from others.<br /><br />I will say that the organization of the book is great, each chapter making good sense and helping clarify how to apply the knowledge given. The test at the end was interesting as I registered with almost three languages instead of just the typical two.<br /><br />If you are having any sort of conflicts in your relationships, or just want to learn more about yourself from the sense of how you express love and affection, this book can be incredibly useful.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a really fun and spooky game that i am really enjoying. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fun distraction.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game.However I do wish u could add others from the social group as neighbors. Very addicting :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this has been great fun playing this game.  enjoy having to really think it out.  keeping the gray matter ALIVE!
B002S0OBMS|4.0|&#34;Love Never Dies&#34; was a great follow up to its predecessor, &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34;. Fantastic songs, my favorites being &#34;Til I Hear You Sing&#34;, &#34;The Beauty Underneath&#34;, and &#34;Devil Take the Hindmost&#34;. It even has the speaking parts, so it's practically the whole entire musical and you can easily picture what's happening. My only complaint is that it's the London cast, and not the Australian. If you've seen the DVD that was performed on stage with Ben Lewis and Anna O'Byrne and know it by heart like I do, the soundtrack is totally different. Different lyrics and notes are slided in the songs, which really catches me off guard. I guess the notes are to be expected, considering it is performed by different people, but still. Honestly, I prefer Mr. Lewis and Ms. O'Byrne to Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess. Lewis has a much richer, deeper, powerful, silkier voice, which really brings the Phantom's character to life, and you can hear all of it in &#34;Til I Hear You Sing&#34;. Likewise, O'Byrne has a warmth and maturity in her voice which really helps in her role as a mother. You can hear the smile in her voice when she sings &#34;Look With Your Heart&#34; and the love gentleness that she has with her ten year-old son. In comparison, Boggess has a little-girl quality, and is rather cold and unfeeling. Lifeless. She's just...singing. Sure, it's pretty, but O'Byrne just blows the role of Christine out of the water. I bought this simply so I could listen to it on the go, but constantly find myself irritated that they chose to film one cast and record another one. If they had chosen to record AND film the SAME cast (preferably the Australian one) I'd give it 5 stars, easily. Still, it's a splendid story and it's nice to listen to it as I drive.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved this series. However, the non- ending was bittersweet. I was left with the feeling of needing more because I had so many thoughts on who would blackmail Gideon, & where the other characters were going in their lives. I'm excited for the next book ( heard there were actually<br />5) but So frustrated to have to wait<br />so long in between. I forget a lot of<br />the storyline and then have to review<br />while trying to read the current book..<br />please HURRY and get the next one out.

0451450523|5.0|Love the story of the last Unicorn. Gave this to my 6 year old niece as a present. She's an advanced reader. I was hoping for more pictures since she is pretty young, but it's worked out well. I thought my sister could read it too her if it was a bit too much. So far she's handling it on her own and loves it! Great classic story read :)
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|i really liked the book, but was disapointed in how it ended, to abrupt. I hope they have the next book out soon.

0061711292|5.0|I had read this novel before, almost 40 years ago. I considered it excellent both readings, but this time I saw it through different eyes.<br /><br />Miss Jean Brodie is a woman \\"in her prime,\\" a teacher of pre-pubescent girls in a private school in Scotland. Unconventional and charming, she favors six young girls in her class as the \\"creme de la creme,\\" and they become known as the \\"Brodie set.\\" The narrative follows them through their school years and beyond, telling of the results of Miss Brodie's influence.<br /><br />This is one of the most skillfully developed books I have ever read, as it effortlessly switches from one period of time to another, so that it early becomes known that one of the \\"set\\" ultimately betrays Miss Brodie. The question becomes the \\"who\\" and \\"why.\\" The novel is also brilliant in the subtle way it inserts humor into what is essentially a very serious subject.<br /><br />This novel spoke to me in an entirely different way this reading. When I first read it in the '70s my focus of attention was on the six girls and the effects a charismatic teacher had upon them. This time, probably because I had recently taught for several years, I was made uncomfortably aware of the terrible responsibility of a teacher toward young students, wondering if I, myself, had abused the power given, as Miss Brodie did.<br /><br />Teachers are in the unique position of having a captive audience who are obliged to listen. A skillful teacher with the right personality can use this to advantage to excite interest and enthusiasm in the subject matter or in learning in general. A self-absorbed and egotistical teacher can abuse his or her position by influencing students in other ways, encouraging a \\"cult of personality.\\" Parents should beware of those. I hope I was not one of them, but there exists, indeed, a powerful temptation to become such a teacher.<br /><br />This novel was included on both the Modern Library Top 100 and the Time Top 100 novel lists. It is short, easy to read, can be viewed from more than one viewpoint, and is wonderfully accomplished in execution. Highly recommended.
B00BBA6FMU|5.0|There are already many stories about the horrible time of slavery in the USA, but this one is so readable and entertaining, that it is a book for all ages, from teens to the elderly!<br />The main character Lavinia, can get a bit irritating by her placid nature, especially towards the end, but you can not put the book down, and the story leaves a deep impression, one that stays with you for quite a while.
B00012FXAE|5.0|This second installment takes the original to the next level.  Enjoyed the action sequence involving the military and the surroundings set in the future.  This one is the best of the series.  It goes down hill on the next two films.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I'm not sure if I would call Steve Jobs a great man. In my opinion, a great man treats others with respect and dignity. Neither of which would ever be used to describe Jobs. However, his contribution to our way of life is un-deniable and arguably genius.<br />This in spite of constant opposition in every aspect of his accomplishments.<br />This is an amazing book about an amazing man.

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|To me this is a different Purple. A more mature band. This is more a Steve Morse and Don Airy cd than the old style. If you like what they have done since Blackmore left then you will like this. It's different but at the same time it's not. You just have to listen to it. Excelent musicianship.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book is probably the best of the series... fast paced, thrilling and giving us the adventures we're used to from George Martin. Can't wait for the winds of winter
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|This book was so poorly written I can't get over it.  Not only was the style like that of a teenage girl, there were typos throughout.  From mistakes in plural nouns and possessive nouns on nearly every page, to the wrong word used in many phrases \\"adrenaline cursing through her veins\\" instead of coursing.  Really? I have no idea how this was ever published. The mistakes were distracting but maybe that was good because the writing itself was terrible.  It was at adolescent in style and I'm a girl who likes a cheesy mystery romance. This was well beyond cheesy. There was no mystery. And the writing was choppy and made every character seem not only unbelievable but like they lack intelligence.
B00CS7CGX2|5.0|I've been VW fan since Contra, but this is just fell in love at first sight with Diane Young but once i heard the whole album wow !<br />On my top 5 of the year.<br />Besides, the heavyweight white vinyl sounds amazing ! the poster with the lyrics is of the greatest quality and it comes with an mp3 download, for what more can you ask?

0345495004|4.0|I liked this book as the fictionalized sections had to do with feelings, emotions, and conversations rather than wholesale rewriting of events. The true story is gripping, and the book is well-written and builds up a good head of steam towards the ending. If you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan you will want to read it; if you aren't familiar with him or his story it still makes good chick lit.

B0041OT9W6|5.0|I downloaded and re-read this book after visiting the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam, the Annex where she hid out until her betrayal and arrest.<br />It was eerie seeing the same neighborhood sights, hearing the same church bells that she wrote about.  I really don't think you can appreciate her precocious insight and the poignancy of this book unless you are reading it as a father of a teenage daughter.<br />&#34;A voice in me screams: go outside,&#34; she wrote after years of claustrophobic isolation.  It must have been like living in a submarine.  &#34;Not being able to go outside upsets me more than I can say, and I’m terrified our hiding place will be discovered and that we’ll be shot. That, of course, is a fairly dismal prospect.&#34;<br />&#34;In the evenings when it’s dark, I often see long lines of good, innocent people, accompanied by crying children, walking on and on, ordered about by a handful of men who bully and beat them until they nearly drop. No one is spared. The sick, the elderly, children, babies and pregnant women—all are marched to their death... I feel wicked sleeping in a warm bed, while somewhere out there my dearest friends are dropping from exhaustion or being knocked to the ground. I get frightened myself when I think of close friends who are now at the mercy of the cruelest monsters ever to stalk the earth. And all because they’re Jews.&#34;<br />She tried to imagine a postwar world but it became increasingly difficult. &#34;I simply can't imagine the world will ever be normal again for us,&#34; she wrote on 8 November 1943.  &#34;I do talk about 'after the war' but it's as if I were talking about a castle in the air, something that can never come true.&#34;<br />Yet the striking thing about the diary is its banality, how life went on despite the terror beyond the secret annex.  After a fight with her father in March 1944 she wrote him a letter declaring &#34;You must not and cannot regard me as 14. I've grown older because of all the misery.&#34;<br />She even learned shorthand through a weekly correspondence course (in one of her helper's names of course):  &#34;I’m also working away at my shorthand, which I enjoy. Of the three of us, I’ve made the most progress.&#34;<br />She had an innocent, child's sort of faith, although she admitted not knowing why those who seemed as devout as anyone (she was from a liberal, assimilated family) were dying:  &#34;I can’t help her [a friend who had been arrested but would ironically survive]. I can only stand by and watch while other people suffer and die. All I can do is pray to God to bring her back to us...Dear God, I have everything I could wish for, while fate has her in its deadly clutches. She was as devout as I am, maybe even more so, and she too wanted to do what was right. But then why have I been chosen to live, while she’s probably going to die? What’s the difference between us? Why are we now so far apart?&#34;  She had survivor's guilt yet the irony of course was that her survival was not assured.  &#34;God has not forsaken me, and He never will,&#34; she wrote four months before she was to be arrested and less than a year before she would die.<br />On 4 August 1944 at 10:30 am following a tip from someone whose identity remains unknown, she and her family were arrested by three Dutch agents and an Austrian SS officer.<br />They were sent to Auschwitz but as the Russian troops approached, Anne and her sister were transferred to Bergen-Belsen.<br />Otto Frank, her father, was the only one of those in hiding to survive.

B0052REUW0|5.0|I heard Steven Pinker by chance on Ted Talks radio and was fascinated with what he had to say - that contrary to popular belief, a belief sustained by a 24-7 news cycle, the ability to capture the most graphic of violence now on camera, and recency bias, violence has been on the decline and dramatically so.  This book proves in great detail what I have always suspected.  Indeed, our revulsion toward violence, especially institutionalized violence such as slavery or war or the death penalty, demonstrates an exponential increase in our capacity for moral outrage.  As other authors have noted, we should not be as shocked by the existence of slavery in West (virtually all societies had some form of slavery) as by its sudden international abolition not by revolt of the slaves but revulsion of the slaveholders and others who saw it as morally wrong.  Even the attempts to prohibit abortion reflect a dramatic broadening of the definition of life now - among some - to include potential life and reflect a squeamishness about disrupting pregnancies that most certainly did not exist anywhere in the bible, as the author so painstakingly establishes.  Vegetarianism is motivated at least in part by a broadening of compassion beyond the suffering and death of members of our own species.  Something has happened and what that thing is is very important to explore and understand because (in my mind, if not the author's), it maybe very fragile and reversible.  Violence comes in waves or outbursts and then for whatever reason the spigot is turned off again and people who yesterday were murdering each other now live in peace (witness France and Germany today who have never been at peace with each other and the rest of their European neighbors for so long).<br />His exploration of the rampant condoned cruelty and violence throughout the Bible and Grimm's Fairy Tales was dead on.  His point maybe not that these texts are so savage but that our modern sensibilities find them so, a development that occurred independently of - and in opposition to - religious instruction or inspiration.<br />Read this book if you need some hope that our species is - despite all the seeming evidence to the contrary - behaving on balance in a far more humane way to each other than at any point in our history.nt that occurred independently of - and in opposition to - religious instruction or inspiration.<br />Read this book if you need some hope that our species is - despite all the seeming evidence to the contrary - behaving on balance in a far more humane way to each other than at any point in our history.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Short and sweet review without spoilers.  Absolutely loved this series.  I'm an adult who didn't like the movie.  Could not put down this series.  I think I read the whole thing in a weekend.  It's long, detailed, well written.  Characters are flawed, not perfect, and well developed.  Amazing series, amazing author.  I typically like mystery thrillers like Mary Higgins Clark, Lisa Jackson, James Patterson.  Suzanna Collins could easily become a favorite.
B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver achieved fame for his stunningly accurate election predictions based on quantitative, statistical analysis of streams of available data, weighted for reliability and accuracy.  If you were hoping for a tell-all book about how he did this, you might be disappointed, and in fact if you are looking for reassurance that those in the prediction business are on balance successful (they are not) or taken to task when they are not (nope), then this is not your book.  What he does do more than anything is express extraordinary humility, admitting that predicting elections is different from predicting earthquakes or recessions, for example, and that it maybe that certain phenomena we may never be able to reliably predict.  One thing he hammers home is that the accuracy of past predictions does not seem to inhibit people from continuing to make them - and forcefully - with no apparent feedback loop by themselves or people who pay for their predictions, especially in areas such as finance or politics.  Included in the book is an excellent review of the dismal track record of seismologists as well as a solid chapter on global warming that should be required reading for everyone (he demonstrates that the available evidence overwhelmingly supports anthropogenic climate change and that past predictions by those warning of the effects of rising CO2 levels have generally been pretty accurate).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book.  First I should say I'm an adult who wasn't a fan of the movie but wanted to read the series anyway.  I could not put it down.  Amazing.  I tore through all 3 of them in a bit more than a weekend.  So amazingly well written.  I found Katniss to be believable.  Not the most likeable but understandably so.  I found many of the characters to not be as in depth as say Harry Potter's characters but the focus was much more on the concept and Panem.  In this conclusion, I felt I had no loose ends waiting to be tied up.  Everything reached a happy ending.  I didn't end the book feeling miserable and like all I did was cry for hours.  For the most part it was less emotional than the previous books in this series.  Suzanne Collins could easily become a favorite author.  This series kept me hooked for hours and when I was doing something else over the weekend, I wanted to rush back to read more.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The interface with the internet is priceless, allowing updates from multiple devices or your PC to become available everywhere, all the time, on demand.  The synching algorithm seems robust and works in the background.  I like the ability to jot down notes on anything when they occur to me, then organize them later, or to dump a large document needing to be edited into Evernote then edit it on my tablet or Kindle with all editions showing up everywhere else.  Searchable, sortable, and filterable.

B005HJWWW8|5.0|If your looking for a simple yet effective headphone amplifier for a low price, you can't go wrong with these.  The size makes it so much more portable than other amplifiers, and thus easy to take everywhere I go. I use these with Sony MDR-V6's, which don't really need a lot of power to start with, but this just makes the V6's so much better.  The selectable EQ settings work well, and there's four of them:<br /><br />1. Flat response (no LED)<br />2. Bass boost (Red LED)<br />3. Bass and treble boost (Blue LED)<br />4. Supression for high input (Purple LED)<br /><br />I toggle between setitngs 1-3 all the time depending on what I'm listening to.  The settings are very distinct and useable.  I typically get about 10hours of use on one charge.<br /><br />Great value for money, and kudos to FiiO for making a useable and affordable product.  If you just want something that works, and don't want to splurge on the more expensive offerings out there, you can't go wrong with this.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A nice puzzle game, goes really fast. Not to difficult,good for wasting time. Only made it ten levels so far, wouldn't mind if it were more difficult.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I still believe that the first &#34;Mission: Impossible&#34; movie was the best of the franchise, but &#34;Ghost Protocol&#34; was still worth watching. The fast-paced action that is a trademark of the &#34;M:I&#34; movies is there even if at times it's a bit beyond belief. But then again, isn't going to the movies a person's opportunity to suspend reality?
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I am just amazed at all the options. It's like I am actually playing a real piano. I need a lot of practice but it so enjoyable. My 4 year old niece loves it. She's even learning faster than I am! I'm still not sure about all the settings. Took the tutorial and it was so fast I couldn't keep up. But I will keep practising.
B008M34INW|2.0|GET THE GRINGO is all about Mel Gibson who tries his best at charming us with wit, humor and providing some edge. Gibson tries to plough through in a slow paced story with a weak plot. The primary action comes from the few gunfight scenes in prison.<br />Not one of Gibson's best performances.

B007FH9GA6|1.0|I have not read the book so please realize that my opinion of this film is based on what I viewed.<br /><br />My first thought after watching this film was, \\"How could they have screwed up the movie this badly?\\" The filmmakers had a fine mystery tale in their hands, yet they attempt to vamp it up with Swedish nihilistic ethically vapid characters combined with sexual violence--graphic rape and sodomy. It appeared to be a modern day tale yet the protagonists were the anti-hero types of the 60's/70's movie genre. The hero and heroine were more like dogs in heat than dogs on the trail to finding a murderer.<br /><br />Lastly, the most improbable glaring inconsistency in the film was how a dysfunctional girl, who engages in sex for money, is able to steal 2,000,000,000 euros. She can steal from banks without being caught, but rather than do that, she first performs sexual acts in order to live. Simply unbelievable...

B005GY0Y8S|3.0|Elise disappears in Paris, France.  Her parents never contact the Paris police.  Never hire a certified PI to find her and do not know what Elise's daughter looks like.  Elise's parents pay an unknown person $15,000 to steal a child that they have no proof is Elise's daughter.  Maggie, Elise's sister, goes to Paris to get her niece.  She falls in love with Laurent, who has no legitimate means of financial support.  Maggie goes back to the U.S. and no letters from Laurent who has promised to write.  Laurent shows up unannounced and announces that he is moving in with her.  For real.  Maggie's father likes Laurent.  The only thing Laurent seems to have going for him is he can cook.  Maggie later finds out that Laurent is Elise' boyfriend's half brother.  He has lied and confessed to stealing a child and defrauding her parents and Maggie still allows him to stay with her.  Please!  In the midst of all of this, Elise is murdered, as well as another woman, and the police don't have a clue and doesn't appear interested in getting a clue.  Maggie plays PI.  And, the author throws around a lot of French dialogue.  I didn't dislike the book but I didn't like it either.

B00005B36H|5.0|There is a saying in the music industry that an album is &#34;all killer and no filler&#34; meaning they didn't fill the record with crap just to fill it.  Well, you can say the same thing about &#34;Lateralus&#34;.  Nothing is wasted and everything means something.  What that something is is relative and it is up to the user to figure that out, but every note and word on this has a purpose.  it is also the next step in the evolution that Tool takes both as a group and as individuals that started with Opiate and move through 10,000 Days.  While each cut is good on its own, take the time to Listen to the entire disc in its entirety uninterrupted, if you can, as it has a flow to it.  there is alot to hear and with each successive listen, you'll hear more and more.  There are alot of layers and they all fit together like some sonic jigsaw puzzle.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|This movie is still on tv now, as much as I really like the movie and because I really watch sify movies once I saw this it would of been better if this movie had a different ending. Why cause it was so like Alien. And I have all the Alien movies, now because this movie is still on tv I haven't opened the movie yet. So this is a must have for me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good thing I didn't read all the reviews before I read it.  Thanks goes to my husband who insisted I read it during our vacation.  I could not put the book done.  I was intrigued by the sex but romanced by the love story.  I couldn't wait to read all three books.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Great movie this movie is on tv now & I watch it almost every time. Although I really haven't watched the DVD. It's just a movie I had to have for my collection.

Although I have seen this movie when it was on tv long time ago, it was only now that I saw this and had to have it. What was really even more great when I purchased this movie I was given a gift to watch this movie threw streaming. Great movie
B007T99ENE|2.0|I really wanted to like this book, but was disappointed. I enjoyed Atonement and was expecting that same level of satisfaction. I thought the book was flat in parts and the characters dreary. Even the twist at the end wasn't enough to change my mind.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Not as intense as the first 2 but still a great read and definitely leaves you wanting more of the story. Looking forward to the next 2 books.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved the book. I started to notice things left and right! It's a very quick and informative read. I think it would be a great book for teens with low self worth. People can be harsh but that's why we have things like this to help us remember we are amazing!
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is the best game a I ever got I got. lots of dragons its very cool its grate
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is without a doubt the absolute best book i have ever read. Bram Stoker masterfully wrote this. A heroic tale about a group of friends doing what is necessary. Life lessons to be learned and with this book being free, there is no better deal.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Sometimes it utterly amazes me what humans are capable of.  I am not just talking about Shin, but also talking about a system created by humans that brought about this story.<br /><br />It also amazes me that people can be so insensitive in South Korea to the fate of their fellow Koreans to the North simply because it might make their lives a little more uncomfortable.<br /><br />Power corrupts human nature, but so does affluence.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a great game to play.  It was not too hard or too easy.  My 4th grade  son and I enjoyed going through the different steps in each level, Only down side is that when I played it, there were only 10 levels available.

Women are in the most danger when they are trying to leave the abusers.<br /><br />So naturally when an abused (punched and slapped around) wife arrives in her divorce lawyer's office for a meeting with the husband, and the husband is argumentative and is found to be carrying a GUN, the smart thing is for the lawyer to do is bring them both back to her office for a chat, with the result of convincing the woman to get marriage counseling?!?! REALLY?!?!
1609611543|4.0|No wonder I have the typical shape at 60!  Wheat has been altered so much that it is damaging our bodies instead of nourishing them.  I have quit the brainwashed multitude and quit wheat.  Between this and Eat Right for your Blood type they have me convinced that our modern medical advice it all wet!  Eating out can be a challenge but it is worth skipping bread with meals-  And breakfast can be tricky but have already lost a few pounds (in 3 weeks) and feel much much better for not eating it with a clearer mind to boot!  Good book!!!

Then found out I needs help on the first level!  7 levels later I had to force myself to set it down and eat something.  very fun, challenging game of logic and observation.

B00B2JSRAS|1.0|I was intrigued by the title and the $2.51 price. The closet geek in me was excited to try the 9 experiments that would \\"prove\\" to me that the law of attraction exists and works for ordinary people.<br /><br />The first 15% of the book explains how and why the law of attraction works.  The author gave examples and stories of wonderful results.  I went from being curious to full of anticipation by the time the experiment section made its appearance.<br /><br />And so began the experiments:<br />Experiment #1 called \\"The Dude Abides Principle\\" is to prove that there is a loving, abundant force in the universe.  Some people call this force God, Prana or Energy force.  There was mention, believe it or not, of the Star Wars force (as in, \\"May the force be with you Luke\\") because it's described as being in you as well as around you.  You devote 48 hours to looking for evidence of this all-knowing, all-perfect force.  You give this force an ultimatum type request.  Basically you are saying \\"Hey Universe!  You have 48 hours to show me you exist.  I want a blessing. Some type of wonderful surprise that can't be explained away by coincidence.\\"  Then you write down the time you made the request so you can be sure of the 48 hour deadline.<br /><br />The result:<br />Nothing happened.<br /><br />Experiment #2 called \\"The Volkswagen Jetta Principle\\" is to prove that YOU impact the field and draw from it according to your beliefs and expectations.  This is another 48 hour experiment where you actively look for certain things.  In this case it is the color of cars. For the first 24 hours you are to look for a certain color car.  I chose the color blue.  The second 24 hour period, you make the intention to find yellow butterflies.  These don't necessarily have to be the real ones.  They could be spotted on a coffee cup, T-Shirt, etc.<br /><br />The result:<br />I discovered that 1/10 of the cars I saw were blue.  Ummmmmm, good to know I guess.<br />No Butterflies were spotted.<br /><br />Experiment #3 called \\"The Alby Einstein Principle\\" is to prove how your positive and negative thoughts control your energy. This experiment requires two metal hangers and a straw cut in half.<br /><br />The result: I didn't try this one.<br /><br />Experiment #4 called \\"The Abracadabra Principle\\" is to prove you can manifest material things from thoughts.  This is another 48 hour experiment where you write down three specific things you want to manifest.  For this experiment I chose three things that were not too grand as to be unattainable.  I also wanted these things to be something I wouldn't be able to consider coincidence.<br />1. A gold ring I had lost somewhere in my house. (It has been lost for 6 years)<br />2. A new purse. (This is not something that would normally be purchased or offered to me)<br />3. A paperback book.  (Everyone who knows me, knows I have a kindle and would think twice before offering me an actual physical book, not that it would ever be turned away)<br /><br />The result:<br />No gold ring<br />No new purse<br />No paperback book<br /><br />This is where I decided to stop the experiments.  While I believe positive thinking is a good thing, I don't think that I was \\"proven\\" anything.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season is another winner.  Very well done with superb actors/actresses; great characters and story lines.  Very addictive once you've started watching it, but do see if from Season 1 to appreciate it all.  Thanks Amazon for making it available to Prime members.

B009S33I68|5.0|Informative, exciting and heart-wrenching.  The book paints a vivid picture of a couple of  nightmarish wartime engagements, focusing on the real-life and real-time implications to the people involved, directly and indirectly.  The setting is backdrop for the some of the best of humanity in the worst of circumstances.  I wouldn't presume to think I now know what it was like for those who fought there, but I certainly can say that I now better know what it was like.  I am humbled and grateful to hear of the mettle of these fine soldiers ... Americans ... people.  It takes one's breath away.

I got both books at my local library.

B00BUADSMQ|2.0|The first three \\"Die Hard\\" movies were exciting to watch and kept you on the edge of your seat. Even though the movies were packed with violence, there was a plot and a reason for the movie. With this new release of \\"A Good Day to Die Hard\\", the plot is missing and Bruce Willis is too old to be performing the miracle stunts of saving the world any longer. So a better name for the movie would be, \\"Its a Good Day to Retire John McClane\\".

B005EGXTL2|3.0|I'll try to write this without any spoilers! This trilogy was at its best in book one, where the hunting and survival aspects are central. As the trilogy proceeds into a political struggle with Katniss at its centre, it lost my interest. Further, Katniss' attitude got very tired very quickly and the only thing that kept me going was that it was a real page-turner, so I thought, what the heck, I've come this far. I think I'd aim this at the teenage audience because of the political concepts explored, but I don't know if the level of violence would be suitable for them. Meh!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great proof of life after death experience.  Everyone must read Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures by Mary Baker Eddy.  She got it right!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed the wrapping up of things. The surprise ending of who was trying to kill her was a little annoying. I understand she was trying to let all of the elements have a bit in the finale I suppose. Some have fussed about who Sookie ended up with. I don't see that as a problem for the book, other than it's a classic romance setup of ending up with what was right under your nose the whole time.

The book is written from his point of view and I was laughing so hard at some parts that my husband thought I was crazy. I love his neice also, especially with the calculator part. Her scenes in the book was too funny. I recommend this book to everyone. I hope to read more from you.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Personally, I absolutely love the first 2 books of the series and I highly anticipated the third. I was really disappointed in this book because I felt like it dragged on to be left hanging until the next book comes out. I will be buying the next when it debuts, but only because I want to see where the story goes!

0385349947|5.0|What I heard and read about [[ASIN:0385349947 Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead]] prior to picking up a copy centered around working moms finding a satisfying work-life balance. I was pleased to find that is only part of the book's broader consideration of women in the workplace.<br /><br />The author, Sheryl Sandberg, explicitly recognizes that, \\"while I believe that increasing the number of women in positions of power is a necessary element of true equality, I do not believe that there is one definition of success or happiness. Not all women want careers. Not all women want children. Not all women want both. I would never advocate that we should all have the same objectives... We each have to chart our own unique course and define what goals fit our lives, values, and dreams.\\"<br /><br />I found much of what Sheryl Sandberg covers in [[ASIN:0385349947 Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead]] to be relevant to me. Besides pointing out the extent of the barriers that many working women face (and the need to reduce, if not eliminate, them), she explains how women often hold themselves back. For example, she writes: \\"In addition to the external barriers erected by society, women are also hindered by barriers that exist within ourselves.  We hold ourselves back in ways both big and small, by lacking self-confidence, by not raising our hands, and by pulling back when we should be leaning in. We internalize the negative messages we get throughout our lives -the messages that say it's wrong to be outspoken, aggressive, more powerful than men. We lower our own expectations of what we can achieve. We continue to do the majority of the housework and child care. We compromise our career goals to make room for partners and children who may not even exist yet. Compared to our male colleagues, fewer of us aspire to senior positions.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Sheryl discusses how women often sabotage themselves. She explains how a lack of self-confidence holds us back and how to overcome negative thoughts.<br /><br />I liked that Sheryl admits that she has the same insecurities that she describes throughout the book, and owns the many instances when she pulled back instead of leaning in. She concluded the paragraph above by confessing that, \\"This is not a list of things other women have done. I have made every mistake on this list. At times, I still do.\\"<br /><br />I was also impressed by how Sheryl provided evidence to back up the vast majority of her points. The number of footnotes (more than 200) was almost distracting, but it is difficult to dispute her arguments when she cites news articles, scholarly studies, and government reports.<br /><br />Part of the reason I awarded the book five stars is the availability of free supplementary materials online (Google \\"Lean In Circle\\" to find the official website since Amazon reviews cannot include links to external materials). I joined a small group in my office that meets once a month to discuss topics covered in the book and on the website. They have been a good starting point to share experiences, seek advice and brainstorm ways to help each other advance.us back and how to overcome negative thoughts.<br /><br />I liked that Sheryl admits that she has the same insecurities that she describes throughout the book, and owns the many instances when she pulled back instead of leaning in.

B003YL4LYI|1.0|Martin is lucky to have the HBO series. I was turned off by reviews I read and should have never purchased this book, but I wanted to find out about some of the characters' fates.  The series kept me involved enough that I finally broke down and bought the book.  I had to skim it after the first 10 chapters just to finish it.  Much more than the money I wish I had back the time I spent.

1401216676|5.0|The Joker is my favorite comic book villain. This has got to be one of the greatest comics about him. Its relatively short, youll probably finish it within a span of minutes, but it is an absolutely amazing story. The art has been updated or so iv read, since the colors chosen for the original print were not particularly great, and I am glad they did, the art is beautiful. The comic itself is actually hardcase, purple with purple foil depicting the joker and batman in the comics final scene, very nice. The cover you see in the pictures is actually a book cover. Overall a must read if you love the Joker.
B0042XA2U4|5.0|I read this a long time ago in high school and then decided to buy it for my kindle; I loved this book just as much now as I did then.  It is a great story.  I think if you have ever been in love you can feel the pain the main character is going through and have sympathy for her.  I also love that the story ends and give you a hopefully feeling for the character and her life. I would say get this book!!
0756655307|4.0|I bought this for my little 10 year old brother who has a budding love of super heroes. This is exactly what it states it is, an encyclopedia of marvel characters. The only thing that keeps me from giving it perfect marks is that almost all the heroes have very short sections, with the exception of the most popular heroes. This in and of itself doesn't bother me. what bothers me is that there are some popular heroes/villains that get a short paragraph that should have probably have gotten more. But other than this its a great addition to any comic collection.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The story was complex, often couldn't see the point of it.  Too much reminisces.  No enough characterization conveyed until the end.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I enjoy it but it has a poor use of cg blood making it corny and unrealistic taking from enjoyment of the show also to much nudity i love nudity but its misplaced in the show and overused like a cheap porn taking deeply away from the story making it very trashy and poorly done but its a decent show

B00BGIBVP8|4.0|I have seen the movie before so I really enjoyed it; however, when I tried to watch it on amazon prime on my tv, it kept stalling and stopping.  I was not able to enjoy the rental.
B005MTHRAA|5.0|I love Greek myth and ancient plays.  This one does not follow Euripidice's play but has its own development of the tale.  It is artistic, dramatic but not melodramatic, and beautifully realized.  The sceneries are breath taking.  The acting by all are first class.  This film gives the feel and atmosphere of the strong undercurrent of mental anguish and steel will of Medea--Diva Callas is also a superb actor.  It is a must have for those who love classical theatre.  I will be watching it again and couldn't recommend it more strongly.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic show! It borders on genius! My whole family loves this show, and we can hardly wait for the rest of the episodes. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|My husband and I absolutely love the series. HBO has done a great job with the casting of characters. We are looking forward to owning them all.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Bought this product because of a very narrow living room and I wanted to be sure that Kinect could view action at a very close (4 foot distance).  I mounted the Zoom at recommended height and followed instructions exactly on being careful not to scratch lenses of the Kinect (this was the trickiest part since the protective plastic provided was a bit hard to line up at first).  Once that was done, the rest was easy.<br />Zoom worked the way it was supposed to.  Enjoying playing Kinect in a narrow spaced apartment.<br />Great product.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|This game is highly addictive! I have a very hard time putting it down! Graphics are good, easy to follow. My only complaint is that there are not more levels!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  Watched all of the seasons 1 through 4 so far and enjoyed them all.  Consistently good scripts, excellent acting and fine guest performances by \\"name\\" actors as well.  Some of the legal issues are relevant and some scenes depicting how twisted the legal minds work to rationalize their behavior in \\"representing\\" their client's although a bit contrived at times, does give a pretty good view of why our judicial system is a mess (just my opinion, JK).  Enjoy the series for what it is, just good entertainment!

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Heartwarming a.amazing and a great read for eleven year olds<br />Great amazing go e star worthy book amazingly awesome <3
B00CFQN12Q|3.0|Was not as good as last three Die Hards.This one had to much action it was so unreal that I had a hard time keeping up.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|As an all-purpose camp-type knife, that can both cut and do light chopping, you can't beat this one for the price, nor for any price up to about twice the price of this one.  It's heavy, and thus maybe too much knife for a backpacking trip, but for general camping, it's good stuff, Maynard.  As noted in other reviews, quite good tool steel type for the price.  The grip is pretty grippy - not super grippy, so perhaps not perfect, but pretty good.  Oh, the sheath is just so-so...doesn't hold the knife completely in place  - it's not going to fall out, but it bounces up and down a little when walking if worn on your belt.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Waiting for the next one and hoping that it will be as good. Great cast and crew and story was great.
B005DD7H50|5.0|the ending was a total let down for such a cool movie,  Not sure how the ending should have gone but there either needs to be a sequel than would do it justice.  I usually don't like sequels since they seem to go downhill from the first movie except for a few.  I wish twilight series would have continued if the rest measured up to the others
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Over all super fun game can't stop playing the game. I love horses and this game lets me take my . Love for them every where I go.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I loved it as normal. I am not hard to please though. I would recommend this to a friend.  I wouldn't exactly buy the dvd, but I'd rent it once or twice.
1575666286|5.0|as a person who has a firm grasp on the benefits of holistic and nutritional healing I believe this book is indispensable. Dr. Gerson's therapy has improved the health of myself my family and countless friends. I try to keep a copy on hand at all times in case the need for sharing the wealth of knowledge arises.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Entertaining but too short. Need more levels. please update soon. Will be looking out for future entertainment from yourselves. Thanks
B006LSZECO|1.0|I A Book filled with hatred where evil wins. Terrible. Makes you wish you had never begun reading it. No more.
6304500831|4.0|Movie was awesome.  But there where a few seconds where the age was showing. But past 10 seconds it was worth the money.
B001EOOQEM|4.0|Dio's influence in Black Sabbath's sound is highly apparent. I'm not just referring to the vocals but the enter sound of the band. Black Sabbath never was the same without Ozzy but Dio came in a close second. Then Dio went solo and Sabbath pretty much disintegrated. Ozzy was right. They need him more than he needed them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER BEEN OUT.THE WORLD TOUR IS AWESOME I JUST THANK THE CREATORS WHO HAD MADE SUBWAY SUFRER HAPPEN.THANK YOU
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Best app ever I play it all the  time  you have to get it  awesome awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best ever get it now right now
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I really enjoyed each one of shows. Sometimes it was hard to keep track of each character fro the first season
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is great. The only thing I don t like is the fact that some times I will breed some animals and it will take 24 hours to finish so I leave it over  night. But when I come back check on the time and gather my coins time had not moved when I was gone. That is the only thing I don't like.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Didn't  like the ending. Loved the whole series. The dynamics between Mary and her husband was just beautiful and should have continued.To me they were the key characters for wanting to watch every episode. It was just such a let- down at the end, that left me feeling flat and so disappointed that things came together too fast and so they just ended it with the fatal car crash. It didn't seem to flow together with meaning as much as the first two seasons did.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I like the concept of time travel and possibility that we live in dimensions of which we are unaware. Well done.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I'm a huge fan to gaming, so when it comes to app games I can be quite a pessimist. This game is by far is the best tower defence game out there well other than plants vs zombies and yes better than bloons tower defence. This game first appeared I believe in armor games and became later available in Apple mobile devices(which I hate because I don't have any of the Apple mobile devices). The game play is fun for both kids(because of the easy beginning levels) and adults(later on in the game there will be harder modes you can select to play on). And because of the intriguing campaign(which always has a twist in each level),awe graphics(for an app game), and exelent game play there's hereby no reason for me not to give it a five stars. So is this game better than &quot;most&quot; other app games or a 5 min snack? Absolutely.
1401941893|5.0|This is a terrific book for someone looking for a way to increase their outlook on life, how they live, what's going on-personally, and their ability to be calm with what makes them special and be comfortable in their own skin. Miranda has taken her life and helps you apply it to your own.  While this book is directed toward young women, all women and young girls would be able to apply it to their own lives without challenge. When it becomes available I highly suggest purchasing it.  I hope it comes out on Kindle as I might even invest in it that way (even though I got it for free).
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game itself is relatively fun and I like that the course areas change at random.I don't enjoy the amount of lag in the game at times though.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Nice game for wasting time while waiting. It gets you thinking. And the best part was it was free for me.
B0016OOS16|5.0|It helps a lot I still have to use it more, but it is really nice! Buy it if you can!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|&quot;My Horse&quot; has great graphics!The competitions feel almost real. This game has taught me the importance of having real horse. I think that all ages would love this amazing horse game!
1442346949|2.0|Simply put, this would be a much better audio read if the reader were a little less emotional... just finished random house's Turing's Cathedral by George Dyson which was a much better audio read... in comparison the Steve Jobs book is hard to listen to. sfs
B00CWY76CC|3.0|if you like a little hard epsace games then you should get this app. This app is a fun new thing to try.

B00BBI9WD6|5.0|The second book in David Weber's epic space opera series introduces the Grayson people, who end up having quite an impact on Honor Harrington's life.  Without going into spoilers, this novel is in my opinion one of the most important in the entire series and is possibly my favorite.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I enjoy this app it is fun and a bit challenging. it doesn't demand money in the game like most other apps overall it is a very fun game!
B00CD4RPWM|3.0|After reading the outlander, I found the graphic novel annoying.  Claire's favorite sayings are forced into what little dialogue there is.  It comes across as unnatural.  It also reduced a great love story into a short, unrealistic relationship.  very disappointed.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|once you start one of the Crossfire novel series, you can't put it down.<br />this is a fun book to read..
B004TPJMLA|5.0|This album is pure delight. From the drums to the heart stirring lyrics and vocal quality of Paul Simon, this album takes you to another level of joy. Feel the joy!
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|There is no way other to describe this movie aside from awesome. I will watch this movie over and over again. Go Stephanie Meyer!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Another classic Taylor Swift album. All very listenable, some fun tracks and a few departures from her usual, all in all an excellent album.
B004RKXN44|5.0|This is my go to book when I need a good read....SOOO much BETTER than HoO...I LOVE Hawk and Sienna
B0062QRTKA|5.0|I got this app when it was featured as the free daily app. I would gladly have paid for it though, as it's really fun while being challenging too. The graphics are adorable. The game is loosely based on Moses parting the Red Sea, but also includes other Bible based characters like Jesus, Noah, and Abraham - all with their own special abilities to help you get through each level. Although it is a Bible based game, it's not preachy and should be enjoyable for players of any religious background.<br /><br />Edited to add: Runs just fine on my HTC One
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best and really teaches responsibility and how to take care of a horse and is a fun thing to pass the time its fun for little kids to
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The story line was not one of my favorites. Definitely liked the othe two better. This is being drawn out too much and needs to come to an end!
B009PU2SX8|5.0|In the summer of 1999, I met Gary Clark Jr. in Austin, Texas on the famous 6th Street.  He was only 15 years old and a friend of mine introduced me to him.  I knew then that it would only be a matter of time and he would be a well recognized guitarist through out the world. This is his best body of work to date and a sure bet that you will love this album as much as I do.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love this series so very much!  I hate it when the books end.  Can't wait for the next installment!!
B000FC0V3E|5.0|My favorite Hemingway novel.  It totally transforms you, taking you to the warmth of Spain.  I've read it multiple times and see new things every time.
B0076DELIG|2.0|I thought I would give Connelly another try as I had enjoyed the earlier Bosch novels.  Yet again<br />the author has to assert his political bias to conjure up a ridiculous premise and predictable ending.<br /><br />This is disappointing because I like the character and I think Connelly is a talented mystery writer.

B00DE0RQM8|5.0|This is a great song to dance to, or at the very least, nod your head & tap your feet to the beat! I agree with some of the other reviewers - it's a fun & catchy tune! Also, check out the pretty innovative beat breakdown starting around 2:35. Britney never ceases to keep me hooked on her music! Whether you're a Britney fan or not, I recommend this purchase, it's well worth $1.29!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series - You will fall in love with these characters, all uniquely different. History combined with rich characters and just enough drama. Patiently waiting for season 4!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|this is a fun hilarious adventure great for the whole family. parents will get the dry jokes.. kids will enjoy the cartoon ..  it's funny, witty, and just a fun movie to watch..

B00785P2QC|3.0|Good game and kills hours during bordom but relies to much on you being willing to spend money to buy the investment points. Which im not
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse is reminiscent of the Razer mice, but this is much cheaper. And in general, the price-quality ratio is better. The only thing that doesn't blow me away is one part of the software, which is that you can only have two profiles per save file, and the other thing is that the mouse feels fairly cheap. It is large (which you get used to and love) but very light, and is made almost entirely of plastic. The scroll wheel on my unit is beginning to depress into the frame of the thing, which should not be happening...I use this mouse to play FPS's and Minecraft, and the only thing the scroll wheel is bound to is switching between items/weapons (scrolling) and throwing grenades (clicking it in). Other than those two things, this is a great mouse with resource-friendly software. Highly recommended.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|we saw this on HBO at a hotel and I had to purchase it because it was so awesome! I just bought another copy for my niece who has aspergers syndrome now called autism spectrum and they just told her that she has this (she is a teen now and wasn't ready before now to comprehend it).  It is an amazing story for all and her website is even more amazing! MUST Watch DVD!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this app is really good but it could use some work like less adds I think is is kind of fun and really boring so if you want the app get it but just a headups a lot of ads

B00A8ECU24|4.0|The voice prompts make it easy for preschoolers to play. There is plenty to do in Ponyville, so it keeps my daughter entertained.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|This movie is exactly what it presents itself as being. The acting by elizabeth is extremely over dramatic and the whole storyline is a bit comical and unrealistic.. but its fun to watch and wraps together pretty nicely. Don't take it too seriously and you will enjoy yourself. Some of the ... intimate scenes ... may make you roll your eyes but all in all its a good movie. I get it for nostalgic value. Reminds me of another time. Back when movies relied more on the story instead of special effects to entertain.
B009R659L8|4.0|You can never go wrong with a Mary Higgins Clark book.  Good story line and the characters were well defined.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Their story is crazy good! I just wish Sylvia will let their exes be an afterthought in Captivated By You!

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Entwined with You was OK not the same caliber of writing as her first two books in this series. The author added too many unfinished subplots and I know this will lead to many more books but I may or may not purchase them.
B005MLOKXA|4.0|This show has drama without being too predictable. It's consistant and well written. I like that its not trying to do too much. It keeps me interested

B004VMUS9G|1.0|I downloaded this app and a minute later I deleted it.  It just wasn't what I was looking for.  It didn't have the alarm features I needed or the look I wanted.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I saw the movie, \\"Reacher\\" and found out it was based on this series. I can't wait to read the other  titles in the series.
0989524116|5.0|Outin lives up to the great first book in the series. It's a thrilling ride and anyone who likes thrillers, spiritual or fantasy will find it very enjoyable, but I think you have to read Outview first or you might be a little lost. Then again, if you do get lost, a mystic might show up to help you out.
B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|Good storyline and great characters.  Interesting situations and solutions.  Was waiting on Worf to return but not in Season 1.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Item was delivered fast, problem free and in perfect quality. Would buy from again, absolutely love this movie and needed it in a timely fashion, worked out perfectly!
B00127RAJY|5.0|If time is an excuse to not exercise, this is the workout for you. 20 Minutes!!It is a tough 20, but as you progress through each of the levels, you will be so impressed with what you can do.

B003Y5H5AG|1.0|Saw movie before, its great.  The selling of scratched DVDs should be illegal.  It had a whole 15 minutes before it wouldnt play any<br /> longer.  Nice scratch.  That's what I get for buying \\"like new\\" I suppose.

B009NY43NY|1.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!! Please do NOT read if you haven't read the book yet as there are spoilers!!!!<br />I don't think I have ever written a book review before. After being a long-time, die-hard Southern Vampire Mysteries fan and then reading this final book I felt the need to write one. Charlaine Harris must hate her fans. She spends 12 books getting a huge, dedicated fan base to fall in love with Sookie and the world she lived in. After 12 books, she turns around and throws it all away with this last book. Where to start?<br /><br />1) Every book there is at least one person trying to kill Sookie for one reason or another. In this book, one of the people trying to kill Sookie (Amelia's father) is mad at her for the following reason: He had one wish given to him by a devil. What does he use the wish on? He wishes for the devil to find him a Cluviel Dor (a fairy item that Sookie owns). What does the Cluviel Dor do? IT GRANTS YOU ONE WISH! Why would you use your ONE WISH to gain an item to grant you ONE WISH??? When the devil finds Sookie, he sees that she has already used it and so returns to tell the man. The man hadn't worded his wish very well, because the devil &#34;found it&#34; and that's that. Wish is used and done. Now Amelia's father is royally mad at Sookie and decides to end her. If anything, he should be mad that Charlaine Harris wrote him as a fool.<br />2) Sookie has been dating/married with Eric Northman since I believe book 3. Other love interests have shown up for short periods here and there. None were ever written as a serious option by Charlaine Harris. I'm a huge Eric Northman fan. However, if Charlaine didn't intend to have Sookie end up with him, then she should have broken them up several books ago and started developing her relationship with someone new. I know Charlaine doesn't like Eric. She has said on several occasions that she didn't understand why the fans like him so much. Why would you have your main character in a relationship with this amazing vampire who loves and protects her for 8 or 9 books only to break them up at the beginning of the final book? And she doesn't just break them up. In a move completely out of character with the Eric that Charlaine has created, he publicly ends their vampire marriage and is subsequently shipped off to Oklahoma where he will be separated from his children and the Area he has so happily sheriffed and made to be what is basically a sex slave to the Vampire Queen of Oklahoma for 200 YEARS! Charlaine, we get it, you truly hate Eric. Not only does Eric have the worst ending to a story line in history, but Sookie doesn't seem to so much as bat an eyelash. After 9 books of developing this strong undying love for Eric and when he &#34;vampire-dumps her&#34; what is her reaction? &#34;Meh... my tomatoes look fantastic!&#34;. There were more pages dedicated to the description of her tomato garden in this book then there were to the ending of her love with Eric and the supposed beginning of her &#34;relationship&#34; with Sam. Unbelievable.<br />3) She completely threw all of the rules SHE created out the window. Remember how fairies can only be killed with iron? Remember how they turn in to a pile of glittering dust once killed? In this book, a fairy is killed with a common bullet. And for whatever reason, he doesn't turn in to dust. He is simply a dead body like any other human. Remember how Sookie loved dating vampires because she couldn't hear their thoughts? Remember how she can hear the thoughts of humans and shifters and were's? Remember how she always thought of Sam as a brother and how even if she didn't, it wouldn't work because she could hear his thoughts anyway? Not anymore! Sookie actually says to herself in this book something about how &#34;she's never been able to hear Sam's thoughts, only pick up his feelings&#34;. Since when?? Since Charlaine decided she had enough of her fans loving the hero she created for Sookie and decided she wanted Sookie with Sam. I think she spent 30 pages on suddenly having Sookie decide she would be with Sam. Thirteen books and you spend 30 pages on the supposed &#34;happily ever after&#34; for your heroine? Sookie deserves better Charlaine.<br />4) She decided to walk through all of these characters that we haven't seen in ages. Why does Quinn show up for two minutes? Why are Bob and Amelia there? Why did you feel the need to waste the precious pages of your last book on characters we haven't seen in so long that we no longer care about and the wonders of Sookie's tomato garden???<br />5) Finally, we are introduced in the beginning of the series to a telepathic waitress stuck in a podunk town serving corn fritters and beer to the locals. We are then told for a dozen books how special Sookie is. How she is meant for such greatness. Great things are coming for Sookie! How does Sookie's life end up? In a podunk town, line dancing, sleeping with her boss in his trailer (having what she refers to as &#34;the best sex ever, we were like two SEALS!&#34;) and serving corn fritters and beer to the locals.<br /><br />So again, I don't think I've ever written a review for a book before but after the the obvious hate for her readers that Charlaine must have, I couldn't help myself. I will never hand over another penny to Charlaine Harris.
B008J34466|2.0|There are perhaps 4 or 5 songs that are good to OK, but the rest is just filler garbage with offensive language that adds nothing to the songs.  I am certainly not a prude, but foul language just &#34;because&#34; has no place in good music.
B00881VLCE|5.0|These puzzles can be easy or hard.  They are very well done and do take a fair amount of time to assemble.  But they are FUN
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Excellent cd.  Wonderful pairing of 2 fine talents.  I may now need to order their other cd, even though there are no song previews.
B007MD2RHC|5.0|Of all the hundreds upon hundreds of albums that I own, THIS is my one, true, irrefutable favorite.  I love every single song, which is saying a hell of a lot.  Thomas Bergersen is a true master of music- the legendary composer of our time!  This is a must have
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|This is actually a pretty fun game to play. I use to play it because my kids like to watch me play games on my kindle... Now I'm hooked on this game also. Only thing that I don't like is that you can use real money to buy aura. That is not good if you have children playing the game. Usually kids tap on any buttons for anything.
0345529057|5.0|These books were the hard to put down. These books are a mix of violence (emotional,physical, and sexual), politics, action,adventure, and epic storytelling. It reads like a unisex soap opera. There is violence and action to keep a male-centric audience entertained with enough romance, storyline, and emotional drama to keep a feminine-centric audience entertained. There are very few stories that both my wife and I are deeply involved in and this in one of them. Excellent for solo reading or couples-focused reading.<br />I started reading the series while I was watching Season 3 on HBO.  The books are filled with much more detail than the show and filling myself in on the intricacies of the story only made the HBO series more elegant.<br />The books are however quite graphic with plenty of violence and sex for an adult reader. They are NOT appropriate for children! They may be appropriate for your late-age teen if you allow them to watch NC-17 movies. The themes are adult oriented.<br />Overall this is my third favorite series ever written.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was in tears both joy and (not going to spoil it) but in the end ... so the whole movie was emotional.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books were easy reads and kept you interested in what was going to happen next between the main characters.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I do not know why everybody is giving this game bad reviews.I guess the developers have updated the game.Fruit Ninja is an awesome game.This version has more blades and backgrounds to unlock.This version even has multiplayer mode.It has elite blades too.This game is very addicting.This game is definitely worth $0.99.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Wish the end of this book didn't leave you totally hanging and an odd ending. When does the next book come out?
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|An overall fun knock off of a good game (team fortress 2) put into a mobile device, extremely fun all the restrictions in game make sense.  No bugs from what I can see, still, an extremely fun game. :)
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love this movie because its has so many great characters.  My favorite is Thor with Ironman being a close second.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's the most coolest amazing game ever the horses seem so real and it makes me feel like I have a real notes it's so cool
B00003CXMG|4.0|If you haven't seen Almost Famous, buy it and if you have seen it, well, buy it. Its timeless and always a good shot in the arm come Sunday morning when too many adult beverages the night before have left you to melt into your couch for 123 minutes, all to remind you that the night before you may or may not have yelled &#34;I am a Golden God,&#34; on some strangers roof. Truly a classic, and always fun to watch, with a 88% on Rottentomatoes.com
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Wasn't sure to begin with but the story sucked me in and I had to find out what happened.  There was something unsettling about the story and I found the characters frustrating at times.  I did enjoy the story though and I think it was the way the story was written that I didn't like?
B00B7Y0206|3.0|The first 10 times I used this app, it worked great. But when the app update, the videos didn't work at all! Developers of this app, I think you have some fixing to do.
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|It was worth the wait to hear all the early Rumours demos.....5 stars!  Especially Stevie Nicks voice-beautiful and even haunting at times.  Rumours is one of a kind!
B007SGM084|4.0|As an older person I found this very interesting! I grew up under a much different set of values. Sexual behavior is so different.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Being a fan of hack and slash games, this game is great.  You don't even need to pay anything to enjoy this free game!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|There is excellent views of the sky and moon. It is very detailed.  You will enjoy this APP.  It keeps track of time zone as well.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Yes, this has a complicated plot with several flashbacks, but it is one of my favorite movies.  All of the actors are amazing and the story is riveting. Even when you know the ending, it is fun to watch the tale unravel.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I bought the DVD and not the BlueRay version, and it is completely fine. The quality is superb and a whole lot better than what is on YouTube. My only regret is not buying it sooner!
B0090EHVMC|2.0|Colorful is about the only good thing I could come up with about this film. Even if I could overlook the glaring political agenda that is slathered all over this terrible adaptation of Dr. Seuss' book. At the very least they could have coupled it with a good story - I guess they were trying to be another FernGully, but they failed on every level.<br /><br />They could have just let Danny DeVito stand up and say, \\"Big business is bad, rich people are bad, and they are going to destroy our planet.\\"<br /><br />It wasn't funny. It wasn't entertaining. It was just a terrible 1.5 hour chore. Fortunately, it was only a $2 mistake.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I like the book because it has the right details and adds lots of work to it that'swhy I like the book :)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like the grafics and all but I don't like how you have to spend money to get more gems. but I do like how it teaches you how to take care of a horse and how to feed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a unique game<br />If u play u will love this app<br />I hope you will love this store<br />It is one of a kind<br />:)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love love love it! Need more levels..cant wait for the updates... Frustrates me at times lol but i Love this game...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this game is fun and at times a challenge.  I enjoyed it can't wait for more.  Was good fun for all.
B00CUWWLWG|2.0|I saw the Epic movie, and it lived up to the title, and when I found the game I bought it almost immediately. I also thought the game would be good, like the movie, but when I started it, the game did not load fully. I never even got to play, and I am very disappointed.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Erotic romance novels?  They are everywhere now, and some are very good.  Written from the male perspective and hilarious?  I hadn't found any until Tangled.  A great story about a cocky investment banker who just met his match in the company's newest associate.  And it was as funny as if it were written by a comedian.  Thanks, Emma Chase, for the wonderful ride.  I will be looking for more of your work.
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|The series is wonderful, but I had to play the set on my computer and hold the drive to keep it from vibrating.  The DVDs made so much noise in my DVD player that they were not watchable on my TV.
B002MFULQO|4.0|Good movie, answered lots of conspiracy questions which patriots had, things that make sense all these years later. Language was pretty bad, but I suppose that was to make it &#34;realistic.&#34;
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun puzzle game! I look forward to more levels! Great for those who like a game that makes them think!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Superb acting. Beautiful story. I only give 5 stars to movies I want to see again and again. Dustin Hoffman is a genius.
1781162646|3.0|Not King's best, but ok for a quick read. Still a big fan and will continue to buy his books.
B00009P1MP|3.0|I don't know where this recording came from. I bought a &#34;NEW&#34; CD but the recording sound was atrocious! I thought I was listening to a recording of a used LP!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Bought this series for my daughter, but my whole family is enjoying it - cant beat Harry Potter series for those nights when there i nothing on TV to watch.
0756405890|2.0|I am new to the fantasy genre, my first experience of reading fantasy was Game of Throne series. This series is recommended as one of the options after GoT series.<br /><br />This series is entirely different from the GoT. But my rating of two stars is not due to that. This book suffers terribly from a dull main character and a terribly slow moving storyline. What makes it worst is the sole main character is narrating his story, so we only hear his point of view and the whole book turn into an uninspiring droll due to the character and his tone.<br /><br />At the high level journey of the character could be interesting, but lack of humor, boring sub-plots and slow pace kills any interest in the book.<br /><br />Please check other books out.
1781162646|4.0|This was a quick \\"read.\\" I enjoyed the pace of the story, but what happened to the editing? I've checked the reviews and haven't seen any comments on the book's reference to \\"It isn't white.\\" Was that a literary diversion? No one I know who had read this book knows what that reference (which was made at least twice) means. With that tease dangling, the story seems unfinished.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Supernatural is easily my favorite show. I purchased season 1 followed by all of the other season, and I would highly recommend them to everyone. There is emotion, comedy, thrill, and suspense. Great story following the Winchester brothers!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This game is fast and the program is helpful doing some of the moves for you.  I have played it with cards but this is better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so hooked on this show & season 3 is even better than the first two...  I highly recommend!
B000ICXQF6|5.0|It's easy to forget how great a director Terry Gilliam is, or how good an actor Brad Pitt is. And Madeleine Stowe, and Bruce Willis, too. But it's particularly Pitt who shines here...though he does not pull down the screen time Willis does, it will be hard to put his amazing, troubled, one-of-a-kind performance out of your mind.<br /><br />12 MONKEYS is a wonderful film, a movie that is at the same time serious and literate and prescient and  frightening and thought-provoking, a thing of art yet at the same time a brilliantly constructed cautionary tale. It's a tale of madness, of time travel, of institutionalism, animal rights, psychiatry, detective work, science, and anything else you can dig up.<br /><br />It must be amazing to work for Terry Gilliam; his films teem with multiple levels, complicated subtexts, strong symbols, and recurring imagery. Every scene of this movie is crowded with people, patterns, noise, and the hustle bustle of everyday life draped over the fabric of the story...it seems at times there is no way there is a story within all this that will make sense, but never fear.<br /><br />Watch, listen, remember.<br /><br />And there it is. All laid out in front of you...though it may take a couple of viewings to get it all.  This is a spectacular movie...a total trip of the mind.  It's one of Gilliam's best.  And that's saying a lot: [[ASIN:B000IEVW82 Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]], [[ASIN:B001P5M7QE Monty Python And The Holy Grail]], [[ASIN:B00D6C0D42 Brazil]], [[ASIN:B0036QYM5Y The Fisher King]]...<br /><br />This is a film well worth checking out. You'll never forget it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I loved this movie, it was a great story, very funny & well acted!  I can't wait to see the second one..  Recommend it for anyone who wants a laugh, young or old!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|how do you make millions, how do you get back from the dumps - this book has super useful practical, do-able life changing insights
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|For all the Blackmore faithfull he decided to go play the court jester 20 years ago so get over it. Steve Morse has taken this music to a higher level while preserving Ritchie's legacy without trying to copy it. And Don Airy has done the same stepping in for the late John Lord. This new disc is quality from start to finish. I have over 1300 in my collection and this one stays in my top 5 rotation and will for a long time. I'm not going to say go and get it because if you're in the know you already have it.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|Downey delivers the goods again with the reprisal of his role as Tony Stark, reluctant super hero, inventor, visionary and peacekeeper. Good storyline and lots of super hero action. As a sequel it is just as good or better than the original.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|I think William Duvall does a good job on vocals but I would like to hear songs with the energy of We Die young , Them Bones & Again. This dredge thru the sludge tempo Jerry's going with feels redundant. I don't know if all the guys contribute to the writing process. If not they should because these last 2 cd's lack those few in your face rockers each of the older ones had. With that said I'm glad AIC is continuing on.
B001KZG99A|5.0|Okay, so it is your standard super hero movie, but it is surprisingly entertaining. Downey plays the quirky and reluctant hero, the rich boy of a father inventor who is a mix of Walt Disney and Howard Hughes. Events throw Downey into world events and well there's where the story begins. You will have to watch it to find out what happens!
B00005JM4Z|5.0|well Amazon did it again,they had the Fast and Furious DVD I needed to bring my collection up to date..now all I have to do is wait for the next two to come out! This is such a good series,I watch it anytime I get a chance.
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Actually I was quite impressed with this game, especially for it being the faotd...very fun, entertaining and challenging.Rarely do I rate a game unless it is a five start game and this is definitely one of those rare games that deserves an absolute five stars....highly recommend this game...great job developers!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter and I really enjoyed this app. However it is not very long. We finished in one night. I am glad I got the free version.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|My kids love it.  They want to play it all the time.  My little one even tries to outrun the player.
B0087EACJK|1.0|I don't have much to say.  I installed it, couldn't get into it, and then deleted it.  Some folks may like it, but I just never did.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|The Ice Age movies are all great movies. This particular movie was a hit with my son who loves dinosaurs.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|It's got some great equestrian scenes and a feel good romance.  What's not to like?  Yes, it's and old movie and yes it's very cheesy.  Although, sometimes you just need a little cheese in your life.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|My son loves this movie! We went on vacation and of course this was a movie I did not bring with therefore my son was disappointed, first movie he watched when we got home was Rio. Lots of &#34;action&#34; keeping a child interested in the movie.
0890090572|3.0|purchased for my 10 year, he found it difficult to read, would like more illustration and large fonts. thantk you
B005LAIH4A|4.0|This movie is not only cute and entertaining but it is also educational to children. The movie has a good balance of educating the viewer (while entertaining) to let people know the importance of not being wasteful. Love Dr. Seuss!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game you take care of your horses and put them in competition. you can buy horses and buy saddle bridals stirrups ect...
0425263924|5.0|I would recommend this series to everyone, however I am looking forward to the next book in the series. I loved it but didn't like the ending. I have since ordered another book by Syliva Day and I'll let you know, if it's the book or the author.
B003XT60KO|5.0|It will open your eyes to the real world and how the business cycle should work. It will also cause you extreme frustration once you understand the material and see what our government is doing.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its a great game. the ziplines and mines are a wonderful addition. the curves and the new power ups are amazing as well. but when I try to play again it wont let me run the app.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Very disappointing!! The story should have continued and not left the reader hanging for who knows how long of a wait until the next issue.<br /><br />Not worth the money I paid.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It's like a heaping dish of sweet and sour stir-fry.  Delicious fun and worth every gold coin.  Loved the music too.  Great fun.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the series, love the writing, the way the author takes the reader on a roller coaster of emotions!<br />Can't wait for the next book!
B004UJAOLM|4.0|I have always enjoyed the book, but don't buy the audible version. The narrator sounded like she had a mouthful of gravel. I was unable to listen to more than 5 minutes and I deleted it. I love audible books since I spend so much time in the car, but not this one.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This timer has lots of options the most of any app of its kind. It's not the prettiest interface but by far the best for options.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love all the little puzzles. So addictingly challenging!<br /><br /> AAAAAAAA++++++ Great for all ages. So much fun!! More than just something to break the monotony. You get to use your brain!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book was good but it left you hanging on again. And it wasn't good as the last two. The main character s was a little boring to me. I hope the next boook give me what I'm looking for.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I could give two ____'s about a musical, but I liked the reaction from my wife when she unwrapped this.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Was not one of the most fun games I have played .controls are very touchy and the timer ruins the whole game.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|I have a 9 year old daughter.  and she loves it. fun. get the supper maket and the handeman bus a dad
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very entertaining read for one.  Honestly, had a hard time putting it down once I started.  Very harsh lesson with this book though, is the experiences that are all too familiar, hence the title above.  Take out whatever bad guy or issue I've had to deal with and insert zombie or zombie related?  Pretty damn close...
B0002KPIQY|5.0|I have always loved this movie and this copy was great! I love Angelina in this role I think she really brings out the emotions of the part and makes you live it with her.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait to read the next one. Gideon and Eva are perfect for each other. I wouldn't mind having myself a Gideon.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this series back when it first came out in season 1 but after that life caught up and I totally missed season 2 until the beginning of 2013 when I started watching the whole season online and finished it in two days then moved on to season 3 and finished up just in time for the season finale. AWESOME! I can't wait for season 4!!
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Eva Polak is a gifted photographer and the book is a lovely example of her work.  It offers hints and suggestions for how to get started in impressionist photography. I thought it was a little light on theory and her suggestions relied heavily on the automatic mechanisms of the camera, so it is not really helpful if you want to figure out how to get exactly the result you want by using the full manual mode.  Nonetheless, it will be good for the vast majority of people who never venture beyond the fully automatic section of their cameras.
159463176X|5.0|Really enjoying this book.  Read both of Khaled Hosseini previous books and knew it would be good.  Love the story line
B00400NHRO|5.0|The book underscore reality in medicine, esp geriatrics. It's a fun and fast read. The book is a classic that I heard about many times, and heard anecdotes from it,  and so it's worth reading...
0679805273|5.0|It was brand new product.  Exactly what I wanted and expected. Would purchase again and would strongly recommend to others.
B008B68IEA|5.0|the bed is SO cute. and it fit perfectly in my Monster High house. (me and my Mom built a monster high house.) and we have all the beds for the dolls but this is one of my favorites.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Once the show had lost Jonathan, Pete, Lex, and Lana I felt less interested. It is a shame, because at it's core it worked best with these main characters included. Season 1 was a lot of fun, and the pilot is quite decent.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I have retired all of our non-Wubbanub pacifiers since my son prefers these so much! They can get a little grungy from being chewed and drooled on, but I just send them through the washing machine. They are very good quality and look brand new when they come out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.  I have been watching 3 at a time and would watch more but I dont have the time.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|((some spoilers))This movie has a great plot of a man trying to redeem himself as a noted author after two failed books. This alone could have made the movie. Now add Bughuul, the eater of children into the story and it becomes a horror movie. Ellison desperate after his failed true crime books decides to move his family straight into the house of the tragic event. He watches the super 8 snuff films of five family being murdered and decides that he can figure this out on his own. He doesn't the deputy does, and its already too late. He made himself and his family the next meal for Bughuul and his daughter as their killer. I love the ending makes it realistic and not the typical they somehow make it out alive. Anyways, the sequel is coming out and personally I can't wait.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Very nice, brings back memories of when I used to play the TCG. Well worth the money that I paid for it.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I was skeptical to watch this series at first.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe because I had 8 others shows on my DVR going at the same time.  The reviews I were getting from friends on G+ were all positive.  No negative reviews at all.  So I checked it out.  And I'm glad I did.  Thank you to Amazon Instant Video (the ONLY ones out there who had all three seasons that I missed) for bringing the Abbey to my American home.  This show is brilliant, and beautiful, and smart.  I felt like I was part of the house while I watched this.  It's hard to pick a favorite character, I loved them all.  I watched all three seasons through Amazon in just three nights.  I can't wait for the fourth season.  I'll be viewing it on Amazon Instant Video when it does come out.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|I would recommend anyone who is a fan of clever, witty comedies to watch this film. Not to mentioned it was delivered intact and on time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good game. There is always something new with this game. I always look forward to where the game takes me next. Love it
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I say awe for two reasons...1. I love the story of Eva and Gideon 2.  Wish there were more chapters. I couldn't believe I reached the end so quickly but the book was soooo good I couldn't put it down...Can't wait for the next one...AWWWW!
B000E6EGXM|3.0|The plastic cover was broken, the CD',s were playable but their color was sort of grey as if been exposed to the elements..The music is great.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|I like the blending of 20's music with contemporary songs. Will.I.Am has outdone himself on his work here. A nice variety of  music.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|Where to begin, some movies really do not need to be remade and here is a perfect example. It was an ok flick if you haven't seen the original. Again something's are better left untouched
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book definitely deserves 5 stars. It is an amazing book, with excellent descriptions and fascinating details.  It is full of mystery, magic, and wonder.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|An entertaining romp for an hour or so, nothing Oscar worthy but it was a fun time watching, good popcorn flick
B005DOKM9M|5.0|The Kindle Fire Sleeve Charcoal works great . I like the way it snaps over the Kindle  and how well it protects it.
B00932A4XE|4.0|A fun romp, was pleasantly surprised, had a few good laughs and was a good way to spend a bored afternoon, if you need something to fill a hour or so and don't want to think too much, here's your flick
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Ok so normally I don't create reviews because  it's a.pain. However I think this game deserves one. It was a good game until it stopped.working. After that I tried to.download it again and it still doesn't work. I am very disappointed
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|So I think everyone will get a different result after watching this movie, the different stories and jumping around the scene are somewhat confusing but all fall in to place, my two scents... Love continues no matter what
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging,fun and challenging. Great game needs more levels. Open different types of doors. Had fun playing and enjoyed the challenge of figuring out what to do with each item

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Some would go out on a bit of limb to argue that rock and roll music is dead, and has been that way for quite some time. But Andrew Stockdale, an afro-headed stoner from down under would argue the opposite point. (Although, to be technically fair, his band, Wolfmother, is really much more metallic rawk than \\"rock `n' roll,\\" per say.)<br /><br />With their brutal, simple riffs and rambunctious grooves, Australia's Wolfmother is a sludgy, doomy, stoner metal-influenced hard rock revivalist band whose sound falls somewhere between Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Pentagram, Rush, Jethro Tull, Deep Purple, Kiss, Cream, Ozzy Osbourne, High On Fire, Def Leppard, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, Rainbow, and fellow Aussies AC-DC. They also fuse in some Spinal Tapp-esque lyricism and Motorhead-sounding bass work. Their debut, an eponymous effort released via Interscope in 2006, was an instant success, and an effort that, in and by itself, affirmed the band's status as one of the finest old-school-sounding hard rock/metal bands of the decade. And if \\"Wolfmother\\" is not a modern-day hard rock classic, then it certainly comes extremely close to being one.<br /><br />Leadoff track \\"Dimension\\" could have been lifted wholesale off of Led Zeppelin's \\"IV,\\" as it is a feel-good hard rawker that grooves really hard with its rock solid, humming bass lines, Zepp-copped riffs, and oh-so-Jimmy Page-esque vocals. \\"White Unicorn\\" continues down this same path, as a viscerally-satisfying piece of heavy rock with propulsive, downtuned guitar licks (which are, again, borrowed directly from Page and Co.), and a muscular, moaning bass bottom. (An alleged bass solo is also included, here.) The bass again comes into the spotlight for \\"Woman,\\" a bass-driven song, and one that is graced by another exceptional bass solo. But it does sprinkle in the sparse use of spacey, atmospherically proggy keyboards, though, too.<br /><br />Another big early standout is \\"Where Eagles Have Been,\\" in that it begins sounding very much like a Beatles-esque ballad, as it adopts a very Beatles-influenced acoustic guitar psychedelia. But when Stockdale comes into the mix singing lines like \\"City of dreams,\\" the tune suddenly becomes more like a Red Hot Chili Peppers b-side than anything else. \\"Eagles\\" also stands out in that it builds really well, and reaches a powerful climax where the guitars turn from clean and melodic to dirty and mean. And it even rips out a wailing guitar solo, too.<br /><br />\\"Apple Tree\\" is an unusually speedy blast of White Stripes-inspired garage punk/rock saturated with fuzzed-out guitar and bass distortion, and a really cheesy (yet also really catchy) overall vibe. \\"Joker And The Thief,\\" then, brings back that same White Stripes influence, and offsets it with a healthy dollop of Nirvana inspiration, peppering staccato, bobbing guitar hooks with proggy, psychedelic guitar textures (including a melodic guitar outro). But back on the metal side of things, \\"Colossal\\" is a very appropriate name for the next song seeing how it is a powerfully heavy, big riff rocker boasting commanding guitar riffs that lumber out of your speakers like a truckload of logs. And it is all anchored by heavy bass lines and soundly thumping skins.<br /><br />Crunchy guitars, accomplished clean singing, and a heavy reliance on trippy, ethereal keyboards make \\"Mind's Eye\\" a really ambient and atmospheric number. But \\"Pyramid\\" is a hard-rocking affair whose grungy, thundering riffs, and thick, fluid bass end up creating a strong Motorhead breeze that is felt flowing throughout. \\"Witchcraft\\" possesses an undeniable blues-rock flavor delivered in the form of meaty, lumbering, Zeppelin-inspired riffage and rhythmic drumming. With that said, though, the track is mostly of note for featuring an epic flute solo that rivals the now world-renowned one heard on Jethro Tull's \\"Aqualung.\\"<br /><br />Of the three songs that remain, two of them find Wolfmother exploring balladry. \\"Tales\\" is a nice, laidback, neo-proggy ballad. And then, following \\"Love Train\\" (a clunky, metal-tinged funk-rocker with tasty, bluesy guitar soloing), comes \\"Vagabond,\\" a backyard porch-flavored acoustic strummer with more bluesy solo runs.<br /><br />Although it might not sound particularly unique, there is a lot to enjoy on \\"Wolfmother.\\" If you like great riffs, memorable solos, thundering bass, traditional (and natural-sounding) drums, wailing vocals, and terrifically infectious songs, and aren't afraid of just a little bit of musical cheese, then you are sure to whole-heartedly agree with this fact. Quality stuff!back, neo-proggy ballad.

B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I think the low raters had expectations of how the cd should sound and because it didn't meet their expectations they are disappointed.<br /><br />It makes no sense for an artist like Kanye to fall off as badly as the low rated reviews said.  I listened to the sample tracks on Amazon and had to have it because it left me wanting more.  Definitely an alternative sound and I really like it.<br /><br />Each track is a goody and I love the flow which is why it rates 5 stars with me.  Go Kanye!

B008IJT0CE|4.0|I live in a very noisy area with neighbors that don't know when it's bedtime, water from my neighbors apartment that sounds like it is coming through my walls with pipes banging incessantly at 2am. So when I found Relax Melodies Premium it was a godsend and I do indeed use it every night.<br /><br />What I have a problem (if you want to call it that) with is the &#34;difference&#34; from the FREE version and the $2.99 version of the software.<br /><br />The FREE version includes and I quote:<br />✓ 46 Outstanding high quality ambient sounds, including 2 binaural beats frequencies for brainwave entrainment.<br />✓ Mix your favorite sounds & music together with different volumes to create your own personal melodies. Create almost infinite possibilities!

The problem I have is most of the extras are sounds of water of some kind and almost all of the water sounds to me sound exactly the same.<br /><br />The interface is great and the ability to not only add different sounds together but to change each one's sound is great. It took me a few nights to find my perfect mix and now I sleep great. I could have very easily saved the $2.99 and gone with the FREE version or I would have even been happy to pay 99¢ for this great program. However, for $2.99 you have to give me something a lot different than what is currently here.<br /><br />My suggestion... try the FREE version first... if you LOVE it then buy it. Not necessarily because you need the 94 sounds (have of which sound the same) but to continue the development of this great program!but to change each one's sound is great.

B00CBQASCQ|3.0|\\"The Grandmaster\\" is Kar Wai Wong's first film in about six years since \\"My Blueberry Nights.\\" His latest film chronicles the life of Yip Man, a legendary martial arts master who had become internationally famous by a 2008 Donnie Yen film. (It took about eight years for director Kar Wai Wong to complete the film since he announced his intention of making this film in 2004.)<br /><br />\\"The Grandmaster\\" begins with beautifully shot martial arts sequence of Wing Chun master Ip Man (Tony Leung Chiu-Wai) and his foes (choreographed by Yuen Woo-ping). You will soon realize, however, that the director does not really intend to make an action film.<br /><br />During the fight scene that is set in dark rainy night, every single shot is meticulously framed and perfected to the point where, with so many slow motions and close-ups, the film's highly stylized \\"action\\" sequences are less dynamic and more graceful than those in Donnie Yen films.<br /><br />Kar Wai Wong, it is clear, wants to put emphasis on Ip Man and other martial arts fighters as a person, including Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang), a retired martial arts master from northern China, and his daughter and martial arts fighter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi). She is romantically attracted to Ip Man, who is a married man.<br /><br />I know storytelling is not Kar Wai Wong's forte, but the film's narrative is too uneven and disjointed, making some of the interesting characters such as Ip Man's wife (terribly wasted Song Hye-kyo) virtually invisible. Not only that; at certain points the film itself has almost become a story about Gong Er. Well, I didn't mind that, but I thought this film is about Ip Man.<br /><br />After all, this is a film made by Kar Wai Wong, director renowned for his visual style. With action scenes that look more like dance scenes, his latest film will satisfy his avid fans, but for those who are interested in action or Ip Man himself as a person, the film is \\"The Grandmaster\\" is a little disappointing.Beautiful
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Of course, as most book series the more editions the better it gets. So much happened in the 23 chapters of this book. When you look at the timeline of the actual events its a mere few months but seems like a whole year or so has gone by because each character's life has had some major event.

This album is just as important to any Wu enthusiast,on the same level as Raekwons' \\"Cuban Linx\\" albums, Ghostface Killah with that \\"Iron Man\\" Record, \\"WUBLOCK\\" 2012. Hell, if u love Wu and don't have this, buy it now and get excited. If any of you didnt know that Wu was still rockin', check the cipher. check \\"Legendary Weapons\\", \\"WuBlock\\", Inspectah's new one, \\"Czarface\\", \\"The Man with the Iron Fists SNDTRK\\", and most importantly, Ghostface's new album w/ Adrian Young, \\"12 Reasons to Die\\" all 5 star classics

B0041H9N4W|5.0|Two college friends Keith(Chris Makepeace) and AJ (Robert Rusler) want to be in a fraternity but in order to be in they have to get a stripper for them for a party. They bring along a rich student named Duncan (Geedee Wantanabe) for the ride to the big city to go to a special strip-club called \\"The After Dark Club\\" where there are plenty of beautiful women especially Keith's old girlfriend Armaretto (Deedee Pfeifer) whom he hasn't seen in a long time. The club is owned by the desirable Katrina (Grace Jones) who is an Egyptian vampiress as it turns out the club is full of vampires who drink the blood of many people as the trio with Armaretto must battle the undead of the night.<br /><br />A very entertaining 1986 cult horror comedy cult classic from director and co-writer Richard Wenk! What began as a concept by Donald Borchers who is the producer of this film as he worked for New World Pictures in 1985 who had an idea for a film about college students vs. stripper vampires, Richard Wenk came off his hit short film \\"Dracula Bites the Big Apple\\" in 1979 as he was seeking something of a debut film and this was his chance. It did became a minor hit and gained a cult following since it's video release, what works in this charming horror comedy is the atmosphere with some dark humor. The acting is quite good even by Robert Rusler and Grace Jones is terrific as the title villainess as she is one of those singers who can act playing the seductive Katrina. Deedee Pfeifer is beautiful in this movie as i always had a thing for her since i saw this movie in theaters as a kid when i lived in St. Louis and she is indeed Michelle's sister, Billy Draco is good in the role of the psycho albino gang leader Snow and there's good and sometimes gory vampire make-up effects by Greg Cannom even with Katrina's transformation from stripper to vampire queen as her character is a bit like Orloff from Nosferatu in some way but as a female version. This movie pre-dates films like \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\" and \\"Bordello of Blood\\" years before them with the similar concepts and all, it even ahsa  good score by Jonathan Elias which sounds kind of Carpenter-esque in some ways and this is one of my favorite vampire films.<br /><br />This blu-ray R0 UK import from Arrow Films is an excellent BD and what some people here in the US don't realize that some foreign BDS mainly ones from the UK can play on US based players sometimes and this is one of them that plays on all regions. The picture quality is great with exceptionally crisp coloring that make the colors pop out and great extras like interview with Deedee Pfeifer (not in the US DVD), new interview with Richard Wenk, new commentary by Robert Rusler and critic Calum Waddell plus booklet with info on the film with collector's poster, 4 panal reversible sleeve options with new artwork and original posters, intro by Robert Rusler, Back o the 80s an interview with the producer, scrapbook of Scares which has Richard Wenk look over his collection of Vamp memorabilia, easter egg, behind the scenes rehearsals, blooper reel, Dracula Bites the Big Apple short film by Richard Wenk and Trailer. A definite must own for fans of the film and for fans of vampire films but please AVOID the US Image company version which is crappy as it has zero extras and bad PQ as this is the only one to get.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"The Lost Boys\\", \\"From Dusk Till Dawn\\", \\"Cronos\\", \\"Bordello of Blood\\", \\"Dracula (1931 with many other versions)\\", \\"Nosferatu (1922 and 1979)\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"The Hunger\\", \\"Near Dark\\", \\"Let The Right One In\\", \\"Let Me In\\", \\"Thirst (2009)\\", \\"John Carpenter's Vampires\\", \\"Subspecies Saga\\", \\"Vampire Journals\\", \\"The Keep\\", \\"Lair of the White Worm\\", \\"Sleepwalkers\\", \\"The Monster Squad\\", \\"Captain Kronos Vampire Hunter\\", \\"Vampire Hunter D\\", \\"Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust\\", \\"Evil Dead 2\\", \\"Blade Trilogy\\", \\"Underworld saga\\", \\"Daybreakers\\", \\"Salem's Lot\\", \\"Vampire Circus\\", \\"Twins of Evil\\", \\"Dark Shadows\\", \\"Horror of Dracula andsequels\\", \\"30 Days of Night\\", \\"Count Yorga\\", \\"The Omega Man\\", \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Blood The Last Vampire (animated and live-action versions)\\", \\"Once Bitten\\", \\"My Best Friend is a Vampire\\", \\"Habit\\", \\"Immortality aka Wisdom of Crocodiles\\" and \\"Fright Night 1 & 2 and 2011 remake\\".sequels\\", \\"30 Days of Night\\", \\"Count Yorga\\", \\"The Omega Man\\", \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\", \\"Blood The Last Vampire (animated and live-action versions)\\", \\"Once Bitten\\", \\"My Best Friend is a Vampire\\", \\"Habit\\", \\"Immortality aka Wisdom of Crocodiles\\" and \\"Fright Night 1 & 2 and 2011 remake\\".
0307887448|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning - it immediately grabbed me, as I grew up in the 1980s and am a big fan of dystopian fiction. What surprised me was how much my 12-year-old son loved it too, even without having grown up in the 1980s. I hope there is more from this author!
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I love this app. I got it for my son and I play it more than he does. The  only complaint is that when you get to the highest levels the things needed to complete missions require a large amount of  &quot;tokens&quot; and it takes a long time to accumulate enough of them.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great addition to the other Crossfire novels, but I want more!!  I can't put these books (or Kindle) down.  I want the store to continue.  Sylvia, please keep writing about them!
B00B04NJI0|5.0|For what this movie is it's not bad. It's not bad at all. It's actually pretty fun to watch. If you're a real fan of horror you get a little bit of everything here. Some cheesy B horror, bat s*** crazy Japanese horror, some art house, french, scifi, dark comedy horror, you name it. For what the directors were given to work with you can tell they put a lot of effort into their little segments. The only 2 I had a problem with was G for gravity and M for miscarriage. Those 2 just seemed like the directors just decided to pocket the cash they were given and at the last minute before they had to submit their work just recordered something on their iPhones quick.  To me this doesn't really seem like an anthology film. It's hard to explain to but I'll try. Imagine a tv show like Robot Chicken or SNL. You get 30 minutes of stringed together 3-5 minutes skits of comedy. Well this is like that but a hour and half long and horror oriented. People are on here slamming it because of some of the segments in particular the Japanese ones and a certain one which leads the viewers to believe a child is being molested. They just don't get it. If they had ever watched movies like A Serbian Film, Life and Death of a Porno Gang, or Salo then they'd understand that in some countries directors aren't afraid to get a little bit more graphic with what they make. And, if they would have ever seen movies like the Dead or Alive trilogy, Robo Geisha, or Vampire Girl Vs. Frankenstein Girl then they'd know what to expect in that specific genre from Japan. Having said all that if you're strictly an American horror type fan and aren't into reading the occasional subtitle then this isn't for you. If you're well versed in you're horror taste then sit back and enjoy.

B00COQKE2M|1.0|I am writing this review because I am very disappointed with this album. I first heard the album when they leaked it on the web. I'm glad I listened to it before I bought it. It would've been a great album without the rap. I can't be the only one out there that can't stand rap. Rap doesn't belong in a rock album. In my opinion the stupid rapping ruined the entire album for me. You couldn't pay me to buy this garbage. I used to be a huge fan of Falling In Reverse but I can't stand this album. If they didn't add the stupid rap to almost every song it would've been a good album and I would've bought it the second it came out. Instead i'm very disappointed and telling everyone I know not to buy it.

0399157565|1.0|I haven't even finished reading this book yet as it feels like such a trial to get through it. I'm forcing my way through it just so I can basically tick it off and get rid of it. From the very first line it annoyed me as it described Kay's watch in overly arrogant detail. It seems that everything to do with Kay has to be so much better than everyone else, all her possessions have to be the best possible. She's the best at her job, her cooking, and every man that meets her wants to sleep with her. Book after book it's just like boasting about how brilliant she is supposed to be. Instead of new material and interesting storylines this book goes on about all the old ground. Lucy (the most smug and boring person in the world) and all her so called genius intelligence and supercars, helicopters etc. Marino and his drinking problems and sexual assault of Kay that somehow needs to be repeatedly mentioned throughout every book. Benton coming back from the dead. There's also a serious lack of any normal conversation between Kay and Benton throughout this book. It's all secret anger and resentment which is then mentioned in a coded conversation about something else. It's barely a marriage at all, they hardly see each other and they never talk when they do.<br />Apart from all the old ground, the actual story is mind numbingly slow. It must be around 10 or more chapters before Kay even gets a body to look at. It seems to me that the writer has run out of material for these books and is trying to spin out what was successful in the past. I'm going to make this my last one.
B0012YYZYU|5.0|Amazon does a great job in packaging and mailing item in a timely manner good job<br />In addition to the Led Zeppelin album this album is the best music for anyone's collection I highly recommend purchasing the Led Zeppelin<br />The song remains the same

1594746036|5.0|Review:<br />The story follows Jacob, a young American boy, on his journey to not only find out more about his Grandpa, but more importantly, his own sanity. As it turns out, the two go hand-in-hand.<br /><br />Middle Grade or Young Adult?<br />Based on the way the action paces itself, and how long children linger on terrible events, I'd actually classify this as more of a bridge book between Middle Grade and Young Adult, rather than a flat out YA novel. In other words, I think this book would appeal to both younger and older children... and I think it would be an excellent \\"read aloud\\" bedtime story book. (Er... for the children who aren't easily scared.... because while this book isn't a horror story, there is some very creepy imagery going on in it)<br /><br />History:<br />The storyline is adventurous, mysterious and fraught with perils, not to mention laced with history.<br />I always appreciate a book that can tie in real world history in a way that makes children more curious about the past... and if listening to Grandpa's stories, or the scene with Adam and the bomb doesn't do that, then I would think the Bog Boy at least would spark children's interest and imagination. Plus, the series promises to deliver quite a lot more in terms of historical referencing with the upcoming sequel.<br /><br />The love story:<br />There are several love stories that unravel through the book, which for me was the more \\"YA\\" aspect of this story... but even though Jacob's own love story happened rather quickly, I found it entirely believable. For once, there was a YA love story with a good, solid reason as to why the girl would fall in love so quickly. All too often I read YA novels where the characters seemingly hate each other, and then three sentences later, they're in love. In Rigg's book, Jacob's \\"love\\" story is, as one would expect from a teenage boy, really something that began more with lust (as in, he thought she was really hot... and then all the \\"Oh, and she's pretty cool too\\" stuff came later). Maybe that is because this novel is written by a man, who actually had the benefit of experiencing life as a teenaged boy? I don't know, I just know when I read YA love stories, more often than not, I'm very aware that the teenaged boy in the story is acting NOT like an ACTUAL teenaged boy, but like a sappy, boring page from some starry-eyed teenaged girl's fantasy.<br /><br />The Magic:<br />This book is fantasy fiction... and it uses the fantasy aspects to propel the story in compelling ways. Often times I read YA novels that have fantastical aspects and feel like I've read the same story I've read a million times over, except this time it was a Mermaid instead of a Vampire. The \\"Fantasy\\" is just a gimmick to draw kids in, but could easily be replaced with a million other things.<br />In Riggs' book, I felt that the fantasy was an integral part of the storyline. It wasn't thrown in casually, it was the mechanism that made this story run. Riggs was able to take moments in history and make them even more real to the reader by not only giving us characters who had been there and lived through it, but by using the magic in this world to allow the main character to experience it as well. The same magic will also allow the main character to delve into the past even farther, and that's something that I'm rather excited about.<br /><br />The Villains:<br />I'm not going to say too much, that would be a bit of a spoiler... but I will say I really loved the villains of this story. Their whole reason behind doing what they do is perfect, and reflects a kind of child-like mentality.<br /><br />The Writing:<br />I really enjoyed Ransom Riggs writing style. It's fast paced, with page after page of action to pull the reader along. He also does a great job of creating an eerie atmosphere. The book reminded me of one of the haunting stories from A.S. Byatt's Little Black Book of Stories... the forest is filled with monsters, BEWARE!<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />READ THIS BOOK! Read this book aloud to children!!! Everything about this story was a pleasant surprise, and I can't wait to read the next one.ion:<br />READ THIS BOOK! Read this book aloud to children!!! Everything about this story was a pleasant surprise, and I can't wait to read the next one.
0545259096|4.0|You know, since this book has been sitting in my shelf for over a year, I thought it was time that I finally read it. I initially put it away because I did not want the series to end. Now, that I have read it, it didn't feel as satisfying as I thought it would.<br /><br />Plot. First of all, the plot felt the exactly the same as the first two books. They are still fighting against their wolf-selves as well as threats from the human world. Nothing much change other than the fact that now their were finally going to make a decision about their future and well being.<br /><br />Love. The love interest of course didn't stray away from what has already been grown. Of course now, Sam is just trying to wait for Grace and is even going to great lengths to protect her the best his can. In this book, I found more interest in the minor characters, Cole and Isabel. Their story really shined and brought of light a lot of truth.<br /><br />Cure. Well, that's one way to put it. But does is work is the question.<br /><br />Ending/Future. I think the way the book ended is not very satisfying. I mean, yeah, they have to place to live with no fear of being hunted and also a cure. Still, I felt like this book ended vague, cause you can still have questions but also complete cause it ended on a good note.<br /><br />Forever is a good conclusion. Emerging with a good ending, leaving the reader hopeful, Forever is great.
B00C7EGV5U|5.0|I discovered Chinua Achebe only recently in reading &#34; There Was a Country&#34;. Here , in an earlier work , one of fiction - he draws a careful image of life in an Igbo village in the time leading up to and just after, the arrival of the white man. The village culture he so economically, but so thoroughly, lays open to our gaze is strong in tradition and culture, well ordered and occasionally shockingly brutal. The hero of the Novel is a flawed character in a number of important ways . Nevertheless we are drawn to him in other ways and brought to sympathise with his clear vision of the importance of tradition to the survival of his culture. Alas for him, his culture begins to be taken up in the cogs of the Western World and it is a one way process. His effort to stand against it is futile and his frustration finally boils over.<br /><br />This is a beautiful Novel showing a loving respect for the Igbo people and their origins , and it would seem to be the fruit of Achebe's attachment to his Grandfaher rather than his Father who was far more content with white influence. A must read.

B004X2M9VY|5.0|I like Matt Smith's version of the Doctor, but like many I thought that the show was doing something wrong lately. I always like the fact that Doctor Who treated kids like the adults they would one day be and revived the kids the adults once were. Lately it had changed that and became very much a kids only show. While season 6 starts out like that it begins becoming more complex and eventually finds the heart of most people who watch it. So if you gave up on Doctor Who after the last regeneration don't. It always takes some getting used to, but in the end it starts finding something for everyone.

B00577WFOU|4.0|A fine effort by the Mark III lineup, although a little too much emphasis on the new album, Burn, and not much attention paid to some of the previous classics. Same observation as on the Live in Copenhagen '72 disc (Mark II)-way too much soloing, which cuts down on the number of songs in a set, but that is a long-standing Purple signature.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is just another example of Baldacci's skill as the master of plot twists and turns.  Every time you think you know what's going on, Baldacci spins you around.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The story jumped around so much, I never knew what country the story was in. Or what character was telling the story
B00CLD65X0|5.0|If I could give it 10 stars, I would. The story telling is beautiful and I have fallen in love with every character.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|I disliked that so much of the book was repetitive.  I liked the theory of the book and found it to be easy to comprehend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I cant believe it ended the way it did.  I WANT MORE!!!  Love this crossfire series.  Cant get enough of it.
0425263924|5.0|I have enjoyed following Gideon and Eva from the start.  This book did not let me down, and now can't wait to see what will happen next.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Beautiful costume, great character development. I even start to like the mean, snobbish granny as she has shown her wisdom in many ways. Love the show.
B003NTSBUG|3.0|Not bad, a bit like a few others I have seen though. Also a little predictable but well done anyway
1594136238|5.0|Defending Jacob held my interest from beginning to the end. However, I was disappointed in the end.I guess the author had to end it the way he did.
B00C5XBAOA|2.0|Like many other reviewers have said, this set would have received higher marks if Sofia's and Amber's heads did not pop off immediately. Both heads came off while I was opening the box. Since my girls, ages 3 1/2 and 1 1/2 love Sofia so much, I gave it a chance. However, the heads continually fall off and at this point, are lost and we are left with headless bodies. The heads on the rest of the family are securely attached and the girls still play with those. Just wish the manufacturer had thought that one through.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|True-to-life courtroom procedures are a minor sideshow to the family and community dynamics highlighted in this page-turner.  If you like Scott Turow, you'll love this book.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I thought this book was gonna be a big thriller but it wasn't all that great in my opinion. C'mon....people being eaten by a car? How lame is that? More like a kids book. I like Stephen King's books and he writes some of the greatest thrillers but this one was just stupid.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think the game is great. I Love the fact you update with new cars all the time and new courses.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|what caused people to give bad reviews? i love it, shouldn't you love it too? god! can't you people look at apps closely
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves this game and can play it for hours. We have it on 2 phones and a kindel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a neat game, keeps you guessing, and uses all types of problem solving, I would definitely recommend this game to others who like to play puzzle games
B001NLL93W|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because I loved this book. Like I couldn't put it down. I even had some very late night s reading it just wanting to finish the chapter and then some.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|So addicting... its a very fun game if u like bingo. And u can play without having to do in app purchaces like many other apps.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this app!! it is so much fun.!!I recommend this game to everyone! its so addicting to play. I cant wait to play it after school!!
0307476073|4.0|I read this book strictly based on reviews and they didn't do justice to the powerful beauty of Cheryl Strayed's writing.  The subject matter was compelling -- I spent a lot of time camping and hiking in my youth -- but not always relatable.  My mother is alive and well and a huge part of my life.  I never did drugs.  I haven't been divorced.  So this was an odd choice for me, but the exquisite writing was addictive.  As best I can, I fully felt the pain of losing a mother, of watching a family fracture, of living with the fall-out from bad choices both big and small.  This is a worthy read for anyone, not just adventurers.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I thought this game was great.  Sure the dialog was a little cheesy but the storyline was good and the game had a good mixture of puzzle and hidden object.  I was pretty hooked once I got through the free trial which is why I purchased it.
1781162646|3.0|A melancholy coming-of-age story narrated by the late middle-aged protagonist in the present day, Joyland's main narrative is set in 1972 and focuses on three college students working the summer at the North Carolina amusement park that gives the novel its title.<br /><br />While there are two ghosts, two psychics, and one serial killer in the novel, these elements often take a back-seat to King's depiction of his protagonist's struggles with love, loss, and a giant dog costume. It's an enjoyable, low-key affair in line with other relatively recent King efforts that include Blockade Billy and The Colorado Kid, in which the genre elements often fade away behind the more realistic concerns of the text.<br /><br />Indeed, the ghosts and psychics make me think of the Yeats poem \\"The Circus Animals' Desertion\\" in the sense that King might be better off abandoning such elements entirely when he writes novels that are so much concerned with other things: the supernatural and the suspense tropes herein feel like props, taking up the space that might be better expended on straight-ahead, non-genre world and character creation instead. Recommended.
0061726834|5.0|This book is just beautiful. The cover, the words, the characters, all of it beautiful. It's funny that in the world Lauren Oliver has created, love is a disease, something to be cured, and treated, love is exactly what I felt for Delirium. I absolutely loved it.<br /><br />This is one of those stories that you don't read everyday. It was something new and exciting. Every word in this has you hanging, dying to continue and find out what will come next.<br /><br />It was hard to imagine the world that Lena, Alex, and Hana live in. A world without love. It makes you realize how much it inhabits your life everyday and what it would be like without it.<br /><br />And that ending! Lauren Oliver, how dare you!<br /><br />I really cannot wait to sink into Pandemonium.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I was stuck between getting a liquid cooled CPU cooler or the Cooler Master Hyper 212 plus. I opted for the later as I read about probable leaking problems with liquid coolers and also that you will have to find a location for the liquid cooler's fan unit. I was considering a corsair liquid cooler but decided to go with this one based on reviews that claimed that this cooler was a lot quieter. I was not planning on an serious overclocking and this was the best cooler for mid range overclocking.  I bought a second Cooler Master Blade Master fan as this unit only comes with one fan. I installed the 2 fans in a push-pull configuration. It really cools the CPU down to run between 30-40 degrees C. Installation can be a little tricky but you can find some youtube videos to help you with the install. You will have to apply a thermal paste before you install this unit on top of the CPU. Do not worry about over-tightening the cooler over the CPU. The screws will tighten and let you know when it is a good fit. It is a large CPU cooler so you want it to have a good fit over the CPU. This cooler also looks very good in your case if you have a glass window on one side.
B003O86FMW|4.0|While I was at times frustrated by the pacing of the story, the power of the author to pull you in made this book difficult to put down. Highly recommend this if you've read the first one.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Loved the third novel. So wonderful to see Eva and Gideon finally getting hitched. Can't wait for the final two instalments.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun and challenging. a great way to end your day. if you like mystery you'll like this game. its free afterall.
B009K0OL06|5.0|I wonder what is in store for Emily, Nolan, and Aiden in the 3rd season???? Can't wait!  I am ready for some more Revenge/11
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I'm very pleased with Battery HD Pro.  Big improvement over the minimal support for battery monitoring provided with Kindle Fire HD.  Nice professional job on this application.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I felt like I sped right through this book!  I'm going to re-read it!  Just couldn't get enough of their love story!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I did not want it to end! I loved the wit and the vivid characters...mixed with the intriguing and fascinating history. Loved this book.
B00062PN6I|4.0|On the less expensive, much less expensive side, sound is adequate.  Cancels the outside side adequately, though the sound quality for bass is a little lacking.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The horse is really realistic this game is so fun<br /><br />You get to take care of a horse so fun
B009NTNHJU|3.0|This disc's crying in shame..boo hoo..it's a wash! Get in the studio and do what you do..or get out the way..we know you're talented, so give us that! It's Barbie b****es!
B00007BHOE|1.0|Ok, so I rate this a 1 star. I get the movie and I'm super excited to see it. It's got a nice case, discs were clean. But my Playstation, Blu Ray Player and DVD player can't read it. What kind of format is it because I wanna watch it!
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Hounded was a very interesting book.  It enters of the world of Druids and ancient Celtic Mythology.  I enjoyed the story and the characters.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to adults.  There is strong profanity and sexual innuendo.
B005HSL626|4.0|I played this game everyday and so does my brothers...... It keeps the boredom at bay but lately it's really been pissing me off.... You play it a couple of times and it works but when you click to play again it freezes up and you can't slice fruit anymore; I don't know what's wrong with it. I don't want to delete it but I think I'm going to have because it just isn't working =(... I would give it 5 stars it's this wasn't the problem...
B00BWRKVVS|5.0|I love that now you can have both movies in the same case for a great low price. My only wish is that they would stop stacking the dvds on top of each other in the case.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really like the game. It runs smoothly, has great graphics, and no glitches. Definitely 5 star worthy. I don't see any way it could be made any better.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|a great way to get the whole collection of toy story, the case is cute only wish the discs were in cases. a great addition to any disney lovers collection
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Awesome book . Took me 3 months to finish.it was very descriptive and interesting. The way the story was told was so good it felt like u were in it.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|This film was ok. The best part by far was John Krasinski's character. I had just finished reading the book and when I learned there was a movie I was curious to see how they had converted it. There were definitely some changes that I thought were not necessary and would have been better as is in the book. Some of it was cheesy as all get out. But John Krasinski was HILARIOUS and it's a good plot. It's not a waste of time.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Good game for mobile devices,not boring. But, like all glu mobile games,it is hard to play without in game purchasing.But it still lots of fun,4 stars.
B000PTYUQG|5.0|As a musicologist and music theorist, we are enjoying the historic recordings of these great works. We wish that personnel lists were included, but that is difficult to obtain in these cases.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I thought this was a great book and do not understand why everyone else is complaining.  Yes, the book starts off a little slow, but a lot happens that prepares you for the books ahead.  I am excited that there will be more books because I cannot get enough of Gideon and Eva.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it!  I couldn't seem to put it down.  It's a fantasy story for many woman.  Thanks for a great read...
B009UNGYHG|5.0|You never need to carry a charger with you and look for some place to plug it in,just put it in the case and it will recharge
1609611543|5.0|As I started to read the book, I thought he had written the book directly to me. I started to follow the diet, and I lost inches and pounds quickly, along with joint pain. Then the stomach problems started going away. Amazing!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is the worst because whenever i try to play it, it never works. waste of time and time
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a fun game that wasn't too hard but had its challenges.  Somewhat addictive.  I would recommend this game..
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I set the alarm to &#34;I'll praise him in the sanctuary&#34;  Helps me to wake up everyday feeling BLESSED!, and Thankful.  Thank You LORD GOD!!!!!!  It keeps the alarm setting for the whole week.  Now, how do I get all the songs I uploaded from my computer into my cloud?
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a nice game and I would give it 5 stars but my buckets disappear and redstone doesn't drop anything.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does what its supposed to. Easy to read, love the radar and hourly weather. I've used other programs, but they were slow loading. This program update quickly with few problems.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|I am not a movie snob by any means, but I bought this to try out my new 3D TV and was pretty dissaponted. It is sort of like watching a 3D movie from an old anntenna on the roof. All of the darker scenes are coverred in a snow like pixelation. Still fun to watch but it looks like it was converted on someone's personal computer.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I have this installed on my Kindle and find it to be a very useful app. I usually check the battery every couple of days, more if I am in the middle of a really great book! If you are a \\"visual\\" person, you will like this battery app'
1608871827|5.0|What a phenomenal art book that traces such a complex film production. If you want to see how Del Toro makes it happen, buy this. A great addition for your coffee table!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|My Kindle HD Fire fits in nicely and is well protected. cables can be attached with it closed which is convenient for charging. The &#34;stand&#34; feature is nice for reading as it allows one to use the kindle &#34;hands free&#34;. Seems to be well made (in China, of course).
0345803485|1.0|So my friends made a big deal about this book and series saying how great it is. I am really question their taste.<br /><br />First off I have no ideal when high tea is or have met anyone that needs tea to start the day lunch afternoon and what ever. The mix between the British influence and American is rather annoying to go between . If the mother or 'father' was from England it would have made much more sense. Being a college student that had a friend that majored in English and love the British writer, it just showed me how much the auth did not understand the youth of today. Than the music chooses that these people loved. Omg I had to ask my mom. I never even heard of some references for singers let alone the songs. And the ending seemed rushed as if the author didn't really know how to wrap up the book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The writers did the best possible job with the movie after its predecessor got cancelled. Almost everything got upgraded - the action, the tension, the story, the acting, the character development, the visual/sound effects.<br /><br />Since this was most likely the last you would see of the Serenity's crew on a TV screen, it was appropriate that they had to make it darker. They had to make this last adventure mean something to both the characters and the audience. There will be heartbreak. That being said, it's still not without the humor, the sense of family, the atmosphere that made the TV show such a success even after its cancellation.<br />I still wear my Jayne hat every time I watch an episode or the movie.
B00008G7UF|5.0|This movie is very hard ot get ahold of for some CRAZY reason, no streaming, not on iTunes.  But here it is, cheap and wonderful as I always remembered it to be.
0763617105|5.0|Good story line.  Great illustration.  My 2.5 year old loves this story and I love telling it.  Definitely recommend for toddlers.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|once you get started it's hard to stop.  I haven't finished. yet but I like it so far.  I'm looking forward to greater challenges as I move to higher levels.
1423113462|5.0|I got this for my 9 year old son and he read almost constantly until he finished the book. He said it was great and asked me to buy the next one in the series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app works great! Very reliable- doesn't drain the battery and is easy to set.  It's also easy on the eyes in the middle of the night.  Perfect for us.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Good songs to bring back good memories growing up! Ran across this on an Amazon sale. Very good to hear again!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This does not work on Kindle HD. Thankfully it was free. Unfortunately I can't give it no stars. Kindle HD needs an easy to use print app.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Good songs to bring back good memories growing up! You can NEVER go wrong with Genesis! Love this album! Bought it on sale.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I really thought it was a good book I think they are coming out with a eighth book if so I really want to read it
B000VXJMYG|3.0|Good songs to bring back good memories growing up! Ran across this on an Amazon sale. Very good to hear again!
B0063M22QO|5.0|When get stuck and have to wait some where this fun little games is great to have.  Fun to play and runs smooth.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's your first horses and it looks so real is the best pet to every have you should get it very  fun
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This book was utterly amazing. I could not take my eyes off of it. It makes you cry, it makes you laugh, but best of all it just gives you a warm and fuzzy feeling inside. The book is much better than the movie!! But even through the rough times in this book it always had a way to bring the mood back up.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|It is hard to explain , how a movie can end up as such a disaster , surely someone must have realized during it's making that it just does not work  - on any level. I was not expecting the music to surpass the wonderful performances of say  , the tenth anniversary of the stage musical. I was not even expecting the acting to surpass the wonderful performances in say , the 1998 re-make movie. However I was not expecting this level of ineptitude , the singing and acting are both ATROCIOUSLY BAD ! It was , without almost any redeeming qualities , ok so some of the sets and costumes are well done ! That gives it the one star !  I can only imagine that people who liked this production , must have no idea of the previous Movies or Musical productions , or are maybe inclined to like the leading stars because they are Aussies - who knows! I must admit to not being able to sit through all of it and skipping through some of it. I can only take so much of a bad thing! Just devoid of any soul  , Hugo's classic vision made into LA cosmetic celebrity garbage. Avoid at all costs , or it may spoil your appreciation of the source material - yes it's that bad!
B00CEJ2EKE|5.0|cant stop listening to this album great buy favorite album by them so far<br />the ep is also great you wont be disappointed
B00BEYYO8U|4.0|Very good on the whole , with some great action sequences . One thing you can say about the Craig movies is they keep a pretty good pace , there is not much to time to think or get bored. This can also be a negative however , as there is almost no time for any character development in the story . I do have some criticisms , so dropped one star. I thought Craig looked like he was kind of going through the motions in the beginning. Bardem had some good moments , but was not quite a believable character , more of a bad  caricature at times. I do believe this would be the perfect time for Craig to bow out , by the end of the movie , he looks about 50 yrs old! With a lot of the peripheral characters being changed , the next movie would be better with a new Bond definitely. Don't get me wrong Craig has made 3 very good Bond movies , but now we are getting into diminishing returns with him as Bond. TIME FOR A REBOOT!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|why would you end a book in mid thought.  then there wasn't a date for the next book so no worth it
B007VTUYWW|3.0|Nice movie filled with adventure and exploration. Immerses you into the life of Lara and even sticks to the talents of Lara from the game. Worth a watch on a boring rainy day with the companion who's looking for something to pass the time by.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I liked the story. It has good suspense built to it and I like the flow of the story with some unexpected twists.
B0094M2SCI|4.0|Loved the movie, full of action and a great storyline. It was a great mix of action and dialogue that keeps you watching for more. Enough gore to enthrall you but not over the top that makes you sick or uncomfortable.<br /><br />Recommend for the Vampire fanatics, or casual movie fan.
0679805273|5.0|These folks are incredible. Best customer service ! GREAT QUALITY! The book is a fabulous treat for a high school graduate or college graduate.
0231161166|2.0|I guess I was looking for more of a pop-sci book that introduced the new field of epigenetics without being too bogged down in technical speak or overly-analytical. Unfortunately this book did not quite satisfy what I was looking for. I did not enjoy many of the examples presented by the author to help explain various concepts associated with epigenetics. I also thought the book focused too much attention on technical jargon.<br /><br />This book might interest readers who actually work in the field of science or medicine, but I will definitely look for a better, more readable book on this subject.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was AMAZING. It was so good tht I had 2 read it again :P I would totally recommend reading this
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It just seemed to me to go on and on for no reason. It just could have ended sooner. Not as good as first two.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is a magnificent book that explores the wonders of nature but yet gives the thrill of and adventure to an unknown land with many key aspect that give it it thrill. This book let the words take over your mind. This book is like a amusement park for your mind, it has the ride that you knew and are found of, but also has the rides that gives you excitement and joy that when you finally get the chance to explore it your mind is beyond blow and you fell as if you where one with the rollercoaster and you felt every bump and rump it had to offer.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|I was disturbed by the title and almost didn't purchase, but after reading other reviews I took a chance. Excellent, exciting story. She did what she had to do to survive, and she did it with heart, strength and courage. I read this book in one sitting because I could not put it down.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Just started playing this recently so far I am enjoying this game. Great graphics definitely not a boring game. So many options to choose from.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|Her voice range is amazing, each song is a treasure. Cecile Mclorin Salvant's song What a Little Moonlight Can Do is a testimony to her beautiful voice.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book gives one a lot to think about. No matter what your beliefs are, the experiences are hard to refute. Some parts are filled with medical terminology that may be hard to understand but it is worth reading through it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I needed a new cord and selected this one. It works fine and meets my needs. I chose the black because I could then distinguish it from the white iPhone cord.
1451662432|5.0|This book is not about a movie star (well, a little) it is about an immigrant with a dream and all about everything<br />that is wonderful about America.  It is the story of America.  Congress needs to read this book when they think<br />about immigration reform.  America needs our immigrants, we all do and down deep we all are.  Great read, deeply and painfully honest.  I have always loved Arnold but have a whole new respect now.  Thank you for sharing your story.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Its totally hot!!! I'm not disappointed at all. I loved being inside Nora's head as she goes through some of her infamous clients. I think my favorites were Kingsley, of course, and the rock star!! I've read everything in this series, so if you've loved the others then this is a must read. Thank you Tiffany Reisz once again :)
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Never saw this one but heard about it.  I like the way the editing made the back and forth between the time frame seem so seamless.  Great acting and such a warm story line.  I think I'll buy this movie.
076781326X|5.0|...&#34;Oliver&#34; is such a delightful, warm movie.  I have watched it many times, over the years and am always thrilled by the<br />awesome performances of Mark Lester and the entire cast!  Cheers!
1608871827|5.0|I just got the book.<br /><br />After months of tracking every piece of artwork, every trailer, every commercial, I figured there wouldn't be much in here that I hadn't seen.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />An amazing book.  Beautiful images, great text describing every stage of the production.  And the construction of the book is beautiful: when you see Raleigh Beckett's name badge, it's actually a cardboard badge tipped in, like an old fine art book.<br /><br />If the movie is anywhere near the level of excellence that this book reaches, we're in for an amazing ride.<br /><br />Can't wait!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|but I'm so glad I did!  4.5 stars!!!  What a well told story.  Not too preachy, political, or judgmental.  Great main character; reminded me of Bridget Jones.  Sweet, funny, and poignant.  Loved it!
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|Just awful. If I could give it no stars, I would.  It was trite and  most of the time the film was too dark.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours and $5 on this.
1455518999|5.0|excellent reading.....Jack Reacher has a competitor....it stays with the storyline well and will make you finish it wanting more...fun and satisfying
B00CWY76CC|3.0|not bad, if only it would stop asking you to rate every single time you pass a level. but so far its pretty easy yet fun
B00AKO93JK|5.0|I've tried a number of workout apps and got this one when it was the free app of the day.  This is the only one I use now.  Good variety of workouts. Easy Interface.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I love this series. It has drama, a rich guy, a naive girl, catty girl jealosy and passion. I am more of a fan of Gideon than I was of Christian Grey.  Gideon and Eva were a bit more realistic.  The passion scenes are not inserted everywhere randomly which gives this series the edge over the 50 series.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Very well written story with memorable characters.  Telling this story through two narrators was a good choice.  I enjoyed reading this book and look forward to others by Kathleen Grissom.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app sometimes it gets a little slow but that doesn't matter this games I recommend for any girl who loves horses and likes going through the whole prosses of taking care of horses
B003F3NEBG|5.0|An excellent film and Blu-ray two disc set.  My only complaint (and it is a very minor one) is that the episodes are not strung together into a unified whole.  They are seperated by intro and end credits as they would be if you were watching the original broadcast.  It does not reduce the enjoyment of the movie, but I do need to be sure to keep the remote nearby so I can skip the fillers.
0547884591|3.0|There are many pearls in the middle of his \\"aren't I the coolest guy on earth?\\" style of wring.  of writing. He clearly researched his topics such as how to cook steak properly or how to serve a hard boiled egg. But the substance of the book could be presented in 1/10 of the space that it now fills. I am surprised that he did not include a video of himself doing one-armed push-ups while wearing a bikini.<br />But there is a bottom line here, which is that I would buy or borrow the book,write down his various recipes and use them. But he certainly the sort of person I would invite to my home for dinner.
B002R2K6LC|5.0|If you're new to Kings of Convenience you will not be disappointed.  This album is a modern interpretation of mellow folk rock - think Simon & Garfunkel.  Great music!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Easy enough to figure out, fun to play. Some challenge are more mentally stimulating than others. It's also too easy to just randomly try to find the clue.

B007HGPBRC|5.0|Mortality is the last of Chris Hitchens' books by necessity, a book he hoped  would teach readers something about what it is to struggle with death, come to grips with it, and then accept its inevitability. Because he was a man who was a truth-teller (Hitchens truths so sharp and cutting that they make you wince) and because he let nothing stand in the way in what he said about North Korea or JFK or a poorly written book, or something the government did that irked him, or the Royal Family, he treated the subject of his approaching death in the same way he talked about the less daunting topics he investigated--an exercise in finding the truth. I warn any reader that the details of his struggle with esophageal cancer might put you off. Early in the game, he decided, you see, that he would try anything that doctors recommended, and he bore bravely the effects of various treatments, some of which were excruciating, that finally, didn't work. He was avowedly an atheist, so the comfort of faith held no attraction for him, and he wasn't about to put his stock in the words of priests. Through the whole  ordeal, he kept writing as much as he could, using all the talent at constructing beautiful prose he had learned over many years. So alongside with the descriptions of suffering, there is everything else I've always appreciated in his work: his habit of going to other writers he admired, wise ones, classical to modern, to see what they say about life and death; his bold way of saying exactly what he thinks, regardless of the consequences; his clear sentences studded with unfamiliar words which when looked up in the dictionary have the exact meaning required for what he's saying; his habit of not falling back in his philosophical positions just because he's having a hard time; and finally, the best thing, examining something closely, so closely it's often painful, to tell us about. In this case, he's doing his customary &#34;close reading&#34; of the most painful topic of all for every human  being alive.  He does, then, triumph over his mortality. In this little black book, he gives us the final gift he can bestow, the truth about the worst thing we face, through what he thinks and what he does about the approaching time when he will no longer be mortal.for every human  being alive.  He does, then, triumph over his mortality. In this little black book, he gives us the final gift he can bestow, the truth about the worst thing we face, through what he thinks and what he does about the approaching time when he will no longer be mortal.
0812993845|5.0|Not having time to sit down to read books, I get tons of audiobooks from the library to listen to while I work. I can see where one might find some parts a bit tedious if reading it like other reviewers, but the audiobook is very animated by a fabulous reader, which made it much more interesting to hear the same situation told by Lottie and then Fliss, and really there wasn't that much repetition of the same situation as their views were from very different perspectives. It kept me very entertained, and when I wasn't listening I was very eager to get back to work to hear more. It is somewhat formulated like TV comedy, rather reminded me of Shakespeare's \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" in the crazy antics and comedic timing. All in all I enjoyed it very much.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|If you are expecting anything like Endgame or 13 , this is different - more experimental with southern rock influences.The leads are still phenomenal and the great arresting  megadeth riffs we all love. Dave and Chris Broderick are probably the most underrated metal guitar player team ever.<br /><br />Some of the songs didnt flow for me like in \\"off the edge\\" , how I think this album is grower .  Bright spots here : Kingmaker, Blackest Rain , Blackest crow, forget to remember .
B004EPYZUS|1.0|Liked the actual movie but disc arrived VISIBLY scratched......bad quality - had to hire this movie again from the local dvd hie to watch the ending...
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This film was nominated for both Best Actor and Best Screenplay for the 2012 Academy Awards for good reason.  Denzel Washington's performance is nuanced and compelling while the screenplay is true to the realities of the human condition. The film portrays people who have both good and bad qualities in a complex morality drama in which character is on trial.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very clever.  Definitely need more levels.  10 was the toughest. I cant wait for more. A must have app. Don't give up on the last level.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|its one of the best I have ever ever played to good amazing love that it's bloody pretty cool cant beat it
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|I played the free app and I picked. I haven finished this game yet that's way I gave it a five star. when I do finish ill rate it again. so far I'm having fun with this hidden object game.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Excellent book again, look forward to the others, miso Happy it didn't end.<br />It's a must read for series for all of those that Loved Fifty Shades of Grey!!<br />I wish there were more series likes these!!<br />Thank you, Thank you!!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I liked the book it started out good but got confusing and a little boring.  But towards the last few chapters it got better.  Hated the ending. : /
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book has so many twists and turns that you don't know what will happen next.  Every page opens a whole new world!  Very original!
B001KP2J3U|3.0|Though this film conveys its story adequately, my view of it is greatly influenced by two things.  One is my having seen all the Poirot episodes starring David Suchet, and two is my having seen Mr. Ustinov and Maggie Smith in \\"Hot MIllions\\" about a week before watching \\"Death on the Nile.\\"  By comparison to Mr. Suchet's Poirot and to his own subtle performance in \\"Hot Millions,\\" Peter Ustinov's Poirot evokes a rugby player posing as a ballet dancer.  Even his scraggly mustache comes in a distant second to Mr. Suchet's precisely delineated adornment.  And poor Ms Smith is so restrained as to disappear almost completely into the wallpaper, where she is joined by some other competent performers.<br /><br />The quality of the performances may be attributable to the fact, if true, that the director and cast were not allowed to view dailies during the shooting or to the unpleasant conditions prevailing on location, which I assume featured hot and muggy weather not pleasant for actors togged out London style.  So I wonder how much shooting was done on the replica boat constructed on the London sound stage.  The behind-the-scenes feature on the DVD stresses the replica's fidelity and shows the construction of it, so I assume it was used extensively.  The question not addressed was how practical is such a replica when shooting interiors that call for wild walls all around and plenty of overhead space for lights.  This is the sort of stuff that's missing from too many \\"how-we-did-it\\" features.
B0049VZ222|5.0|love the show and can't stop watching it. I am going through all the seasons now to get caught up.
B00915G6WQ|2.0|We thought this was the newest series for 2013 as it was advertised, but it was the season for 2012. It was deceiving when it said &#34;Season 7 - 2013.&#34;<br /><br />The delivery time was very positive.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I can only imagine the time spent in traveling and taking down both airman's exerpience.  It was riviting, heartwarming, revealing and one heck of a read.  How you found them; how you took on this project, I can only commend you as an author.  I have been to Bremen, I have been to the north coast of Germany; I have been to Sande where a bunker sits titled, too huge to blow up.  To know the honor code for many German soldiers, needed to be told.  I only wish this book was a mandatory read for school children.  It gives an insight to both a German soldier and American soldier.  I could not put down the book; only wish I could have met both of these men.  Thank you, Adam Makos, for giving us a great read and insight into War from both sides.  Hope there is another book in the wings.  Lynn, Daughter of WWII Ranger
B001DPC4R8|5.0|Arguably the greatest album of all time. The 180 gram vinyl sounds better than any CD you can purchase. You can check in but you can never leave.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|A great followup to the previous two books, this is a terrific series.  I can't wait for the next installment.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I preordered it and the price dropped just before shipping... amazon refunded the difference. Absolutely worth every penny at its original price and to get the sale was a nice surprise.  The show itself is bloody, sexy and turbulent.  Best 10 hours of TV ever!
B00479SVBU|1.0|My car has a Aux input and this device worked well using both the Aux input and the FM transmission.  The music was clear although there was a slight hissing/buzzing between songs but I never heard it while the songs were playing.  I just picked up the unit today and I will be returning it tomorrow.  The folder/song navigation is terrible.  I copied my 10 folders of music to a SD card, inserted the card into the Soundfly and immediately noticed I could not navigate thru the folders.  It would skip around from Folder 1 to Folder 4 to Folder 10 back to Folder 1 - randomly - all while I am simply pressing the advance button.  Even worse is the fact you never know if it will advance to the next folder or the next song within a folder - there is no option to specifically choose how you want to advance.  I thought, perhaps, I had too many folders - although, they only took up 10GB of a 32GB card, so I deleted 5 of the folders and still the same problem existed.<br /><br />I had been hooking up my tablet to the Aux input in the car.  But I found I have gotten spoiled to the radio controls on the steering wheel which is why I wanted a player with a remote control.  If a song comes on that I am not in the mood to listen to, then I can use the remote to simply skip to the next song without having to wait for the next stop light.  I have decided to buy a small, simple MP3 player (size of an Ipod) with a remote control and just hook it up to the aux input.<br /><br />If you do not organize your music and are not interested in navigating thru your music, then this might be the player for you.  But if navigation is important, stay clear of this player.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Characters you will cherish,because their humanity is so apparent. Even those who are despicable you can understand their behavior in their history.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game because it messes with ur mind. its really cool and tricky its fun and amazing. I love it
B005S9ELVC|1.0|Gangster Squad, as many have observed, is a one-dimensional, dumb and badly-written film that largely wastes the considerable talents of its cast.<br /><br />But Gangster Squad is far worse than just another poorly-made film. It deserves to be condemned because of its profoundly evil theme. It actively promotes police violence and extreme government authoritarianism.<br /><br />The core message of Gangster Squad, repeated from beginning to end, is that sometimes police have to abandon the law and use criminal methods to fight crime, and that this is a good and heroic thing to do.<br /><br />Gangster Squad celebrates and cheers on extreme police violence and murder, illegal police wiretapping, warrantless searches, and in general police lawbreaking of all kinds.<br /><br />This is a vile and repugnant message that is a great danger to a free society.<br /><br />Ideas have consequences. Art - even extremely bad art, like this film - can deeply influence minds. I shudder to think of police, lawmakers, and citizens watching Gangster Squad and thinking, \\"Yeah, that's right, sometimes you just have to ignore the law for a greater good.\\"<br /><br />Imagine a badly-made film that promoted rape, or racism, or murder. Most people would agree that it should be condemned. That is also the appropriate response to Gangster Squad. It is despicable trash promoting a dangerous police state agenda.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it does not work when I touch it it just loads and then it comes off. I don't even get to the screen that you tap to play

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game! It was challenging without being impossible. This will be a favorite! I would recommend it.
B002QCAXOS|4.0|This is a quirky, sexy, mystery story, made by a small British studio on a small budget, and made in time when small productions could still get an audience, though I suspect its American audience was quite tiny. It's biggest interest is the way it foreshadows the clash of cultures that really started impacting Britain around 1990, when drug use and unmarried births got so high they began undermining most other British institutions, especially the Church.<br />But back to the story. I won't provide much detail, you can read that elsewhere. The police detective in the story (Edward Woodward), who is investigating the disappearance of a teenage girl, is shocked and amazed by what he learns about the people on the island community of Summerisle, because they are so contrary to the quaint ways of folks back on the Scottish mainland. Perhaps the first, and most enjoyable part of this is how everyone in the tavern sings a dirty song about sleeping with the innkeeper's daughter, just as she's leading him to his room. (The Wicker Man has three clever songs in it, so it's billed partly as a musical.) And when he tries to sleep, the beautiful daughter played by Britt Eklund, sings a siren song in the next room, trying to entice him to come. Her singing is rather good, as is her naked dance of joy.<br />As he continues his investigation, the detective uncovers more suspicious evidence the young girl was murdered and the townspeople are in collusion, covering for it. His disbelief doubles and triples as he witnesses cult dances to pagan gods, and no sign of any Christian worship. Everything seems confirmed when he meets the Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee and looking very foppish in his 70's era coif. The Lord explains how the Island must continue its reclaimed pagan religion to keep the apple crops coming, their main export.<br />Determined to find the truth, the detective plots how to break through the Lord's and the people's lies. But little does he know, the jokeis on him.<br />So I recommend this flick as an interesting diversion, if you can live with the small production values. It's well made, has some good acting and has a fun, but ultimately frightening story.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Have to say im really getting addicted.  This game makes you really think things out.  Absolutely loving it!!!  Thanks for making it free!!  Gotta go back and play now.  Enjoy it, I am!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|It is awesome. I love all the features it has, they are really nice. I loce this game so much.
0515123447|4.0|another good book by Child.  I started out with book 8 and then started the series and am trying to catch up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great, easy summer read, but you become totally engrossed in the characters. Just finished book 2 and can't wait to start book 3.
B001EBWINQ|4.0|Loved the fact that was black and white. Loved the story about the things people do for love. Great lesson
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a sad story but  very uplifting at the same time. There are decisions to make by the main character and other characters in the book that really make you think. Well crafted. A unique story. Riveting.
0062080237|5.0|One of the things I truly enjoy about Mr. Gaiman's stories is that they are rarely about the destination. As Lao Tzu is often quoted saying, \\"A good traveler has no fixed plans, and is not intent on arriving.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman is in the category of authors I read because their words take me on a journey through thoughts and ideas that are only sometimes parallel to those in my own mind.  At other times, their ideas tangent mine, doing a flyby with a single point of reference, and sometimes they swoop in from another dimension through a wormhole I never saw coming.  I enjoy immensely the opportunity to see the World through eyes fronting twisty minds that are open to the Wonders of the World, and to revel in the spinning, careening and dancing visions their stories engender.<br /><br />As an aspiring writer, myself, the works of these authors, very much including Mr. Gaiman, are an inspiration to take the road well traveled (as all story plots are), and yet look around with new eyes, making new connections, describing old ones in terms less thought of.  They also remind me that the journey of the story, not the destination, is indeed the goal, and that includes all the curling twists and turns, fascinating dead ends, and pauses at the center of the labyrinth, regardless of how 'relevant' they may seem.<br /><br />In American Gods, Mr. Gaiman has done this again, making good use of World mythology to inspire the story.  I have not yet read the new addition, but I am very much looking forward to seeing how his preferred scenes go - I am sure they greatly enhance enjoyment of the journey.
