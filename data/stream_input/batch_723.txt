B000WQ9UA8|2.0|I don't understand why everyone is calling this \\"Britney's best album.\\" Yes, she sings it, but that's pretty much the only involvement she has with it. Yes, the songs are catchy and fun, but Brit didn't write any of the songs, and had nothing to do with the music, so why should I give her any credit? ANYONE with a decent voice could have sang these songs.
B0007MAO0M|5.0|A lot of snooty western-ophiles thumb their noses at \\"Silverado,\\" I guess because it's fun and enjoyable and not completely revisionist, pointing out how terrible the west REALLY was, as all westerns post-Leone apparently have to be. That's too bad, because this really is one heck of a good flick.     Written and directed by the guy who wrote \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" and \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" this movie has much of the same race-to-the-climax flavor. Fortunately, like all good westerns, it also takes its time and allows us to savor the landscape and the dialogue and the characters. Everyone involved was playing at or very near the top of their game, in particular the Kevins (Kline and Costner).    The special edition is a lot of fun, too, and worth a couple of extra bucks even though it's still not expensive at all. It includes a \\"Silverado\\" deck of playing cards, a booklet on the history of the western (that doesn't mention Clint Eastwood, oddly), and a couple of good documentaries. There's a 20-minute interview with Costner on how he got the role and how he played it, and as usual his insights are brilliant. There is also a slightly older documentary, about 40 minutes long, on the making of the movie, featuring much of the crew and Kevin Kline. A supposed \\"history of the gunfight\\" documentary narrated by John Cleese is actually just a series of trailers.    There is one commentary track, unfortunately not by the director but by three adademic western authorities, who spend most of the movie joking with each other and hawking their own various books and documentaries. It is of virtually no interest, though we do learn that John Cleese's hat is the only \\"authentic\\" western hat in the film.    But the play is the thing, and get ahold of this film and watch it again if you haven't seen it in awhile. I'd forgotten how really good it is. Apparently it was intended to \\"bring back\\" the western, and obviously it didn't, but in fact there are many elements here that point toward the great westerns of the last 20 years, from \\"Dances With Wolves\\" to \\"Unforgiven\\" to \\"Open Range\\" and the recent \\"3:10 To Yuma.\\" This film belongs on the same shelf as those, with the same attention to detail and the same rigorous quality. But there is one crucial difference: the others are merely brilliant; \\"Silverado\\" is also one heck of a lot of FUN.

B000EBD9TY|5.0|The music at the beginning of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" sends jolts through me that stir my emotions like a violent wind whipping flames through my soul every time I watch this DVD. That may sound dramatic, but it is truly how I feel when I hear the music of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\" To me, it is not merely the music of a film's score or music that is representative of a single film, but it is the music and the representation of an entire era - an era in which unmatched cinematic history was created. It is the awareness of the stage production that came before the film and the lives lived by those involved in creating the unrivaled work of art that \\"Streetcar\\" was and still is. We shall never again see the likes of Marlon Brando, Vivien Leigh, Karl Malden, Kim Hunter, Elia Kazan, Tennessee Williams, and others who brought \\"Streetcar\\" to life.    Marlon Brando is breathtaking, both physically and artistically, in this film. He plays the role of Stanley Kowalski, the brutish brother-in-law of Blanche DuBois, performed, shiningly, by Vivien Leigh. Stanley, the brute, is a character whose value system is quite contrary to that of Marlon Brando who portrays him in this film. Marlon reportedly once said that Stanley Kowalski exhibited \\"everything I loathe in men.\\"     Early on in the film, Stanley meets his wife's sister, Blanche, and takes an immediate disliking to her. Then, throughout the remainder of the film, he works to systematically break her already fragile spirit, driving her further toward insanity - a state of mind she has teetered on for some time already. Stanley is not a man completely devoid of human feelings, however. Despite his egocentric tendencies, his crassness, and his crude behavior, he loves and cares about his wife, Stella, and is loving, tender, and needful where she is concerned.     In one scene, after Stella and Stanley have fought, Stella goes to stay with their upstairs neighbor and Stanley, revived from a drunken state with a cold shower forced upon him by his poker pals, stands haplessly (his clothes dripping wet)at the bottom of the stairs, tearfully, his face wrought with pain and his hands grasping the sides of his face, calling for his wife, \\"Stellaaaaaa!\\" It is a cry heard around the world and a scene replayed over and over again by fans, reviewers, and talk show hosts for a long time afterward. Stella succumbs to her feelings for Stanley and his need for her in that moment. She makes her way, slowly, to the bottom of the stairs where Stanley has, tearfully, fallen to his knees. She falls into his arms and covers his face with passionate kisses as he lifts her up and carries her into the house. \\"Don't ever leave me,\\" he says.     Soon after his reconciliation with Stella, Stanley is back to his usual ways and his torment of Blanche is ongoing and relentless, culminating in a scene later in the film in which Stanley physically, emotionally, and sexually assaults Blanche while Stella is away at the hospital, preparing to give birth to her and Stanley's baby. Blanche is driven over the edge by the act. Stella returns from the hospital after giving birth to find her sister in an even more fragile state than before and makes the decision to commit Blanche to a mental institution. Stella's heart breaks for her sister as her sister is taken away and she lashes out at her husband, Stanley, whom she faults for her sister's circumstance. Despite this, Stella's final words in the film ring unconvincing when she tells Stanley never to touch her again and when she vows to never go back home to him again.     \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" written by the incomparable Tennessee Williams under the unparalleled directorial expertise of Elia Kazan, is among the greatest of the greats in films and filmmaking. Each time I have seen it, it has left me with a longing -a wishing to have been there to see the stage production and to have had a part in the creation of this film masterpiece, to have known the players, and to have watched them work in putting together this, one of the best pictures ever made.    For those considering purchasing this two-disk DVD set, it not only contains the film version of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" but it also contains outtakes and commentaries, including a touching tribute to Marlon Brando by the wonderfully talented Karl Malden. Marlon Brando's screen test for \\"Rebel Without A Cause\\" is also on one of the disks as well as other inclusions that I was pleased to find.
0743277457|3.0|The author is a remarkable achiever in chess and boxing, with an aggressive and selfconfident personality. But in the title and its ad blurbs I had raised different expectations. I am not certain how many would pursue \\"excellence\\" following Josh Waitzkin's advice, or how many might even wish to try!  We need to cultivate much more cooperative than competitive personalities in most fields of endeavor (sports not necessarily included).The book is good reading albeit the title and selling methods should have been different.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|Overall the cd is good.Unique,and odd but good.If you appreciate musical talent and all types of instruments,you will like this cd.I happen to like that M shadows decided not to scream on this album.The only problem I really had was \\"dear god\\".For some reason them doing country just doesn't work for them.I think \\"scream\\" and \\"afterlife\\" are awesome.This cd is worth checking out,but will be too odd for most traditional music listeners.
B000V6BE6C|4.0|After my gf bought me this cd on tuesday i listened all the way through and had a disgusted look on my face after, I could not believe that this was the same heavy hitting band that wrote waking the fallin and the same guitar crazed metal heads that wrote city of evil, but unlike most people i always listen to a cd a few times before i really give my opinion about it.      This album is very different then a lot of songs the band has written, it seems to be a lot more radio friendly which could be a good thing and a bad thing all at once.  Most songs seem to catch on after a while and you find yourself singing along and bangin your head.    The only real stand out on the whole cd is a song called A Little Piece of Heaven.  When i first heard this song I was like wtf is this, it sounded like a bad high school band fight song but then I heard the Lyrics and was like ok M. Shadows is a sick SOB!!!  The song basically talks about his gf cheating on him so he murders her and has sex with her dead body, then she haunts him killing him and then they both come back, get married and kill everyone at their wedding.  All and all its a funny song that grows on you.    Anyways i give the cd a 3 1/2 but since that is not available ill give it a 4 but i would pick up waking the fallen way before i get this!!!
B000A3DFZE|5.0|This is a different Clapton album, it is not string bending blues but it is good music. So he decided to do something different, if you want Crossroads buy the record!! I have been a fan since I was a teen, a while ago, and I dare say I have every EC album, this guy has been around for more than forty years and he is like fine wine, he just keeps getting better. He is happy, he has a family, he is sober, what is wrong with that?     Doug Mizell

B000FS9FCG|5.0|\\"V for Vendetta\\" does not show how things could become, but is a look at how things have become in the U.S. and other countries as well.  To get a better idea of what the world has become (although the politicians are trying their darnedest to keep it hidden) one only needs to watch \\"V for Vendetta\\" to pierce the veil that hides the truth from so many.    This movie shows the psychopathic people who are in control of a country and how they are abusing their power, as all psychopaths do.  And although I am not endorsing the way that the revenge of \\"V\\" was handled, there is a sense of encouragement that one has while watching the movie.    I think that \\"V for Vendetta\\" is a very important movie in its own right.  It brings to light the true face behind the mask of those who are in power right now in real life.  It is a movie that needs to be seen by those who think that their governments have their best interests at heart.  To show them that 'Big Brother' is already here.
B000MRA5NS|1.0|The Blu-ray version does not have subtitles, unlike the DVD version which does.  A lot of the charm is in the dialog, which can be unintelligble.  I give the DVD version 5 stars.
0525950079|4.0|It's not possible to write a book as profoundly intriguing and moving as Pillars of the Earth, even if it is a sequel of that very book by the same author.  Why?  A lot of the appeal of such a groundbreaking book is in our fresh reactions to something unlike what we have read before.  Once you've had those reactions, a new book is seen through different eyes and with higher expectations.<br /><br />That said, most people will be pleased that they take the time to read the over 1,000 pages of World Without End.  But start your expectations lower than the way you remember Pillars of the Earth.<br /><br />I started late on Wednesday night and couldn't put it down until I finished today . . . with brief breaks for sleep and refreshment.<br /><br />At one level, the book is simply a soap opera based in the Middle Ages where youthful encounters set lifelong enmities and alliances into motion.  At another level, World Without End is a fictional history of the 14th century as seen through English eyes.  At a third level, this book creates a bridge between the 14th century and the 21st century by presenting modern sensibilities in medieval dress.<br /><br />World Without End returns to Kingsbridge, England, two centuries after Pillars of the Earth.  Kingsbridge, the cathedral, and descendants of the key characters in Pillars of the Earth provide the continuity.  But this is a Kingsbridge led by people who are either obsessed with never changing anything or by seeking personal advantage . . . regardless of the cost.  As a result, when there are problems, well, it's a problem to fix things.  Fortunately, the book features two extraordinary problem solvers -- Merthin, who can design and build almost anything and Caris, who can turn a profit better than the other wool dealers and heal better than the Oxford-trained monks.<br /><br />In the beginning, lives are changed after Gwenda steals Sir Gerald's purse.  Already in debt to the priory, Sir Gerald (a descendant of Earl Thomas, son of Thomas the Builder) gives up his lands in exchange for a meager pension and assigns his son Merthwin to be apprenticed as a carpenter and his son Ralph to serve as a possible knight in training.  Wanting to try out a bow that Merthwin had made, the boys trek into the forest with Gwenda and Caris, daughter of a wealthy wool merchant.  While in the forest, the four youngsters observe a knight come under attack and Merthwin becomes involved in a deadly secret.<br /><br />Almost all of the major characters in the book are introduced in the first 100 pages, and you'll follow them through the next 34 years (1327-1361) as they become allies and enemies of one another.  That's the soap opera aspect of the story.<br /><br />The historical side is covered by a deep exploration of relations between the church and towns and the nobility and farmers.  There are also side trips into the battles between the French and English and the development of Florence.  This is the century where the Black Death (bubonic plague) decimated Europe, and the plague is a major part of the story line.  You'll also gain a deeper understanding of medieval society as you observe how relationships among the characters shift as their position and status in society change.<br /><br />For those who like a compact story, World Without End will seem endlessly long at times.  But exploring all of those historical nuances takes a lot of space.  I thought that for the most part the historical aspect was well done, if a little too encyclopedic.  But at the end you'll know the differences among a landless laborer, a serf, and a tenant who farms land in exchange for rent.  Having taken a lot of medieval history courses in college, I can report however that World Without End is a much easier way to learn this history than by reading standard history texts.<br /><br />To me, the book's main flaw is in Caris.  Ken Follett tries to do too much with this one woman.  If the way she is portrayed had been split up among three or four characters, I think the story would have been more credible.  As it is, she's a little too 21st century for the 14th century.  And her position and attitudes shift way too much.<br /><br />The secondary flaw is in constantly pitting the good guys and gals against the baddies:  There's enough conflict to account for more than 25 books.  I frankly got tired of it . . . not because it was boring . . . but because I didn't get enough respite from the unrelenting struggles.<br /><br />For those who loved the cathedral building details in Pillars of the Earth, you'll feel rewarded in World Without End by learning about bridge building and repairing cathedrals.  Those who enjoy economic history will be fascinated by the social effects of the Black Death in creating rights and a higher standard of living for the downtrodden.<br /><br />After you finish the book, I suggest you spend some time thinking about the value of keeping good relations with everyone you come into contact with.  Those you meet in the way up you may well meet on the way down.been more credible.  As it is, she's a little too 21st century for the 14th century.

B000HEWEJO|5.0|I've enjoyed this movie many, many times throughout my life, and still had to buy it so I could watch it even when it's NOT Christmas time!  The picture clarity is excellent and I'm glad it's still the original Black & White as I don't think I'd like it as much if it were in color.    Others have already offered outstanding and greatly detailed reviews, but I just wanted to add that this movie is not only a heartwarming classic, but also teaches a wonderful lesson our children and grandchildren need desperately to learn.  Please do share it with your family.
1592332803|5.0|Colleen's book is highly informative and so easily read, not to mention beautifully designed.  I have made the fudge recipe on several occasions, and each time it's met with great enthusiasm and comments such as, \\"THIS is VEGAN?\\"  I purchased her DVD a few years ago, and both the book and DVD make excellent gifts.  Thanks Colleen for helping me to show nonvegans how to make compassionate sweet treats!
0684135051|5.0|I really like this book.  I read it from cover to cover like a novel.  I have used some of her techniques as well, with fantastic results.  I really enjoyed her writing style and I plan to purchase some of her other books as well.
0374105235|5.0|Such a well written book.  I saw Ishmael's picture on the back of the book and wondered how someone so affected in such a brutal way could so beautifully resurrect himself.    This book is a wake up call.  Read this book and realize that it is Ishmael's journey but it is for all of us to do something about it.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Sure Radiohead has experimented with their sound, sure Kid A wasn't OK Computer, but more or less, Radiohead has had a certain tone to them that was defineable. Hail To The Thief was the first (and only) real departure in sound. Radiohead is close to unidentifiable in this album, both instrumentally and vocally. Thom sounds like a much gloomier person (his voice is often unrecognizable), and the rest of the band match this theme as well. While some claim Hail To The Thief feels more like a collection of songs than a true album, I think the mood set in this album is very clear and consistent. This CD is hauntingly beautiful, I love every track, and know any devoted listener will find incredible pleasure in the tingle this Radiohead release constantly sends up and down your spine. Hail To The Thief is not an album to be overlooked! It belongs up there with OK Computer and Kid A as a true classic and revolutionary piece of art.

0385751532|5.0|A heartbreaking tale about the friendship between two little boys, Bruno and Shmuel, who had no clear understanding of what was surrounding and separating them beside a tall, barbed-wire fence.  Delivered by a clear and uncomplicated narrative, the Holocaust is seen through a different perspective -no ghastly descriptions, no monstrosities- and it's recounted with the profound simplicity of a nine-year old child.    Knowing history and considering the time/social frame, I do sort of agree with some reviewers who maintain that the character of little Bruno was perhaps a bit implausible, considering his age (nine, not two or three)and the fact that he was the Nazi Commandant's son at Auschwitz -and for quite a long time-.  But it does not matter, at least not to me.    In fact I think that the author was able to convey the innocence of childhood in a very straightforward, raw and achingly touching way, which will linger on because of its wrenching final message.  Well done.    I would recommend this book for young readers too (14+).

0805079831|4.0|As a run through the history of neoliberalism--basically, the raiding of state resources by capitalists selling 'magic of the market' snake oil, this is excellent.  And her chapters on the way the war in Iraq and the response to Katrina continue this process are extremely stimulating.  Her attempts to connect all this to the 'shock doctrine' of psychologist Ewan Cameron is a little forced, but the point that neoliberalism advances by force is well-taken.     But Naomi Klein, once the hero of the anti-globalization movement, has apparently decided she should start acting like a grown-up, or at least what the guardians of the American public sphere regard as mature ways of thinking.  So talking about ending capitalism is out, uncritically celebrating the legacy of Keynes is in.  Anti-globalization activists have completely disappeared from the picture.  To make her point about the evils of free market fundamentalism, she exaggerates the role of Milton Friedman and downplays the mobilization of US capitalists and the US state behind this agenda, which was crucial to its triumph world wide.  For someone who carefully avoids any reference to anything that sounds like Marxism (again, the grownup thing), she's awfully economistic.  And she underestimates the way neoliberals manufactured consent through such means as the conquest of cool by consumerism and the NGOs.  These problems aside, well worth reading.  For a lengthier treatment of this book, visit my website at the address next to my name.

B000I2MRHE|2.0|The 'idea' of this product seems perfect - baby is cradled by a \\"saddle\\" on a turntable that allows him to develop the neck and back strength he needs to crawl. Sounds great on paper, but in practice this thing was like a torture device for my little one. It seems to me that there is a very small window of time when the saddle would be useful and safe for baby. It's that time after he has the considerable neck and back strength to maintain the position - arms extended straight down and locked, head lifted high and steady, and legs extended straight back - but before he is able to crawl. If your baby can do what the baby in the picture for this product can do, he will literally be crawling within a couple of weeks, if he isn't already, and he will spend most of his time trying to wriggle off of the thing. But what if your baby hasn't reached that point yet and still needs to put his head down every few seconds? It flops over the front of the saddle, straining baby's neck and back. When I figured that out, I immediately packed this back up and took it back to the store. The playmat can be used without the saddle, but I was unimpressed with that as well. The felt-like material attracted every little piece of dust and pet hair in our home like a magnet. I'm not sure what this accomplishes that a simple tummy-time pillow under baby's chest would not - and the pillow is a lot safer, less expensive and more comfortable for baby.

B000ULQV0W|5.0|I read this book in high school and was really looking forward to the film.  I loved LOVED this movie and cannot say enough good things about it!  It was better than expected.  The soundtrack greatly added to the film, enhancing the stunning cinematography (if that's even possible).  It captured the amazing story of Chris McCandless--as sorrowful as it was uplifting.  Eddie Vedder was a great credit to the project.  Vedder's voice both captures the spirit of life on the road and the haunting turns in McCandless's path.  The vocals and instrumentals allow you to make the journey with Chris.  I HIGHLY recommend this CD (& it's currently on repeat in my car).  It allows you to immerse yourself in the spirit of the story.  Check out the songs: Long Nights, Hard Sun, and Society.
0618680004|5.0|Einstein knew over fifty years ago that dogma enforced by authority will always stifle truth.  Dawkins forcefully and eloquently argues against the powers of superstition and irrational blind faith that have held us back for centuries.  This is a powerful work of evolutionary biology, not just a diatribe against religion.  Our place in the universe is to know it and master it, not to lick the boots of a malevolent tyrant.  Atheists and agnostics unite, the only thing you have to lose is your chains!
B000SSGUEO|5.0|The previous customer is incorrect, SPACE TRUCKIN' from this concert was NOT previously issued.    This is a London show at Kilburn, prior to and NOT the Cal Jam 1974 concert, which may be confusing him.    Anyway, the booklet is incredibly informative, the sound of the remaster is awesome, and now we have a 31-minute version of Space Truckin' from the only British tour the MK III line-up ever did.    HIGHLY recommended.
B0002SG1OY|5.0|Arthur (or the decline and fall....) was one of the vastly under-rated LP's of the sixties..Somehow it got lost between the Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\" and the Stones \\"Let it Bleed\\"..As the years go by you can easily see that the Kinks were right even with the best..I see so many groups who have been influenced by them..XTC,TV Personalities,Van Halen, the Jam,even Johnny Thunders from The New York Dolls took his name off a Village Green Preservation Society LP track, in my humble opinion the KINKS RULE!!!!! Too bad they never received the promotion the other groups got from their record company, plus they had many money problems with their managers, and were banned to tour in the US which cost them greatly in the mid sixties..this remaster is a must for all the bonus tracks included which show that the Kinks left alot of great songs unpublished until now.There isn't a day that goes by with me listening to something done by this iconic group..Ray Davies and the Kinks are KINGS..Long life and long may you rule.... you have given this writer much happiness[[ASIN:B0000089A5 Arthur - Or The Decline And Fall Of The British Empire]]
B00008DDRX|5.0|Only the presence of Steve McQueen could have accomplished this amazing documentary of the event that started endurance racing. If you are a fan of Steve's work, a car person, a race fan or a person looking for a \\"book-mark\\" in history this is for you. Only the persona of a man like Steve could of fused the studios, the French government, the ACO (promoters of the event) and dozens of the finest drivers of the day, including drivers that to this day their records are yet to be broken into a film that even today stands alone. To have earned the respect of Porsche to add their assistance in a big way and the cooperation of Scuderia Ferrari and so many others shows the respect this charismatic American actor/racer had earned during his career. While todays Le Mans 24 hours is much different event this movie captures the flavor and drama of the spectacle.  In the big color program of the 2005 event paid homage to McQueens bringing the event to a much larger audience.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is one of the rare movies that I've watched multiple times. And every time I watch, it still has the same powerful effect on me.    Although the action is good, what makes this movie truly great is the message it conveys. After you watch the movie, look out of the window, you will see that the movie is playing in real life in the \\"good ole' America.\\" In V's words: \\"There is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting submission.\\" That's not what happens with the fictional Britain in the movie. It's happening in the U.S. with the Patriot Act and the like.    More than just pointing out the objective reality, the movie will give you a sense of hope. It is really moving to see thousands of people in their V masks marching in unison. It's a powerful force that once released, no government can contain.    So as the Fifth of November is coming, watch the movie and remember that: \\"People should not be afraid of their governments. Governments should be afraid of their people.\\"
B000ULQV0W|5.0|This album is amazing!!! If you keep in mind it is a soundtrack(some of the songs are short) it's a true work of art. I heard someone introduce Eddie Vedder at the premiere for the movie as Composer--SO TRUE.  Extremely enjoyable.  Very good album, can't stop listening to it.

B000Y179KO|4.0|I try to remind myself sometimes as a older person who quietly remembers what it felt like to be young and hip and with the crest of the wave of music backing up my life...that nothing much that I listen to would get more than a few seconds of listening by young people of today.  I try to believe that it is just their problem.  Hey, I even like John Mayer.    This album is well produced and has a good sound to someone who came of age in the 70s.  I liked all these guys as soloists and it's nice that they get along well enough (need a paycheck bad enough) to still give it a go.  I am enjoying the album just fine.  I just don't kid myself that a kid would find anything among the 700 songs on my player to give a listen to (perhaps the John Mayer?)  Certainly not Clapton, not Beatles, not Joni Mitchell, not Jackson Browne, not Bonnie Rait. Ha.  It's not twangy enough for the country stations.  This ain't the 70s.  The young ones don't know that we were cool.  Don't expect to hear this on the radio...good darn thing we have these cool little music boxes nowdays.    Aside from the generational comments...so far this sounds to me like it could use just a bit more edge.  Perhaps some, \\"I'm 60 and I feel it all shutting down on me...it's getting dark\\"

0525950079|5.0|It is a follow up and it isn't.  But for most people like me that read \\"Pillars of earth\\", it's a long awaited book. I'm not going to pretend to be a critic, so I'll stick to what I know.  It hooked me from the moment i opened the box.  I took me less than a week of long reading nights to eat through it, and it was worth the bags under my eyes.  It was like being reunited with a family member you always had a great relationship with, you just want to keep the conversation going. The Book starts about 200 years after the other book, although for new readers it doesn't matter if they haven't a clue of \\"Pillars\\".  Ken follet is a master of characters, he makes us fall for them, the way we felt, for first loves and we can help but loath the bad ones.  Hope you have the best of times reading it.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A great Movie!  A must see for those who think that the government is looking out for their interests.  It shows the corruption and greed that is behind the lies we are told by our leaders, and gives hope that we can stand  up to the oppression of our governments (particularly here in the US).  Hope that our psychopathic politicians can be brought to justice.     And it is great entertainment too!
1582701709|1.0|the copy of the book i ordered was poorly printed. blurred pages and some pages quite unreadable. i believe it was a manufacturing mishap. i have ordered many books from amazon and have never been disappointed. i ordered several of this same book for my sisters but theirs were fine.  as far as the book content itself it is interesting but a bit superficial  and requires a broader sense of self and the world to be beneficial.

You only have to read about 2-3 sentences per page and you can still follow what's going on (without having to actually wade through the excruciating dialog and descriptions).   2.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|So, the album is terrific, the best Springsteen has done since the Rising, but the packaging is horrific.  I only took the CD out once, and already it is scratched beyond repair.  The song Gypsy Biker skips to the point of sticking.  I don't understand the shear incompentency of people who design these cases:  you can cut down on materials and cost is ways that don't ruin the CD.  Look at David Glimour's On an Island, which uses a little nub of foam, or the last few releases by Tom Waits on the Anti- lable:  even his newest, Orphans, which uses the same cardboard squeeze-and-release style as Magic, at leaves enough room for the packaging to open enough to slide the disc out without mauling the thing.  So, thanks to iTunes, I was able to recover Magic, but there is still a bust of static in the middle of Gypsy Biker....download the album, don't waste the money supporting Columbia's poor choices.  (I had to do the same thing with Springsteen's Seger Secessions)
B00005JPWH|5.0|An excellent film. One that works on many levels, one that will inevitably lead to discussions afterwards. The  cinematography is outstanding, as is the overall technical aspects of the film. Unfortunately, probably will be overlooked at Oscar time. There aren't a lot of big name stars, but they all come across as authentic (perhaps that's why they were chosen?) representatives of place and character. The scenes don't go on too long, always a temptation in these kind of character driven movies. And, of course, the soundtrack is effective when used. And a very rich palette of place, colors and emotions. Having also seen \\"Grizzly Man\\", even though this is not a documentary, it has a much better feel for the Alaska wilderness. A very very good film (and quite long by the way). And a good one to purchase because you'll want to be able to view it again after seeing it in the theater (where it must be seen first to truly appreciate the cinematography).

B000002U82|5.0|No one can deny the power of Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\"  Released in 1973, virtually every generation of music fans has discovered its awesome power.  So what really makes this album so great?  Each song is beautifully composed and executed in a way that very few albums of any genre or generation are.    1) Speak To Me/Breathe-5/5.  \\"Speak To Me\\" is a sound collage intro put together by drummer Nick Mason.  It does exactly what an intro to an album should, set the atmosphere and mood.  \\"Breathe\\" is a slow tempo song with fantastic lyrics and beautifully played music.  The vocal duet between Richard Wright and David Gilmour elevate this song to a different level.  2) On the Run-4/5.  This is another sound collage with a background tape loop of synthesizer notes.  Many sound effects are played over the top of it to give an ethereal feel.  Not very good on its own, but fits in with the mood of the album well.  3) Time-5/5.  This song starts out with several clocks going off all at once and moves into a tick-tock tempo of drums and guitar.  Then, out of nowhere it moves into a heavy rocker with one of Gimour's best vocals ever and one of his best solos ever.  The lyrics are some of Water's best.  One of the best songs here.  4) The Great Gig In the Sky-5/5.  An absolutely beautiful piano driven ballad written by Richard Wright.  Essentially an instrumental, it does have a beautiful, soulful, female vocal, with no lyrics being sung.  It is absolutely astounding and very moving.  5) Money-5/5.  The most well known song on the album.  It was a single hit from the album, but doesn't really sound like one.  It has an odd time signature played out in the bass line, before breaking into an all-out driving rock song in the middle.  The lyrics are pretty good and the vocals by Gilmour are great, but the main focus here is on the music and musicianship.  6) Us and Them-5/5.  Another keyboard driven ballad from Richard Wright.  Absolutely beautiful performances all around, particularly Wright's keyboards and Gilmour's otherworldly vocals.  One of the best on the album.  7) Any Colour You Like-4/5.  Another instrumental composed by Wright and Gilmour, and as you would expect, it is driven by the keyboards and great guitar work.  Very well executed and fits perfectly within the album's structure.  8) Brain Damage-4/5.  This one probably has the best lyrics on it.  The vocals aren't the best here, but the music and choral background elevate this one to being great.  Slow tempo, keyboard and guitar driven.  9) Eclipse-5/5.  A phenomenal way to close the album.  Loud and bombastic, the lyrics sum up the whole concept of the album.  The vocals are minimal and plain, but the emphasis is on the music driven by the organ and ends with the heartbeat from the beginning of the album, bringing it all full circle.    Anyone with a love of music of any genre will absolutely love this album.  There isn't anything else out there to compare it to, since Floyd moved into a more guitar driven territory with their subsequent albums.  It is truly one of the greatest albums of all time.  No album collection should be without it.

I LOVE HOW CHRIS NOLAN DIRECTION IN THIS FILM I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WRITINGS I HAVE SEEN IN A MURDER MYSTERY IN A LONG TIME. I DONT THINK THAT I COULD LIVE MY LIFE LIKE LEONARD BECAUSE HOW CAN HE FEEL TIME. I THINK THAT I COULDNT BE ABLE TO LIVE THAT WAY. I HAVE CHILDREN MYSELF AND I WOULD BE SO SAD TO KNOW WHEN WOULD MY CHILDREN BE ABLE TO GROW UP BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I CAN SEE THEM IN A PHYSICAL SENSE BUT EMOTIONALLY I WOULD BE STUCK IN TIME. IT WOULD BE LIKE RELIVING THE SAME DAY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. I KNOW THAT IF I TOOK PICTURES AND WRITE THEM ON THE BACK OF THE PICTURE IT COULD HELP BUT THE FACT THAT YOU COULDNT FEEL TIME IS TOO PAINFUL THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT GUY PEARCE PERFORMANCE IS SO GOOD AND THAT HE SHOULD OF BEEN NOMINATED FOR BEST ACTOR FOR THIS AMAZING WORK. CHECK THIS MOVIE OUT BECAUSE YOU WILL ENJOY THE FILM FOR THE BRILLIANCE AND MOST OF ALL THE EMOTIONAL PAIN THAT THIS MAN WAS SUFFERING AND THE REVENGE THAT HE WILL DO TO SEE THAT HIS WIFE KILLER IS PUNISHED OR DID HE?REVENGE THAT HE WILL DO TO SEE THAT HIS WIFE KILLER IS PUNISHED OR DID HE?

B000Y44LBG|5.0|What the world needs is order and when Frank Lucas' (Denzel Washington's) boss dies, Frank steps up to the plate to take over Harlem. Being the astute businessman he is, he realizes there's a significant problem. Local drug dealers are buying their heroin from the Mob, then they get busted by the NYPD.  The NYPD takes the dope, cuts it down, and leaves enough of the evidence to convict, then resells the drugs to the drug dealers.      Frank figures if he can go to Vietnam, he can get the heroin straight from the fields and fly it in on US Army planes. He can use his substantial family  to act as distributors. He puts his plan into action and his \\"Blue Magic\\" takes Harlem by storm.  Soon, Frank has managed to do what  no other Black man could--he's making terms with the Mafia. He's living the American Dream, dining with stars and athletes, with a gorgeous wife on his arm--and he's still taking care of Harlem, too, handing out turkeys for Thanksgiving like his old boss did.     Meanwhile, Det. Ritchie Roberts (Russell Crowe) is taking law classes while he works the beat.  He and his partner make a million dollar bust--and anger the whole police department by having the audacity to turn the money in against his partner's advice.  This marks Roberts as a troublemaker.     Roberts has his own view of the system: \\"Judges, lawyers, cops, politicians. They stop bringing dope into this country, about a hundred thousand people are gonna be out of a job.\\" It's basically the theory so many people espouse about Government--it's not here to solve problems, but to manage them.  Roberts sees thousands killed everyday from drugs and related violence and wants to stop it. And, he wants to stop police corruption as well.     Roberts is not the kind of man who takes the easy way out.  When his former partner is caught in a tenement having shot a drug dealer with an angry mob outside, Roberts goes in alone to help.  His solution to get his partner out alive is ingenious--and keeps you on the edge of your seat.     It's inevitable the two men are going to collide.  The film essentially deals with the build-up of Frank's business, Roberts' investigation, and the ending for both men.     The supporting cast in \\"Gangster\\" was strong.  Of particular note are Ruby Dee in a nomination-worthy performance as Mama Lucas and Josh Brolin as Lt. Trupo, a cop so crooked he made the gangsters look good.       The research on this film is obvious.  I saw an interview with Denzel Washington talking about the time he spent with Frank Lucas trying to get into character. Even at an advanced age, the original American Gangster was still in charge.      Director, Ridley Scott did an amazing job recreating a 30 year old world.  The details from the rotary telephones to the music played are spot on.      Warning:  The world \\"American Gangster\\" depicts isn't often pretty--drug preparation, use, and abuse are shown in graphic detail. There's some nudity and violence; however, the film was not near as vicious as I expected it would be.

B000UJBYD8|3.0|Towards the end of 2005 The Cult decided to get their act back together after Ian Astbury got tired of acting out the role of Jim Morrison in Riders on The Storm (the former Doors of the 21st Century). After a successful tour with a new line-up The Cult would have a shot at a new album. On October the first 2007 \\"Born into This\\" came into this world.   Highly anticipated, as with each Cult album, \\"Born into This\\" didn't quite satisfy the majority of fans. Of course, it would be unfair to demand another \\"Love\\" or \\"Sonic Temple\\" album of the band. One of the great things about The Cult is that they've kept developing while staying true to that throbbing guitar sound and pounding on the chest and new age lyrics that brought them world fame in the first place.   I can understand that many rate this album as average or less. This is not the carefully constructed Gothic Cathedral that was the \\"Love\\" album. Neither does it have the lyrical consistency of 2001's Beyond Good and Evil. Thematically Astbury regurgitates some mystical lines about Light, praises his band (and himself) more proudly as any peacock could and delivers a motivational message (They can't break us/They'll never take us) that might better have been left to Tony Robbins. Not much new here. New is the flirt with electronic rhythms that give a decidedly Primal Screamish touch to several songs. The Cult borrow heavily from their own (song 9 sounds a lot like Black California) and the back catalogue of others (The Stones, Johnny Cash and others).   In my opinion \\"Born Into This\\" is not so much as a good album, but rather an album with several great songs. Dirty Little Rockstar is a monotone drone, Diamonds is a lyrical low in the Cult's oeuvre. On the other had songs like \\"I Assassin\\", \\"Born into This\\" and especially \\"Tyger in the Sun\\" are rockers worthy of any previous Cult album. Astbury's vocals sound crystal clear and Duffy and the other musicians form a cohesive unit. The most important point is that this is an album born form craftsmanship, something exceedingly rare in the music world today. The price of the three aforementioned songs is well worth the price of the album.

0385340559|4.0|Ok. This was a fairly decent book, which is why im giving it four stars. But compared to the rest of the Jack Reacher novels, this book is a joke. Most of Lee Childs Reacher Novels keep you guessing at the flip of every page, and the clues and hints are always changing. You are always guessing something else until you know it. I didn't feel that with this book, I was pretty much in the dark the entire time, stepping my way to the only conclusion. Then within one page, and im not exaggerating, within one page I knew the entire story. It was a decent book overall, but like I said it wasn't one of Lee Childs best books.
B000UOOT1W|3.0|Of course, there will always be two types of Santana fans: Those who cherish the band's \\"classic\\"-era output like \\"Black Magic\\", \\"Evil Ways,\\" etc.; and those who didn't discover them until the latter-day collaboration discs with the likes of Rob Thomas, Michelle Branch, etc.  I'm not sure which type of fan I am, because I like most of the songs on this disc.  But's it's not a perfect compilation.<br /><br />While the emphasis on more recent songs is understandable--there are at least FOUR other best of/greatest hits/essential collections out there--the exlusion of the Michelle Branch collaboration \\"I'm Feeling You\\" is hard to forgive.<br /><br />Of the new songs, only the collaboration with Jennifer Lopez really works.  The first single, \\"Into the Night,\\" with Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, is just awful.  Now, I realize Nickelback has sold millions of albums and all that, but Kroeger's droning monotone voice is completely wrong for a Latin-flavored song of passion.  Maybe the band felt obliged to work with him again after his song on SHAMAN (\\"Why Don't You and I\\") was re-recorded and made into a hit with Alex Band.  \\"Game of Love,\\" redone with Tina Turner doesn't fair much better, if only because it reminds one of how Michelle Branch's version was just that much better.<br /><br />For casual fans, this single-disc collection could be all the Santana they need.  But \\"Ultimate\\" Santana it ain't.

B000Y179KO|4.0|Well, the long wait is over and I must say well worth it.  After 28 years, Eagles fans have certainly missed the harmonies.  Well, you won't be dissapointed by \\"The Long Road Out of Eden\\".  If you're looking for a new sound, sorry.  But if you're looking for the Eagles you grew up with, you're in luck.  The old sounds, harmonies and lyrics are back with a vengeance.  \\"How Long\\" should have been the opening track, as it is an upbeat number sure to make the radio airwaves.  \\"What Do I do With My Heart\\" is a beautiful, tender ballad from Glenn Frey, as good as any he's ever penned and sung.  I especially liked \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\", \\"Waiting in the Weeds\\", \\"Guilty of the Crime\\" and \\"No More Cloudy Days\\" on Disc 1.  In my opinion, disc 2 is not as good, but there is still some good music there as well, especially the discs final track, a very excellent \\"It's Your World Now.\\"  Congrats to the band for getting back together.  As a music fan, I always appreciate it when the great ones return as the Eagles have here.  Welcome back and let's not wait so long from now on.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Hands down the best rock album of the decade.  I loved their first 2 albums and this one tops em all.  Every song is a winner and the subject matter is very cool.  My only problem is where do they go from here?  Not much more to say that hasn't already been said.  Buy it and rock on!

Still firmly entrenched in the mainstream pop genre, this album does not disappoint, with several tracks that merit being released as singles.<br /><br />First single \\"Inconsolable\\" is typical BSB, and is very similar to \\"Incomplete\\", the hit single from their last album.  Other tracks to note are the upbeat \\"Everything But Mine\\", \\"Any Other Way\\", and the reggae influenced \\"One in a Million\\" and \\"Panic\\".<br /><br />Of course there are the trademark BSB ballads like \\"Something That I Already Know\\", \\"Love Will Keep You Up All Night\\", \\"Unmistakable\\", and bonus tracks \\"Downpour\\" and \\"In Pieces\\" to keep ballad-lovers swooning. Another interesting track is \\"Treat Me Right\\" written by A.J. McLean of BSB and J.C. Chasez formerly of `N Sync.<br /><br />A track I REALLY like is \\"Helpless When She Smiles\\", especially the chorus, which goes \\"I'm a house of cards in a hurricane / A reckless ride in the pouring rain\\", and with fourteen tracks and two bonus tracks, you're sure to find a favorite too.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of mainstream radio-friendly pop music.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, November 2, 2007
B000002ILG|5.0|PRIDE, White Lion's major-label debut, is a great CD. Unlike most 80s metal bands, whose songs were utter nonsense, this band had an intelligence that belied their hairdos. Many of lead singer Mike Tramp's lyrics called for people to be more tolerant of each other, as well as to rise above their circumstances. The fact that Tramp opposes Indonesia's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000NOKA0S|5.0|In the late 1960s, Leonard Cohen was one of those fabled individuals of whom most serious music lovers had heard but who had not actually been much heard except through the voices of better-known singers who tirelessly promoted his songs. Over the years, Cohen became better known and has since become a cult hero in the world of those who like their music decidedly deep and decidedly dark.  I first became aware of Cohen back in the 1960s when I heard Judy Collins' haunting rendition of Suzanne. I liked that and I liked some other Cohen covers I later heard but never got around to actually buying a Leonard Cohen recording until some ten years ago. Since that time, I have gradually added to my collection of his music but did not acquire his first album until it was recently remastered. And what a piece of work it is!  Many have compared Leonard Cohen to Bob Dylan because both are masters of the English language and both are masters of poetic imagery. And like Dylan, Cohen has a peculiar talent for the blending of the sacred and the profane. You might even say that Leonard Cohen is Canada's answer to Bob Dylan. The last picture of Cohen in the attractive booklet that accompanies the CD even looks like Dylan does today! Despite the flattering comparison, however, Cohen is absolutely an original.  I like the dark, the brooding, and the bittersweet when eloquently and intelligently expressed, so its almost only natural that I am a confirmed Leonard Cohen fan. Every song on this CD, including the bonus cuts, is a winner. Suzanne is obviously the most famous cut closely followed perhaps by Sisters of Mercy. Good as they are they are not my favorites. Mine are Master Song, The Stranger Song, Stories of the Street, Store Room, and finally Teachers which is hugely evocative of the pre-commercial works of fellow Canadian Gordon Lightfoot.  On the Songs of Leonard Cohen, the listener is presented with an astounding body of work that, to paraphrase the updated liner notes, assuresCohen a place in the pantheon of great twentieth century songwriter/poets. There are precious few artists whose debuts are so auspicious as this. This is a recording that deserves a place in the music library of every serious music lover. Get it while you still can.
B000068FXX|5.0|This is a great remastered version of a great reflective CD by a great progressive pop-rock band. Supertramp are, I believe, highly underrated, possibly because of their commercially-attuned, easy-on-the-ears music, but that's our loss. This band had much more talent than most of the bands that were new in 1977 (I can do without the Sex Pistols, thank you very much), and the songs on their 1974-1979 albums imply that living in an upper-class neighborhood like Cape Elizabeth, ME; Western Multnomah County, OR; or certain parts of Seattle/King County, WA isn't as great as it seems. I know this because when I lived in that type of neighborhood as part of a special program, my neighbors sided with authority figures against my fellow students and me because of the whole \\"nimby\\" (Not In My BackYard) attitude. This is a CD that any fan of progressive music must own.
B0002KVULG|4.0|This 1979 version of Dracula (released by Universal) is one of my favorites, primarily because of the sensuous and charismatic performance by Frank Langella as the bloodthirsty count. Langella had performed in the 1977 Broadway production of Dracula and reprised his role in this film version. Purists will revile this production for not being faithful to Stoker's original. There are many changes in plot in this film version - for example, the roles of Mina (Jan Francis) and Lucy (Kate Nelligan) are reversed here, and Mina is the first to fall victim to the Count's murderous charms. The movie begins with a ship crashing into the seaside at the coastal town of Whitby in England, where Dr Seward (played by Donald Pleasance, and who also plays Lucy's father) runs his asylum for the mentally insane. Dracula appears to be the only survivor of the shipwreck, and Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve) salvages what's left of Dracula's belongings. Renfield (Tony Haygarth) transports Dracula's belongings to Carfax Abbey, where Dracula is staying. Mina, slowly drained by Dracula, dies, and her father Dr. Abraham Van Helsing (Sir Laurence Olivier) investigates her death, uncovering the dark secret of the Count in the process.<br /><br />I loved this movie adaptation of Dracula for the palpable chemistry shared between Langella and Nelligan (Lucy), making this one the most sensuous and romantic adaptations of Dracula. Langella and Olivier also do a great job in their respective roles - Langella's Dracula may be charming and sensuous, but one never forgets that this is a front for a murderous monster. Olivier plays the grief-struck father very ably, though it's his performance as the relentless seeker of truth in uncovering the mystery of his daughter's death that stands out. The atmosphere and sense of Gothic horror and suspense permeates the entire movie, from the muted color (it is leached to such an extent as to render it almost a B&W production), to the magnificent score by John Williams, the beautiful sets, costumes, and bleak cinematography. If judged by setting alone, I'd rank this as my favorite version of Dracula of all time. Though I'm an ardent fan of Christopher Lee (and his 'nemesis' in the role of Van Helsing, the great Peter Cushing), Langella's portrayal of Dracula is one of my favorites, after the legendary Bela Lugosi. Final verdict - may be reviled by purists, but if you're the kind that soaks up atmosphere in your horror movies, you may really like this version.ms, the beautiful sets, costumes, and bleak cinematography.

B000VS6P9Q|4.0|I just got this a day ago and have only listened to it once, but I really like the first disc more than the second. With that said there is still some really cool stuff on the second disc. My favorite covers include the songs done with Calexico, Jeff Tweedy, and Yo La Tengo. A cool mix of artist doing Dylan covers.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie and it's characters, so I purchased the video as I do with the ones I would like to see more than once.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this video for the romantic in everyone.  Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy is just delicious, from his looks to his voice he's just dreamy.  20 year old Keira Knightly us unbelievably adorable and beautiful as Lizzy -- Miss Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy's love interest.

B000UR9T8C|3.0|Many others here in these reviews have already pointed out how the inclusion of too many villians hurt this movie.  You would think the makers of this film would have learned from the horror that was \\"Batman and Robin\\" that that doesn't work.  The reasons should be obvious to a first year film student: put too many characters in and none end up getting enough screen time to be developed properly.  I think the most probable reason they do this sort of thing in superhero movies is because the most popular superheroes in comics, like Batman and Spider-Man, have so many great and memorable villains in their rogues galleries that, given the likelihood of getting only two or three, or maybe four movies made before the actor playing the hero won't come back to play the part again, or wants too much money, or is just too old, they have to put several villains in at once in order to hit all the ones that just HAVE to be put onscreen.  At least that's the only reason I can think of to explain why they make such an elementary and obvious mistake.  One hopes this movie will reinforce the lesson that when it comes to villains, less really is more, but I rather doubt it will.<br /><br />The other main problem with this movie is also common to the superhero genre, on both big screen and small: unsympathetic love interests.  In romance, the chase is more dramatic than the victory and its aftermath.  When the hero is trying to win the heart of his love the audience is pulling for him, and hoping he'll succeed, and tuning in to see if he will.  Once he's got her, a lot of that dramatic tension is simply gone, and viewers may lose interest.  So the writers, in order to put the success of that romance in jeopardy, and thus maintain dramatic tension, constantly have to come up with things that keep pulling the hero and his girl apart.  The problem is, this can only be taken so far before it starts to make the characters look immature, selfish, and unsympathetic.  You can see it in \\"Superman Returns\\" where Lois comes off looking selfish, spiteful, and passive-aggressive to the point where you can't help but wonder what the hell Superman sees in her.  The same thing happened to Lana in the TV series \\"Smallville\\" (which is a pity since Lana started out in season one as a very sympathetic character).  Well Mary Jane gets the same treatment here.  In scene after scene she seems positively determined to misunderstand Peter, ascribe the worst of motives to him, and refuse to give him any benefit of doubt.  He tries to comfort her after she gets a bad review, and she bites his head off for telling her he knows what it's like to be mocked and misunderstood.  Before a crowd (and clearly for their benefit) Peter, in costune as Spider-Man, lets a girl whose life he's saved kiss him, and Mary Jane, who as a young, good-looking actress is certainly someone whose work would require her to kiss another man than her boyfriend for a role, and should understand that was just showmanship, but she holds it against him.  Mary Jane instead of calling Peter when she'd feeling a bit down, runs off to spend time his best friend and then initiates a kiss with him, and so on.  This hurts the movie because it makes Mary Jane a fickle, undependable, untrusting, unsympathetic girl that he just might be better off without.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining, for all its flaws. But I hope that if they make a Spider-Man IV, they'll avoid repeating the mistakes of this installment.urns\\" where Lois comes off looking selfish, spiteful, and passive-aggressive to the point where you can't help but wonder what the hell Superman sees in her.

0385751532|4.0|My son was reading this for his school's book club, so I naturally picked it up and as soon as I read the inside cover, I knew I was in for something different. Once it dawned on me what the book's content was going to be about, my first reaction was to stop reading (this was after the first chapter) Such a hard subject, such pain buried beneath the pages, I was sure. Yes, there was pain but also, because it was shown through child's eyes, it was a much different read than I have in the past regarding the Holocaust. It was a great talking tool to use with my son about this horrific event, and I really think he could feel the different sides of that fence. Each in their own way a terrible prison. I do recommend this book, especially to read with your teens when studying WWII. Another note: art work on the cover is brilliant, once you know the story.
0143038419|4.0|I will be sharing it with all my friends!  A great story of hope and happy endings with plenty of humor in between.

B000MRA5NS|4.0|IMHO Casino Royal deviates quite a bit from the typical 007 series, possibly on purpose.  Lots of action, violence, and hot women but Daniel Craig is probably more suited for a boxing role rather than a suave British spy role.  He seems to lack that smooth operator feel so kicks and grunts his way to the end, it's somewhat comical.  One shouldn't complain though since the Blu-Ray was free LOL.<br /><br />Casino Royale [Blu-ray]
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Britney's new album \\"Blackout\\" is awesome. With her great vocals and dance beats, make this one of her best albums to date. As soon as I popped it in the player and the beats started, I knew Britney never lets me down when it comes to great pop music. Keep up the great work Britney. Check out this album. You will be pleasantly surprised.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|Good movie that brings light to somewhat obscure geo-political issue.  I'm not a fan of Leonardo Dicaprio but Jennifer Connelly is hott in this movie.  Plenty of action but not really my genre.<br /><br />Not much else to write about a movie really.<br /><br />Blood Diamond [Blu-ray]
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I've seen this movie many times, and because of this movie alone I became a fan of Jimmy Stewart. I'm not here to review the movie, that's been done. But to maybe shed some light on the scrooges who lambaste this gem of a movie. There are folks out there who say this movie isn't believable. For one thing: Don't we watch movies to be entertained, to make believe? For those who say this movie bombed, and that noone liked it upon its initial release, well yes that is true. But as they say 'sometimes you don't get it, until you get it.' This film is honest if nothing else. About one man who gives, and gets nothing in return. He wants glory, but doesn't realize that he is seen as glorious by those who know him best. He has a beautiful wife, well behaved kids, and most of all he has integrity. He realizes that if he never existed that he never would have saved his own brother's life. He wouldn't have married his beautiful wife, who actually loved him as a child (remember what she whispers in his ear?)     George Bailey didn't get it, until he got it.    With each viewing a lump develops in my stomach, and I always shed some tears. Maybe because George Bailey is a man I would want to be like.
B000QZTK28|5.0|I bought this album in the 80's and have nothing now to play the plastic on.     They got rid of the \\"Ain't Talkin 'bout Love\\" cover!!!!!. WTF......That was the whole reason I blindly downloaded the album!!!      The omission totally sucks but the rest is still golden. Heck, the 20+ year-old vynil version I had didn't have the 'original' explicit version of the cover so even then it had been diluted by The Conspiracy.   Still, just one more example of how you can't go back and recapture the glory you thought was the past.     Screw it! Its still a five star package!!!!
0440419514|5.0|Regardless of your age, if you have an imagination, this trilogy will make good use of that imagination.  It is an excellent written story (in three parts) than uses your known world and stretches it this way and that in a tale that captures the hearts of children and adults alike.  Personally I prefer the original title of the first book - The Northern Lights, but that is neither here nor there.
B000002KHH|5.0|Yes, War Pigs, the title track, and Iron Man are all great songs, but what about the other tracks on this album?  Well, here goes.<br /><br />Planet Caravan is actually one of my favorite Black Sabbath songs.  It's really, really eerie and almost pyschedlic even.  It's hard to believe that's it a Sabbath song.  A lot of people used to skip over the song (like Zeppelin's The Battle of Evermore on the IV/Zoso album) because it's sandwiched in between too many classic songs.  Electric Funeral is a great one.  If you ever watch Beavis and Butthead, one of their \\"songs\\" (when they start vocalizing and jamming) is Electric Funeral.  Hand of Doom is a great Sabbath epic, something they did a lot but never got credit for.  Rat Salad is a great instrumental (with a good drum solo by Bill Ward), and Fairies Wear Boots/Jack the Stripper is a great closer, one of Sabbath's most underrated songs.  Overall, this album is pretty much perfect, worth all the accolades it has received over the years.
0812550757|5.0|One of my favorites fron the Enderverse. Actually all are favorite reads. I think it topped Ender's game. I tell sci fi fans that they've got to read Speaker for the Dead and Children of the Mind.      Ender's game seemed nonstop adrenalin. This one is slowed down a bit but still has major adrenalin pumping dramatic moments. The pace of the story allowed for more time to think as the information flowed than ender's game. The piggies are interesting creatures. The book really is about the cycle of life. Speaking for the dead is speaking of life.  Where Ender's game focused on the manchild in a manipulative world, here you really get the man.  As always with OSC's stories, there is much moral philosophy- The good the bad and the situation that makes it one or the other.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|Nothing here rocks as much as Abel or the incendiary Lit Up from Alligator,  but the surpassing qualities from that work -- the odd opening instrumental gambits, the baritone, the lyrics, the melodies that lodge in your brain, and the simple but insistent drum lines that pull it all together in urgent beauty -- are all welcomed back in Boxer.  Personal favorites are Mistaken for Strangers, Apartment Story, and Start A War.  Slow Show is sneaky; it's almost over before it grabs you, but grab you it will.  Think Karen before things went off the tracks.  I would have liked more noise, one hard rocker replacing the draggy Racing Like a Pro or, especially, Green Gloves would have been welcome.  (Saw them at a re-opened NYC club the other week and they do tear things up live.)  But that's a quibble.  The National continue on their steady course of some of the best, most interesting music going today.
B000SNUMC0|5.0|What's killer:     Tim `Ripper' Owens is quite simply an amazing vocalist.  His phrasing is amongst the best I've ever heard, as evidenced on the harmonic laced \\"Reflections' and the ballad type moments of `The Clouding'.  While he may not have the `Baritone' of Barlow, I believe he has the best-matched voice for Iced Earth.  And with time, more Iced Earth fans will understand what I have understood since he sang on the Gettysburg Trilogy.    Jon Schaffer has also taken steps forward as the maturing song writer.  Yes, the infamous `gallop riff' is still as prominent as ever, but is taken in an entirely new direction, which is refreshing to see.  The main riff in `Something Wicked Part 1' is a good example of this, brimming with the spirit of latter day Dream Theater composition.   As for the album's epic masterwork, there isn't one - really.  `The Clouding' is the closest you're going to get clocking in at 9 minutes.  This matters little though, as each song is deserving of its own sound world - no guitar riff is rehashed, not this time...       The artwork and inner booklet is very nice indeed, containing song illustrations in the same vein as 2001's `Horror Show' and 2004's `The Glorious Burden'.  Again, Schaffer takes pride in CD packaging and offers up greater reason to buy his art rather than to simply download it.  While I maintain the `Something Wicked' storyline, should have been released as a double disc set, the illustrations and lyrics here only offer a `general' outline of the `Something Wicked' storyline, and are not enough to suffice a full blown concept - like a comic book.  The original idea was to release a comic book accompanying the CD. However, it is believed it would be too time consuming to do so.       Throwaway tracks:  Nearly every Iced Earth album has 1 or 2 duds.  Fortunately, there is only 1 here, and that is the instrumental `Something Wicked pt.2' - it will bore the pants off you!  The same thing was achieved much earlier with the superior `Overture'.      What's missing:    After 18 + years of writing material for Iced Earth, what keeps Schaffer going is his desire to make the big leagues - to someday move 500,000 copies in the U.S.  That is his ultimate goal.  What's stopping him is the absence of a permanent lead guitar player (not just guest solo spots on albums).  Now the problem may be with Schaffer himself, and his specific vision on how an IE song should sound.  Consider the revolving door of band members - with little collaboration to be found in recent years.           On \\"Framing Armageddon\\" there are moments where a lead begins but never really takes off.  `The Setian Massacre' is a prime example.  All the classic bands: Sabbath, Metallica, Maiden, all utilized this area in their music to maximum effect.  With Iced Earth, a guitar lead is merely in the shadow of a gargantuan riff.  `Retribution through the Ages' carries the longest (and best) solo on `Framing Armageddon'.     With those minor criticisms aside `Framing Armageddon' still receives weekly rotation in my CD player and is easily one of 2007's best metal releases.  Look out for Something Wicked pt 2. which should surface around July 2008!!

B000K15VSA|4.0|I have for years been trying to get my hands on a DVD copy of the original 1982 cut as my VHS tape is worn out and it was a master. How anybody could like the Director's cut is beyond me. Give me the original movie. The Decker voice over to me gives it that film noir quality of an old Sam Spade movie. I wish that the 1982 version was released by itself, but now I have to fork over big bucks just to  own the original in DVD. I have never read the book that the movie was based on as I could care less as I just like movies for my escapism and only read non-fiction. I could only give this a 4 stars as the price is too high and it includes the directors cut. I have never met anybody who likes that cut but reading the post here I guess there is just no accounting for taste. To each his own I guess. Can't wait to see the original on my big screen surround sound system.
B000W4HFY8|5.0|What a beautiful thing it is to finally see the release of this disc.     I agree with the above review that it's a bummer to disinclude that particular version of the theme. (When Ben watches the old family film...)    Other than that, this is a fan's dream come true.    Night Bells is a track I have always dreamed about having.     New Shoes is all standout for me.    Maybe best of all is Just You which is the song James sang with Donna and Maddy in the living room of the Hayward house.     The Hayward Boogie featuring Alicia Witt on piano is another treat.    THANK YOU to whoever is responsible.    What a treat.

B000V8I2QU|3.0|Let's start with the very strong positive: Girls In Their Summer Clothes is one of Bruce Springsteen's best songs ever. My God, the intense longing for the past that it evokes is absolutely palpable. The song is so wistful, so emotionally powerful, it makes you smile and gives you chills of sadness at the same time. Great lyrics, great music, great instrumentation. And the only tune on the album for which the Phil Spector \\"Wall of Sound\\" technique is appropriate; after all, Bruce and the band sound like they're channeling the Crystals. (And that's a good thing; no, make that, it's a GREAT thing.) Remarkable.    Other than that, there are some songs that are pretty good, songs that most performers would be happy to have written. But, based on past recordings, and based on the kinds of emotional claims he makes, and based on the ambitions for himself that he states...heck, just based on the title of this disc, calling it Magic...Bruce just has to be held to a higher standard. Sorry.    Wealth, fame, downright admiration: Bruce Springsteen has earned it all. But if he's going to make as audacious a claim as, \\"I'll Prove It All Night for your love,\\" He's got to keep on earning it. And that has got to be mighty difficult.    It's painful to hear Bruce Springsteen quoting a John Kerry speech as a lyric. Nothing against Kerry, or what he (and apparently Bruce himself) stand for (or against), but let's face it: It's not just unoriginal. It's a cliche. For an artist as formidable as Springsteen, that's just...I don't know...disappointing. Doesn't Bruce have any insights of his own?    And referring to the Holy Family as \\"Jesus, Mary and Joe\\" is just...cornball.    My advice is: Get the record, check it out just to see what one of the great artists is up to. You'll find some worthy songs throughout, maybe even a personal fave. Then put on Girls In Their Summer Clothes and hit \\"repeat.\\"

B000VT55G4|1.0|This movie is beyond bad. My friends and I made a movie as a joke when we were 19 that had better dialogue. The script/plot just does not make any sense whatsoever. When they revealed maybe a 1/3 of the way thru that Cusack was an ex-cop I was incredulous - my 3 year old daughter can hold a gun better than his character was. And then when he managed to to take out the spec-ops tracker that was chasing him with an automatic rifle? Sorry, no way. I don't think Freeman's acting was all that bad, but this movie really has no redeeming qualities (wait, I take that back - the Bulgarian scenery was stunning - yep, thats right, the outdoor scenes were filmed in BULGARIA!)

0374280967|5.0|Blame it on the corgis. They discover a bookmobile parked near Buckingham Palace and get the Queen's attention when they start yapping. Since she is every inch a queen, HRH borrows a book, a novel by Ivy Compton-Burnett even though she has previously left liking books to other people. Although she finds Compton-Burnett rather dry with the characters all sounding like each other, the fire has been lit. The Queen becomes hooked on reading; neither she nor eventually England will ever be quite the same in Alan Bennett's quietly humorous short novel THE UNCOMMON READER. The Queen discovers Jean Genet, Nancy Mitford, E. M. Forster, Emily Dickinson, Alice Munro, Proust, Charles Dickens, Dostoevsky. She has difficulty with Jane Austin because that writer is so concerned with social distinctions. She at first is put off by the verbosity of Henry James, something she has in common with any reader I have ever known (\\"'Am I alone,' she wrote, 'in wanting to give Henry James a good talking to?'\\" Later, however, James' \\"divagations she now took in her stride,\\" opining that \\"'novels are not necessarily written as the crow flies.'\\" She even reads the memoirs of Lauren Bacall and is envious of her. In the beginning the Queen reads indiscriminately  as one book leads to another, but she eventually becomes a very discerning reader.<br /><br />Reading this little book as delicious as an English trifle, I was reminded of how gentle Mr. Bennett is with his velvety barbs and so different, for instance, from American writers like Molly Ivins or Calvin Trillin when they harpoon the current resident of the White House. There is much here to make you smile. The dogs, for example, destroy an Ian McEwan novel, \\"the James Tait Black Memorial Prize notwithstanding.\\" Also in the past when the Queen is out in her kingdom meeting her subjects, before her obsession with reading, she would have asked them questions perhaps about what mode of transportation they used to get to their meeting with her.

0399226907|5.0|This is a classic board book!  This is also another favorite book of mine by Eric Carle.  Whether you are a school teacher or mom/dad/caregiver, this is an excellent book to read to your children!  Great illustrations and easy reading for the little ones!  I love this book!
0316067598|5.0|I loved the book.  My only small complaint is: I wish he had not hired a writer to help him with this book.  The writer embellished the already gripping story; this was unneeded.  Indeed The story is amazing.  BTW - I don't understand why they just didn't tie up the three goat herders?  Sooner or later their relatives would have found them, the delay this would have caused would allow the team time to leave the area, set up a defensive position, radio for extraction.
0671449028|5.0|Sandra Boynton is one of my favorite children's book authors!  All of her books are written well and very easy to read to the little ones!  I started reading The Going to Bed Book when my daughter was only a few weeks old and now she picks out this book on her own to read!  She also loves Fuzzy Fuzzy...I believe thats the title.  If you are looking for good quality books to read to your baby and toddler, you can't go wrong with Sandra Boynton!  Even my husband loves her books!  Give them a try, you won't be dissapointed!!!

B00003CXPD|5.0|As a hint as to the high quality of this excellent film, notice that this film has a higher proportion of '5' scores among a large number of raters than the vast majority of films. It is a very well crafted piece of art.     The film is about the human spirit and the motivations to excel and to experience life fully. Billy is a young boy who becomes entranced with dance, an art form that allows him to express his emotions and experience a deeper connection with himself. He is reared in a working class neighborhood with a rough father and older brother, both of whom are miners on strike. Billy's mother has died and this boy interested in dance must survive in a highly tense highly aggressive home and neighborhood. Jamie Bell plays the role to perfection and deserves incredible credit for being able to carry off this lead role with such fine acting skills and ability to become the character Billy Elliot before our eyes.     The film is also about his dance teacher and mentor, played perfectly by the wonderful actress Julie Walters. She is the perfect mentor, pressing the student when he needs to be pressed but recognizing that for every step she takes, he must also make a step.  The best mentors know that they can't do it for the mentee. Walters is an incredible actress, being able to be vulnerable and controlled at the same time. She recognizes that the role she has taken on in regard to Billy's budding talent is that of protector and teacher and that at some point he will move beyond her if her work is done. Walters embodies and channels this aspect of the mentor perfectly.    Gary Lewis is superb as Jackie Elliot, Billy's father. He plays a middle aged coal miner, still in grief over the loss of his wife, trying to make ends meet in a home with two sons. At first Jackie is furious that his son wants to become a dancer, but gradually the father sees the hopelessness that he and his older son experience as miners on strike, and supports his son in following his passion and breaking into a new world of opportunities and experiences.    Excellent in every way, this tale is about the growth of the human spirit but thoughtfully explores the roles of those who facilitate that growth.
0198534469|5.0|This text is innovative to say the least.  It has been very helpful to me in my work as an engineer and graduate study in engineering by providing a great deal of insight into difficult topics.  One should note that this text includes topics more theoretical than those included in texts such as Brown and Churchill.
B000ICM5VW|2.0|For the first 45 minutes to an hour my wife and I were really pleased with this film. It was engaging; it started to develop the story and the characters, and promised to be really entertaining. In fact, it reminded me of how effectively movie makers of the 1930's and 40's could tell a story and engage you in the telling of it. Then, the main characters reached the island of Skull Mountain and the special effects began to run amok in the film much like King Kong ran amok in New York city.     Once the special effects were introduced, they violently (very violently, in fact) wrenched away control of the story from the director and began an almost non-stop convulsion, a flood, an avalanche, a torrent of mindless computer-generated effects. Kong stomping dinosaurs. Dinosaurs stomping men. Men stomping giant insects. Kong contemplating the sunset. It was as if the XF crew became addicted and lost control of the sequences, and could no longer discern when special effects were helpful and required to move the story along or when they were thoughtlessly trampling on it. Overdone? Holy cow!    At one point the graphics people push the story so far out of the way they decided, for whatever bizarre reason, that it would be really good to show King Kong ice skating in Central Park! They were wrong.    I was lured to this film because I was familiar with the story, and because this 2005 re-telling won the Academy Award for Visual Effects. In fact, many of the visual effects are stunning -- but only when they are not ridiculously over done, and that is not often enough.    My assessment is that when the film is good, it is very, very good. But when it is bad, it is horrid. Unfortunately the good part lasts less than half way through.
6305949980|4.0|Jack Skellington (Sarandon speaking, Elfman singing) is the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown and usually revels in the macabre antics of his fellow townsfolk in the run up to the holiday. This year, however, he's not feeling it. After wandering the forest, he discovers a doorway to Christmasland and, falling in love with the warmth and love there, is determined to bring Christmas to his friends - by kidnapping Santa/Sandy Claus (Ivory). The new version isn't a director's cut: there's no scenes shaved or added, but the 3D makeover adds more depth and gives a wider scope to Burton's bizarre gothic world. It's also a good excuse to fork over a tenner for a re-release. The animation is short (really short), which means it doesn't outstay its welcome or leave you with a headache (it can be a lot on the eyes at times) and you'll get to keep a cheap pair of '80s style shades to boot!
B00000DGXN|5.0|One of my favorite albums...very melodic, flowing,and vibrant. Burton's vibes are strikingly beautiful, and the other 4 legends complement gracefully and spontaneously. Just an outstanding album..no hitches.
1577314808|1.0|Save your money and time.  Nothing new is revealed here.  Tolle simply takes other peoples ideas that have been circulating about for the past two thousand years or more and claims them for himself.  A couple new bents on female menstruation but other than that, not much more.  As other reviewers have responded, living in the NOW is a lie.  There is no NOW!  Even as you read this your are moving ahead into the furture!  DUH?  How stupid is the public to fall for this NOW idea?  Living in the present makes more sense but even that is a flawed perception.  We are all products of the past.  Tolle wants us to leave it behind, the who we are and have become.  Not Possible! We carry our pains and pleasures with us. It is human to do so.  Don't become a walking Tolle zombie new-age unreal person.  Be who you are!  Meditate if you must but don't make this guy another modern day billionaire guru!
B00000IGGA|5.0|The guy can't sing a note, he should be doing sound effects for Briggs and Stratton and he needs major polyp surgery on his vocal chords.  But man, I could listen to his stuff all day.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This movie takes you through a time of an oppressive government.  Some of the propaganda mentioned sounds like what is going on these days.  That is scary, but this movie inspires hope for those who fight for truth and freedom.  The Wachowski brothers have put together another great story without disappointment!
B000P46QTA|4.0|Probably the most memorable Blu Ray I've watched so far.  The level of detail in the picture is outstanding and so much more filmic than your average Hollywood offerings.  I'd say this was definately shot on Film as opposed to Digital Cameras.    That aside it offers a well acted, high production values included insight on what it was like living in the former DDR (German Democratic Republic) or commonly 'East Germany'.  The main character a play write becomes a suspect of harbouring Western Sympathies, by the Stasi (State Police).    This is a true story and the lengths that they would go to to Spy on you and watch/listen to your every move is unbelievable.  The sub plot is interesting involving the 'bald' Stasi officer and his feelings towards the State and the female lead as the film progresses.    East Germans lived in such a droll depressing era then which made me realise that growing up in northern Ireland in the 80's was a similar lifestyle in ways that would make us have quite a lot in common to talk about over a fine pint of Berlin Pilsner or Guinness.    Makes me want to re-visit an 80's film called 'CAL'
B000V8I2QU|2.0|I've been a huge fan from the beginning but this album does not impress me at all. With all the pre-release hype I had high hopes. Its just echoes of Tunnnel of Love and Lucky Town. Even the album photos were mundane.
B000UJ48U4|4.0|IF it is true and there really aren't 2 versions of the movie it is kind of false advertising.  For the shear visuals and atmosphere this is one of his best.  Perhaps by mentioning the packaging doesn't match the content there will be a revision to this.
0634022296|5.0|I've loved the beatles since the first time I heard them over my step fathers tapes. So I went searching on ebay, in different stores, and then someone told me about amazon and thats where I found this purfect book. Since I love playing guitar this book has made it more fun, because I get to learn songs from people I've never met but would love to meet one day. The beatles are inspiring and just filled with life even though the beatles are no longer a complete set like they used to be. Now I play the beatles songs and have fun doing it. I've even shocked my step father who learned guitar way before me on how well and how quickly I've learned the songs. This book was amazing and I will defintly keep it for a long time and continue to enjoy it.
630460291X|3.0|I'm a Costner fan, so I watched it.  It breaks my heart to criticize him, but he was NOT a good choice for the role.  First of all, his accent his inconsistent.  His speech veers from British to almost california surfer.    However, supporting characters were for the most part, very well done.  Entertaining action sequences.  Observant viewers will note that an artful dodger, Jack Wild, plays a bit part.  Alan Rickman is just deliciously wicked and is able to inject some humor into his lines.  I have never not enjoyed Morgan Freeman.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The Matrix series wowed people with its special effects and action.  But what I picked up from these movies is a deep message.  Later on I researched what influenced the Matrix series and found out it tied in with Gnosticism (ancient christianity), buddhism, hinduism, and other philosophies/religions.      After you watch this movie check out the book The Secret History of the World by Laura Knight-Jadczyk.  This book goes deeper into the rabbit hole with all the mythology, religion, and science to the ideas that inspired the Matrix.    That is what I love about this series.  Many people disliked part 2 and 3, but they stood true to the original influences.
B000RJO578|2.0|I watched Hot Fuzz on the strength of 'Shaun of the Dead', which was a marvellous breath of fresh air from Hollywoods bloated excesses. HF has a great cast. One of my favourite British actors from any era Jim Broadbent. Simon Pegg who has an intensity in his acting that is very funny. Bill Bailey, Nick Frost, Timothy Dalton etc etc, but somehow it just doesn't work.     The idea behind the story has the makings of a successful comedy. Sgt Angel is sent to Sandford, a small sleepy English town, because he is too good. As Angel Simon Pegg is perfect for the role but is let down most of the time by lines that just aren't that funny. To be honest after an hour had passed I had started to lose interest and at an hour and a half I gave up. It is too long.     Maybe on a 2nd showing I will enjoy it more, but its not a film I'd recommend anybody buying just because they liked 'Shaun of the Dead'. rent it first.
B000Y179KO|5.0|If it's true that \\"a day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as a day\\"...then a considerable assembly of Eagles loyalists, like me, have waited several million years too long for \\"Long Road.\\"  Or perhaps, as eternity will soon disclose, it was just 5 minutes ago?   In any case, there's much I could write about these guys during my 35 years of faithful allegiance, much to say about this new (as well as old) \\"Long Road,\\" but here's the chase: If all you got to hear (or all they released) was Disc-2, the majority of true Eagles' fans would've been okay with that; in fact, most would've been ecstatic, I'm sure.  And yet the naked truth is that Disc-2 actually pales (if you can believe it!) in comparison to the incredible gems on Disc-1!    Surprisingly, the opening track \\"No more walks in the woods,\\" upon first hearing, actually swept me back to (pre-Eagles) days of listening over and over again to the C,S,N debut LP.  Anybody else feel like that?  Those were the days when our Eagles (then Glenn, Don, Randy, and Bernie...with much help and inspiration from Jackson Browne & J.D. Souther) had not yet flown, but were playing the local L.A. bars as L. Ronstadt's house band.  Long time friend and pt-time songwriting Eagle, John David Souther, whose \\"How Long\\" track (written in the early 70s)seems the commercial chartbuster at this point, was the 'other' dead guy (along with Jackson) on the back of the \\"Desperado\\" LP.       I'm not ready to review every track at this juncture.  Besides, how boring, or what a frail grasp (of the big picture).  I'll just say that it's certainly no accident that these guys (all rock-n-roll A-Listers individually, with resident mystic cynic, ace Don Henley (even if he is doctrinally off base much of the time) still flying high at the helm--with longtime partner, heartbeat Glenn Frey (not to mention Sentimental Tim & Chainsaw Joe) are still, unequivocally, without a doubt, incomparably, as they were back when,...the finest band in the land!  And those unmistakably perfect Eagles' harmonies are still, incredibly, well....perfect!  In fact, they're better than ever, as evidenced in the CD's best overall track (in my opinion), \\"Waiting in the Weeds.\\"  It just doesn't get much better than that!      In short, it's clear these guys haven't missed a beat: the harmonies, the vocals, the tunes, the timing; everything is clean, crisp, tight!  These, my friends, are...THE EAGLES!  And this \\"Long Road\\" is definitely something to remember, a Keeper of the highest order!
B00003JRCQ|2.0|This movie was a dissapointmet. As if the acting wasn't bad enough, the plot was too dull. I'm a big Jane Austen fan, but this is definately worth passing up.
B00009UW0N|5.0|The film: Halloween (Divimax 25th Anniversary Edition)<br />Year Made: 1978<br /><br />The Packaging: 5 Stars.  The outside is a classic Halloween shot that you have to just love.  Inside you will find 2 discs.  One has the full length movie and the other disc is full of some very nice extras.  The discs are very easy to pop out of the holders, yet they also stay in place very well which is always huge plus.  You also get a nice inlay book that has some classic photos from the film, along with some nice information to read about throughout the booklet.  My favorite picture is the one of Michael Myers standing there with the sheet over his head, looking like a ghost!  I LOVE that photo, it's so creepy!  Any Halloween, horror fan should be very pleased with this nice package.<br /><br />Spook Meter:  3 Stars  This movie is spooky.  I have seen films that have spooked me more and films that spook me less.  While holding a bowl full of your favorite popcorn, you may lose a few popped kernels while you jump a time or two while watching this.  This film is just full of TONS of great scenes.  It's all the nice little details while watching this that really make this so great to watch.  All of a sudden you look in the distance and there is Michael standing there, then he's gone.  You think there will be a kill from him, but no he is suddenly gone.  You hear the breathing from him under his mask while a lit pumpkin glows and casts a shadow on the nearby house.  I LOVE THIS! This is the kind of details that can really make a horror film a all time great that stands out from all the rest for years to come.  When I watch this every year I feel so pulled into the film.  It feels so Halloween like when watching this gem.  The blowing leaves in the breeze, you can almost feel the chill in the air.  There is so much, so many things about this that I love that every time I watch this, there is always something exciting that I notice. This has always been considered one of the top all time greatest horror films by many horror fans including myself.  It really is that good and it only gets better and better as it ages.  Ahhh what a classic!<br /><br />Gore Meter:  2 Stars.  There is not much gore here as far as blood is concerned.  I will say that there are a few scenes that will be considered a bit violent for some viewers, but it's nothing over the top.  The Gore Meter is low because even the few violent scenes that are in the film, they show very little blood and are not that hard to handle.<br /><br />Profanity Meter: 3 Strikes.  There is a fair amount of language throughout this film.  I have seen worse, and I have seen less.  I use a DVD player that will block out the profanity which I encourage others to put to use if you enjoy watching films but don't care for the language.<br /><br />Sexual Meter: 3 Strikes.  We see a make out scene in this film that is not very graphic.  It has the usual moans and stuff while two people act like they are having sex while covered in blankets.  I gave the sexual meter 3 stars because there are a few shots that we see a woman naked from the top half wearing no bra.  It's a few quick shots, but it's something just to point out for viewers.<br /><br />Final thoughts:  Overall this is just a amazing film.  Halloween is one that will forever be considered to be one of the all time greatest in the horror hall of fame!or films by many horror fans including myself.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|This does a great quick clean up on hardwood and pergo floors.  Not too good on carpet, but that is what a real vacuum is for!  This does awesome for quick jobs around the house, under the table, in the kitchen, etc.  So light the toddlers can use it too and really be vacumming!  I highly reccomend this as an affordable lightweight easy clean sweeper!      MAKE SURE TO CHARGE IT RIGHT.  IF YOU DO NOT YOU WILL HAVE A PROBLEM.

B000002J0B|5.0|I haven't listened to this album since I was a kid(like 10). I'm 33 now and this album brings tears to my eyes with emotion about 1:30 into \\"The Rain Song\\". I am a hardcore metal head but give respect ehere it's due. For a GOOD LAUGH, read the RETARDED comments from people that gave this \\"1 star\\". My favorite is the monkey that says something about naked children on the cover, or the Bengals(ha ha) fan. It must suck to be so stupid. There are people in this world that have no sense of musical talent, expression of emotion, or respect for art. If you fall in this category, please bury yourself in a hole before you infect others with your disease and go back to whatever planet your from... seriously.
B000002KO3|5.0|The Talking Heads' fourth album is really really freaking good. `Nuff said.    Okay, maybe not. Here's what you should know: Remain In Light sees the Heads (with longtime producer Brian Eno in tow) creating some of the most intricate, colorful, original, and downright stunning soundscapes in the history of music. The sound of the album is an absolutely ecstatic mixture of funk, punk, and new wave with elements of electronic music, African rhythms, twisted pop, post-psychedelic experimentalism, and good ol' fashioned rock `n' roll. It's the sound of a multitude of musical influences being molded together, shaped and structured in terms of one another, like some kind of musical funhouse mirror. It also rocks.     I mean, just listen to \\"Crosseyed and Painless.\\" Just listen to it! Listen to that ridiculously propulsive rhythm, which finds the common ground between Chuck Berry, James Brown, and King Sunny Ade. Listen to that squirming bass line, and Byrne's sweaty, paranoid vocals. It's friggin' amazing! And then there's \\"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On),\\" with its tight polyrhythm and morphological keyboards. \\"The Great Curve\\" mingles heavy metal guitars with a swirling maze of drums. \\"Once In A Life Time\\" is a warped new wave classic, with vocals that bring to mind a Revival-era preacher, and densely layered melodies.     The album's second half is a quieter, less explicitly rhythmic affair, but it still packs a wallop. \\"Listening Wind\\" is a supernatural tale of imperialism thwarted set to a skin-crawling whisper of melody, while \\"Houses In Motion\\" boils with tension. \\"Seen And Not Seen\\" is strange, funny, and hypnotic, while \\"The Overload\\" is pure slow-burning apocalypse.    It's stunning. Buy this!

B000001E18|1.0|Gross, Homer Simpson-level incompetence. Soulless dreck. Music that struggles and fails to be cutting-edge. You'd never think that U2 would make something like this, would you? Well, you were wrong, then - this represents their lowest low. Distorted, processed electrofunk is not U2's strong point, and you probably could tell that by listening to \\"Babyface\\" and \\"Numb\\" (with a vocodor! On a U2 song! Seriously! The Edge raps on it, too... urgh...). I mean, at least Achtung Baby had some really high highs, rather than awful imitation Prince fused with techno such as \\"Lemon\\" (which was somehow a charting single - when you're massively popular, you can get away with anything). The only song with organic elements, \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close)\\"!), is a pathetic flop with some of U2's worst lyrics. Said awful lyrics show up to plague \\"Some Days Are Better Than Others\\", which does have a fine bass groove going for it. It's the only song on this monstrosity I can tolerate for more than a half minute, and even then I have a hard time with the instrumental break. At least \\"The First Time\\" and \\"Dirty Day\\" have nothing to do with techno, even if I can't remember a thing about any of them. Oh, and did I mention the title track, less a song than an excuse to whip out as many headphone tricks as possible? Or the execrable Johnny Cash duet \\"Wanderer\\"? No? Wondering why? I hope not. This is the ultimate low for U2. Painful. Just painful.
B000Y44LBG|5.0|Back in the late 60s, Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) was a driver for one of New York's leading crime figures. But after said person has a fatal heart attack that claims his life, Frank ponders where to go from there. That comes in the form of heroin, which he brings into the country inside coffins containing wounded soldiers who died in the Vietnam war. The heroin is pure, uncut stuff, which he calls \\"Blue Magic\\". With the help of his hoodlum bretheren (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Common, Warner Miller, Albert Jones, J. Kyle Manzay), he makes a profit off of it, and eventually marrying Miss Puerto Rico (Lymari Nadal) in the process.    Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), an honest police detective, is not very popular with his crooked partners and is going through a divorce battle with his ex-wife Laurie (Carla Gugino). Now working with a cleaner team of drug enforcers, he can now take down Lucas' empire without much problems.    \\"American Gangster\\", along with \\"Lions for Lambs\\", is one of the many much anticipated films this fall looking to get cozy with the Golden Globe and Oscar crowd. One stars award winners Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and the other one has Robert Redford, Meryl Streep, and Tom Cruise. My pick? \\"Gangster\\", all the way.    Of course, this isn't no ordinary crime drama that you've seen. All that's on the screen has been based on a true story (as instigated as the film kicks off) about real-life crime figure Frank Lucas. In 157 minutes of running time, \\"American Gangster\\" is told like a \\"Scarface\\"-esque rags-to-riches story about a nobody who became a somebody from selling drugs. With that, he gets the money, power, and respect. But like \\"Scarface\\", the kingpin eventually doesn't maintain power forever. It's standard stuff, but director Ridley Scott manages to make some solid, riveting stuff out of it, thanks to a large cast of today's most popular African and Caucasian actors.    Washington is in true form, but is anyone shocked? As Frank Lucas, theactor sells the stuff, whether it's waxing poetic about business, sharing time with his family (which also includes a welcome performance from Ruby Dee as Lucas' mother), confronting his rivals (Cuba Gooding Jr. leaves a huge chunk of a mark on the film as the flashy and flamboyant Nicky Barnes), or confronting Richie Roberts for the first time (it's shades of Al Pacino and Robert De Niro's confrontation in Heat). It's standard stuff, but Washington is capable of finding ways to keep its shelf life dust-free.    Russell Crowe makes an excellent adversary to Washington. Also doing another performance as a cop (he did L.A. Confidential, remember?), Crowe is able to juggle Richie Roberts' squeaky clean performance on the job to his flawed family life where he's about to lose his wife and kid to Las Vegas.    Before I get into the rest of the cast, I'll need to do a little ribbing on Roger Bart. A usually fierce actor, he suffers from the Keira Knightley school of overcompensating and crap method acting. As a creepy attorney, he turns all indication lights and spews a racist tirade at Richie Roberts. The man can be usually reliable (\\"The Producers Musical\\" - he's better suited in movies like that), but here, it's way out of place for a movie that requires relaxed acting (especially from Carla Gugino, whom Bart could've studied, cause she could've gone over the top too, but didn't). Regardless, it's only a small cameo. Moving on...    Ridley Scott also assembled a star-studded cast to back up both Washington and Crowe: we've got Josh Brolin as a crooked cop (unlike Bart, Brolin doesn't need to overcompensate when playing a crooked figure), direct-to-video action star Armand Assante as a Mafia godfather, Idris Elba as one of Lucas' rivals, T.I. as a nephew who becomes enamored with his uncle's lifestyle (following in the footsteps, Ice Cube and LL Cool J, Mr. Clifford Harris is evolving into one of the more talented rapper-turned-actors; \\"ATL\\" definitely was no fluke), Anthony Hamilton in a cameo as a lounge singer, Wu-Tang head honcho RZA as one of Richie Roberts' new DEA co-workers, and some additional support from Ted Levine and \\"Miami Vice\\"'s John Hawkes and John Ortiz.    Sure, 157 minutes is long. But Scott does whatever he can to keep the audience's eyes glued to the screen. With nary a drawback in sight, and a soundtrack replete with 70's R&B and rock (look out for Bobby Womack's soulful \\"Across 110th Street\\"), \\"American Gangster\\" is definitely another crime epic to fit in a DVD collection of a fan who O.D.'s on films like \\"Scarface\\" or \\"The Godfather\\".
0553582038|5.0|People can knock it because it is only half a book, or it has too many characters, or whatever, but it is still one of the best stories I have ever read. I hope he writes ten more books in the series. I will love them all.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I was 3 years old when this movie came out.<br />I remember goin to see Jaws 2 with my Dad & my brother.<br />I had the hardest time just swimming in our pool in our<br />back yard for about a year after seeing Jaws 2.<br />Ever since seeing Jaws I've had a interest in sharks.<br />I would say Jaws 1 & 2 are the best out of the series,<br />3 & 4 are kinda corny & stupid.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
0060794410|5.0|Excellent Book, and the full length CD set (12 hrs) was better than the hard bound version. The CD is presented \\"Read\\" by the author of the book, and conveys his passion for the topic where you would normally try to extract it from the printed words yourself. The CD was recorded 5 years after the book was written, and contains some additional follow on information. This book makes you think! I would highly recommend listening to the CD set... even if you read the book!
B000005RUX|5.0|I love this album. It's not terribly original, but who says all great music needs to be original? It really is a triumph of craftsmanship over innovation - sure, they're essentially reinventing the wheel (you can tell the band listened to a LOT of Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Rolling Stones, Who, and AC/DC), but they reinvent it well, so no reason to complain.<br />Featured on this album are four large hits that have gone on to be just alternative radio staples. The massive hit \\"Jermey\\", a song about teen suicide, is probably the biggest, and while it's the weakest of the four, I will not deny the song has staying power, or a climactic, moving refrain. \\"Jermey spoke in... class today!\\" and all that. Eddie's vocals on the song in general are some of the best in rock history, ranging from all-out screams to pseudo-scatting to some subdued, melodic singing. That's why so many bands today take it upon themselves to blatantly steal from this group's book (Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Nickleback). Eddie Vedder. Stone Gossard and Mike McCready aren't exceptional guitarists, but they play cool riffs, and really step up to the plate on another pair of the classics, \\"Evenflow\\" and \\"Alive\\". The former is pure Hendrixian guitar wankery, but WHAT guitar wankery! That solo just screams to be BLASTED. Anyway, nothing wrong with stealing from Hendrix. Hendrix is awesome. And the latter features a superb guitar solo as well, this one slower than the last. Heavily inspired by Led Zeppelin, but I like Zeppelin (can't say I love 'em, but I like 'em). It sure helps that they're about meaningful topics: homelessness and child molestation, respectively. I love Nirvana (they're better than Pearl Jam in virtually every respect, in fact), but I think sometimes their lyrics are a bit self-centered. I never get that feeling from Pearl Jam. Anyway, the fourth hit is my personal favorite: the chilling \\"Black\\", which builds from quiet unplugged electric guitar playing to a huge, emotional climax - something a lot of other Pearl Jam songs do (see also \\"Alive\\"; \\"Jermey\\"; \\"Betterman\\"). I love the ending, where Eddie just screams his head off and the rest of the band does that cool, \\"Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo\\" stuff. Fantastic song! \\"Once\\" and \\"Why Go\\" get bashed a lot for being dated, but I like both: \\"Once\\" is pretty funky; and \\"Why Go\\" is a nice little rocker, though I'll admit Vedder overscreams, a trap he REALYL fell into on the next album, Vs. Both are better than anything by Creed, at any rate. And while it took a while for me to realize it, \\"Oceans\\" is another highlight of the album. this one's got a surprise influence: The Velvet Underground, one of my favorite bands. I think the structure and drumming owe a lot to \\"Heroin\\", one of my favorite songs. So I'm perfectly fine with it.<br />After \\"Oceans\\", the album gets weaker. While \\"Garden\\" and \\"Release\\" have  damn fine choruses (\\"I will waaaaaaaaaaaaalk in your gaaaaardeen...\\" and \\"RELEASE MEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!\\", respectively - much like U2 and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam construct perfect refrains, which are often more memorable than the verses), neither rank among the best; and I can't remember an ounce of \\"Porch\\" or \\"Deep\\", but I don't recall being annoyed by either. But the beautiful b-side \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\" (you can find it on the \\"Jermey\\" single, I think), my favorite Pearl Jam song other than \\"Black\\", should've been included in their place.<br />From here on out, it was all downhill for Pearl Jam. Even the next album (Vs.) had a lot of amateur screaming and a few poorly written tunes. These guys never equalled their debut album, a milestone in the grunge movement.a lot of other Pearl Jam songs do (see also \\"Alive\\"; \\"Jermey\\"; \\"Betterman\\").

B000W1V44I|5.0|I enjoyed all their past CD's.  But this is their best one yet.  The music definitely reflects their growth as musicians.  I highly recommend UNBREAKABLE to everyone!  I am soooo looking forward to hearing more from them!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|Boy do I wish I was at this one but this DVD is almost as good as being there.  Get this DVD and you will not be dissapointed.  David can play that guitar and still sings pretty good.  The bonus stuff is also fantastic.  Several guest artists really make it a cool event.  Just get this DVD.  I have nothing else to add except it is awesome.
0393039102|5.0|i also read this when it first appeared, was deeply moved and presented it to my wife's father, a ww2 veteran.  i write this review today because a man george bush proposed for attorney general is about to be approved while refusing to admit that waterboarding is torture.    as every reader of this book knows, this is precisely the torture that was used on the author eric lomax, which terrified and impacted him for his entire life, and made it so hard for him to forgive even the interrogator present during it.    several reviewers have said this book documents how brutal was the japanese treatment of prisoners, and i agree..  how can we allow ourselves to become the same as those wartime enemies we have characterized as monsters?  god help us if we do not object..
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My son would have watched it for at least 100 times!!! we used to borrow it from library and upon finding that he liked it so much, we bought him his own copy...    Now, at 4, he can play it all by himself and enjoys it through the end..    Wonderfully made.
0307346609|4.0|I am glad that I read World War Z.  I was excited to receive and read this book.  I haven't had the opportunity to read many zombie stories and don't have much to compare it with.  Some of the chapters were very good and others seemed plain and less than exciting.  A good read, I really liked the perspective that the author took to tell the story.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|My four-star rating in the end might be a little generous, but two top-notch elements in \\"Death Proof\\" prevent me from giving it a lukewarm three stars: Kurt Russell's tour-de-force performance as Stuntman Mike- where he effortlessly moves between cocky/cool, menacing, whiny, and finally, hilariously cowardly- and that uber-cool car battle at the end, as stunt gals take on stunt-psycho for the road-ruling crown.  You have to see this movie for those elements.  Trust me, it's worth sitting through the handful of endless girl-chat scenes to get to them.<br /><br />Ultimately I think I prefer the shorter, tighter cut of \\"Death Proof\\" that originally appeared in the double-feature theatrical presentation, \\"Grindhouse\\", though two extra scenes in this longer cut were fun: the notorious lap-dancing scene dangled before us but not delivered in the theaters (instead we got the frustrating practical joke of an apologetic, three-second \\"missing reel\\" insert card) and a black-and-white interlude at a convenience store that creepily sets the tone for Stuntman Mike's stalking of the second set of girls.  But otherwise I didn't notice anything else of note to justify the added length.<br /><br />Hmmmm, what else to say about this eccentric little DVD? The extra features are entertaining and well done... lots of behind-the-scenes stuff that's fun to see.  And the extras again remind us how enthusiastic Mr. Tarantino is on the set, for a minute making us think that the movie is better than we're giving it credit for.  For a minute.  And, oh yeah... because the movie's closing credits have been redone to excise music and credits for \\"Planet Terror\\" (the other half of the original \\"Grindhouse\\"), you get some interesting musical additions to replace that stuff, most notably a longer version- featuring a few foreign language verses- of the infectious \\"Chick Habit\\", performed by April March (the soundtrack album only has the shorter, all-English version of the song).  A small plus but a good one.<br /><br />\\"Death Proof\\" is certainly a lot of fun, and I'm glad I own it on DVD, but for my money, the two \\"Kill Bill\\" movies are still Mr. Tarantino's best grindhouse-style projects to date.  But, make no mistake, you still have to give this fuel-injected little thriller a look.\\"Death Proof\\" is certainly a lot of fun, and I'm glad I own it on DVD, but for my money, the two \\"Kill Bill\\" movies are still Mr. Tarantino's best grindhouse-style projects to date.

It's beautiful, the cookie designs are beyond adorable, and the directions are broken down in such an easy way that anyone can make the beautiful designs. I'm already plotting the various cookies I plan to bake up as holiday gifts. (I think even my impossible-to-impress Mother in Law is going to be bowled over with these designs.) I'd recommend this gorgeous book to bakers of any and all experience levels. And anyone who likes to bake will love to receive this as a gift to add to their collection, too! Happy cookie making.
B000UR9T8C|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  I really liked the first two.  Let me start out by saying that I watched this over two nights.  I did not feel like staying up until past midnight.  At first I thought the story was going to be about spider man vs The Sandman.  The Spiderman killed him (or so he thought.)  The His old friend whos father died in the last movie (the boy blamed spiderman)  looses his memory.  He gets it back and now it's him vs spiderman.  Then when I was getting into it The Sandman comes back and gets spideys friend to join him.  Ok I was a little erked then but it was ok.  I said it's just a movie.  THEN Spiderman gets this black goo stuff.  Kind of like a virus.  It takes him over and makes him turn mean.  It makes him real cockey and he stops thinking it bad to hurt his enemies.  Ok now I'm mad because already here are 3 stories going.  Then when I just about had enough Spiderman gets the stuff of of him and it goes onto someone else.  It goes onto Tofers character.  NOW there is a Sandman, a scientific ex spidey friend and a mutated spiderman trying to take down spidey.  Ok I think to myself, OK SOMETHING BETTER HAPPEN.  Well then Spiderman talks to his old friend and he decides to help him.  The Sandman tells Spiderman all about what happened when he killed his grandfather.  Spiderman tells him he isn't mad at him anymore and that he forgives him.  So now here I am, after seeing like an hour and a half of two enemies trying to kill Spiderman turn into either his friend or just turning into dust and flying away I'm a little milfed.  Siderman then gets the stuff off the evil Spiderman.  Let me just say something happens to the character he gets out.  I will not tell you what, for if I do then the movie will have no suprises at all.  BUT don't let that make ou feel good.  What happens happens so fast it's just over.  I don't even remember the last 10 or so minutes of the movie.  Oh and I forgot the part where Spidermans exfriend talks Spideys girlfriend into telling Spiderman she wants to move on and that they can;t go out anymore.  What it comes down to is this.  This could have been a good movie using just one of the many enemies they had spiderman face.  It is as though they had 3 or four differen't movies and said \\"hey guys, instead of taking the time to make 4 movies.  Let's just through all this crap into one and save the time.  We know well make alot of money off of it because it's Spiderman.\\"  Well I was sad to see a movie that had the possibility to be such a great movie, come out so bad.  I hear there is a 4th movie beng made.  All I can say is this.  If any of the crew that has anything to do with the story and plot is reading this.  \\"Just have one good solid story.  A great story can change your life.  I am reading a book now that has me so drawn into it.  It is harry potter 6.  The one story is amazing.  I leave my body when I read it and I awake in a world not of my own.  For this book brings in into a new existance.  One story.  one main purpose.  One main objective.  That is what makes a great story.  Not a bunch of action shots and fight scenes.\\"  Actually even the graphics are bad.  I mean the look amazing but you can see the fakeness of them.  Like you watching a cgi movie.  I did not notice this in the first two movies.  Ok it's almost 11 and I am going to watch Ghost Wisperer and Numbers.

1401300529|5.0|Halberstam's wonderfully written book is far more than a detailed chronicle of the relatively ignored Korean War. By recounting the domestic political considerations that led to the war, and the political maneuvers and posturing that went on as politicians lined up to benefit from anti-communism, Halberstam illustrates a powerful repetitive syndrome that has plagued U.S. politics. That syndrome has led to our three most recent wars -- Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq (1&2).<br /><br />Domestic politicians look for issues to use to either consolidate their power or wrest it from those who have had it. The details of the issues are almost irrelevant. It is their ability to use those issues to destroy their opponents and take over their power that drives their convictions.<br /><br />Communism was indeed a vile ideology, and the Soviet Union was a pathological, paranoid, evil state. Many Americans believed -- wrongly -- that Communism and Socialism were the keys to a better kind of world. But Communism in the U.S. was never a threat to the existence of our political system or way of life. It did, however, offer Republican politicians a wonderful issue to use in fighting Democrats who, under Franklin Roosevelt and Truman, had held power for a considerable period. By whipping up anti-red fervor, they affected national policies, destroyed some of their opponents, and rose to power (Nixon).<br /><br />The situation today is not entirely congruent. We have a war that the administration started, at least partially, to solidify domestic support for the Republican party and, by generating profits, for their economic base. However, we also have an anti-war party that has taken that position mostly to wrest power from the Republicans -- not because they truly believe the war was wrong -- if it had gone better, they would have loved it.<br /><br />I'm not sure what distorted policies a Democratic president would be forced to develop if that party wins in 2008 and then has to defend itself against Republican attacks -- but I'm fairly sure they won't be the best we can do.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand how domestic politics interacts with foreign policy before and during wartime.- but I'm fairly sure they won't be the best we can do.    This book should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand how domestic politics interacts with foreign policy before and during wartime.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|Mark Knopfler continues his successful solo career with this album.<br />This disc has an excellent mix of songs.  I love the romantic \\"True Love Will Never Fade\\" and the sweet \\"Secondary Waltz\\".  I love the accordian playing by Ian Lowthian and violin playing by John McCusker featured on \\"Secondary Waltz\\".  I also loved the harder tracks on this disc like \\"Behind On The Rent\\" and \\"Madame Geneva\\".  Mark's low vocal register conveys such  depth of feeling on these tracks.  The percussion instruments accompany Mark's vocals and guitar playing perfectly on \\"Punish The Monkey\\"  This is an interesting song about a crime that has been committed.  \\"We Can Go Wild\\" is a happy coming of age tune.  \\"The Scaffolder's Wife\\" is a beautiful song about the sacrifices a wife makes for her husband.  The flute playing by Chris White is a nice touch.  The musical arrangements on all these tracks are excellent  \\"The Fizzy And The Still\\" is another gem of a song about a man trying to make amends with the woman he loves after being away from her.  This is one of the best albums of the year.
0307237699|5.0|Critics of Obama go after him for not having easy answers and clear-cut solutions.  We've had plenty such types in the present administration.  When will we ever learn?  Obama thinks, and writes and talks, admittedly much like a professor.  And he reads--not just biographies but difficult and challenging works of literature--to learn, to gain practice in interpreting the complexities of human nature, to confront the gray areas and even darkness that, try as hard as we might to deny them, are as present in life as in great literature.  He doesn't come before the cameras and announce that while on the ranch he \\"read a couple of Shakespeares\\"; like Hamlet or Lear or Henry V he contemplates the actual situation, the questions, and the right responses of a conscientious leader.  As he makes clear, he is not a \\"sound bite\\" politician.  Instead, like Jefferson, JFK, Carter and Clinton, he's (and I know this is risky) not merely \\"intelligent\\" but an \\"intellectual,\\" and in the best sense of the term.  Better that Americans base their next choice of President on the kind of conversation they can share by reading this book than by the criterion: \\"Who's the guy you would most like to sit down and have a beer with?\\"  We tried that.<br /><br />Obama knows that what the country is facing at this time in history--perceived and reviled as an imperialist aggressor, seeking vengeance and projecting isolationist and arbitrary nationalistic pride--clearly outranks issues of race, gender, religion: we need someone with a near-exclusive focus on the problems that confront us all--from foreign affairs to Katrina to global warming.  Hillary was accused of playing the gender guard when she told Wellesley students that the all-girls' school had prepared her to hold her own in the \\"all-boys' club\\" of Presidential politics.  And some have accused Obama of playing the \\"race card\\" because he occasionally uses a different accent and lexicon (i.e. \\"code shifts\\" into the vocabulary and cadences of Martin Luther King or Jesse Jackson).  But perhaps there's a distinction between the two candidates: Obama has said nothing about his experiences as a black man preparing him to handle himself in the white boys' fraternity.  Instead of making an issue out of his ability and its source, he's got that \\"vision thing\\" (as Dubya's dad once called it), and in addition has the savvy to draw upon his life experience to communicate to different audiences in different contexts.  And that's exactly the kind of President that we need at a time when America has become more isolated, more dysfunctional in its relations with other nations, religions, and peoples than in human memory.<br /><br />[Well, I see I'm batting under .200 for this one. Time to pack the uniform and adjust to Triple A.  Don't know whether I've offended Edwards-Hillary supporters or Republicans.  If the latter, I actually like McCain and can picture him in the starring role.  And if forced to, I'd probably have to place my bets on Giuliani (even after the last two unfortunate Presidential elections).  Anyone who can convert the world's most cosmopolitan city into a family theme park knows how to have it his way.  But the only major contender who immediately rued and then renounced the Iraq invasion was Obama.  After reading his book, you'll understand why.

If you want an exciting sci-fi movie, then look elsewhere. Maybe Matrix or Star Wars will do.    Avoid this one like the plague!!
B000NA2348|5.0|Bowie's longtime producer Tony Visconti strikes again!  After the wonderful DVD-Audio and CD re-releases of David Live and Stage, Mr. TV has worked his magic on the classic Young Americans album.      If you've never heard this album, it will rock your world.  If you know this album well, the new version will rock your world even harder!  I was simply amazed at how great the sound is, especially the surround effect in 5.1.  I heard instrumentation and vocal arrangements that got lost in the earlier stereo album mix.  It was like hearing the album for the first time all over again!    If you don't have surround sound yet, the included stereo CD is just as exciting.  The mix is much brighter and more powerful than before, so you won't be disappointed.    Also, the DVD includes the rare video of Mr. Bowie's completely coked-up appearance on the Dick Cavett show -- absolutely essential viewing for any Bowie fan!

Even the first chapters of the book, which discuss the history of birthing and the emergence of this method, are relaxing to read.  I have been able to use the breathing exercises to calm myself during stressful, non-pregnancy related times.  I feel so much more confident now about my upcoming childbirth experience.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in trying a drug-free birth experience.
B000G8NXYQ|1.0|What may have passed for great art in the narcissistic seventies must today be seen for crude, overbaked claptrap by a once-great cinematist who was just treading water by 1973.<br /><br />I took this dvd out because some reviewers somewhere wrote that it was better than \\"La Dolce Vita\\".  It is far worse, in truth, despite being in color while only black and white film was available in 1950's Italy.<br /><br />I also listened to the \\"learned\\" commentary on the Critereon Collection dvd, trying to derive some meaning from the disjointed and often offensive scenes I was viewing (movie is obsessed with backsides and flatulence).  Whatever those guys were seeing, it was in their own minds, not on the screen.  I suspect they had no more idea than I what Fellini was trying to say with this mess, but to admit it would never do for professors of film studies.  So they pontificated about feminism and the role of women for two hours--topics in which Fellini was not at all interested!

B00005JPFH|4.0|Everything is going well for a change for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  He's finally dating the woman of his dreams, new Broadway star Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst).  He's doing very well at school.  And his alter ego, Spider-man, is the toast of New York City, much to the dismay of newspaperman J. Jonah Jamison (J. K. Simmons).<br /><br />The only downside to his life is former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).  Harry has recently learned (or decided) that it was Peter who killed Mr. Osborn and has vowed revenge.<br /><br />Soon, that will be the least of Peter's worries.  The man truly responsible for killing his uncle Ben has just escaped from jail.  Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) is on the run when he stumbles into a science experiment and gets molecularly turned into Sandman.  Meanwhile, Peter's plan to propose to Mary Jane falls apart and the two begin to drift.  And a mysterious substance has attached itself to Peter, tapping into his darker side and making him more powerful at the same time.  Will his new power and attitude destroy him?  Can he get revenge on a man who has no shape?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of the comic books, I can't comment on how the movie compares to the source material.  I can, however, complain about the change to the Uncle Ben storyline.  Those scenes in the original were what made Spider-man become Spider-man.  Suddenly, this revelation changes everything.  This doesn't sit well with me.  Couple that with the weak climax (I get why they had to do it thematically, but I still didn't like it), and you've got my complaints on the film.<br /><br />The rest of the film was wonderful.  The action scenes were amazing and had me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects made me believe everything I saw.  Yet the movie had plenty of emotional storylines.  They were perfectly balanced with the action and really made things even better.  For comic relief, there are Peter Parker's scenes under the influence of the virus.  And I loved Harry Osborn's arc in the film.  Even with all the different notes, the actors never missed a beat and made everything believable.<br /><br />If they just hadn't changed the details of Uncle Ben's death, I would have loved the film.  As it is, it is still entertaining.  A worthy pop corn flick.n the film.  Even with all the different notes, the actors never missed a beat and made everything believable.

B000URDEB0|3.0|Don't get me wrong - I adore Nightwish. Well, at least until Tarja was a part of the team. But I just can't get over stupidity of everyone involved in the \\"letter incident\\". Don't people talk anymore?    Yes, Tarja may have been acting like a diva, but she IS a diva - the combination of her looks and voice don't come that often and absence of her  powerful instrument is the main reason why I gave \\"Dark Passion Play\\" just 3 stars.    Again, don't get me wrong - the songs themselves are not bad at all. Melodies are first class and arrangements are superb. But it just doesn't add up - when you have such monumental and operatic instrumentals, you must have a leading voice to match. Sadly, Anette's voice is too weak to follow. Not that she's a bad singer - she sings rather nicely, but after the choir is done with the refrain the songs just fall flat. Tarja's voice carried over that parts and prepared as for the next explosion of choir singing, which is best heard on their last masterpiece and apparently the original line-up's swan-song - \\"Once\\".    The guys obviously thought that in this video-MTV-age they could get by with a less talented singer (but equally beautiful one) instead of opting for someone with a soprano voice (but without the looks). And sadly, their choice is our loss...
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Whoa. Where do I start with this one?  Okay, I'm just going to say right now that Avenged Sevenfold have created a career-defining album.  It may not be their heaviest album to date, but the band ditched the metalcore thing a long time ago. This upset and alienated many of the longtime fans and I'll admit that it kinda rubbed me the wrong way. At first.  Then I realized that with \\"City of Evil\\", the band I had grown to love with \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\" and \\"Waking the Fallen\\" were going for something different altogether. But when you think about it, each record they've done has always been radically different than the one before it, so a big change on this album shouldn't come as such a suprise. Still, as different as this self-titled album is, I think it's their best, most focused (albeit, more polished) yet.  It's the sound of a band busting out of a genre and truly discovering themselves.  In short, this is their \\"Sing the Sorrow\\". This is their \\"Black Album\\".  It's sure to upset many, but just as many will find something to love.      Despite all the hatred these guys have had to deal with, they know who their true fans are and this masterpiece should please most of them looking to hear something different than what they've come to expect.  Still, as different as it may be, it's still distinctly A7X.  This is apparent fromt the get-go with the first three tracks.  You gotta love the intro to \\"Critical Acclaim\\" and although I'm normally not a fan of politically-themed music, it's refreshing to hear a different take other than just how much \\"the administration sucks\\".  \\"Almost Easy\\" didn't do much for me the first time I heard it but it grew on me after a couple of listens and I can now see why it was chosen as their first single.  If the album has one weak moment, it would have to be \\"Scream\\".  While far from bad, it's just kinda mediocre by the band's standards.  It does have a pretty cool \\"Vulgar\\"-era, Pantera-esque groove to it and it's kinda nice to have in the background when you're having a few.      The album really takes a hard turn with \\"Afterlife\\".  This is where things start to really get different. We will most certainly be seeing a video for this one soon on Headbanger's Ball because it's sure to be one of the band's biggest hits.  Starts off with some strings before diving headfirst into a dual-harmonies and insane drumming before switching into mid-temp then the chorus hits and we're left in awe. Yeah, thsi song alone will probably gain them more fans. I'm not sure yet but this could almost be their \\"Unforgiven\\".    \\"Lost\\" is one of my favorites right now and it's one of those that they're going to catch a lot of grief about.  They took the Auto-tune, which is normally used for pitch-correction, and actually used it to give the Dragonforce-like track a whole new vocal dimension. Almost liked they used it as another instrument.  It's laid on so thick that it takes the vocals to a whole new level. Not everybody will dig it, purists are sure to hate it, but I think it was a brilliant move on their part.      If you've read ANY reviews, then you've probably already heard about \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\".  The first time I heard this one, I had a vicious hangover so things were moving a little slow for me and I had to give it three consecutive listens just to wrap my mind around what all was going on.  I read somewhere that the original title was \\"Big Bear\\" (an awesome title that I wish they would've kept) and this is their \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".  There aren't many bands that could pull off a track like this one, and it really should seem kinda out of place, but for some reason it works.  \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" comparisons are obvious but this plays more like a Tim Burton nightmare mixed with Beetle Juice and a strong dose of sick humor thrown in for good measure.  Love it. (Is it just me or is there even a little bit of Mr. Bungle thrown in the mix too?)      The album is nearly flawless in my mind and the production (done by the band) is perfect. (Truth be told, I think Rick Rubin would've have been the only other man for the job.)  True enough, it will probably alienate a few fans who were expecting \\"Waking the Fallen 2\\" or who're still mad at Metallica for not recycling \\"Master Of Puppets\\" for the rest of their career, but it's sure to gain them many more fans. In short, die hards will love it, as will open-minded people who are sick of the same-ole radio schtick.  Also, it's ALWAYS a good thing when you can listen to a whole album in one sitting and still be wanting more.  9/10
0887307280|5.0|Not only have I read the E-Myth, but two weeks ago while at my insurance marketing convention, Gerber spoke for 2 hours. We was very insightful and very funny. He reminded me of George Carlin.     Gerber preaches systems and process. Working on your business not in it. His favorite example is Ray Kroc of McDonald's. Kroc never worked in a McDonald's, never flipped a hamburger. What he did was set up the systems to be followed for the lowest education level so it could be replicated over and over again.      I could go on and on about Gerber.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Wow, I was a little worried that I would not like this album, but I have to say that this is a great album. I love every song on this album from the Acapella Intro to the sad and dreary \\"Unsuspected Sunday Afternoon\\". I have to say I love the new sound better than the old sound. I was so amazed by \\"Never Gone\\" and the new sound. I know they will be around just as long as the eagles. They don't have to compete with other boy bands anymore like N'sync. Apparently, this group was God given because they have lasted this long as friends. The solo projects did not destroy the band, and they say over and over again that they are like brothers a family. I look forward to seeing more and more of the Backstreet Boys, and the music will get better with age. Maybe they will win their first Grammy very soon because people have to get over the fact that they are no longer a \\"boy band\\", but a band of talented men.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|It was a great CD, as everyone expected.  The only problem I have is that when I got the CD, the word F#$*ery was bleeped out on my disc.  That really upset me.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|This girl needs to stop making music because I always end up liking her single and end up buying her cd and loving it. I own all of her previous music, but this cd has to be her best for me at least. Yes, she has changed and I used dislike her vocals, but her vocals aren't as annoying as it used to be. I really like this album. I listen to it at work, and I want to jump up from my chair and bust a move. Britney, if you keep making music like this. I will continue to buy it. Good Job on this cd.
0307387178|5.0|I first got this book by accident while browsing through books about Alaska at my local library. I enjoyed it so much that I just had to own it. 5 stars and highly recommended to anyone who is into hiking, wilderness survival or Alaska.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|After seeing LOVE in Las Vegas last summer, this CD has been a steady in my iPod. This soundtrack recalls the images of the performance so vividly I love to get lost in remembering what a cool experience it all was. I think the re-tooled mixes are fantastic and maintain the integrity of the originals. It helps that George Martin had his hand in the process...lends a bit of credibility. Not just anyone can remix Beatles tunes!!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|If you like to watch women talk about uninteresting things for an hour and a half, tune in. This movie was so boring. I am a big Tarantino fan, but this movie was a let down. Especially after seeing Rodriguezs brilliant Planet Terror and some hilarious faux trailers. People in the theater were sighing and a few left during it. Only the last fifteen minutes is even worth looking at. Finally some action. Even the witty Tarantino dialogue isnt here. Watch Planet Terror and skip this one!
B00004VVN9|5.0|This is an excellent movie for anybody that has an interest in the afterlife.  Christopher Walken is fantastic in this movie.  He portrays a young scientist that gets caught up in an experiment using technology and the brain.  I highly recommend it!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is just a Must See movie, as it has a powerful message apt for the times in which we are living. Though V himself is taking personal revenge in the way of killing the leaders in control, his appeal to people is not one of violence. He appeals to people to wake up from their slumber and stand up against the endless lies and brutality of the regime. That this is the message is clearly seen in his speeches as well as the way in which the people respond to it.    The scene at the end of the film where thousands of people, young and old march unarmed, hand in hand against the oppressors and the troops, is an extremely powerful message and reminiscent of the power of Gandhi's message of non-violence and civil disobedience.    As this non-violent uprising culminates in the film on the 5th of November, it is a timely reminder to go out and buy this video and let the message sink in.    As a follow up reading \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, is eerily close in describing the fascist society that is shown in the film and sadly also close to the way things are going. The book \\"Political Ponerology\\" is another recommendable book that details the process by which a society gets to become a totalitarian state.
1400049628|5.0|This book is so good. The intelligent writing of this book, making it us believe that its an actual handbook (and a really good one at that) with all the posible aspects of a guerrilla warfare and unconventional attacks, defense and approachs to a zombie menace.      Its Fun, Its Clever, and really makes me wanna be part of a zombie apocalypse (and yes...that is sick...but the book really gets one pumped up)
B000E1KN5W|5.0|Normally I would hesitate to recommend an album that has been reissued on CD as often as King Crimson's seminal first album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\". However, this is the first time that the album has been reissued using the long missing original mastertapes from side one of the album.<br /><br />First the positives--there's increased depth and detail that make this a stand out. \\"I Talk to the Wind\\" benefits particularly because it is one of the quieter tracks on the album. The album is presented in a miniature replica gatefold sleeve with a booklet that includes news clippings from the time about the band.<br /><br />The bad is pretty minor but needs to be made note of for honesty sake; it appears that the midrange of the album has been boosted a tad. Purists that want a \\"flat\\" transfer of the album with no futzing will probably be disappointed with this. However, listening to the album convinced me that this actually benefited the vocals of the album in a good way.<br /><br />This is a classic album well worth picking up and the fact that the original mastertapes have finally been located for the first side of the album (tracks 1-3)is a big plus. There aren't any notes here as to who remastered this (I can only assume that it was Fripp and Simon Heyworth again from Chop 'Em Out who remastered all the other albums)but they do a terrific job overall.
B000Y1H7VA|5.0|This new silver limited edition of Zeitgeist (Best Buy exclusive released 10/30/07) includes three songs that are not on the original release:<br /><br />\\"Death From Above\\" (4:06) (track 08) (also available on the Best Buy version, Japanese version, German version, Amazon.de version, and a B-side of \\"Tarantula\\").  It is a softer, driving song that is a great mix of keyboards, guitar, and drums.  This song is certainly a welcome missing treat from the original Zeitgeist.<br /><br />\\"Stellar\\" (6:24)  (track 12) (also available on the iTunes version, and a B-side on \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\").  It is a beautiful slower song.<br /><br />\\"Ma Belle\\" (4:08)  (track 13) (Previously Unreleased) is also slow, but it builds at about the halfway point.<br /><br />All three songs are more than welcome.  They are all recorded by Terry Date and Bjorn Thorsrud.  They are all performed by Jimmy Chamberlin (Drums) and Billy Corgan (All the rest).  \\"Death From Above\\" and \\"Stellar\\" are produced by BC/JC (Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin).  \\"Ma Belle\\" is produced by BC/JC and Terry Date.<br /><br />So this Silver version is still missing the known Zeitgeist recording session songs \\"Zeitgeist\\",\\"Gossamer\\", \\"Superchrist\\", and  \\"Signal to Noise\\" ... but, of course, then it would have to be two CDs because this version is 67 minutes and 6 seconds long (\\"Gossamer\\" alone is rumored to be 15 - 35 minutes long).<br /><br />The DVD has a 20 minute documentary called \\"Inside the Zeitgeist\\".  Picture Format 4 X 3. It is in NTSC All Region format according the back of the disc.  The back also says Linear PCM (Linear pulse code modulation).<br /><br />There is no booklet with this release.  It is a cardboard gatefold cover with plastic inserts that hold the 2 discs.  The silver cover is very cool, but it ruins the double meaning of having a red ocean around the statue of liberty (is it blood, a sunset, or a sunrise?).<br /><br />So, can you live without the bonus tracks?  Not if you are a Billy or Pumpkins fan.  If you are a casual fan and already own Zeitgeist Red, Yellow, Purple, Blue, Green,  etc... then, eh, maybe not...but if you collect all of the colors, you can make an Andy Warhol-esque collage.

0805079831|1.0|I enjoyed Klein's previous effort, \\"No Logo.\\"  She was better qualified to comment on advertising and the media than on macroeconomics and international political history.    The Shock Doctrine condemns \\"Chicago School\\" economics and Milton Friedman in particular.  I won't go into the specifics, but the basic idea here is that democracy is incompatible with capitalism, and that free markets (which according to Klein are evil things indeed) result from catastrophic events such as natural disasters and revolutions.  Within the book, Klein asserts that Friedman and his ideas were essentially behind the atrocities of Pinochet in Chile.  This is not supported by the historical record, and as Timothy Lee points out:    \\"just as Michael Moore's endorsement of Cuba's health care system doesn't constitute endorsement of Castro's dictatorial rule, so Friedman's endorsement for Chilean tax or pension policies don't constitute an endorsement of coups, purges, or torture.\\"    The Shock Doctrine, and the film by the same name, uses a number of specious rhetorical techniques, such as slippery slope, post hoc ergo proptor hoc reasoning, and blatant pathetic appeals.  The film mimics the style of conspiracy theorist films (see \\"Spare Change\\").    Friedman maintained that freedom depends upon the ability to make unfettered economic choices.  In other words, there is a connection between economic liberty and personal liberty.  Klein is not interested in this.  She wants government guarantees, and puts more emphasis on wanting than deserving.  Capitalism is an economic theory, not an ethical system--to criticize it for not being inherently ethical is like complaining that the Easter Bunny didn't bring you presents, when that is the job of Santa Claus.  Are there problems in capitalism?  Absolutely.  These problems are not the result of free trade--they are the result of corruption, and in many cases, government interference in the private sector (see the S&L scandal to see what I mean).      Klein apparently wants some kind of mixed system of free market economics with socialist policies and guarantees.  This describes France, where the unemployment rate has been consistently around 8-12% for the last 10 years (double the U.S. rate), young people are basically barred from the workforce, ethnic discontent and violence is rising (lots of burning cars and riots), and productivity is falling. And yes, France has plenty of corruption.    The text is at best anecdotal and polemical.  When one finally gets through the 400 pages, they may quickly recall G.K. Chesterton's remark:    \\"The reformer is always right about what is wrong, but seldom right about what is right.\\"    The best thing to do is to read Friedman in the original and make up your own mind.
0895260131|5.0|1. There is one god in Islam! 2. mohammad,Jesus, Moses,David (and others) Peace Be Upon Them are messengers of Allah. 3. Islam was spread by the sword? Islam is one of the fastest growing religions in the world, TODAY. 4. Allah is not the God of Muslims only. He is the God of all people and all creation.  5. The Islamic concept of God is that He is loving, merciful, and compassionate. But Islam also teaches that He is just and swift in punishment. Nevertheless, Allah once said to Prophet Muhammad, \\"My mercy prevails over my wrath.\\" Islam teaches a balance between fear and hope, protecting one from both complacency and despair. 6. Muslims neither worship Muhammad nor pray through him. Muslims solely worship the unseen and Omniscient Creator, Allah. and the list goes on and on!
B000RMQH30|3.0|I wanted to review this at 3 1/2 stars but it didn't work.  My favorite songs are Having Wings, Lonesome Train and Younger Than Today.  I always like Ben's prettier songs more than the rocking blues songs.      Unfortunately Ben's voice is too loud on the title track Lifeline which drowns out the guitar part.  It's also a bit too loud on the first song Fight Outta You.  I think he produced it himself which might explain these obvious mistakes.

If you were a fan of the original cartoon and the first movie you will fall in love with this.

B000RJO578|5.0|Quick question: Did you like \\"Shaun of the dead?\\"  Then you should already be buying this DVD.  I actually found this even funnier than SOTD, and it was definitely a change of pace to see Simon Pegg playing the no-nonsense straight man to Nick Frost's bumbling but hilarious funny man.  Great action and just a excellent homage to every buddy flick/action movie out there.  Great fun and definitely worth the coin.
0099429799|4.0|This is my second reading of this book having read it when it first came out.  It was not one that stuck with me so when searching the bookshelf for something to read, I tried it again.  This second time around, it had more of an impact.    The characters of Briony and Cecilia are well developed.  The setting of pre-war England and England during the war comes alive.  However, there are times that I just had to reread because I wasn't sure I really understood the sentence.   Some sentences are really really long -- needlessly so, I think.    The plot is interesting; lives are drastically changed because of a young girls vivid imagination.  However, life goes on.  This is a good read, but not a fast one.
B00005Q3TZ|5.0|First I will review both the movie and the DVD. This movie has gotten alot of flack from the day it was released and still does. The movie itself is very well done. It truly captures the mood of that fatefull day and the chaos that ensued during the battle at Pearl. The romance did not detract from the spirit of the movie and instead added to the drama and truly made you connect to the characters. The acting was superb in this. Ben Afleck gave a spectacular performance one of his best in my opinion. As did Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckensale. John Voight did an excellent job as FDR and Alec Baldwin was the perfect choice for Doolittle, and Cuba Gooding did a great job. The music and effects are stellar and add alot to the movie. The theatrical version of this movie was dumbed down abit in the gore department which didn't bother me much. However now that I have finally seen this Directors Cut it makes this great movie even better. The war scenes are gritter which adds to the realisim and several scenes are extended and one scene is swaped for a different version which changes the whole mood of the last 1/4 of the movie. This is as I stated is more bloody and far more realistic (think Saving Private Ryan)so not for the faint at heart but it is indeed the better of the two versions. Both are great but when compared you won't want to see the other version again.
630542845X|5.0|How many movies, books or tv shows can make you cry? My answer is, not many. powder took my breath away. It delivers on all emotional cylinders and when Powder used his special abilities to allow two people to speak, one who had been in a coma for many years, I couldn't hold back. This is an unusual movie in that I had no expectations going in and came out completely satisfied. A plus.
1595141715|5.0|\\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" is a powerful and insightful first novel by author Jay Asher. The plot is very original and not at all like filler teen novels that try to portray high school life. \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" offers a true look into the ins and outs of high school drama and how it can slowly begin to affect someone's life. I, personally, could understand how those events could culminate in someone wanting their life to end. Maybe not one event alone, or even three or four, but put several of them together and it could make anyone go a little berserk. In the case of this novel, those events create a poignant story of how other people's actions shape, and by extension ruin, an individual's faith in people.     This is the most incredible book I have read in a very long time. I simply could not put it down. I finished it in less than a day and, to be honest, I truly did not want it to end.  This is the type of novel that would make me want to change my life. It helped me realize that some people do need to be reached out to. It can be a scary line to cross, not knowing when to help and when to just leave things be. But some people do need help more than others. Hannah's story made me think of my own life when I was going through a rough time several years ago. I never considered suicide, but thinking back, I remember how no one (repeat NO ONE) tried to find out what was going on. I can relate to Hannah's loneliness and helplessness and can understand why she felt that way. Nobody ever realized that just the act of asking can save someone's life (or, at the very least, their sanity).  This novel would make a great study in human nature, and provides a deep look at the angst that accompanies high school and its impact on individuals.     I would read this book over and over again and recommend it to anyone looking for a great page turner.
0891419195|5.0|This is one of the best books, of any genre, that I have ever read.  What a profound new respect I have for combat veterans.  With crisp, unadorned prose, Sledge describes what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific during WWII so vividly, that on more than one occasion, I found myself hunkered down in the chair, my shoulders tight and my teeth clenched.  If reading about the battles on Peleliu and Okinawa can make me that tense, I cannot begin to fathom how the Marines and soldiers actually in the fights did not crack up.  And, in Sledge's honest telling, many did. Unlike a lot of books where ALL Americans were noble and heroic, Sledge does not pull any punches.  His description of a Marine in a fox hole who loses it one night and can't be made to shut up is haunting.  I imagine many scenes in the book will stay with me.<br /><br />My brother is getting a copy of this for his birthday.  Highly recommended - even if you think you don't like \\"war stories.\\"  If you're human, this is worth reading.
B000ULQV0W|4.0|The album is brilliant. And it's even more invigorating once you've seen the film. Scenes flash instantly when you hear every note. Let's be honest - Alexander Supertramp's \\"ode to an apple\\" leaps to mind upon the first few notes of \\"Rise.\\" It's unavoidable. The piercing banjo plucks against a softer, more sophisticated Vedder gruff...it's almost perfect. And it's all a backdrop for a Krakauer gem. As for the addition of the two politically-charged tunes to the album? Well, see that one missing star?
B000P12LWY|2.0|This first season of the Tudors concentrates on Henry's attempt to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, a member of the royal Spanish family, so that he can remarry a younger woman who can give him a male heir. Thus the time period of English history being addressed is roughly 1527 to no later than 1532. If you are looking for a beautifully filmed well-acted piece of drama set in the 16th century that has little basis in fact, this show fits the bill. I guess I've been spoiled by \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" that first aired back on network television back in 1971, and is now on DVD. The production values were much lower in that six segment show than this Showtime extravaganza, but they got most of the details and the costumes right.<br /><br />Besides all of the playing with the facts and even the existence of King Henry's family members in \\"The Tudors\\", what bothers me the most is the fact that King Henry in this case is sporting the body - and haircut - of the leading man in a 21st century detective show. The first season of \\"The Tudors\\" ends, from my best guess with all of the playing with the details, no later than 1532, since Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII were married in 1533. By that time Henry VIII was in his early 40's and overweight. HBO just finished a six season eight year run with a series that dared to have a leading man - Tony Soprano - who was not good looking in a conventional sense, gluttonous towards food, overweight, and was ruthless in both his personal and professional lives - not far off from King Henry in these regards. The result was a show that won both critical and popular acclaim. Showtime should give its audience a little credit and dare to show Henry as he really was, not as a post-Titanic DiCaprio knock-off.
1401207529|5.0|I have to say that this is amazing.  Frank Miller does an awesome job of portraying batman/bruce's fears and faults within the first year and the artwork really pops.  not to flashy or colourful, but not dull and neutral either.  A most enjoyable read
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Love, love, love Michael Buble!!!  I love this genre.  His style & voice is a modern version of Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra.  I don't know how many time, I've listen to this CD.  Definitely, recommend this CD for anyone who love this type of music.
B000RE619I|5.0|I paid more and waited a long time for this to be shipped. The track listing is wrong here in the description. Chivas is a seperate track #14 and then #15 is a song called Fading, which is why I wanted the import. I love the whole album and Fading is great. I wish it was on the U.S. version. If you're crazy for Kelly like I am, consider buying this one. Oh, and I also just saw her live in concert. She is really fantastic. Not many people can actually hit those high notes live. She is amazing.
B00005CDNI|4.0|This album would be perfect, were it not for the two drippy ballads. No matter how I try, I cannot listen to 'I Have a Dream' or 'Chiquidita' (or however you spell it!). But everything else is dynamic and gleaming.    Agnetha and Anni-Frid sing their hearts out, displaying the fullest extent of their combined talents. Benny and Bjorn's songwriting and arranging make you want to sing and dance along. My husband thinks that there is something really wrong with me that I love ABBA and the Velvet Underground equally (amongst other 'cooler' acts). But he doesn't know what he's missing!    This album - bar the two drippy ballads - is pure Pop Pleasure. ABBA at the top of their game.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Once again, Disney delivers; not only a \\"Classic\\" animated film, but loads it with extras for everyone to enjoy.  This film was a hit when I was a youngster and is one of my three favorite Disney animated movies.  [The others being- 101 Dalmations and Snow White].  All the voices fit the characters they are portraying.  Not like the animated flicks of today, with celebrities hitching to the voice wagon, just so they can tell their precocious offspring- \\"Look daddy (or in some cases Grandpappy) is the voice of Fester the Fish!\\" I especially like the voice of Shere Khan, provided by George Sanders.  Those great animators of yesteryear even made the Tiger look like Sanders.  Each frame of the film is picture postcard perfect.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say-I loved this DVD!  Now I'm waiting with bated breath for the spring release of 101 Dalmations.  I know the Disney group will not disappoint.  [PS: Now if only I could plant a seed about releasing- The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh].

B000UD0ESA|1.0|I have seen both the original cut and the final cut on the big screen. The first Blade Runner left me feeling elated, entertained and full of inspiration. This tired retread left me feeling disgusted and flat.<br /><br />Why disgusted? In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.<br /><br />Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't \\"fix me\\" I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the \\"boy meets girl ending\\" is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims.<br /><br />Too bad Hollywood doesn't pay its writers better, instead of forcing them to go on strike. Maybe then we would have some really daring sci-fi film making instead of this tripe!<br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction see:[[ASIN:B000059HAE Zardoz]] and [[ASIN:B000059HAC Enemy Mine]] and [[ASIN:B000TZN7KQ Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]Fantastic Planet]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXXP A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and [[ASIN:630587493X Bicentennial Man]] and [[ASIN:B001S86J0I Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)]]
0060555661|5.0|This book is a great read. It's very logical and practical. Graham's principles are somewhat conservative but that doesn't mean you don't make money, it just means you're smart about it or an \\"intelligent investor.\\" The commentary provided at the end of each chapter helps to clarify and put it into today's context. I would suggest knowing very basic information on investing before reading this.
B000W4HFY8|4.0|When I first heard they were finally coming out with a CD of music from the second season of Twin Peaks, my jaw dropped to the floor and my heart skipped a beat. Could it be possible, after all these years, to get this music on a CD? The answer is an emphatic, YES!!    The selection of tracks covers a lot of fan favorites and some of my personal favorites of any of the music the great Angelo Badalamenti composed for the series. In addition to the season 2 music, there are some previously unreleased material from the film prequel Fire Walk With Me including the Lynch composed \\"Blue Frank\\" and Angelo's \\"Half Heart\\" and \\"Laura's Dark Boogie\\" all of which are great to have on CD, \\"Half Heart\\" being one of the best tracks on the CD as a whole.    I agree with a previous review that the acoustic version of the main title used in the Ben Horne scene waxing nostalgic is not only one of my favorite tracks but I also agree it would have been a nice addition.    Standout tracks:    \\"Shelly\\" - loved this music and the scene in which it was first used, a beautiful piece of music.    \\"Audrey's Prayer\\" - the track used the most in season two and a definite must for this CD, truly beautiful again.    \\"Harold's Theme\\" - short but those haunting guitars (wow!) and the keyboard playing the melody certainly evokes memories of Harold Smith and a great addition to the CD, albeit it's a little short.    \\"Night Bells\\" - great guitar work. I don't know why this one sticks out, but I love that this music was included.     \\"Drug Deal Blues\\" - one of the grooviest songs ever to be heard on Twin Peaks, this is a solid gold jam.    \\"Josie and Truman\\" - another staple of the second season used in so many good ways. This might be my favorite track on the CD. One of Angelo's best jazz arrangements that's for sure.    \\"Hook Rug Dance\\" - enough said. This is a must inclusion and a great track.    I thought the the \\"Dark Mood Woods/Red Room\\" extended track was a very interesting compostion and shouldhave been included because of the atmosphere it offered the final episode.
B000WSL5Y0|5.0|Private investigators Patrick Kenzie (Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Monaghan) are approached by Lionel (Welliver) and Beatrice McCready (Madigan) to look for their niece, Amanda (O'Brien), who has gone missing.  They fear the police won't be able to devote enough time towards the investigation and think Patrick and Angie would be a great help.  Opposed to their help are the girl's mother, Helene (Ryan); the police chief Jack Doyle (Freeman); and the two cops working the case, Remy Bressant (Harris) and Nick Poole (Ashton).  They quickly discover some overlooked clues that put them in harm's way as well as put them in the position of having to make some morally ambiguous decisions.<br /><br />\\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is a mystery/thriller that is full of twists and turns.  They can be figured out beforehand if one pays attention thanks to this well written and executed script.  Solid performances all around compliment Ben Affleck's first outing in the director's chair.  Like \\"Mystic River\\" before it (it was also based upon a novel by Dennis Lehane), the film doesn't offer any easy answers.  It forced the audience to decide for themselves if the right thing is done by the characters.  This is a solid, top-notch film, and a definite contender for Best Picture when the Oscars come around.  I highly recommend this film.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|Not dissapointed in James second great album although it is identical to the first. If you liked the one that catulpulted James to stardom this is more of the same. I would like to see him expand a little next time. Perhaps a little more rock edge and some jazzy tones.

B000UR9T7I|3.0|As I was watching Spiderman 3 I was reminded of when Joel Schumacher took the reins from Tim Burton ([[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman]]/[[ASIN:B000B5XOSO Batman Returns]]) to direct [[ASIN:B000B5XOXY Batman Forever]] and [[ASIN:B000B5XOXO Batman & Robin]]. Remember how Schumacher brought back the campy TV series Batman (especially for Batman & Robin) and destroyed the dark nature of the Batman series that Burton created?<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Spiderman 3 was as bad as Batman & Robin, but it was on par with Batman Forever...just an average movie. And that is surprising. Because it's not like there was a directorial change in the Spiderman series; Sam Raimi has been there from the start.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a...what's the word...'lighter' feel than the first two. It's brighter. It's a little campy at times. It's a little unrealistic. The effects are way over-the-top at times...especially The Green Goblin's glider skills. Spiderman 3 is just a lot less believable than the first two.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 was very fun to watch though. I was thoroughly entertained. Great visuals in high def (I watched the Blu Ray version). The first two Spiderman movies focus mainly on Spiderman's confrontation with one foe per film, but there are several villains in Spiderman 3. This helps provide an abundance of action.<br /><br />But the action doesn't save the movie from its wide stretches of reality. Sam Raimi is great at taking unfathomable situations, adding a little silliness, but making it all seem real. He just didn't do it as well in Spiderman 3 as he's clearly capable of doing it. So that took some of the shine off of Spiderman 3 for me.<br /><br />Let's hope that Raimi brings his A-game to Spiderman 4 announced for a 2009 release.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I wathced Spiderman3 that my mom rented it from Netflix for me to see it.I really like the 3rd Sequel I thought it was better than the other 2.This 3rd Sequel has more villians,jealousy & revenge.Peter's old friend Harry Osbourne becomes the New Goblin to go after Peter Parker as Spiderman that he still blames him for the death of his father.And starts wearing this strange mysterios blacksuit makes become a whole different person & causes him to neglect the ones he love including Mary Jane his Love Interest.There were to 2 other villians in the movie is The Sandman Flint Marko who killed Peter's uncle & The Venom is Edward Brock they were after Spiderman to kill.Harry found out the truth that Spiderman didn't kill his father.At the end of the movie I cried when Harry Osbourne died.I would love yo get the 3rd Sequel to add it with my other 2 Spiderman Collections!!!!

Isn't that what you have to do to be the real thing? Who is this upstart from Canada who goes somewhere, writes down what is happening and then, gulp, tells the rest of us? No glitzy self promotion? No trying to get a spot on a big time network? No agenda. No dumb and boring shouting matches on CNN or Fox? Just writing down what's happening. Since when is that journalism!?    If not for Naomi, I would have no idea what was happening in the world. That's one journalist, just one, that I know of that I have been able to rely on in this world for news. This book is yet another example of that. She's the real deal; a real journalist... not an infotainment personality. One. Just one. There may be others, but they're so well hidden I haven't discovered them, yet. It's a shame.
B000EGDAK2|4.0|You all know the movie, so I won't waste your time going over it again.<br />I personally love it.

No other bells and whistles or extras, which is why it loses a star.<br /><br />Spring for the special edition version with the extra features unless you just have to have a copy in the UMD format.

Disappointed that she didn't draw a lot of hoots and hollers from Italian men, she goes on to explain that it isn't because she's not as attractive at 35 as she was at 23. No, it's that Italian men don't yell at the babes anymore. Oh and she meant to gain weight in Italy. blah
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I've never reviewed anything hear before, but I feel compelled to his time.  Anyone that can't rate this album without discussing Britney's lifestyle needs to go away.  I hate it when people rate an album badly simply because they dislike the person in general and probably haven't even listened to the cd!  That being said, this album is HOT!!!  Definitely her best one in terms of not having any songs I really dislike...I will say the Toy Soldier chorus gets annoying though lol.  My favorite song is definitely \\"Break the Ice\\" and \\"Perfect Lover\\" is good too.  I'm hoping the former is her new single.  I'm slowly convincing non-Britney fans one by one to listen to the cd, I've already converted some people at work lol. People may criticize her life choices but how many artists do you know whose albums have all been great successes???  Time to go listen to Blackout again!
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|I think the critical review posted on here is a bit over the top. This is a fantastic collection of Dylan songs - both famous and more obscure ones - by some of the most relevant artists working today. It's a loving homage to the master songwriter. Each artist brings his/her/their own interpretation of the song to the table, but they also keep his sensibilities in mind (with a few exceptions). Some of the covers are obvious love letters to their songwriting hero (e.g. those by Cat Power, Jeff Tweedy, Stephen Malkmus), but there are also many artists on this collection that I previously wouldn't have associated with Dylan, but now I'm happy to see the connection. My advice is simple: take a look at the artists who appear on this collection. If you like them, and you love Dylan, I think it's a safe bet you'll enjoy this soundtrack.

B000000XBC|5.0|Like others have stated, I also find it annoying how radio stations will take three or four songs by each artist and wear them out to the point of overkill year after year while constantly overlooking so many other great tunes that deserve the same airplay given to the overplayed hits. This is exactly what makes Chronicle volume 2 a refreshing collection of songs for Creedence Clearwater Revival fans. John Fogerty, Tom Fogerty, Stu Cook, and Doug Clifford were responsible for more great rock n' roll in the brief span of four years than most rock bands can produce in their whole careers! The band's first Chronicle album from 1976 is a must-have that includes all of their best known radio hits, but this excellent second volume serves up an impressive selection of great overlooked material that hasn't been worn out by every classic rock station in America.<br /><br />The Beatles had a bigger impact on the world and the Rolling Stones stayed together a whole lot longer, but neither band consistently produced as many pure rock n' roll tunes of better quality than Creedence did from 1968 to 1971. As Bruce Springsteen said when inducting these guys into the hall of fame, \\"they weren't always the hippest rock n' roll band in the world, just the best\\". If Creedence Clearwater Revival isn't the greatest rock band of the 60's and 70's, there hasn't been a band on the radio in the past 30 years who can touch them.<br /><br />At least half the songs on this CD equal the quality of any hit single the band ever released. There is a great mix of strong original Fogerty tunes and excellent reworkings of classic tunes by others that Creedence delivers with as much feeling and conviction as the original artists. The swamp rock masterpiece \\"Born on the Bayou\\" is the one essential hit here that was left off of the first Chronicle CD and is arguably the ultimate Creedence song, if not the greatest swamp rock tune ever recorded. John Fogerty is among the most powerful rock singers alive and this is one song that proves it. John belts this classic with enough grit, power, and passion to make overrated rock vocalists like Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart sound truly weak and inferior in comparison.<br /><br />\\"Pagan Baby\\" is another hard-hitting Fogerty rocker that features a hot extended guitar solo and another gritty, powerhouse vocal performance from John. Fogerty's underrated guitar work was one of the band's strongest assets which is clearly heard in their rockin' arrangement of Little Richard's \\"Good Golly Miss Molly\\", \\"Tombstone Shadow\\", and the great boogie rocker \\"It came out of the sky\\" that has a nice Chuck Berry feel to it.<br /><br />\\"Night time is the right time\\", \\"Midnight Special\\", and \\"Born to Move\\" show the band's blues-rock side, while the Elvis Presley tune \\"My baby left me\\" shows how well Creedence could play authentic Sun records rockabilly. \\"Wrote a song for everyone\\" is one of their best overlooked ballads and \\"Lookin' for a reason\\" is nothing but pure country music that few rock bands could pull off so convincingly.<br /><br />Creedence Clearwater Revival managed to take everything that was great about rock music in the 1950's and make it popular all over again at a time when psychedelic excess and flower power had taken over the world. Creedence offered nothing but \\"feel-good\\" rock n' roll with more beat, rhythm, and drive than any other rock band of their era. Their music was simple, direct, raw, powerful, and totally infectious. If you already have their original Chronicle CD but want to dig a little deeper into the rest of the best that this great band had to offer, this is the collection you need.

He can however talk with cats and uses this unusual gift to locate missing cats in and around the City in which he lives.......<br /><br />This was my first experience with Haruki Murakami and it was a very enjoyable one. Murakami's writing is heavy handed with metaphors, analogies, and symbolism. There are also a lot of metaphysical elements to his writing in Kafka. This book and Murakami for that matter is definitely not for everyone. The story did not unwind along a typical plot line, and other elements of the story which to say the least will come across as very unusual and will likely turn some readers off. The story isn't an action packed novel and it isn't full of explosions but the writing was great and just seemed to flow seamlessly and kept me interested throughout.<br /><br />The Good: The writing overall very good. Murakami used an atypical style. Half of the book (Kafka's chapters) are written in the first person point of view and the other half (Nakata's chapters) are written in a third person point of view. I liked that the story didn't follow a typical plot line. It kind of reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's stories and how they unwind in that there isn't an ultimate goal for the characters. The story just examines the characters for a particular period of time. As mentioned this book is heavy in metaphysics which I found interesting but may not work for other readers.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable. There are some elements to the story that some readers may find unusual to say the least but I can't give details without giving spoilers.<br /><br />Overall: If you can handle the metaphysical aspect of this book pick it up and give it a try.

B0000028M7|5.0|After Alice in Chains above average 1991 releases Facelift, Alice in Chains followed up with a masterpiece of dark,heavy music. I consider it more heavy  metal then grunge, but the genre does not matter. This CD is EXCELLENT.    Here is my overview of each track    Them bones; An instant classic, this song has it all, a sweet guitar solo by Guitarist/vocalist Jerry Cantrell, eerie haunting vocals by lead vocalist Layne Staley, and awesome drumming by Drummer Sean Kinney. This song has it all, in only two minutes! 5/5     Dam that River; Just like Them Bones, short but sweet. 4.5/5    Rain When I Die; Starts with a gritty baseline by bassist Mike Starr and descends into darkness with weird guitar effects, and hypnotic vocals. Incredible. 5/5    Sickman; One of the darkest tracks on the album, really eerie lyrics. 4/5    Rooster; The centerpiece of the album and a true gem,a sad song about Jerry Cantrell's father in the vietnam war. Harrowing.5/5    Junkhead;A sarcastic song about the benefits of drug use.You might find this song funny.(If you have an extremely black sense of humor.)    Dirt;Lead Singer Layne Staley(RIP) puts on one hell of a performance in this song, He literally spills his heart out on this song. A Masterpiece 5/5    Godsmack; A great song, but probably the weakest of the album 3/5    Hate To Feel; Every time I listen to this song I get the chills, it's truly the most menacing song on the album.4.5/5    Angry Chair: Another excellent track, contains my favorite line on the album\\"loneliness is not a phase ,field of pain is where I graze, serenity is far away.\\" 5/5    Would; Killer baseline,awesome intro,a great way to end an amazing album.5/5    This truly one of the best albums of the 90's. anyone interested in dark music should own this album.
B000W1V44I|5.0|I'm amazed at how with every record this band is growing as artists. Unbreakable has a more rock sound and a lot more harmonies. I especially like the Intro because the guys are singing Acapella! If you're a true Backstreet fan you know that is why you love them -- THEY CAN SING! Does it matter that they can dance and look good? Sure it won't hurt but without their voices, they would not be here today. All of the other \\"boy bands\\" couldn't truly compete with the Backstreet Boys. Hey did anybody notice JC Chasez from *N Sync wrote co-wrote a song on this record? I think it's cool that all people can really get along. One song that REALLY made me want to go out and get this record the morning it came out was \\"Love Will Keep You Up All Night\\". I heard a sample of it here on Amazon and it was Nick singing and I was like \\"I'm sold!!\\" But when I bought the record, I ended up liking a lot more then just a few songs. I pretty much liked the whole CD. I'm sad to not hear Kevin on this record, but happy as well because it means I get to hear more Nick. :D Plus you can't beat 2 extra tracks on the Deluxe, a fold-out poster, and some extra downloads! More bang for your buck!
B000AL730O|5.0|I came to \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\" after first stumbling onto the newer \\"Memory Almost Full.\\"  \\"MAF\\" surprised me with its many memorable songs, some of which are quite moving, so I decided to give \\"CACITB\\" a go.  After several careful listenings, I consider this CD to be a real gem.  One song after another has penetrated my brain, where they are now all playing on a continuous loop.    The music contained in this album reveals a mature songwriter/musician who is in complete control.  All of the songs are carefully crafted and recorded.  They are rich in textures and layers that most other pop artists could not imagine if their lives depended on it.  And as one would expect from Paul, there are melodies that will stay in the listener's head well beyond the listening, possibly forever.  It is quite evident that Paul has learned much from his forays into classical music composition, and some of the songs in \\"Chaos and Creation\\" have a symphonic quality.  One can only wonder at what he might have accomplished had he had a solid grounding in music theory and notation.     Of particular note is the second song, \\"How Kind of You,\\" which I regard as a true masterpiece that ranks with the best songs that Paul has ever created (yes, ever!).  \\"A Fine Line,\\" \\"Jenny Wren,\\" \\"At the Mercy,\\" \\"Follow Me,\\" \\"Friends to Go\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" are not far behind.  Even the somewhat prissy parody song \\"English Tea\\" is growing on me     I have recently been re-listening to some of the Beatles best albums, and I am of the opinion that \\"Chaos and Creation\\" is of the same caliber.  (Did I just write that?)  Those who trash this CD may have inappropriate expectations.  Paul McCartney is NOT a rock musician and never was.  He is a multi-talented musician who works in a number of different genres, one of which happens to be rock.  Just enjoy his music for what it is.
B00005JPS5|3.0|\\"Bee Movie\\" is an adult satire trapped in a kid's cartoon, a combination that's bad for adults and even worse for kids. I guarantee you that anyone under the age of ten will not understand this movie; it relies mostly on verbal humor, most of which consists of pop culture references, work-related puns, and backhanded political references. Yes, this material had the potential to be very funny, and I'm sure it would have been were it not used in a family-oriented animated film. Unfortunately, it was. This is one of the year's most disappointing films, unable to decide which audience to connect with and unwilling to balance it's material. This is a shame because it actually gets off to a promising start, presenting an amusing, brightly colored story with interesting characters. But it soon goes downhill, and it goes hard.    The plot focuses on Barry B. Benson (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld), a worker bee ready to enter his hive's workforce. As you might expect, work revolves around the creation and distribution of honey, a product so labor-intensive that it requires many job positions. There are literally dozens of jobs attached to honey making: one could be a Crud Picker, or a Stirrer, or a Pollen Jockey.  One could even wear a tiny rubber finger and use it to scrape the last drop of honey from a container--this is the job that Barry's best friend, Adam (Matthew Broderick), hopes to get. Barry is not all that excited about getting a job, simply because he's not ready to settle into that lifestyle. This desire only gets stronger when he learns that, once a bee picks a job, he or she has to stick with it for life. \\"One job?\\" he asks a tour guide. \\"Are you trying to work us to death?\\" \\"We certainly hope so!\\" the guide enthusiastically responds.    And that's when Barry decides to sneak out of the hive with the Pollen Jockeys. Upon his entering the outside world, we learn that his hive is located in New York City's Central Park. We also learn of the one cardinal rule all beesmust follow: They must never speak directly to humans. Barry goes along with what he's told ... until he finds himself trapped in an apartment. A kind-hearted florist named Vanessa (Renée Zellweger) saves him from her loud-mouthed husband, Ken (Patrick Warburton), who was ready to use a heavy-duty work boot as a swatter. Thus begins an unlikely friendship between a human and a bee, a friendship that conveniently overlooks even the simplest of logical ideas. Even in an animated film, how would a bee be able to drink coffee? How would a bee even know what coffee is?    When Barry accompanies Vanessa to the supermarket, he's shocked to discover that honey is mass-produced and sold to humans. He finds this incredibly unfair: Why should humans be able to enjoy a product that bees work so hard to make? But this isn't half as bad as the discovery of a honey farm, which not only houses bees in deplorable conditions, but also subjects them to periodic drugging. In an unprecedented (and nonsensical) legal move, Barry decides to sue the human race for infringing the lives of bees. He hopes to make any honey-related uses illegal, such as in teas, lip balms, and bath products.    And that's pretty much when the film loses its way. The last third goes beyond the limits of suspension of disbelief, getting increasingly more ridiculous until it's no longer bearable. Not that it was easy to suspend disbelief at the start--I found it hard to invest in a bee/human relationship, especially since obvious communication problems like voice volume and language aren't even alluded to. Insect purists will be disappointed that a queen bee is never introduced, even when issues regarding family relations are brought up. As you may know, queen bees lay all the eggs of a hive, meaning that all the workers are related; Barry seems to understand this, yet his character is still given his own parents. Does this make any sense at all?    If there is anything redeeming about \\"Bee Movie,\\" it's the slew of special guest voices, all of which add a much-needed dose of relatable humor. Oprah Winfrey lends her voice to the trial judge, while John Goodman lends his voice to the attorney representing the Honey Industry. Kathy Bates and Barry Levinson voice Barry's parents. Larry King voices a bee version of himself--Barry is quick to point out that the humans have a Larry King, who also sits behind a desk while wearing suspenders. Chris Rock voices a mosquito that wants to go to Alaska for moose blood (interestingly, this character is named Mooseblood). Sting and Ray Liotta voice themselves: the former is questioned for using an ill-fitting stage name; the latter is questioned for lending his name to a brand of honey.    I also appreciated the playful reinterpretation of the DreamWorks Animation logo. Normally, the logo will display a boy floating up to a crescent moon via a bunch of balloons. For \\"Bee Movie,\\" Barry stings the boy before he reaches the moon, causing him to release the balloons and fall off screen. If only the rest of the film had maintained this kind of humor, the kind that both children and adults can enjoy. As I see it, a screenplay co-written by Jerry Seinfeld is not appropriate for an animated film, least of all an animated film geared towards younger audiences; his sense of humor is far too intellectual. This is also a problem for adults, who will only be distracted by the cartoon world these characters inhabit. Ultimately, I don't see how this movie can resonate with any audience; it's about as difficult to understand as the natural process of pollination.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Eddie Vedder is amazing.  I am a long time Pearl Jam fan, so I had to get this.  I listened to the cd before seeing the movie.  It was wonderful to be able to recognize the songs when I was watching the movie in the movie theater.  I listen to this cd every time I'm in the car driving, it is a very soothing albumn.  Eddie Vedder's voice is spiritual and beautiful.  He is a living legend.  This is the most meaningful music I have listened to in a long time.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Who doesnt love this movie??  I think it is one of the greatest love stories ever! Juaquin and Reese light up the screen together.  One of my favorite movies ever.  A classic in the making!
0060590165|5.0|Good sequal to Sabriel. It seems like the story is not as strong, but i think that's because Sabriel has a lot of discovery (not suprising, it's the first book). The other thing is that the prince is a little annoying, but thankfully that doesn't last.
6305327041|4.0|Great movie! Funny (in a really odd way) and fun to watch.  If you have never seen it- you should!
0785123490|5.0|When this originally came out i was big into the Silver Surfer,  and read most anything with him in it.  Then out of what seemed nowhere came Thanos.  I'd never seen him before and didn't know his past with Captain Marvel and his love of Death. (the entity and embodiment)  I only needed to read a couple surfer comics and the first two issues of this series to realize Thanos is the most evil and interesting villain in the marvel universe.  In this collection he has attained god-like powers. (as told in the silver surfer trade \\"rebirth of thanos\\")  Hes used his powers to thin out half the universes population.  Whats left of the mightiest heroes earth has assembles with Adam Warlock and Silver Surfer to confront Thanos once and for all.  And the result is one of most climactic battles ever put to print.  I cannot recommend this book enough.  If you like marvel and space oddesys it seriously DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS.  Its been around 15 years since this came out and i can still pick it up and read it any time.  You'll be glad you bought it.
B000UNYJXQ|1.0|The problem with this video is when you look at something as large as healthcare, where there are literally millions of cases that can be looked at you are naturally going to find issues. What Moore does is exploit those issues so he can scare people to buy into his line of thinking. No matter what system you establish you are going to have issues. Is it fair? Does it suck? Yes, but that is a fact of life. Everyone who is gung ho for a government run system is putting on blinders if they dont think there are going to be a ton of other issues that arise. Government run programs have more waste and are mismanaged more then any other programs in the world. The government has no incentive to manage programs effeciently, if costs get out of hand they have an easy solution, raise taxes.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|i think its 'bout time i got around to writing a review for their album!<br /><br />i think my review's title speaks volumes in itself.<br />now i LOVE linkin park (they're my favorite rockers in the world) so i was estatic (it had been 4 years!!! since METEORA) this may when their new album was finally dropping. i loved WHAT I'VE DONE and of course thought the rest of their music would blow that song away... i was dead wrong!!!<br /><br />i listened or tried to listen to the album, and all i could think was: what the hell??? where was linkin park??? where was mike rapping and where was chester's melodic screams??? i was beyond disappointed. i tried to force myself to like it because they are who they are... but i couldn't.<br /><br />i have only 5 songs from MINUTES TO MIDNIGHT in my ipod.<br />why only 5 songs? 'cause those five songs are the only ones that resemble the \\"old\\" linkin park.<br />these 5 standout tracks to me are:<br />*WHAT I'VE DONE<br />*GIVEN UP<br />*NO MORE SORROW<br />*BLEED IT OUT<br />*LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST<br />i can listen to these songs over and over and love them even more.<br />the other tracks are too slow paced for me--- some, as another reviewer agreed, are almost ballads!!! linkin park and ballads??? exactly... it just doesn't work.<br />its great for them that they decided to experiment but for us hard core fans (who were expecting METEORA or HYBRID THEORY 2), not so great.<br /><br />maybe they'll release another album one of these days. and i so so SO hope its more linkin park sounding!!!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity is the climactic, epic ending to the Firefly series. Basically, they tie up all the loose ends that were left open when the show ended. The movie itself is awesome- witty, funny, immersive, clever- but this special collector's edition is a treat in itself. The box itself is unlike any dvd case I've ever seen- you can't get a good feel for it just by looking at the preview picture. It's got some neat features that weren't released on the normal Dvd version, so it's worth checking out!    This is a great movie even if you haven't seen Firefly; being familiar with the show only helps make some events and characters more meaningful. I haven't shown this movie to anyone who didn't end up liking it!
B00000IGGA|5.0|Not to often do I discover an artist who started out in the early seventies via an album he put out in 1999. With Tom Waits though, his craft is timeless, so you are bound to find a hidden gem along any year of his trodded path.<br />I was introduced to MULE VARIATIONS by this punk rock chicky, who was hanging out with me at this Coffee House that I stumbled into back in '99. One thing led to another and she got to talking about Tom Waits (perhaps in comparison to both of our recent re-discoveries of Bob Dylan at the time?) She made me sit in her car and listen to BIG IN JAPAN, his newest track, and it hit me immediately as being one of the coolest songs I ever heard. Still can listen to that one track alone, over and over again... Tom Waits had been declared the man in my book for the hour. The rest of the CD plays out as sort of a coolage of Waits different styles... LOWSIDE OF THE ROAD is weirdness, HOLD ON sounds like a song that Waits could have wrote for Bruce Springsteen (and could have been, he's written a few songs for The Boss) GET BEHIND THE MULE is a nice long, verse ridden, dark style blues jam, another gem...  We had to give a few snaps for the alterna-beat poem WHATS HE BUILDING, rock along to EYEBALL KID, croak a few blues of our own to CHOCOLATE JESUS. etc.<br /><br />I found a lot to like in this album, and soon owned my own copy. Though not his strongest record, it certainly was enough to peak my interest, with a fine mix of fractured-almost-custom-for-radio songs, and a bunch of gravel from the graveyard, and silent twenties horror, Waits delivered another great with Mule Variations in '99.
B000P46QTA|5.0|this is a great dvd.  the story is intriguing with lots of twists and surprises.  the ending is redemptive in many ways.  2 thumbs up.   i did not mind reading the subtitles at all.  a great \\"time piece\\" from a period not that long ago.  because of this particular experience, i now have a newly acquired taste for foreign film!
B000WMVJ7E|4.0|Once upon a time, probably in this century, there were three brothers, each careening thru live in his own way, each struggling to cope with the loss of his father. [[ASIN:B000WZ7C8G The Darjeeling Limited]], off-the-cuff-and-walls and still young film-maker Wes Anderson's latest offering (begun in 2005) is all about who you think James L. Whitman was, despite the fact that you never get to meet him. You do get to meet the three, up close and all true. They've agreed somehow to meet one year after Dad's demise, on a train to nowhere. It's a spiritual (there's that word) journey (as all good train rides are), seeking answers to time-honored questions about live, death, being, not being, power adapters, and prescription pain meds.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys a good tense action thriller will love the opening sequence featuring Bill Murray as \\"The Businessman\\", all the moreso because it's just a connector to the rest of the film. Could this mean that it's a vital clue to our understanding of who Jimmy Whitman actually was? For the first three quarters of the feature, set initially in the high desert Darjeeling region of NE India between Nepal and Bangladesh, while you practice morphing together the faces of Owen Wilson (embandaged), Adrien Brody (emschnozzed), and Jason Schwartzman (emustachioed) to create your possible reconstruction of the man who sired them, they become your existential tour guides to brotherly love, sibling rivalry, and family frustration. And so you have the next installment in WA's fascination with and obsessive emphasis on strange family members and their ever-developing relationships with each other, even beyond the reaches of death. Momentary memorial experience is all. Money is no object. By the time we realize that Schwartzman (Jack) hasn't worn any shoes at all thru the entire thing (not even in the short that sets up his part of the b.g.), the three have collectively and symbolically re-lived the tragic death and circuitously-reached funeral of JLW, telling us nothing and everything in the process about his personage, his humanity, and his penchants. Remains only for the film's final chapter to crash Mom's slumber party of conventional nuns in the foothills of the Himalayas, where lurks the dreadful man-eating tiger, so that ultimately we can subtract Angelica Huston's features from our composite sketch to arrive at a more complete portrait of the man that is anything but finished, and find Zen-like ways of accepting that not every wife will actually make it to every husband's burial, matronly bonds notwithstanding. High in the mountains we find the source of Wilson's \\"take charge\\" eldest, Francis - he makes plans for you, orders your food for you, but also takes the hardest hits. \\"Let's look at our itineraries, shall we?\\" Unpredictable Peter (Brody) says \\"I think I'm going to hold this in for awhile\\", but doesn't. As an ensemble, they couldn't be more delightfully deadpan, so serious about their brand of ingrained silliness, never looking knowingly at us, always gaining insight to their selves and each other.<br /><br />So have we figured out who James Whitman was? Not really. Isn't that what the next one will be for? All we can say by the end of this movie, based not exclusively but emphatically on his brilliantly designed Louis Vuitton/Eric Anderson luggage set, is that Dad must have been one heck of an adventuresome, artistic, absent, awesome, analagous, adult Andersonian man. The film's scenery and cinematography are great, but know that this is a man's manly film (as evidenced by the Vuitton-designed suits that the leads wear throughout) and that consequently women may be treated somewhat incidentally.  Maybe a bigger part for Murray ahead in Part VII - but wait! This one's all about him, isn't it!LW, telling us nothing and everything in the process about his personage, his humanity, and his penchants.

0380729407|5.0|I love Bradbury's style, how his writing calls up so many images from my own childhood.<br /><br />When \\"Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show\\" rolls into town, two thirteen-year-old boys become involved in a grand mystery. \\"And that was the October week when they grew up overnight, and were never so young any more...\\"<br /><br />I loved the merry-go-round that could speed up or reverse aging!<br /><br />I don't like to tell too much about a story, so I'll end with a high recommendation from a life-long-reader.
0743486285|5.0|This book reminds me of 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' more than anything else.  I love the design. This is hardly the only Rock star drug abuse book out there.  It is much more interesting than the others.  You can see that some times it was fun and sometimes it was hell but it wasn't boring. The book is not even dull and preachy after he gets clean.  The sound track is very good too. Nikki is a better musician with out the others. I was never all that impressed with Motley Crue. Mostly because I thought Vince was drunken moron who sings like a little girl. Clearly Nikki was the brains of the outfit and still is. Much as I love Clapton and Slash's music this is better book than their respective efforts.
0743289684|5.0|It must be true that human beings are endowed with certain inalienable rights by their Creator because when they are denied those rights by stifling religious and political subjugations, sometimes the human spirit finds the strength to resist the suffocating, restrictive grip in which it finds itself.  Like the tiny flower seeking to blossom exerts the effort to poke its way up through the sod and bloom in the fresh air and sunshine, Ayaan Hirsi Ali would not be denied such liberation in her own life.<br /><br />Hers is the real-life story of a noble, courageous woman similar to the fictional women depicted in A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini.  One would hope that other women living in politically and religiously repressive countries could know Ali's testimony and gain strength from it.
B000LPR9ZS|4.0|Pretty up close and personal as far as seeing \\"Jigsaw's\\" innards.  Still a lot of complicated traps and tricks.  Also some flashbacks. Watch carefully before seeing Saw 4 (Which is really, really confusing).  A lot of what happens in Saw 3 is related to Saw 4.  Not the worst of the series.  Saw 4, so far, is the hardest to figure out. Again the situations and characters in the first 3 films are all involved in Saw 4.   All in all, Saw 3 sticks to the basic premise and \\"gross out\\" pattern of the other Saw movies.  I understand there are to be six Saw films.  I suppose once they're all on DVD, the plan will be to see them all back to back.  Oh yes, the commentary track is pretty good.  It's fun to hear the way the effects were done and how the story developed.  You really need to have seen the other Saw films for this one to make sense.  Unlike Saw 4 which, even if you've seen the previous 3, is a jumble.  Still, for just the blood and guts (and the fun of knowing it's movie guts so no one is really getting hurt,) it's worth seeing.  And the HD quality makes you want to check the carpet in front of the TV for blood splatters.  For fans of the Saw series, who have seen the others, a must have.  As a stand alone film, gross, but the \\"plot\\" will be lost.

B000683VI4|5.0|i believe this has got to be one of the greates love stories of all time. the notebook was based on a novel, but brought to the screen it touched viewers like so few ever do. it's a great film. the way they made a simple story have such a deep impact and fill it with passion, and drama was excellent. about a rich girl named allie that falls in love with the boy from the wrong side of the tracks who's name is noah. although he has a big heart, he has one flaw. he's poor and she deserves only the best, in the eyes of her parents. but as in most cases you can't help but follow your heart no matter where it takes you. on and off the film flips from the present day to the past. to an old couple, and back to the young. throughout the film you realize that these couple are the same people. telling their story and reliving it at the same time. through memories. although the older woman(gena rowlands) suffers from alzheimers, her one true love won't go on without her. he knows that deep down she remembers their devotion, and their undying love to one another. he doesn't give up, and he never will. it was love at first sight for him, and he didn't stop trying for young allies attention until he got it. it was just a summer romance, but soon blossomed into something more. even more than they ever thought. they loved each other, but her parents didn't approve, and he had nothing to offer. they parted ways always thinking about one another, and always loving each other. time passes by, things happen. i'm sure if you could stop time, they would have, but all you can do is live. she finds another romance and they become engaged, thinking he moved on. her parents approve, but in his face she sees noah. he has a woman here and there, but they're not allie. after several years they meet again. they try to remain calm and collected, but you can't control the fire that's been burning and has never been put out. they rekindle what they had, the feelings all that stronger. the time comeswhere she must choose. will it be love, or her high class fiance. she follows her heart and they will stick it out like they should have since the beginning. beautiful couple, great love story, and outstanding performances. it makes you want to cry. gives you hope and inspires you to just go for it. it's never to late. they stay together till the end, because allie and noah just can't go on without each other. very touching and a sweet movie. they go through so much, and they give you drama, and that touch of romance that you can't help but love. i don't think it could have been better. ryan gosling is a very talented actor. you can't help and fall for his boyish charm. great acting and very well done.  you think he could be anybody. rachel mcadams, was great as well. very talented and she becomes that character. she shows you that rich girls cry too. nicely done on all counts.

B000UJCALI|5.0|This is the best copy of this film you can get next to blu-ray and hd.  They have really overworked and cleaned this film up to pefection, clear and ver sharp picture at best.  The sound is perfect to.  The old kubrick collection release was sub-par at best.  The additional features and commmentaries are really neat and break down alot of kubricks ideas and goals and visions as a filmmaker.  What else can I say about this film thats already been said before.  You either love it or hate it.  This is one the best pyschcological horror films ever created, of a man and his family slipping quickly in to madness.  Don't try and compare the book and the film.  They are two completely differents stories almost.  The book is basically and haunted house story, were as the kubrick film is purely a psychological horror story, beautifully crafted.  Jack Nicholson gives a milestone performance as well as the whole cast.  I've seen this film probaly more than a dozen or so times and each time it scares me and I find something new i have never noticed in the film before.  The book and the film are about dead even as far scares go, but both stories give you something new.  PLEASE avoid the miniseries remake if possible-its like watching some cartoon.  If you liked the shining, I highly recommend director Brad Anderson's films Session 9, and The Machinist, both excellent psychological journeys.

0345423496|3.0|Monolith mankind murder, with Poole.      Frank Poole's body is rediscovered and presumably frozen enough for 31st century technology to revive ok, and this happens.    Not so great is the discovery that the monoliths want to get rid of those pesky humans, so a defense is mounted to try and prevent this.    What will confused readers of this series is the inconsistencies between all the books - monoliths here in this book, but not in that one, in this book they can travel like this, in the other, no.  This is all presumably deliberate on the part of the author.
B000W1V44I|5.0|There's not a bad song on this record, even the bonus tracks are great and the boys sound more amazing than ever. Unbreakable is definitely my favorite Backstreet Boys record along with Millennium.
0451457994|4.0|Alien monument mystery.      The strong point of 2001 as a novel is that it actually explains what the hell is going on in its movie counterpart, from the prehistoric man segments, right on through.    With the discovery fo the alien monument on the moon and the shock that engenders, through to the mission to Saturn to work out what is going with the alien monument makers, and the post-HAL phase with Bowman, leaving you with a far greater understanding and appreciation for what at times can seem a bit of a drug trip otherwise.    Definitely worth reading for that.
B000VS6P9Q|5.0|This album is incredibly interesting because it shows how varied Dylan's music truly is.  Most of these artists are Indie but I would not have expected them to do the originals justice.  Also the producers made a good choice skipping the big guns when it comes to Dylan disciples, Springsteen, Petty, Young.        The songs are very well done.  Highly recommended.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This series works on many levels. It provides entertainment, great stories, humor, horror, the absurd, and a movie-like quality. I love it. And I also love the interaction between the brothers. Unlike the coldness of other series dramas which are mostly about dissecting corpses and coming up with pithy conclusions, the devotion between these brothers reminds me that there are people in the world who still care about each other.

078322687X|1.0|John Hughes can script and direct very well and proved that with\\"Pretty in Pink: and \\"16 Candles\\". Legend has it that he cranked out the screenplay to \\"Breakfast Club\\" in two days, and I think it really shows. With exception of Anthony Michael Hall, the players are all poorly cast. Molly Ringwald is pretty and talented, but not pretty or talented enough to make an impression as a spoiled teen queen. Nor are Nelson and Estevez buyable as class stoner and class jock. Kids this age are often shallow, but the roles here have all the real depth of a leaky baby pool.  Worse than the poor casting is Hughes' \\"reach-to-be-deep\\" script. This group of kids are supposed to jointly reach profound conclusions about their lives and themsleves in the matter of a few hours of detention. It's a try-too-hard grasp at brilliance that cheapens the viewer and writer both.  See this if you must. If it's your first viewing, you may be surprised why this film is so highly regarded. If you saw it in the 80's, you may wonder why you would watch it again.

0451169514|5.0|This book isn't for the reader who while reading a lengthy segment of detail constantly asks the question, \\"what is the relevance of this part?!?\\"  If you're inclined to question long segments of minute and seemingly irrelevant details concerning the lives of the main characters, you won't make it beyond page 200 (and you got a lot more to read at that point, believe me.)    This book rewards those who have a fascination with complex characters.  Different authors are enjoyable for different reasons.  Whereas I find Michael Crichton enjoyable for his intriguing plots enriched by fascinating science, I find King enjoyable for his intriguing horror enriched by fascinating characters.  King's terrifying but ultimately gripping horror is what hooks you, but the gratification of reading this book comes from the 7 main characters who become your best friends.    Honestly, you'll know these characters so well that you'll consider them in your close circle by the end.  Not many books can so vividly - and realistically - depict characters so as to make you truely relate and empathize.  What a feat that is considering the fantastical premise.    In terms of the horror: this is the only book I've read that still gives me goosebumps when I think about certain parts.  The opening of the book will stick with you...an anxiously drawn-out scene of an innocent boy playing with a boat in a gutter during a rainstorm.  You obviously don't know what exactly is going to happen, but you know it can't be good.  And what eventually comes to pass is worse than you could have imagined, and the rest of the book succeeds in satiating your desire for answers.        What follows is a weaving of two stories: the 7 main characters as children, and again as adults.  Both serve to enrich the other and put the reader in a context that is greater and more fulfilling than if each story had been told chronologically, one before the other.  I found the format deliciously gratifying to read, as each storyhelped to both ask and answer questions of the characters.  I was also thoroughly impressed by King's vivid portrayal of the characters as kids and how their relationships spanned the course of time.  I found his aging of the characters seemless and consistent.    To the nay-sayers, there are a host of other authors offering more streamlined and concise adventure stories.  King will spend 20 pages describing one specific memory from one specific character for no other reason than to further enrich your undertanding of him/her.  If you're not the type that enjoys that brand of thorough elaboration, may I suggest Ken Follett?  With him, you'll get a quick, fairly entertaining, and what someone like me may refer to as \\"glib\\", read about larger-than-life - and ultimately unrelatable - characters, but that's not the strength of that particular author anyway.    In conclusion, I found Stephen King's \\"IT\\" to be a truely remarkable book.  All I can ask from spending countless hours reading 1100 pages is a lasting impression, and I certainly got that.    charles vickland

It also really changed my life forever because ever since i've seen this movie, about a month ago now, i have had a dream every night. It has made me look forward to sleeping like never before. totally a must have to share with friends and watch over and over. If you don't look at life differently after seeing this movie then you have a lazy brain.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Johnny Cash and his guests are truly exceptional! These DVDs are a treasure of tremendous, musical talent! Will buy some for gifts and will be the first in line to purchase the next Johnny Cash TV Show DVD whenever they become available.  The Johnny Cash Show brings to mind the expression,\\" They don't make 'em like they used to.\\" What a novelty it would be today to have a musical TV show with integrity.

B000JVSUS4|2.0|Another disappointing re-make, the picture \\"flutter\\" in the action scenes is terrible, compared to the just released \\"Troy\\" which is a fabulous piece of work, even on my high def plasma, this one does not cut the ice and is most certainly not worth the hefty price tag.
1932100660|5.0|An excellent guide to nutrition and its effects on many diseases. Free of hype and not pushing the use of any silver bullet product. Shows how special interest groups inflate and exaggerate claims about individual nutrients in diet when it promotes their products. A well written book by an author who has personal experience with nutritional science and various government health organizations.
1932100660|1.0|Before anyone takes this book seriously, I suggest reading the 1-star comments here.  This book is full of misleading information, not to mention contradictions and biased fallacies.    It might interest those with critical minds who think for themselves to note that the author of this book is on the scientific advisory board of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM).  The PeTA Foundation houses two charities . . . PeTA and PCRM.  I suggest knowing what the American Medical Association said about PCRM might come as a surprise to some folks who leap before they look.  It's impossible to dismiss the misinformation in this book as not being part of an agenda, no matter the credentials of the author.    And by the way, the connections between PeTA, PCRM, and ALF, ELF, and SHAC are undeniable.  Read their FBI files.  You might also find the comments to this particular review interesting.
0920668372|2.0|I got this book as a shower gift for my first child from someone who said the book used to make her cry and cry each time she read it to her kids.  Uh....I don't think so.  What I think is that this book is creepy.  It says the mother waits until the baby is asleep then \\"crawls\\" across the floor and cradles the baby and rocks him and tells him that she loves him.  I just don't get it.  Why doesn't she tell the boy she loves him when he is awake?  Why does she \\"crawl\\" around on the floor?  One of the illustrations of her kneeling on the floor and peeking into the child's room really scares my daughter.  It is really creepy.  And the verses are absolutely corny!  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because I really like that there are cats in the illustrations.

B000VWE5OY|1.0|I had high hopes for the series. Especially being a doctor who fan and it being a Dr Who spinoff. The actors were good but the stories often contained scenes and images that I can only describe as grimey, dirty, and ugly. A good scifi series should spark your imagination. This one simply left me wishing I could purge from my mind of the ugly things I saw. Do yourself a favour and don't go near it.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|This album is Britney Spears' best to date. It's cohesive, it's cool, and it should pull her back up to the top of the pop kingdom she ruled a few years ago - hopefully on her own terms this time.  Despite the mess of the last few years, she somehow managed to pull it together for a few days to work with a few fabulous producers to produce a few minutes of fabulous music.  Mixing sounds from various current artists ranging from Goldfrapp to Justin (yes) to the Pussycat Dolls, Britney's album easily stands out as the best pop/dance album to come out in quite some time.    Enough about that though - you're probably just wondering what songs are good!  The answer would be, in my opinion, the first four.  Although Gimme More wasn't received as warmly as most 'comeback' singles go (in part b/c of MTV) once you hear it within the context of the rest of the album it makes perfect sense - although Brit had her pick of other singles!    \\"Piece Of Me\\" is an attack back at the media that has in part made Britney who she is, and easily one of the best songs on the album - yet interestingly Britney's name doesn't appear on the writing credits.  It's insanely catchy and easy to sing along to, and really distorts Britney's voice till it's simply one of the instruments in the song.    \\"Radar\\" is tied for best song with \\"Piece of Me\\" I think - Britney's voice sounds fantastic in the verses, it's another great catchy dance song, and probably the next single.  \\"Break The Ice\\" possibly should have been her first single - as per she's breaking the ice with her fans again, and it makes for another fabulous dance tune but the heavy breathing in the chorus might remind people too much of \\"I'm A Slave 4U\\"    After that we have what I think may be some of the weaker tunes on the album - but by no means bad - including the 80's-tinged \\"Heaven on Earth\\", and two songs basically about getting down and dirty in the club (and perhaps out) \\"Get Naked\\" and \\"Freakshow\\".    \\"Toy Soldier\\" is a prettydifferent tune, and another potential single -although slightly less likely because Britney's voice is quite tweaked to sound extra whiny, meaning you can only give this one the occasional listen before you get sick of it.  It definitely evokes a bit of Missy Elliot though!    \\"Hot As Ice\\" isn't nearly as good as its other 'ice' counterpart on the album, and sounds more like past Britney material.\\"Ooo Baby\\" is one of the few tunes co-penned by Ms. Spears (I believe Get Naked, and one other one might be as well) and it's pretty good - not lyrically or anything, but it's really catchy with a mixture of spanish guitar and a sports-like beat line.      \\"Perfect Lover\\" is basically filler, nothing good or bad to say about it, followed by the jarringly slow, smooth, and mellow \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\" produced by The Neptunes - a nice but different end to an album that barely stops to take a breath overall.    Overall this is a great cd.  There will be lots of comments about how it's all about the production, how Britney is ticking off her label by not promoting it, how it's simply a slickly-produced dance album, or how it's formulaic (sexy lyrics? shout-outs of Brit's name? hot dance beats? check x3)...but at the end of the day, it's Britney B*tch and I'm lovin it.
B000WSJNWQ|4.0|In this day and age in which just about every other news story involves discussions of waterboarding, images of Abu Ghraib, or tales of forced detentions at Guantanamo Bay, Gavin Hood`s \\"Rendition\\" is about as up-to-the-minute and timely a movie as is ever likely to come out of the entertainment mills of mainstream Hollywood.  It's not, by any stretch of the imagination, a perfect film, but neither does it merit the caterwauling opprobrium it has received at the hands of critics from all across the ideological and political spectrum.<br /><br />The term \\"rendition\\" refers to the ability of the CIA to arrest any individuals it suspects of terrorist dealings, then to whisk them away in secret to a foreign country to interrogate and torture them for an indefinite period of time, all without due process of law.  Anwar El-Ibrahimi is an Egyptian man who has been living for twenty years in the United States.  He has an American wife, a young son and a new baby on the way.  He seems a very  unlikely candidate for a terrorist, yet one day, without warning or explanation, Anwar is seized and taken to an undisclosed location where he is subjected to brutal torture until he admits his involvement with a terrorist organization that Anwar claims to know nothing about.<br /><br />On the negative side, \\"Rendition\\" falters occasionally in its storytelling abilities, often biting off a little more than it can chew in terms of both plot and character.  The ostensible focal point is Douglas Freeman, a rookie CIA agent who is brought in to observe Anwar's \\"interrogation\\" at the hands of Egyptian officials.  The problem is that, as conceived by writer Kelley Sane and enacted by Jake Gyllenhaal, Freeman seems too much of a naïve \\"boy scout\\" to make for a very plausible agent, and he isn't given the screen time he needs to develop fully as a character.  We know little about him at the beginning and even less, it seems, at the end.  He \\"goes through the motions,\\" but we learn precious little about the man within.  Thus, without a strong center of gravity to hold it all together, the film occasionally feels as if it is coming apart at the seams, with story elements flying off in all directions.  A similar problem occurs with Anwar's distraught wife, played by Reese Witherspoon, a woman we never get to know much about apart from what we can see on the surface.  Gyllenhaal and Witherspoon have both proven themselves to be fine actors under other circumstances, but here they are hemmed in by a restrictive screenplay that rarely lets them go beyond a single recurring note in their performances.<br /><br />What makes \\"Rendition\\" an ultimately powerful film, however, is the extreme seriousness of the subject matter and the way in which two concurrently running plot lines elegantly dovetail into one another in the movie's closing stretches.  It may make for a slightly more contrived story than perhaps we might have liked on this subject, but, hey, this is Hollywood after all,  and the film has to pay SOME deference to mass audience expectations if it is to get itself green lighted, let alone see the light of day as a completed project.<br /><br />Two of the supporting performances are particularly compelling in the film:  Omar Metwally who makes palpable the terror of a man caught in a real life Kafkaesque nightmare from which he cannot awaken, and Yigal Naor who makes a surprisingly complex character out of the chief interrogator/torturer.  Meryl Streep, Alan Arkin and Peter Sarsgaard also make their marks in smaller roles.  Special mention should also be made of the warm and richly hued cinematography of Dion Beebe.<br /><br />Does the movie oversimplify the issues?  Probably.  Does it stack the deck in favor of the torture victim and against the evil government forces?  Most definitely.  (One wonders how the movie would have played if Anwar really WERE a terrorist).  Yet, the movie has the guts to tread on controversial ground.  It isn't afraid to raisedicey questions or risk the disapproval of some for the political stances it takes.  It openly ponders the issue of just how DOES a nation hold fast to its hard-won principle of \\"civil liberties for all\\" in the face of terrorism and fear.  And just how much courage does it take for people of good will to finally stand up and say \\"enough is enough,\\" even at the risk of being branded terrorist-appeasing and unpatriotic by those in power?  (The movie also does not, in any way, deny the reality of extreme Islamic terrorism).<br /><br />Thus, to reject \\"Rendition\\" out of hand would be to allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good.  \\"Rendition\\" may not be perfect, but it IS good, and it has something of importance to say about the world in which we now live.  And that alone makes it very much worth seeing.pproval of some for the political stances it takes.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love the original novel by Jane Austen with the same title. The screenplay is an abridged version that focused more on drama and cinematography rather than keeping true to Austen's prose. With this in mind, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. The acting was superb and characters were well chosen. My only disappointment was with the ending, which I choose not to watch in subsequent viewings.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Ron Howard should be commended for directing the true story on one of the most anxious moments in the world. The crew of the Apollo 13 faced some agonizing moments during that week in April,1970. I enjoyed the work of Tom Hanks in this movie. To me it was one of his best next to Forest Gump, Saving Private Ryan and Cast Away. Hanks is an actor for all seasons. Good movie and a good price for this two set DVD collection!

1400064287|5.0|I saw this on a store shelf and thought it was a marketing book -- not so. No doubt, it has great value to marketers both in principles and stories. But, it is really a book about improving communication.    The story examples are engaging, and in and of themselves present a wealth of knowledge worth learning. But, the Heath brothers draw parallels and put the stories together in a format that flows directly to their primary points. I find it admirable that two guys who are obviously so brilliant can put together a book that is such an easy read yet contains such valuable info. The summaries in the intro and at the end of the book are very helpful also -- I was about to write my own when I reached the end of the book but there it was.    I highly recommend this book for anyone trying to influence, motivate, teach, or lead others through communication of ideas that seem complex. The way I figure it, that's pretty much everyone in a professional environment.
B000002AP1|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet: This is THE best rock record ever put out, it's not history, it is a living breathing rock masterpiece by which all others pale in comparison. This mix brings it all together, you can hear the bass, you can hear the rhythm guitar, this mix put the balls back in the record that was lost in Bowie's mix. Forget about the negative reviews of this remix, they obviously don't get it, they'd probably rather listen to Lawrence Welk or something. You NEED this CD, it will blow you away and give you a reference point for comparison for all rock music. If you've never heard this before you will never listen to music the same after you hear this.
B000060OFT|4.0|Well, I must say that this picture was quite an eye-popper.  Director Baz Luhrman has used every fast-cut camera angle, bright color, zoom, pan, fast-action trick in the book to keep this story moving along at a rapid, psychedelic clip.  It really is worth seeing, just for the director's vision, in the same way that Julie Taymor's interpretation of \\"Titus Andronicus\\" is worth seeing (if you can stomach it).      Hard-core Shakespeareans may cringe at some of the textual editing - e.g. Romeo saying, \\"thy drugs are swift\\" not as he dies at the end, but as he pops a tab of acid before going to the Capulet's costume ball.  That kind of stuff is unnerving, but you have to deal with text editing in any version of this play.    I had a hard time getting behind Leonardo diCaprio and Clare Danes as the lovers in this one.  Maybe it was their totally American accents.  Totally.  Or maybe it was the fact that they just came off as a couple of spoiled, bored kids looking for a thrill.  But then again, maybe that's what R&J are.  Spoiled, bored kids looking for a thrill. Or maybe it's because I'm getting older, I dunno.    The real stars of this picture are the supporting actors, particularly John Leguizamo as a lithe and menacing Tybalt, Miriam Margolyes as a thick-waisted Mexican Nurse, and Harold Perrineau as a flamboyantly light-in-the-loafers Mercutio.  Those people were very, very fun to watch, and worth the price of admission.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War was not only an entertaining read, but it was written in a clever way.  It is mostly independant chapters describing events during this World War Z from the point of view of those that lived it.  The different chapters are at times related where an event you read about early on is mentioned by another character during his/her interview.  I found the book kept making me turn the page with anticipation.  The interviews are not only interesting but many of the points made relate to problems we are facing right now.  I recommend this book, not just for those that are fans of horror/zombie books but for those that like well written fiction.
B00005JPS5|1.0|If you are looking for proof that Jerry Seinfeld is the most overrated, most obnoxious and most boring \\"comedian\\" on the planet, then go see this alleged \\"kids\\" animated movie.  I did not know Seinfeld was in it, so when I took my two year old toddler son to the movies, I chose this, because I thought it would be suitable for him.    Now, my boy has a great attention span for someone so young:  He was under two years old (22 months), when I took him to see \\"Ratatouille.\\"  He sat in his theater seat, eyes transfixed on the screen the whole time.  When he watches \\"The Incredibles\\" and \\"Over the Hedge,\\" you can't pull him away from the television screen.    This one?  Thank God he got my genes, because he was twitchy, whiney, and distracted.  I kept having to drag him to the concessions stand, or for a walk around the theater lobby area.  We caught some of the ending of this movie, which involves politically correct trashing of humans when Jerry Seinfeld's character sues the human race for filching the honey and royal jelly the hapless bees worked so hard to produce.      Geez.  That's a surprise: A kid's movie with a hidden environmentalist agenda.      Yawn.    Not wanting to be ripped off, I took my boy to another screen in the multiplex to watch the Western flick \\"3:10 to Yuma.\\"  My boy was his old self again.  He loved watching the action and the gunfight at the end had him pointing at the screen, really got his attention.    Renee Zellweger:  Do you really need to be so desperate as to have been cast in this schlock?    It's time to hang Jerry Seinfeld upside down from a tree and stick a fork in him:    Like his fellow untalented \\"comedian\\" Michael Richards, he's done.
0385520298|5.0|As a Chinese, I think this book truly protraited the deep-inside cultural difference between China and the west (at least Britain). I sometimes feel the same pain of misunderstanding as her when I am in the States. She is NOT a representative image of average Chinese girl today, (especially the ones in the cities) however, the underlying philosophy, e.g. attitude toward love, definition of relationship, intimacy, etc. are very genuinely presented in the book. I love it.
B00005JP5P|4.0|Sunshine was a movie that really made me think.  Having it sit in the back of my head for a couple days after the movie trying to figure out all my questions usually tells me I saw a good product.  I will be purchasing this DVD.<br /><br />A couple days later it dawned on me why I was still thinking about it.  This movie is a Sci Fi/Horror thriller at it's utmost, but it is also more than that.  Once I realized that the lone crew member of the Icarus I is a metaphor for religious fundamentalism it dawned on me that this movie is also a movie about how different people deal with and approach their death.  Some approach it from fear, others focus on the mission right until the end, others decide on suicide rather than face reality of a worse death, others realize what a small speck we all are in the universe.  \\"If you wake up one day and see the sun shining brighter than usual, you'll know our mission was successful.\\"  That made me sad when I thought about it more but the message is clear, life goes on through all of us, even if one day we will no longer be here ourselves - and may be elsewhere.
B000NA2776|4.0|You have to have a sense of humour for Mika.  He certainly has one, which is one of the things I find most appealing about him.  His range is startling (in a good way!) and the songs are catchy, fun, and creative.  I could live without a couple of the slower tracks but in general find the whole album immensely enjoyable.  It's impossible to be in a bad mood with \\"Life in Cartoon Motion\\" a soundtrack to your life, and for that reason if for no other I absolutely suggest it.  Get it, listen to it, lighten up, and love it.<br /><br />You will, I assure you.

You go grrrllll!!
B000NIVJHM|5.0|Dirty Dancing is up there with just a few dozen films, the Classic Love Story which has taken us from the 40's and 50's (Brief Encounter/Casablanca)to An Officer and Gentleman, Ghost and Pretty Woman.    The Music is great too, a collection of late 50's and early 60's hits that spanned the World.    Such is the appeal of this classic film it has crossed over to the Stage with the London West End production a sell out, soon it is to open in Toronto, and I am sure the live versions will be every bit as good as the flim, for the Dancing will be a stage production dream.    If you have never seen Dirty Dancing, then live a little and buy it now, you will not regret it!  Oh and look out for the others mentioned here as well, for love stories do not get much better than as shown on these classic titles.
B000RZIGVS|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of the entire ST:TNG series on DVD! Finally affordable at a great price which previously would have only bought us 2 seasons with tax and shipping.<br /><br />Don't listen to these naysayers who are never satisfied... and is the very reason the Star Trek series were canceled. Because no matter what the producers did, people like this were NEVER satisfied and ruined it for the rest of us who have loved Star Trek since the mid 1960's.<br /><br />Don't let them spoil this for you. I was delighted to finally be able to afford the full series collections of ST:TNG and the original classic Star Trek series after over a decade of a single season costing about $114 each. So I would get it while you can before the chronic complainers drive them into stopping production of the DVD's or driving the price back up. You won't be disappointed with this collection.<br /><br />And they finally heard our pleas to reduce the prices on the other Star Trek series... or at least the poor economy made them drop their prices. At least they did it before our original Star Trek generation died off so we would have a chance to enjoy it. Voyager which was $1200 for so many years is now less than 1/4th the price. At long last I was able to buy all of the Star Trek Series.<br /><br />As for the chronic naysayers who complain about everything... if they would put as much effort into getting involved with cleaning up corrupt politics like we did in our era, the entire country would greatly benefit.... but it won't work with e-mails. It takes organized efforts and public protest marches out in the open and on the news for the world to see, in order to effect change. E-mails & Blogs just won't do it.<br /><br />If not for us old activists.... none of you would have had the opportunity to enjoy Star Trek beyond the original 3 seasons. We fought for Star Trek for 10 years until they brought it back in movies and several new series. So think about that. The younger fans could have saved Enterprise by a nationwide boycott of every product or service advertised on the network which canceled it. All they had to do was to contact every advertiser in that time slot and alert the media to the nationwide boycott until Enterprise was restored. They could do the same thing with oil companies. Not a one day boycott, but a total boycott of a single oil company gouging the public (buying gas at any other brand but theirs) until they relented or went out of business. Then do the same thing with others.... one company at a time. People can make a difference on anything as long as they are organized.<br /><br />The public can bring back Star Trek series as well using the same methods. Perhaps a new series like \\"Federation\\" which had stories about different Federation planets and different species each week and different Star Fleet stories would be interesting to see. Stories about Vulcan, Betazed, Andoria and many new planets. They should never run out of material for something like that.wide boycott of every product or service advertised on the network which canceled it.

Don't get me wrong here, musically the band is as good as ever. I was hoping for an album that is not so \\"preachy\\" and gloomy. All that being said, there are some very good tunes, such as 'How Long', 'Busy being fabulous', 'Do Something', 'I love to watch a woman dance', and perhaps the best of the album is 'Waiting in the Weeds'. It is still way above most of what is out there!

B000VWYJ86|5.0|From The Bourne Identity's success several years back up to the August release of 'Ultimatum', the Jason Bourne franchise has emerged as a top-notch action series comparable to the James Bond franchise.  Fantastic locations, excellent action sequences and intriguing plots define both, however Bourne does it differently in a way that makes this series unique.    'The Bourne Ultimatum' marks the conclusion of Jason Bourne's quest, in the wake of a botched assassination assignment, to discover the \\"why's\\" of his existence.  Having learned the nature of the 'Treadstone' project in 'The Bourne Supremacy', he seeks further resolution to his lingering doubts in this installment of the trilogy.  The conclusion of 'The Bourne Ultimatum' brings the plot lines of the first two installments full circle while leaving open the possibility of a fourth film further down the road.    This movie is a fast-paced thrill ride filled with perhaps the series' finest action sequences.  A motorcycle chase through the streets of Tangier, a brilliantly conceived foot race at Waterloo Station in London and Bourne's signature hand to hand fights are the make-up of a film that will at times leave viewers stunned.    For any fan of the Bourne series, this is a must have DVD.  Unparalled action and numerous plot twists are prevalent, yet it retains the qualities that molded the Bourne series into the excellent spy trilogy it now is.  Here's to hoping for a fourth film.

I think the best tracks are: Gimme More, Pieces of Me, Break The Ice, Get Naked, Hot As Ice, Ooh Ooh Baby, and Why Should I Be Sad.  The last song (Why Should I Be Sad) has the best production (the song was produced by The Neptunes).

This recordings features other compositions for instruments, mostly the whole band, and they are not limited in duration due to the LP format, and some of them run quite long, almost mini-symphonies, with many extended solos from Johnny Hodges and others.

The P.R. mill tells us that Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks studio okayed the movie after comedian Jerry Seinfeld cutely suggested the title to Spielberg over dinner one night. It only shows that some jokes should not be told at the dinner table.<br /><br />Seinfeld voice-stars as Barry B. Benson, a cog in the bee circle of life. Having gotten his bee education -- four days of high school -- Barry is now expected to choose his sole vocation. But surely, Barry reasons, there's more to life than this. So one day, Barry breaks out and enters the human world.<br /><br />Sadly, the one human Barry chooses to speak to is a vacuous florist named Vanessa (Renee Zellweger). This movie labors mightily over this slightly-above-platonic relationship. But if you think recent comedies about love affairs between babes and nerds are implausible, try working up a lather about the impending love affair between a babe and an insect.<br /><br />From there, the movie veers into...not even a sub-plot, more like a side-plot. Barry discovers that generations of bees have labored to produce the honey that mean old humans casually swipe for themselves. So Barry launches a lawsuit to get the bees' honey returned to his own kind. After that, the movie veers into a pro-environmental message, which certainly has its place. But that place probably isn't a big-budget kiddie cartoon.<br /><br />Seinfeld already has a huge human following -- is there some unknown bee demographic he's trying to reach? If bees could reason, I'm sure they'd be thrilled that their story is being thoughtfully told. Me, I'm not so moved.<br /><br />The movie's tone is so desperate, the movie should have a drummer just off-screen, doing rim shots for each one-liner. Seinfeld does Barry as the type of screechily bad comic that his TV show used to lampoon. And the rest of the movie is \\"Flintstones\\"-type stuff, with cutesy jokes about workaday life, celebrity cameos (Larry King plays himself as a bee -- hysterical!), and lots of bad bee puns.<br /><br />Even the movie's basic idea is a rip-off -- remember DreamWorks' \\"Antz\\" (1998), with Woody Allen as a drone ant? It's been almost a decade since a stand-up comic made his cartoon debut as a non-conformist insect. DreamWorks, I promise, nobody will complain if you let the concept die right here.<br /><br />\\"Bee Movie\\" is rated PG for minor innuendo and bathroom humor.uld have a drummer just off-screen, doing rim shots for each one-liner.

B000Y179KO|4.0|Somehow, I missed the fact that the Eagles were in the studio working on 'Long Road Out Of Eden', their first studio album since 1979's pseudo-swansong &#34;The Long Run&#34;.  I was beside myself when the band released the CD single for 'Hole in the World' a few years back, and I even enjoyed the four new tracks recorded for the 'Hell Freezes Over' CD (most especially the riotous 'Get Over It' and Don Henley's masterpiece 'Learn To Be Still'). Now, after a 28-year wait, Mr.Henley, Glenn Frey, Timothy B. Schmidt, and Joe Walsh have brought us the ambitious (yet uneven) 'Long Road Out Of Eden'. Twenty songs on two discs is a monumental feat for any band, especially if the intent is to weave some common thread and wrap the songs around some central core of meaning. Let's face it: Even the Beatles found this a daunting task, as evidenced on 1968's 'The White Album'. (One of the few groups to wholly make the two album concept work was, arguably, Chicago- whose first several LP's mined diverse musical territories in intriguing and jazz-tinged fashion.) 'Eden' kicks off and instantly makes anyone over the age of 35 feel good again about American music: the flawless harmonies sung, at times, in acapella style, harken you back to the days where melody was king and the bass took a backseat to the rest of the music. This track, 'No More Walks in the Wood', creates an eerie aura of a world that's losing ground to the senseless destruction of nature over the past three decades.  Sadly, the song ends as quickly as it starts, and we are immediately whisked into the country-rock twang of J.D. Souther's 'How Long', written back in 1972.  The song is likeable enough, and is reminscent of early Eagles' hits like 'Take It Easy' and 'Already Gone'. Fans will recognize it instantly as The Eagles, and will no doubt be shocked to hear that this is a song recorded in 2007 that's getting airplay and not from the early 70's album 'On The Border'.  After the next two songs, the witty and cynical 'Busy Being Fabulous' and the somewhat trite balladry of 'What Do I Do With My Heart', I knew my mission as I listened to the remaining 16 songs: No longer was I looking for that common thread; that overriding 'concept' or theme that would link these songs to a place and time.  Instead, I began looking for diamonds in the rough, and I am very pleased to say that there are gems aplenty throughout 'Eden'.  Henley's 'Waiting in the Weeds' is a sweeping tale of coming to terms with a lost love- a song that would have fit nicely on his 1989 CD 'End of the Innocence'.  Likewise, Glenn Frey's uplifting 'No More Cloudy Days' and the reassurance of his 'You Are Not Alone' are pleasing in their own right.  For me, however, the masterpiece of Disc 1 is Henley and Schmidt's 'Do Something': a song that all but begs us to get up off our duffs and 'do something' about our gripes and senseless self-pity. Disc 2 begins with the 10-minute title track- and this song alone is worth the $11.88 admission being charged at your local Wal-Mart. Here is the hardly subtle Bush-bashing that has peppered much of Henley's solo work (Yes; that's both George W. and his father).  This song, with its haunting Middle Eastern instruments, tells the story of young Americans 'trying just to stay alive' while some back home 'smoke fine cigars' and 'eat pecan pie'. The contrasts that play out between the U.S. and Iraq are vividly realized- and punctuated by guitar riffs that occassionally recall some of David Gilmour's best work with Pink Floyd.  Frey's instrumental interlude 'I Dreamed There Was No War' provides a nice segue from the title track to Jack Tempchin's 'Somebody', which I can't help but feel is a message aimed directly at the leaders of our current administration- (i.e. 'You'll get yours in the end'). 'Frail Grasp on the Big Picture' is listenable and interesting, though ultimately feels like it's trying to take on too much in its 5-plus minutes (politics, love, and religion!).  Joe Walsh's 'Last Good Time in Town' plays as a serviceable sequel to Hotel California's 'New Kid in Town'; 'Business As Usual' is Henley as we've heard him before, wishing for a change in leadership, direction, and commitment; 'Center of the Universe' is either an apology or a backhanded compliment to a long lost love; and the whole affair ends with Frey's light and breezy, trumpet-inflected 'It's Your World Now'. In my view, this final track can be interpreted in one of two ways. On one hand, it's a gift from an aging father- a world that has changed, for better or worse, during his lifetime; on another, it's a gift from an aging band: It's almost as if The Eagles are saying they've put in and done their time, they've created and played their music that defined at least one American decade. Now, they're leaving the stage, much as they had stormed it nearly four decades ago.  Today, on 'Eden', the evidence is there that these players are polished, if not masterful, musicians and still of very strong voice, both individually or in harmonic unison.  The overall effect is pleasing to this 40-something purveyor of music, and something about the first new studio album by these musical icons since I was a 16-year old kid newly driving is more than comforting and reassuring. Still, I sense that I am falling comfortably into a life of blissful contentment and complacency, and I'm more than all right with that.  The Eagles, as men and as musicians, have fallen into a place of happiness and complacency too. And, in the long run, I'm more than all right with that as well...
B000R7HY0K|3.0|My wife and I have hosted a 24 hour movie party for thirteen years now, this next year will be fourteen. From noon Saturday to noon Sunday we show movies   upstairs and down on projection screens, so you get a nice, near theater experience. We start with a cartoon feature of some sort and usually have about eleven movies each. We schedule them to oppose one another to force our guests to chose one over another. This year we plan to oppose Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Last year Batman Begins and Superman Returns. We have a commercial popcorn popper, serve a dinner and a breakfast, have door prizes at midnight (including a choice of time slot for next year) and have about 65 guests on average, many of whom stay all night. Many bring sleeping bags, etc. Anyway, from the moment I first saw Grindhouse I knew I wanted to show it at my \\"Film Festival\\". But chopped up into two films like this it is not the same experience that it was at the cinema and I just can't do it. They were fine films but without the extra material included they are just more horror movies, good... but I can't justify showing them to as broad an audience as my party because the trailers and intros and all the old time theater stuff ties it all together and makes it work as something different. I may buy these movies, if I can get a good deal. But just for me.
B00005JPRG|3.0|In \\"Resident Evil Extinction\\" Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in the same way as the first installment, naked but discreetly covered by plastic sheet. It looks like someone has clicked a reset button at first, but writer Paul W. S. Anderson gives us a few nice twists to the earlier part of the story. After that, however, the third \\"Resident Evil\\" film goes on the same road as the previous two \\"Resident Evil\\" films as well as past classics like \\"Mad Max 2.\\"     The actions themselves are impressive even though they are getting less and less original. Milla Jovovich does her best as film's cool heroine Alice and the Mexican location gives an authentic touch to the post-apocalypse world with the fine production designs by Oscar-winner Eugenio Caballero (\\"Pan's Labyrinth\\").    But what does Alice have to survive? Not much. She reunites Carlos and L.J. (Oded Fehr and Mike Epps, both returning to the series), but they are not given any particular place to go, traveling from one place another looking for gas, and this is not a very exciting premise. Moreover, the people at Umbrella Company (responsible for the mass destruction of the world) are very slow to discover where Alice is. In short, we have to wait for the action to start, and the wait is long and new characters by Ashanti, Spencer Locke and Ali Larter have little to do in it.    Here is great material out of which someone like Paul W. S. Anderson himself, who knows this genre more than anyone, might have made a better film. As it is, it is just an OK film with increasingly tired story about zombies.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|The fact is that no matter what you might think of this adaptation of the graphic novel or the methods used by V to achieve his ends, what it tells us about ourselves and where we are currently heading makes it an absolutely worthwhile movie to watch.<br /><br />The film takes place in a dystopian future that is very nearly the present for much of what is still known as the \\"free world.\\" Wars and disease had shocked people into submission (see Naomi Klien's [[ASIN:0805079831 The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism]] for more on that) and a power hungry dictator filled the gap in their minds with mock security and peace. It doesn't deal with the fall into totalitarianism itself, but then we've had ample opportunity to watch that happen across Europe already with the spread of fascism in the 20th century as brilliantly detailed in [[ASIN:1897244258 Political Ponerology (A Science on the Nature of Evil Adjusted for Political Purposes)]].<br /><br />As V puts it in the film:<br /><br />\\"Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.

B000Y179KO|4.0|The Eagles have a new album coming out.  \\"Great\\", I thought.  Looking forward to it.  Well the day finally arrived and after being teased with the advance single \\"How Long\\" for weeks, now we get to check out the whole thing.  Is it gonna be like the old classic `70's Eagles? Or carry on with the modern style we last heard on The Long Run?<br /><br />I'm here to tell you it's a little bit of everything, all rolled into one.  Starts off with an a cappella track reminiscent of Seven Bridges Road.  How Long, which most people heard and thought was a throw back to their classic sound, were right.  The song was actually written in 1972 by J.D. Souther.  Other tracks are typical Don Henley ballads and one track that could fit perfectly on one of his early solo albums, with the vocal stylings and horns like we heard on \\"Dirty Laundry\\".  Glen Frey's songs are also typical solo type material.  All on the soft side.  Mellow and laid-back, complete with smooth sax solos.  Timothy B. Schmit songs (of which there are only two) are both slow, like his past offerings.  \\"Do Something\\" even has early style Eagles slide-guitar on it, reminds me of Peaceful Easy Feeling. The most disappointing is Joe Walsh's contributions.  Again, only two songs that he sings.  He obviously plays guitar on a number of tracks, but it's barely noticeable.  There is little of the distinct guitar work that used to stand out on Hotel California and The Long Run.  The second disc definately Rocks a little more than the first.  Don and Glen get an even split at 40% each of the tracks here.  That only left 10% for Joe and Timothy respectively.  Not quite as even as the Long Run album.<br /><br />Over-all, I like it.  There's enough good to out-weigh the bad.  It is the Eagles.  We've waited 13 years for another release, you might as well pick it up and enjoy what you can.  It will probably be another 13 or 14 years before their next release (if ever!).  By the time that happens, they will be in their mid-seventies!  Not likely.<br /><br />It's a good buy for the money.  Your getting a decent double-album worth of music for a very reasonable price.  Conveniently waiting for you at your nearest Wal-Mart store.

B00005JPS5|4.0|I've seen all of the animated features since Toy Story, and liked this one better than most.  It's not as funny as Shrek, and overall not as good as Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo, but certainly in the better half, comparable to Cars, Ice Age, and Over The Hedge.  During the first twenty minutes or so it seemed like it might offer nothing better than a series of Bee jokes, which I see has resulted in some negative reviews here.  But the story develops as an allegory for frivolous lawsuits, but it's the bee who brings the frivolous lawsuit here, so it doesn't jump on the Hollywood blame-humans-first bandwagon, which is refreshing. Some of the results are predictable, some funny, but not preachy or trite.  There's at least one lawyer joke that had the audience in stitches, along with several other funny jokes.

Using real sideshow performers, Freaks sparked outrage among the viewers. Even in this day and age a movie like Freaks would probably never get over in this PC world; actually it would probably never make it into production. So just imagine how it went back in the 1930s.<br /><br />Originally Freaks ran at about 90-minutes, but was chopped down to a little over an hour, but that didn't help much. The movie was still hated and still ripped a part by the critics; for the longest time Freaks was banned in several countries and as well as several states in the US.<br /><br />I enjoy a lot of Tod Browning's work, but a lot of the times I feel there is just something lacking from his movies. Some just sort of lack even though they are good movies. Some of the problem was Browning had a tough time making the transition from silent films to speaking films, but Freaks, though is his masterpiece. I would love to see the movie in its complete running time, but I think that might create some pacing problems. With the running time just over an hour there isn't really any slow moments and the character development is actually very solid.<br /><br />After Freaks, Tod Browning would never recover. He was one of the top horror filmmakers at the time of the release, but his career would take a massive nosedive and was on a very short leash by studios. He went from having creative control to having none. Freaks can almost be seen as the first exploitation flick, but the freaks are never exploited; we the audience, are able to identify with them, where as the so called normal characters are the most vile. The characters are interesting and like I said it's with the freaks we the audience will feel more comfortable with. All of them are excellent and really do a great job.<br /><br />As a director Tod Browning does a great job here; like I said as much as I like his work sometimes I feel it's just missing something and even the pacing can be a little off at times, but Freaks moves at a great pace, has great characters and just when it starts to slow down, it picks right up for the final stretch. The final act is simply wonderful and creepy. Freaks, is by no means a scary movie and I don't see how even back in 1932 this would scare people. But the final moments of the film is actually quite creepy and so amazingly set up.<br /><br />After Freaks, Tod Browning who was a very active filmmaker would only go on and direct 4 more films, one of them he was un-credited; Freaks though now a cult classic sadly ruined his career. Most people will cite Dracula as the defying moment in Tod Browning's career, but I'd go with Freaks anytime over it. Freaks, is easily one of the best horror pictures of the 1930s and to this day holds up as one of the horror genres very best.t vile.

B000N6TYLW|1.0|What to say about a show that outdid nearly every show on the books.  Unfortunately this show's seventh season was nothing at all like the show we all loved the first six years.  As an avid fan of GG I own the first 6 seasons, which have been lovingly watched again and again.  I do not plan on buying season 7.  As far as I am concerned the show ended with season 6!  It broke my heart to see the show I loved more than any other morph into a substandard version of itself.  Sadly Amy Sherman-Palladino's shoes were just too big to fill, and the new showrunners failed miserably to capture the original essence of the show.  Gone was the quick-witted dialogue we all adore, the biggest deficet of this season.  But there were other problems.  The scenes during this season didn't flow very well, and many were just too long.  Previously the show did a superb job of keeping things moving, giving us enough in each scene without over-cooking.  In seasons past it was artful, allowing the audience to put together a fantastic puzzle of our favorite girls.  But in this last season there were far fewer scenes, fewer puzzle peices to work with, and the scenes they did deliver were too long and frankly got boring.  This more rapid pace in previous years also allowed us to get more of all of our favorite characters that populated Lorelai and Rory's lives.  The longer scenes of the seventh elimiated more time with these other wonderful characters, especially Emily and Richard.  The unfortunate tone of this last season was also hampered by the odd lighting.  There is a rather big difference in the lighting between the seventh season and all the others.  What happened to the warmth of Stars Hallow?  The warm hues were replaced by drab, colorless gray tones that in the end couldn't help but contribute to the rather blah feeling that best describes this season.  Plotwise my biggest complaint centers on the Lorelai/Chris/Luke situation.  I'm not a Chris person or a Luke person per se.  I foundmyself pulling for each during different times.  In the end I did believe the Chris ship had long sailed and Lorelai belonged with Luke.  I think it was a mistake to spend so much of this season focusing on Chris.  The marriage and divorce should have been quicker so that the show had time to do justice to the eventual reunion of Lorelai with Luke.  We watch the show for seven years, witness the marriage of Dean, witness the marriage of Lane, witness the marriage of Liz and even witness the renewal of vows by Richard and Emily, but for Luke and Lorelai all we get is a kiss?  A stinking kiss!  For that matter this show could have ended with season four!

B000OYC3J8|1.0|This album had me yawning in minutes. I can't believe how awful it is. The songs are totally immemorable (certainly, when compared to their previous work) and this effort - and a shoddy one at that - is stone dull. It's nothing but a narcissistic, \\"bloozy\\" misfire of self-indulgence. Luckily, I heard it for free, so I didn't lose any money off it. Heed my warning and save your valuable funds for something else. I don't mean to sound cruel, but I think canceling their tour to support this album was the right thing to do - did Meg have an emotional breakdown because she realizes how bad this album is, and was too embarrassed to hit the road in a vain attempt to promote it? Good for you, Meg, if this is the case. I was about to buy tickets to come you, but without having this disastrous release beforehand. Now that I've heard it, I'm only too grateful that I didn't have to part ways with my cash and waste time having to hear the dreck found on this album performed live. What exactly is the problem with this album? It suffers from the weight of unoriginality. It is boring. It is yawn-inducing. How often could you say that about a White Stripes in years past? Seldom, that's for sure. My advice for the White Stripes? Meg, take all the time off you need. Don't attempt to write or perform music until you are well. And Jack? Just because your hangers-on and yes-people tell you anything you pump out is \\"genius\\" doesn't make it so. Call Loretta and ask if you can help out on any future projects she has in mind. You did GREAT work with her on Van Lear Rose - it's a shame your reputation has seemingly gone to your head causing you to release garbage and, appropriately, title it \\"Icky Thump\\".
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|This movie is even better when viewed in 1080p high definition! This Blu Ray movie was well worth the price difference over the regular 480i standard DVD! Absolutly amazing!
B00003CXDV|4.0|Not real fond of Tim Allen but this is a good movie.  Entire cast is great.  Very funny movie.  Probably favorite is Guy, #6.  Last name please?  He had some of the best lines.   Someone \\"acquired\\" first copy so had to buy another one!
0060557818|3.0|Anything Neil Gaiman writes is worth reading; Neverwhere is no exception. Gaiman is an imagination factory and all of his stories are original and rich. That said, Neverwhere is not his best, as the story is not as original as some others, such as American Gods, but it is still better than the majority of fantasy books available.    Modern fantasy is a sub-genre I have recently come to love. Fantasy has long been the realm of \\"long ago and far away\\", but the likes of Neil Gaiman, Tim Powers, and Greg Stolze are literally rescuing it from the dark ages and separating it nicely from modern horror.Richard Mayhew works in securities and his life is boring. He is engaged to an emasculating woman who won't make love to him in his apartment because it is small, and loves him because he is willing to follow her around and participate in her favorite activities. When he stops to help a bleeding girl on the sidewalk, she scolds him for encouraging her vagrant laziness. Little does he know his act of kindness would suck him down the proverbial rabbit-hole.     Read the rest at [...]
B000LAZDQA|5.0|I love this movie. It lays it all out and is frank and real. We still live in this sexual revolution and this movie brings out the emotion in all of us. You will see yourself in anyone of the characters in the movie. I was blown away!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I have been a Bruce Springsteen fan since 1974 when I saw him in State College, PA in a tiny venue on the campus of Penn State University. He blew me away that night and as I like to say, he is the only man who has never disappointed me.    Magic is just that--pure magic.  The songs, the band, the lyrics are so tight you couldn't squeeze a hair in between.      Bruce is still up on his political platform but it the lyrics are couched in such joyous music it is hard to hold it against him.  Hey, it is what he wants to write about at this time in his life.     My fav?  \\"Livin' in the Future\\"!  The song is such a genuine rocker like old school Bruce--think Darlington County.  Frat rock as he calls it.      Check it out, you will not be disappointed.
B00005YJMX|4.0|I've have always been a fan of this movie since I first saw it in the theatres when released. This was a pricy disc set when first released on dvd from 2oth Century Fox but this set from Anchor Bay is a stunning transfer with both the english and german language version's. This movie is done with style and class and is a modern horror masterpiece. A must for any fan of Nosferatu.
B000N6TX22|4.0|This is a well-acted, well-produced film that provides a bleak vision of the future as a result of man's poor environmental, social, and political stewardship over planet earth and its inhabitants.  There is abundant attention to detail in the depiction of London of the near future.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|The real disappointment with Magic is not the content, but the very poor sound quality - at least on my CD copy, purchased from a major retailer in Alberta, Canada.    The entire CD sounds like a mp3 compression (perhaps it is) - the dynamic range is very compressed, individual instruments are muddy, and the soundstage is non-existent. For those used to, say, the very high quality of the recordings of the LP version of Born in the USA, or the CDs of The Rising, or even the recent Dublin sessions, this is a huge turn-off.    In fact, it sounds like a back-street garage recording. We have come to expect better from Springsteen's producers.    As I write this, my other half has come into the room where this CD is playing on my very high end audiophile equipment - this is the first time she has heard the CD - and, totally unaware I am writing this, has just said: Is this a CD? It's terrible. It sounds like the radio.    Quite.    What a pity. Perhaps someone could report on the sound quality of the LP veriosn, if they have managed to get hold of one in North America.
0060987464|5.0|If you're inerested in Marilyn Manson then you should read this autobiography. Marilyn Manson is certainly one of a kind, he's lived the rock style life among other things. His thoughts and opinions are amazing to me, he's defiently an inspiration to many.
0307346617|5.0|I'm a big fan of zombie movies...always have, always will despite their sometimes absurd plots and goriness.  There's just something about a zombie that no other monster can match.  It's like you're staring at yourself.  When I picked up this book, I didn't expect it to be as brilliant as it is.  This is truly a book that must be read...by anyone who is a fan of a well written story full of suspense and a great deal of reflection on what it means to be human, how our worth is determined, and how we survive despite screwing up all the rules.      The book is technically an 'oral history', so everything you read is interviews of people by the author...people scattered across the globe of all colors, all occupations, and all nationalities.  The glue that holds all of these people together is their battle to save themselves from a horror that could never be imagined.  It is a twisted commentary on the fallacies of our own society here in 2007; the value we put on the football star over the farmer, our drifting away from the community model, the inability of the most powerful military on earth to stop a force that seems to be easily defeatable, but in reality is not and the inability of the government to get its act together for the sake of the common good.  As the oral history unfolds from these survivors of the Zombie War, the twists in society start to unfold.  I finished this and went back to read the \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" that the author put out a couple of years ago, and how the two intertwine is brilliant.      Even if you're not a fan of zombies (such as myself) these books are still well worth reading.  If anything, they're chilling from the mere standpoint that it exposes our modern day society fallacies, and it is in some ways a Revelations-like telling of a story of what's to come if we don't refocus on the important things that make survival in the face of disaster a possibility.      This really is a book you must read, even if you're not a zombie fan like me.  Who knows?
B000Y179KO|5.0|And I cannot say enough, with what the first reviewers before me have said. Yes, the four men have come down from the mountain and thank god for that. Take a listen to some songs like 'waiting in the weeds', 'do something,' and the title track and you'll say like I'm thinking... WORLD TOUR? Yep, they still play AND sound that good. Welcome back guys, we missed you.
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Not only do you see Johnny & June do live renditions of our favourites,you also get performances and duets with legends such as Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong,Tammy W, Linda Ronstadt, Stevie Wonder, Bob Dylan, Neil Diamond and the Big - O. Fantastic trip back in time as well with references to the War(Vietnam).
B000UR9QIK|5.0|I think this is a great quality format  Dawn of the Dead that was released in the new format Blu-ray. This is the same version that was released in theatres, and is not extended or lasting too long. I think all of the George Remero films should go to Blu-ray. Dawn of the Dead is a great story that asks yourself what would you do in this type of situation.
0800141865|5.0|This is an awesome movie. Funny a lot of the time yet gripping to see all the things Larry Flint went through . I was purley fascinated. I am now reading his autobigography, which is also good.
B000SQFC0E|5.0|This is a great quality version of the awesome film I remember watching in the 80's. Ask yourself what would happen if you beat an arcade game and all of a sudden you are wisked away to defeat a real threat that the video game trained you for? The Last Starfighter one of the Icons and the Greatest movies to come out of the 80's. This movie is way ahead of it's time and the HD-DVD gives high resolution to the dawning age of computer graphics in movies.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Being of fan of the Matrix movies and the Wachowski brothers, I was anxious to see this movie. I was very impressed with the style that they created for it. It wasn't the super hero type movie that I thought it might end up, considering what Hollywood does to movies from novels. They actually did a pretty good job not detracting from the real message within the movie.<br /><br />I perhaps expected a bit of the dark undertones as in the cinematography of the movie 1984, but this was completely opposite. It was crisp, the music was enthralling and demanding. It moved fluidly, the cinematography was excellent, and I loved the soundtrack. The actors themselves are perfect for the role - you actually start believing they are who they portray. I thought it a nice touch to see John Hurt in the role of Chancellor - especially since he was Winston in 1984.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a very important movie, not just for the fact that it is very entertaining, but it sends an important  message too, a message that  people need to wake up!  The movie illustrates something similar to our current time, namely a time when we are ruled by leaders without conscience.  I found the movie really touched me, and made me think.  There are not too many movies out there these days that have something this valuable to say, so I highly recommend this.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|There are so many levels of depth here- take notes (I'm serious.) EVERYTHING has it's place and contributes to the PLOT. I'm not going to write a dissertation, but I will say the reviewers who gave this amazing film 1 star and said it's boring, didn't get it.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|Not every voice ages like fine wine, but Annie's is fortunately an exception. She's richer and stronger than her Eurythmics days--if that's humanly possible.     \\"Songs of Mass Destruction\\" is not my favorite Lennox CD, but it's well worth adding to your collection if you love Annie Lennox's voice and the variety of music she sings.  \\"Songs\\" is divided pretty equally between rocking songs and ballads with some world-beat flavors.  If you are not into variety--you might want to listen to the samples and pick and choose from the songs of the type(s) you like the best.      Much of this CD is haunting.  \\"Ghosts in My Machine\\" is the song I kept repeating at first.  It's the upbeat rhythm you'd expect from her and it also bears the message of every woman who's carried too much in her life.     \\"Fingernail Moon\\" may well be my favorite. I've so often felt the same looking at the moon:       I'm just a girl with my feet on the ground  I'm just a girl with my head goin' round  I feel so sad  There's something unsettling under my skin  I don't know the reason or where to begin  Caught in the circles I've found myself in     I'm the odd duck who likes \\"Sing\\" and the positive message within it.  I applaud Ms. Lennox for her world-spirit in taking leadership with this much-needed project.    Overall, \\"Songs\\" is a welcome addition to my collection, but I'm very eclectic in my tastes.  If you like her ballads as well as the soulful rock, you may well enjoy this CD as well.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|After seeing other Hollywod remakes of \\"J-Horror\\" offerings, I was prepared for a scary and unsettling film when I saw Dark Water.  The Ring, and to a slightly lesser extent The Grudge, have shown that it is possible successfully to translate Japanese horror films for American audience.  Each of these previous films manages to create disturbing images and creepy atmospheres that stay with the viewer long after the film ends.  Unfortunately, Dark Water doesn't manage to reach the bar set by these other films.    One of the biggest problems of with Dark Water is that we've seen so much of it before.  In fact, I would even say that the script of Dark Water feels like they took the script from The Ring, stripped away all of the terrifying and creepy elements, but kept the same dynamic between the two core characters.  Then they changed a couple of details and then fleshed out the story about what would happen between the two characters if the film were going for a more mysterious and ponderous tone than the chills and horror found in the Ring.  Let's see compare details from the two films for a moment... there's the key role of parental abandonment, the role of mental illness, the prominent role of a water storage/supply device for a grave plot development (and the setting for a climatic scene), the arrival of a new potential mother figure, the imperilment of the new mother figure's child...  Doesn't this all sound kind of familiar?  The film also lifts some elements from The Grudge--see, for example, the scene when the main character rides the elevator and sees a surprising face through the elevator door's window.  This was played to creepy effect in the Grudge, but in Dark Water this feels rehashed.    Maybe one could forgive these similarities if the film was done really well.  A significant problem of the film is that the atmosphere isn't that creepy or scary or tense.  Yeah, there's dark water on the ceiling and intermitant the sounds of dripping water and other spooky noises, but it comes of more as unpleasant than scary.  Some of the most unsettling scenes of the film are so obviously dream sequences that they don't deliver chills because the audience knows that the character will wake up.  Many of the water-logged dream sequences seem to borrow more from Tarkovsky's film The Mirror than actual horror films.  (Tarkovsky was a great film maker, but his work doesn't seem to be the best place to be looking for inspiration for a horror film.)  The film makers try to surprise the viewers with the standard fake-out \\"boo!\\" moments, but they just don't work.  I'm sorry, but the spooky gurgling of a malfunctioning washing machine doesn't deliver enough tension to make us \\"surprised\\" when the main character closes the washing machine door and someone is there waiting behind the door.  Plus, most of the film seems to be focused on the struggles of being a recently-divorced single mother in New York City rather than the ghost story that brought us to the movie.    The film is most effective the times when the film makers go for subtlety.  During the course of the film, the main character begins to question her own sanity just as she happens to move into a concrete-slab apartment building that evokes a bleak institutional mental hospital.  In addition, the shades and blinds draw lines over the windows so it almost looks like there are bars on the windows.  These subtle touches are probably the most effective part of the film.    The film is least effective in terms of the plot structure.  The similarities between the main character's life story and that of the dead little girl are way too close and way too convenient.  I mean, they should have gone with the main character being mentally ill and projecting her own life story onto an imagined \\"ghost\\" rather than making it so that the two characters lead almost exactly the same life.  Also, don't these similarities make it just too convenient for the ghost that a young woman with almost her exact life story who also has a young daughter exactly the age of the ghost when she died just happen to move into the apartment below where the ghost used to live?  If they had been more subtle about all of this, it would have been a lot more effective.  Plus, the idea that the little girl's new imaginary friend is really the ghost, well, that's just too cliche to comment upon.  Finally, the \\"happy\\" ending feels wrong--didn't the main character learn anything from the experience of the ghost?    Bottom line:  If you were expecting the edge-of-your-seat terror of The Ring or even of The Grudge, then this will be a disappointing film.  On the other hand, if you want a mildy spooky ghost story involving a single mother struggling to make ends meet after a recent divorce--and you want to watch a Hollywood remake of a J-Horror film without actually getting scared--then you will probably enjoy this film.
B00008GKEG|5.0|THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY dvd set is a fantastic look at one of the most influential rock groups in history. I'm a new fan, so getting this behind-the-scenes look at the Beatles was a real eye opener.<br /><br />Through their own voices and loads of archival footage(interviews and concerts), John, Paul, Ringo and George take you on a journey from their humble beginnings in Liverpool to their final break up concert on top of Apple Records.<br /><br />I've got hours of enjoyment watching these dvds, and it's amazing to see the Beatles go from small local band to international superstars. Even though they broke up around the time I was born, watching these dvds I did get a sense of what Beatlemania was all about.<br /><br />The dvd set conveyed that magic spark that ignited the world back in 1960s and now I understand why the Beatles have endured.<br /><br />This set also inlcudes interviews with producer George Martin and road manager Neil Aspinall, as well as George, Ringo and Paul in 1994 and 1995 --'94 reminiscing about the old days/'95 at Abbey Road studios discussing how they did certain songs.<br /><br />So if you're wondering whether or not THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY dvd set is worth buying, I'll say yeah, yeah, yeah!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|After all the bad press lately, I have to admit that I expected a half put together cd with songs that were similiar to her \\"performance\\" at the VMAs, but after taking a listen, I'm in love. This cd is her best by far. Piece of me is my favorite song, but all the others are at a close second. The songs are way better than I thought they would be and the pictures within the cd case make her look sexy and gorgous. Congrats brit! As far as music goes, looks like your back.
B000URDEB0|5.0|A little about me first.  I'm 51 and I listen to pretty much anything from Mozart to Mahler, Brubeck to Hancock, Abba to Metallica. I have all the previous Nightwish albums. I was as interested as anyone to hear the new album and new singer. I was not prepared to be completely blown away!    Since getting Dark Passion Play on pre-order I have listened to it every day, sometimes several times a day, and listened to almost nothing else. This has NEVER happened to me before.  I have had radical thoughts of selling all my other music (probably won't though).    Some have compared songwriter Tuomas Holopainen to Mozart.  I think Mahler is a closer comparison.  I wonder what Mahler would have done with the resources available to Nightwish.  He would have found the sound he wanted for the three hammer blows of fate in his sixth (tragic) symphony.    What are the songs like?  Other reviewers have detailed this.  I will just add that part five of the epic \\"Poet and the Pendulum\\" is one of the great moments in all music.    But enough.  Don't waste any more time reading reviews. Don't try to decide whether it fits a category of music you like. Don't agonize over whether Anette is as good as Tarja.  Just get it, listen with an open mind and be amazed!  This music, like the amaranth, will never fade.
B000UCEJEQ|2.0|I was so looking foward to this album.  I am a huge fan of the Eurythmics and i absulutely adored Annie's previous solo albums.  But this album soooo disappointed me!  I found it totally dull and depressing.  I especiaaly loved Annie's upbeat songs with the Eurythmics and on Diva.  But on this album there was nothing!  I'll wait patiently for her next album!
0307387178|4.0|I must confess that I skimmed through Jon Krakauer's accounts of his own adventures into the wild, and chose to focus on the events related to the journey of Chris McCandless.  These events are dramatic, interesting reading - especially in the context of other adventurers Krakauer has researched.  This is an eminently readable book, and I feel sympathy for those who cared for McCandless and have lost his presence in their lives.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|As everyone has already Stated This is an amazing series, regardless of who the narrator is. Aside from that i have to be honest that i prefer Sigourney Weavers voice. David Attenborough has a soft voice, much like a story telling passing along history. Thats all well and good however i don't think it fits the series. This is a modern film not a documentary, designed to inspire people and open eyes, while Sigourney Weaver may not have been the best choice, she is better as her voice is more bold and dramatic where as David Attenborough sounds like he is gasping for air. His voice lacks authority. Regardless of this everyone should watch it, either version, and remember what a beautiful world we live in and remember theres a lot outside your doors.
B000Y179KO|4.0|I wrote my review to discuss a FINE work by the Eagles and to respond to s<br />\\"some\\" of my peers who feel an older band like the Eagles should CHANGE<br />their sound, EVERYTHING, like being older DEMANDS a different SOUND.<br />I am glad whne I first played these CDs, I heard a lot of music that reminded me of 70's Eagles and a lot that just sounded like the boys have been recording and playing all along...I think its alright for bands to do that. If you are a longtime Eagles fan, there is a lot here to be<br />pleased about. Lots of good work by Henley and Frey for example and a Souther song even if it was written before 2007...is  a bonus to me.<br />I like the Eagles. They are not my favorite group, however, buit its refreshing in these times of disposable pop, and one CD wonders to hear<br />something that seems eternal.  Atreides
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is a superb ending to what has been fantastic screen adaptations of Robert Ludlum's superb espionage trilogy centering on a CIA-trained spy/assasin who has amnesia and who is being hunted relentlessly by his employers.<br /><br />Joan Allen and Julia Stiles return as two sympathetic CIA agents, and give excellent performances, but this film, like the first two, are dominated by Matt Damon, who has made Jason Bourne up to this point, his career defining performances. His Bourne is the Energizer bunny of characters. Shot, stabbed, beaten within an inch of his life, and in more car wrecks that the Car Crash Dummies, Damon's Bourne continues to pursue the truth just as ruthlessly as he deals with his enemies.<br /><br />Just like the first two movies, The Bourne Ultimatum has more than its share of fights, car chases, shootouts, and stunts. These movies have been total thrill rides, and if this is truly the last film in the series, The Bourne Ultimatum takes it out on a phenomenally high note.
B000Y179KO|1.0|Well, it's official. The Eagles have abandonded the Rock rack for the Easy Listening bins. Reviewing \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" is like performing an autopsy on a cadaver that died of old age and natural causes.    This latest collection of sleepy, been-there-done-that retreads by a bunch of technically proficient but creatively complacent old men is easily the most forgettable pap since the Backstreet Boys. Not even the barely noticeable presence of Joe Walsh can drag this musical mush out of the \\"How can we cover all the bases while simultaneously mastering none?\\" slush pile.    Stylistically it's all over the road, from soft rock to faux R&B, with only a few weak attempts at the glory of such former hits as \\"Already Gone\\" and a pathetically pale imitation of \\"Hotel California.\\" Don Felder should be thanking his lucky stars that he's in no way connected to this snooze-inducing Slurm. If you've heard ANYTHING by Poco or Crosby, Stills & Nash (even the weakest of their last efforts) then you've already heard this stuff, only much, much better.    \\"Long Road Out Of Eden\\" is the insufferably long-winded conceit of a band with absolutely nothing new to say, and an unfortunate, deluded obsession to say it ... in as many words as possible.    Save your money for John Fogerty's \\"Revival\\" instead. Now THAT'S what's still possible by a guy who hasn't sold his soul to Corporate Rock And Roll.

1401300529|5.0|The Coldest War is a popular history of the Korean War: 1950-53 which is the forgotten war in America' collective memory. Over 30,000 young Americans died in the mountains of Korea in temperatures which sometimes reach 40 degrees below zero. In horrific battles in hellholes called Pork Chop Hill, Inchon and the Chosin Resevoir American blood ran red in the snowy inferno of Asia.<br />  The war began on June 25, 1950 when the North Korean dictator Kim II<br />Sung launched his forces south of the 38th parallel under command of Marshall Peng. The weak South Korean forces under President Syghman Ree fell to their onslaught. Sung was a toady of the Soviets under the eye of the all seeing Joseph Stalin. Mao the victor in the recently concluded civil war in China watched with interest from the sidelines. Neither he or Stalin wanted Sung to begin war in the south. This was the time when their was an uneasy alliance between China and the Soviet Union which would soon turn hostile<br />  Under the attacks of Republican conservatives who blamed the Truman admininstration for \\"losing China\\" the President and his Secretary of State Dean Acheson called on American forces in Korea. Douglas MacArthur the fabled victor in the Pacific War against Japan was governinig that land from Tokyo. He was named commander of the American army in Korea. He ruled from a distance spending most of his time in Tokyo. MacArthur was a majestic, remote, cold and enigmatic figure who sought glory and disdained presidential authority.<br />  MacArthur launched the Inchon invasion in August which led to the expulsion of North Korean forces from the South. However, in December 1950 Chinese troops at the instigation of Mao joined forces with the North Koreans to re-invade south of the 38th parallel. MacArthur wanted to invade Manchuria and mainline China which would probably have launched World War III. The Soviets would have, in all probability,have joined forces with their Asian allies.<br />  Truman fired MacArthur suffering bad press and public disdain. History has proven him correct as he demanded civilian presidential control of the military.<br />  General Matthew Ridgeway replaced MacArthur and did a good job in teaching the troops how to combat the Communists forces. The war ended in a peace agreement signed in 1953. America came away from the experience wrongly looking upon Communism as a monolithic enemy which would lead future administrations down the long road to Vietnam.<br />  This was Pulitzer Prize winning author David Halberstam's final work. He won fame for \\"The Best and the Brightest\\" his brilliant chronicle of how we became involved in the Vietnam war. Halberstam has done a good job writing this popular one volume account of the Korean War. We see the battle action on the ground as well as what was going on in the diplomatic wars and intrigue in Washington DC, China and in Moscow.<br />  The book has excellent maps of the battlefields of such places as the Chosin Resevoir and Inchon but lacks any photographs of the war which would have been a good inclusion into the excellently written text.<br />  Anyone with a keen interest in American military history, the Cold War or tracing the American involvement in Asia would benefit from this excellent study.ffering bad press and public disdain.

Decide what you care about and enjoy those decisions (even elongate them - he calls this \\"Maximize\\"). If you find yourself making decisions about things you don't care passionately about then he recommends that you \\"Satisfice\\" - ie make a good enough decision (take advice from others that care about this subject, do what you did last time etc)    There is lots of great tips in this book.    If you are unsure try this video    [...]    It's not the full deal, but it gives you a good intro.    This book was an inspiration while I was creating my board game. It's great to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the human mind.    I think book this is closely linked to understanding personal happiness in this crazy world in which we live.     Highly recommended.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen was terrific when it was published as a maxi-series by DC comics in the late 1980s, and the power of the original work was only heightened when it was transformed into a graphic-novel.  The innovative storytelling techniques that mixed a regular comic book, a comic book within the regular comic book, and other learned studies of the characters within the regular comic combined to produce a masterpiece of creative energy.<br /><br />The storytelling and artwork are as cohesive as you'll ever find, and if you're like me, you'll find yourself picking this book up every few years to give it a fresh read.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
1401302378|5.0|I wish I'd read this a year earlier.    Wow. It's scary and leveling. This book explains why you should reset your expectations about what any product can achieve an a world of abundant choice.    On the one hand the \\"Long tail\\" is about exploiting the market for low volume items, but knew a lot about that already.    What I'd not fully taken into account was the how the long tail dramatically reduces the potential for a hit product in our information overloaded world.    Great book, very well argued. Lots of great data.    Must reads to go with this book are;    The Paradox of Choice  A Whole New Mind
0316067598|5.0|This a tremendous tale of bravery and sacrafice under the harshest of conditions.  It's a story of the toughest military training program in the world.  It's the story of four Navy SEALS who fought gallantly for hours against a vastly larger force of Taliban high in the Hindu Kush.  It's the story of that battle's lone survivor who walked and crawled for seven miles before being taken in by a friendly village.  It's a story of the strange Afgan tribal politics, which dictate interaction between the local Pashtuns, the Taliban and Al Queada.  Most of all, it's a story which brings home in vivid detail the sacrafice that our troops make for us and our country.    Lt. Murphy, the officer who led this doomed mission, was recently awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.  He, along with all the fine men in this book, and in the military in general, deserve our gratitute.  Read this book so that this story isn't forgotten.
1594481717|5.0|I guess it depends on your mindset and you open-mindedness to new ideas.    Do you believe we are in an ongoing \\"Information Economy\\" - the easy option (information is everywhere and only becoming more prevalent) - so why consider a change?    Or, do you believe we are at the beginning of a new age driven by Asia, Abundance & Automation - i.e. there are significant forces at work that are changing the way we work?    Pink calls is the \\"Conceptual Age\\", in my experience you do need to be conceptual to read and agree with this book.     Others calls if \\"Dream Society\\" or \\"Participation Age\\" and more ...    The jury is out, so for now it's a conceptual leap. Personally I'm a huge fan. I believe a new age has begun - as yet unnamed. I certainly don't think mainstream media has bought into the idea of an age shift.    I'm a huge fan and really think there is something behind the theme of all these books. I have recommended this book to others, some of whom found it a bit abstract and unfounded/unjustifiable, but this is how they always receive new ideas.    I REALLY recommend this book for anyone who is interested in trend watching and who's involved designing products/services for the tomorrow. This book and the others I mention can give you a list of unique angles that you can use to help create differentiating features for your new product/service.    I'd also recommend reading;    \\"Dream Society\\" (not such a great read, but awesome content)  \\"The Deviants Advantage\\" (a little odd, but related if you like the theme)  \\"The World is Flat\\" (very well written and more serious)    For me this book is connected to the Web 2.0 trend - I know many hate this term and this book is not about AJAX, but it does (in my mind) explain some of the forces at work as to why Web 2.0 has taken off.
B000W1V44I|5.0|This is such a catchy CD! I'm really surprised at how awesome this CD is. It went way beyond my expectations! Good job boys. I love it!
0385512058|5.0|I really believe this book is awesome.    I think Keith can be perceived as \\"over the top\\", he lives his life by the rules he sets out in this book.    My advice. It's a bright orange book, read it and dilute to taste.    I can honestly say that whenever I have come unstuck in the marketing of my board game it was because I didn't connect ahead.    There are so many simple things you can learn from this book - each one is your call to decide to follow or not.    The concept of never keeping score and helping other where you can is an awesome one and one that you really can implement.    If you know you can/will help others when asked they you have a perfect basis on which to go out and ask others to help you.    Read it, try it, dilute to taste.    I can see some people not liking this book, but like its advice or not, I can personally attest that it works.    There is a growing army of fans for this book and its advice. I've always found it a great conversation starter.
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|Last weekend I spent a couple hours writing a pretty entertaining review for this soundtrack.  Evidently Amazon didn't think so, as it still hasn't turned up here.  So I am writing another one, which won't be nearly as entertaining.<br /><br />I am enjoying this CD very much.  The only tracks that truly bite are those by Sufjan Stevens, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Jack Johnson.  I am glad I bought this CD.  It is much better than CATS.
0143038419|3.0|I might have ditched this read altogether. But our adventuress here--though extraordinarily self-absorbed, narcissistic ad infinitim--Ms. Gilbert DOES have sense of humor.  And thank goodness for that! I did laugh many a time throughout her journey, yet couldn't help cringing at her enormous pre-occupation with herself and really, what are tiny, if not unimportant, dramas! While I am not going to agree that this is a waste of time, (like many of the one-star reviewers here) there is much better out there.
B000005E3K|5.0|This CD is amazing.  I have owned it for several years, and I never tire of listening to it.  The soloists are great.  The words are in the CD insert (in English as well).  This is my favorite recording of Mozart's Requiem.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I heard Johnny Cash's rendition of the Nine Inch Nails song \\"Hurt\\", and was captivated by its haunting beauty. A sparse, dark acoustic ballad with frail vocals (his lungs were damaged, and he would pass on in 2003), it's a fitting epitaph, and made me seek out the album from which it was taken, the gold selling \\"American IV: The man comes around\\".<br /><br />Produced by super producer Rick Rubin, and largely comprising stripped down country/blues/hymnal covers of other people's songs, with a trio of Cash originals, he makes each song his own. Themes of death and spirituality abound.<br /><br />Opening is the Cash penned title track \\"The man comes around\\", which starts off with a narration from the book of revelation in the Bible, and semi spoken lyrics about the return of Christ, set to a jaunty guitar riff, reflecting his strong Christian beliefs.<br /><br />On the tender \\"Bridge over trouble water\\", sounding rather tremulous, he gets help on harmonies from Fiona Apple. It is a simple, yet stunning remake.<br /><br />Other standouts are the haunting, heartfelt \\"The first time ever I saw your face\\", a blues tinged, guitar reworking of Depeche Mode's \\"Personal Jesus, the moving \\"Give my love to Rose\\" (a Cash composition about a dying man's last wish), the hymnal \\"Danny boy\\", and closing cut, the horn peppered \\"We'll meet again\\" with a faint jazz feel, and a jolly sing-a-long choir at the end, belying the somber nature of the lyrics.<br /><br />The songs take one through various moods; terror, death, saying farewell, and the power of everlasting love. A stunning collection!
B0000033WC|5.0|Well, The Velvet Underground made three incredible and cutting-edge albums with the MGM/Verve label.  Afterwards, they signed a contract with Atlantic Records and made which was to be their final studio album, Loaded.  I'm told that even today, many Velvet fans rank Loaded as the band's least effective effort.  In a sense, I can understnd where they are coming from.  Loaded is neither as innovative nor as edgy as the bands three previous studio albums:  The Velvet Undergound & Nico, White Light/White Heat, and The Velvet Undergound; aka The Grey Album.  Lou Reed and the rest of his bandmates were constantly under pressure to make an album that would sell and be played on the radio.  Therefore, they had to make music which had the sounds of what was mainstream or Top 40 during 1970.  That is what you hear on Loaded.  The mood of each song is not necessarily cutting edge.  The sounds are pretty much as commercial and mainstream as you can get.  After all, even during the sessions of the band's previous albums, the members were to an extent trying to make music which sold. Afterall, what kind of artist would want to die in obscurity after doing work which they painfully put so much of their mind, body, and soul into?  With this said, I will say that Loaded has two of the most memorable and crafted songs on here:  \\"Sweet Jane\\" and \\"Rock 'n' Roll\\".  The chords of both songs are smartly arrnaged and has some terrific guitar solos by Sterling Morrsion.  The other songs are great to listen to the more you hear them:  \\"Who Loves the Sun\\" and \\"Cool It Down\\" are stright out pop sounding songs; much like The Beatles or The Beach Boys.  \\"New Age\\" is a slow-moving, easy ballad; along with that it rhymes 'Robert Mitchum' with 'nvever catch him' and contains the line \\"You're over the hill now/And you're looking for love\\".  You also have \\"Head Held High\\", a fairly loud rocker, \\"Lonesome Cowboy Bill\\" is a country-flavored song, \\"I Found A Reason\\", a 'doo-wop' style song, \\"Train RoundThe Bend\\", a funk-type piece of music, and last, but not least, \\"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\\", a bluesy song.  Since this album, is a 2-CD set, you get to hear different versions of the original line-up of songs as well as a collection of songs that Lou Reed would put onto his solo albums; among these are \\"Ocean\\"(featured on his debut, self-titled album), \\"Satellite of Love\\"(feature on the album, Transformer), and \\"Sad Song\\"(featured on Berlin).  I didn't realize this until later on, but Maureen Tucker beacame pregnant and had to take some time off.  Therefor, Doug Yule brought his kid brother, Billy in to play drums.  Now, his playing may not be up there with Maureen's.  And maybe, the album might have had more edge, if Lou, Doug, and Sterling had waited until Maureen was well enough to play drums again.  Nevertheless, I think Billy Yule's playing was good enough to make the songs worth listening to.  After all of the recordings, Lou realizes that the compromises he has made to make an album which sells and can be played on the radio have reached his limit and would hinder his creative process.  Therefore, on August 22nd, 1970, Lou Reed abruptly quits the Velvet Underground.  Then on September 22nd of the same year, Loaded it released.  Ironically, the album did not sell.  Thankfully throughout time, people have apprectiaed the album Loaded as well as the VU's other studio albums and have regarded it as one of the most influential albums ever.  As a reminder, Lou and his bandmates did not want to repeat themselves; they wanted each of their studio albums to sound different from each other.  In this case, The Velvet Underground, took music and lyrics which were mainstream and commercial sounding during 1970, and made them their own.  And they did it with plenty of skill.  That's why I think Loaded is every bit as good, if not better than the band's three previous studio albums.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|With a sound hearkening back to his seventies/eighties heyday; loads of harmonica, organ, lovely harmonies, poetic lyrics, and those fiery guitars, \\"Magic\\" by Bruce Springsteen is just that, Magic! It became deservedly his 8th #1 album on the Billboard charts, and his seventh in the UK.<br /><br />Opening cut, \\"Radio nowhere\\" is a burst of brilliance, with lyrics about being lost and unable to find anyone around. It is destined to be a stadium classic. Other rockers include the cheery horn sprinkled \\"Livin' in the future\\" (which reminds me a wee bit of \\"Cover me\\"), \\"Girls in their summer clothes\\", \\"Last to die\\", and \\"Long walk home\\" (which starts off deceptively gentle, and builds up to a galloping rocker).<br /><br />On the softer side of things are the beautiful cinematic acoustic ballad \\"Magic\\" (lovely mandolin, and gently sweeping strings), the brooding \\"Devil's arcade\\", and closing cut, the acoustic/hymnal \\"Terry's song\\" (lovely mournful harmonica solo), a heartfelt lament for a departed long time assistant.<br /><br />I have to agree with lots of reviewers who have commented on the poor sound quality in mixing the CD. Still, a truly magical collection from The Boss, who has been rocking for well over 30 years.
B000002KFJ|5.0|First off, the 'Ozzy Osbourne era Black Sabbath' 1969-1978....had two different styles ....1969-1972 or BLACK SABBATH to VOLUME 4 had the doom and gloom,droning guitar style (which I love!)...1973-1978 or SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH to NEVER SAY DIE had a brighter guitar sound more 'treble-ly',more keyboards and synthisizers,and more upbeat lyrics on some songs.  SABOTAGE has the \\"bright sound\\" down pat....it was 1975 and they needed to evolve....Zeppelin did the same with PHYSICAL GRAFFITI.  SABBATH BLOODY SABBATH was a 'hit and miss' album with some good tracks but some filler too........SABOTAGE from start to finish is excellent!  SABOTAGE is versatile with its classical influence and keyboard/synth use and is really mixed well throughout...as well as the good Iommi classic riffs......This album also shows that Black Sabbath are one the heavyweights of the era along with Led Zeppelin....A little more money was spent on SABOTAGE but it paid off ....it's great album!  TECHNICAL ECSTASY was fair ....NEVER SAY DIE was poor......  SABOTAGE is the last 'good' Ozzy Osbourne-era Black Sabbbath album.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I've never owned any album by Britney Spears, and had downloaded the odd track I liked in the past; \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Slave 4 u\\", and things would have stayed pretty much that way, if I hadn't read rave reviews from critics whose opinion I respect. I decided to give it a try, and surprise, I quite like it.<br /><br />Yes, it may be largely down to the assembled team of super producers, and their studio trickery (it features quite a bit of vocoder and vocal distortion), rather than Ms Spears' vocal prowess, but the result is rather pleasant, and guaranteed to get your feet moving.<br /><br />Opening is the smash hit single \\"Gimme more\\", a bouncy synth driven song with a technoi-ish sound in the chorus, and those famous opening words, \\"It's Britney b***\\". It is so catchy, I keep listening to it over and over.<br /><br />Other standouts are \\"Ooh ooh baby\\" (nice guitars) which is vaguely remniscent of \\"Toxic\\", the quirky Pharrell penned/produced \\"Why should I be sad\\", which is the closest thing to a ballad, \\"Get naked (I got a plan)\\", and the brilliant eurodisco stomper \\"Heaven on earth\\" which would make Giorgio Moroder smile.<br /><br />Some of the lyrics attempt to touch on parts on her life; \\"Piece of me\\" deals with the media obsession with her, \\"I'm Mrs. Lifestyles of the rich and famous / You want a piece of me / I'm Mrs. Oh my God that Britney's Shameless / You want a piece of me / I'm Mrs. Extra! Extra! this just in / You want a piece of me\\", while on the skeletal marching groove of the Gwen Stefani-ish \\"Toy soldiers\\" she seems to diss her ex, stating that \\"This time she needs a real soldier, and she's sick and tired of toy soldiers\\" (in a cartoon-ish voice).<br /><br />If she keeps releasing music this good, she just might succeed in blacking out all the negative press! A fun record which succeeds.
B000VH3FV8|4.0|i was/is a big Luther Vandross fan. this collection has alot of his hits,but if I put it together I would have had a Live cd of Luther in the mid 80's or so.  I liked his stuff mainly from 81-88. would have dug  more rare stuff from Luther or just hearing a Jam Session with Luther and Marcus Miller and Nat Adderly Jr. nevertheless the Good stuff still holds up. Luther was So Soulful and you felt where he was coming from. i have almost all of his albums and this collection is worth picking up. brings back alot of Memorys and alot of Good times with hearing these songs that touched on alot of things. he was a Voice that captured so many feelings. RIP  to One Bad SOul Brother.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|This is my FIRST CD from her that I actually listened too.  She great to look at, but shes a artsit that I was only into a few of her songs.  BUT DAMMNNN, how much difference does a live band make though.  I listened to this CD back to back to back.  She actually sounds better and her band was on fire.  I got a new apprieciation for her after listening to this cd.  This is by far the best Live CD I heard (and thats including Mary J Blige in that last).
B000V6BE6C|4.0|I get a chuckle reading the reviews every time these guys come out with an album. So, to be proactive; I have come up with a standardized oath.     Raise your right hand, and repeat after me.     \\"I, (Your Name Here) do solemnly swear to stand on my soap box, publicly trash this album, and call the band sell-outs. I will uphold this standard for a period of approximately 2 years. Upon completing said duration; I will then repeat this process upon the release of their next album, for reasons including (but not limited to) the fact it does not sound like this album.\\"     Now that we've gotten the formalities out of the way; let's get to the fun.     Oh, I almost forgot; if you can't hear the elements of 'Waking The Fallen' on this album, I recommend an ice pick to pierce the tin in your ears.     The one thing that jumps out at me on this CD is the album length. It's far shorter than their previous two efforts, but it flies right by. Kicking off with 'Critical Acclaim'; M. Shadows (displaying a fully healed voice) simultaneously displays a previously untapped vocal range in the pre-chorus, and dusts off an old one with some tastefully placed screaming.     The production has more low end than any of their previous 3 albums. Given that the album is the band's first crack at self production; they get an 'A' for effort. Some of the songs require some tweaking on your stereo EQ due to the aforementioned production.     It's hard to fault them for switching gears to a more groove oriented approach, then again; give 'Waking The Fallen' a listen...you'll realize it's been there all along. After all; to top the all out instrumental insanity (in a good way) of 'City Of Evil' would have resulted in them sounding like Dragonforce with a different frontman...nothing wrong with that...but one Nintendo metal act is enough.      Yes, there are fewer solos this time around...but it's well worth the listen.As with every album they've put out thus far; A7X is always good for a few curveballs. From the speedy piano loop on 'Unbound (The Wild Ride)' (which also features what sounds like a little girl singing at the end), to the almost country 'Dear God'. The influences mesh seamlessly which has long been a staple of theirs. The guitar work of Gates/Vengeance is as tricky as ever, but a bit more subtle this time around.     The biggest surprise of the album would have to be 'A Little Piece Of Heaven'. I don't want to give anything away; but Tim Burton and Robert Rodriguez should collaborate with the band if a video should ever be made.          The only low point of the album (which I only call low because it drags the momentum of the album a bit) is 'Brompton Cocktail' (despite being an excellent song). Other than that 'Avenged Sevenfold' is solid from beginning to end
B0000024V2|5.0|After seeing Johnny Winter as a headliner after Foghat in the early 70's, capturing his guitar work on any recording (even his Live concerts) doesn't seem to do him justice. But his rocking Texas style blues format are probably best found on this CD. (Orginally a three sided double album). One hot great guitar player and showman.

B000025XKM|5.0|I missed Nick Drake in my youth (I am in my late fifties). My youngest son who plays the guitar and has a very eclectic library played him for me. His melancholy, intricate, complex use of the acoustic guitar and simple lyrics (In particular, I like \\"Road\\".) moves me. My only compaint is that \\"Paracite\\" sounds like \\"Dear Prudence\\" by the Beatles.  The collection of music in \\"Pink Moon\\" is by far my favorite because it showcases Drake's guitar and voice and is not over-produced.  This is not the case in Bryter Layter.  I was dissapointed in the song \\"Fly\\", which in its original version, highlites his very intricate guitar work. In the remixed version of Bryter Layter, it is lost in the production.  I would very much like to hear \\"Way of Blue\\" released on CD, but not if it ends up like \\"Bryter Layter\\".

I can only close my eyes and see a scene where Miles Davis is listen to this for the first time. This is, in spite of the fact that Ahmad Jamal doesn't play much like this today, a desert island disc for me.

B000ULQV0W|3.0|The film and the score are truly moving as almost everyone here has echoed so I will cut to my only reservation. Did anyone know that Kaki King had at least 3 tracks in the film? They were absolutely gorgeous: some of the best in the film and placed so well yet you have no idea. It's suspicious that Barnes and Noble and many other retailers list the record under \\"Eddie Vedder\\" and exclude her tracks completely. Sounds like she got the raw end of the deal and was crushed under the EV/P.Jam marketing jugernaut. What a pity. Do youself a favor and pick up up all three of her records. SHE is truly a pioneer and free spirit!

B000Y44LBG|4.0|Ridley Scott's \\"American Gangster\\" is a film of contrasts: the have and the have nots and the have and the have more than enough. It is also about the American Dream: realizing it, losing it and striving for it and never quite achieving it.<br />All of this is centered on two characters: Frank Lucas (the incredibly strong and charismatic Denzel Washington) and Richie Roberts (the equally strong and charismatic Russell Crowe).<br />Denzel plays Frank Lucas, a Harlem gang lord who runs a heroin empire circa 1969 in New York City bettering even the Mafia on their own turf with shrewd and knowing procurement of the drug directly from the producers in Asia. Crowe plays Richie Roberts, a New Jersey Cop, who pursues Lucas.<br />Screenwriter Steve Zaillian has set up some interesting and dynamic contrasts here: Roberts (on the \\"right\\" side of the law) and Lucas (on the wrong side) are exact opposites in nature and in action. Roberts is a loose cannon at work (he is despised by his fellow officers because he turns in a million dollars that he and his partner find in an abandoned car: money that would have been divvied up among the cops on the take), craving a family (he has a wife and a son) who puts in none of the work that goes into sustaining such a relationship. Roberts's family is his group of fellow officers determined to bring down the drug traffickers. When Roberts's wife (Carla Gugino) wants to move to Las Vegas to begin a new life, Roberts half-heartedly makes an attempt to legally prevent her from doing so but in the end he concedes to her wishes because, basically a good, honest man, he realizes that his son would be better off without him.<br />Lucas, on the other hand, is all about a huge extended family: Moms (a resplendent Ruby Dee), Wife (Lymari Nadal), brothers and sister and a bunch of in-laws who not only work for Lucas but also make sure to sit down to dinner at Moms every Sunday. Lucas puts in the work necessary to keep his family together and functional yet the family is supported by the unlawful distribution of heroin.(When Lucas is being interrogated by Roberts he says, \\"I took care of Harlem, now Harlem is gonna take care of Me.\\")<br />Lucas is also the ultimate in cool and control. He dresses like a banker, conducts himself with reverence for his Moms and his wife. At his mentor's funeral, he wipes up a glass spill and sets down a coaster so as to avoid this from happening again. The movie is filled with this type of telling character and behavior traits. Roberts dresses like a bum, conducts himself like a man without any social graces, lives in a hovel yet he is going to school at night to become a lawyer which requires major dedication and work.<br />Zallian has set up an ambiguous and interesting situation in which our loyalties are torn between the ancient friction between good and bad: a bad man who does some good and a good man who does some bad. In the end we are genuinely disappointed when Lucas is caught and imprisoned.<br />All the time I was watching the big broad Epic of Ridley Scott's \\"American Gangster\\" all I could think about was: how much better, as in committed to this subject matter Sidney Lumet would have been. Lumet (all you have to do is watch what he does in \\"The Verdict\\" or \\"The Prince of New York\\" to see what I mean) would have brought a grounded sense of thoughtfulness and humanity to the proceedings that Scott almost achieves here which is not to say that \\"American Gangster\\" is without any of those things but more than anything this has to do with the exemplary performances of both Denzel and Russell Crowe who bring their best game to this film.<br />\\"American Gangster\\" is not a great film but it is a very good one with magnificent performances by Denzel and Russell Crowe. Don't come to \\"American Gangster\\"expecting clear, precise morality fed to you with your popcorn...because you won't get it. What you will get is a conflicted, obtuse treatise on the folly and foibles inherent whenpursuing your dreams in a country where all is possible, all is available yet nothing is guaranteed.y where all is possible, all is available yet nothing is guaranteed.
B0000029GA|5.0|Ok, well this is my first time reviewing anything on amazon but this CD made me do it. I am 16 years old and ever since i was a teen i began listening to rap such as 50 cent, dipset, t.i. ludacris. etc. But then i realized that even though the songs by these artists were hits they had no substance to them. So I started listening to old school and many people said I had to start with this album. Well you can call me a stereotypical kid because originally I was turned off by this album due to its average beats. But slowly it became my favorite album of all time because once I listened to the lyrics it was amazing how nas painted a picture in your head for ex. one love. I slowly started understanding the concepts of nas' street life and struggle. If any kid is reading this review please stop supporting the bad soulja boy, ay bay bay, t-pain, crunk, snap music its not even rap and immediately buy this album!!!!  My favorite tracks are:  1)Memory Lane  2)The World is Yours  3)One Love  4)New York State of Mind  5)One Time for Your Mind  6)Halftime
0805079831|5.0|\\"The Shock Doctrine\\" by Naomi Klein offers an uniquely powerful history of neoliberalism. Drawing substantively from David Harvey's [[ASIN:0199283273 A Brief History of Neoliberalism]], Ms. Klein extends and deepens the analysis by demonstrating how both violence and economic crisis are collaboratively and consciously wielded in service to political ideology. Assiduously researched and cogently argued, this outstanding book offers one of the most persuasive indictments yet written about the pathological excess of the corporatist state.<br /><br />Ms. Klein contends that the shock doctrine was incubated during the Cold War in CIA-funded torture labs and Chicago School economics classes. The author demonstrates that the election of the socialist candidate Salvador Allende in Chile provided the first opportunity for military and economic planners to effectively coordinate their actions and engineer a neoliberal coup featuring war, torture and economic restructuring. As this U.S. policy template spread throughout the hemisphere, Ms. Klein provides ample evidence that the end result was little more than an armed robbery of the national resources for the benefit of the powerful and corrupt few.<br /><br />Importantly, Ms. Klein shows that nations do not choose neoliberalism when given the choice. In Bolivia, Poland, Russia, South Africa and elsewhere, international bankers pressured governments saddled with debts to accept economic restructuring. In other cases, financial catastrophes that were orchestrated by the financial community forced open semi-protected economies in Asia and Mexico. Sometimes, the shock of war provides an opening for politicians; for example, in the U.K., Margaret Thatcher's economic policies succeeded only after she had acted swiftly on the heels of the Falkland Islands War, and of course in the U.S. George W. Bush gained the upper hand following the 9/11 terror attacks. In all of these instances, Ms. Klein discusses how neoliberal shock doctors such as Milton Friedman and Jeffrey Sachs were on call to quickly design and implement the Washington Consensus policies of free trade, deregulation and privatization before these desperate patients really understood the implications of the procedures.<br /><br />Against this compelling backdrop, Ms. Klein defines the current Iraq War as perhaps neoliberalism's last great misadventure. In a narrative that bears resemblance to Noam Chomsky's work, Ms. Klein submits that the disaster capital complex visited war upon Iraq in order to pry open its closed economy and of course, to exploit its rich oil resources. Ms. Klein discusses how the subsequent disregard for law, corruption and profiteering, war and torture has produced a near total disaster, with more recent gains on the ground coming on the heels of a grudging acknowledgment that the collective memory of a society cannot be wiped clean and remade overnight. With this insight, Ms. Klein goes on to discuss how former victims of neoliberal experimentation have begun to organize and reclaim their communities, citing the leftist victories in South America and elsewhere as evidence that a more tenable, mixed democratic/socialist alternative may yet be possible.<br /><br />Destined to become a classic, I highly recommend this brilliant and important book to everyone.Friedman and Jeffrey Sachs were on call to quickly design and implement the Washington Consensus policies of free trade, deregulation and privatization before these desperate patients really understood the implications of the procedures.

0061020680|5.0|Excuse the caps in the title, but the quote comes from Death himself, and as many of you know, the guy always speaks that way. It is really great to have a book in which one of the main characters is Death, my favorite one in Discworld. Death's sarcasm is one of the reasons why I like this series so much. But the old man is getting tired, and has decided to get an apprentice to alleviate some of the burden that rests on his shoulders.<br /><br />Mort is a youngster that does not show much promise for any profession, so when Death shows up and offers him an apprenticeship, he is happy to take him up on it, and off he goes. Mort is a little thick at the beginning, but soon he shapes up. There is one thing that he does not tolerate, and that is people calling him boy, lad or any other way that is not his name, and he keeps reminding others of this fact. During his commission, he will have to take care of things when Death goes on vacation, and try to figure out the messes he creates by altering reality. Meanwhile Death is living the good life and there is the risk of him deciding not to come back. Imagine the repercussions!<br /><br />Once again, Pratchett delivers a wonderful product in the Discworld series. Many of you already know the basics: flat world, shaped as pizza, standing on four elephants on top of a turtle, abyss at the horizon, many gods, etc. The parallelisms with our own world are merely coincidences, or aren't they? Anyway, the humor in this installment reaches an all time high, and the author showcases his talent for using different techniques to make us laugh out loud. Satire, pun, tongue-in-cheek, you name it, it is all here. Fans of the series will have a great time, and those that are new to it, what are you waiting for? You can start here, or go back to [[ASIN:0552124753 The Colour of Magic]] and read the books in order, either way you will have a blast.

The more uptempo songs keep you moving while the traditional ballads move you, it's classic bsb and it's why we still love them fifteen years from the start.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I was 12 years old when this series arrived in the US thanks to PBS.

B000002J1U|5.0|The truth is, I'm getting tired of people saying Zeppelin III is the most underrated album of all-time.  That's simply not true.  How can one of the biggest rock bands in the world possibly HAVE an underrated album?  I mean, come on, think about all the bands out there from back in the early 70's that most people would have no clue who they are, and how good some of those albums are.  Wouldn't those be the TRUE underrated albums?      Anyway, despite that, I love the record.  \\"Tangerine\\" is perhaps the best song on the album even though it's quite short.  What a charming little ballad that one is.  \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" features some extremely insane blues soloing in the middle, and that's mainly why I love the tune.  Everyone knows \\"The Immigrant Song\\" because apparently classic rock radio doesn't understand there's more than just that one song on the album.  \\"Out on the Tiles\\" has a great guitar riff to open the song, and pretty good vocals to back it up.  \\"Friends\\" is a mysterious Egyptian-sounding piece of pop music that goes straight into a more upbeat, and hard rocking \\"Celebration Day\\" with a weird, funky riff to dominate the song.  Brilliant.  \\"Gallows Pole\\" is another really good Zeppelin track.      You can see why no other band sounded like these guys back in the day.  It would almost be impossible to recreate these songs.  The last three songs are probably the weakest ones, but obviously they aren't THAT weak otherwise I wouldn't be giving the album a perfect rating, would I?  Just buy and own the darn thing!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I'll never forget seeing this movie for the first time on the big screen. Being a big fan of the Matrix films, I was eagerly anticipating the Wachowskis' next project. And for the next 130 minutes, I was blown away. Not only was the story intricate and engaging, the acting intense and convincing, the characters sympathetic and human, but the subtext of the film was unbelievable.<br /><br />At several points throughout the film my jaw dropped and I thought, \\"Did they just say what I thought they said?\\" I walked out of the theater elated and awed at what the filmmakers had created. I even had a moment of delusional optimism: \\"Maybe people will GET it! This could be the movie that breaks the door down!\\" But, like a sign from the great pessimist in the sky, my wishful thinking was promptly rebuked.<br /><br />Leaving the theater I overheard a man talking with his son. They, too, had just seen the movie. Surely, he had seen what I had seen; heard what I had heard. But no. \\"It was a good movie,\\" he said. \\"But just remember, son, it's a movie, not real life.\\" I wanted to sock the guy in the face. How could a human see the movie and come away with such a pusillanimous and lily-livered response?<br /><br />What property of human stubbornness and \\"thick-skulledness\\" can misinterpret the line, \\"artists use lies to tell the truth, while politicians use them to cover the truth up.\\" But I should know better. The human mind has a hyperactive and tenacious tendency to avoid uncomfortable conclusions.  Cognitive dissonance reigns supreme. If believing two contradictory pieces of information at the same time can prevent one from accepting an uncomfortable truth, our subconscious is more than willing to give us a hand.<br /><br />\\"No son, our government would never do such a thing.\\" Bollocks.<br /><br />V for Vendetta is a no-holds-barred condemnation of the creeping fascism that has infected both the American and British systems of government; of their repeated use of false-flag operations to cow their populations into blind and terror-based submission; the presence of psychopathic individuals in said governments and all the implications that follow from that point.nd and terror-based submission; the presence of psychopathic individuals in said governments and all the implications that follow from that point.
B00008DDXL|2.0|Was JK embarrassed by this blunder? egad this was truly a dissapointment, and the delusion that it was fine cinema, or five stars is only on the track of it having Potter as a label. Potter fans around the globe would give it accolades even if Freddie Prinze Jr was playing Severus Snape.<br /><br />A poorly executed screenplay, the CGI was adolescent, in a world now taken over by the mass marketed Transformers and the like, you think they would have called Stan Wintson in for some fun, this was truly a first year at the New York Film Academy type work. The plot was acerebral. Rupert Grint is wooden, plastic and insignificant. There was absolutely no character development from jumpstreet, and equally no suspense.<br /><br />We are yoked into believing that because it's Harry Potter it's going to be good. I am such a huge fan of the book series, and naturally the books are usually better than the films, but [this] compared to the book, was a true washout. Personally I find Branagh a superb method actor, he played a fine Hamlet and his movies are very thoughtout and distinctive, however the miscast here is evident, as he was unmoving, and commonplace.<br /><br />In closing the whole package seemed rushed, irrelevant, unbecoming of the worldwide sensation of Rowling's, uh, epics?, and like Augusten's \\"Running With Scissors\\", definitely stick to the book.<br /><br />A two star rubbish.
0374105235|4.0|I enjoyed the book and I would buy it again but, that said, there are some things about it that bothered me.  For someone who was supposedly on drugs all during his conscription, he exhibits an uncanny recall of the events of that period of his life.  And, then too, he always seems to paint himself as just a little better, a little braver, a little... well, you get the point. A few points were simply not credible.  One, in particular, is the episode where they carried him, I believe it was three days, back to their old base where they had medicine that would save his life and without which he would die.  These children were disposable.  I honestly doubt that they would risk the lives of the others it required to carry him not to mention the fact that it slowed them considerably and would take them longer to return with needed supplies.  But it does give us a glimpse into the lives of those caught up in these conflicts, how easy it is to lose our humanity and how we are capable of regaining it.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|If you have not seen this movie, you are in for the best time.   The acting is great, story line terriffic.    Unlike the Matrix series (which I very much enjoyed), this movie will make you watch it over and over (or pause and rewind to be sure your ears hear correctly).  The messages sent out by V are so relevant today.  The one spoken by V that I can't forget is this:  \\"people should not be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of their people\\".    Watch it soon, before it's banned.

B000000XCK|5.0|On \\"Pendulum,\\" Fogerty experiments with new approaches and although many Creedence fans find this album their least favorite I feel it has the most musical integrity of all six albums (I'm not counting \\"Mardis Gras\\"). After \\"Pagan Baby,\\" which features one of rock's best guitar solos, a series of unique songs follows, each of which is distinct and avoids cliches (unlike \\"Travelling Band\\" and \\"Looking Out My Back Door\\" on \\"Cosmo's Factory\\"). Fogerty's voice is outstanding, particularly on \\"Hideaway.\\" He plays both the sax and organ well and seems to be trying to fuse all his talents to create a less commercial style, which is perhaps why this album is not as loved as some of the earlier ones. The only exception is \\"Rude Awakening #2,\\" which after the first two (very pleasant) minutes descends into a nightmarish cacophony of organ, drums, and studio effects.
B000V8I2QU|1.0|The sound quality of this recording is so bad I can't listen to it.  What's the point of pouring all that effort and talent into the making of a new album if the end result sounds like a wall of mud?  Very disappointing.
1564029654|4.0|This book teaches children and is a great way to start a bit more of a reassuring discussion with them when its finished that there will be times when a parent will not be there but that they will return at the end of the day or whenever.  Obviously a human (a responsible one anyway) isn't going to leave three babies alone in an apartment but there will be times when they may wake up with a babysitter or parent's friend when that parent has been urgently called away.  If kids have had this read to them they will be a bit more assured.  Also probably a great book to have on hand for the stand in adult to read to children who awaken to this situation.<br /><br />The basic plot of owl babies is three owl chicks ranging a few days apart in age awaken one night to discover their mother is not in the nest (she's obviously out hunting as owls do) and they worry.  The older ones reassure the youngest and themselves at the same time that she'll be back and where she probably is.  The illustrations are also quite well done, not detailed realistic but close with that touch of softness to help the reassuring message sink in.

B00007KWI9|3.0|Luis Mejia (son) - Yes first incarnation as a band resulted in the meetings of both virtuoso vocalist Jon Anderson and bassist Chris Squire, who would later become Yes all time bandmates, plus the most influential progressive rock drummer Bill Bruford and the addition of guitarist Peter Banks and keyboardist Tony Kaye, and all in all, Yes welcomed the world with their debut self titled album. This first album becomes truly a talented piece, it got some fine rock structures and it ranks among the first progressive rock albums, it shows a couple of important faces in Yes music that would later be characteristic, and there's a lot to take onto consideration, as the notorious guitar signature of former guitarist Peter Banks would be a characteristic later adopted by Steve Howe. An album full of organ, distinctive time signatures and unusual pieces, it surely goes beyond the sixties era effect on culture, not far away from that territory but better placed, and being one of the first and most underrated prog rock pieces, it keeps its collection of comfortable songs and even some pretty excellent songs, this can be easily detected on the calm and tender simplicity of \\"Yesterday And Today\\", the pop rock oriented \\"Looking Around\\", the most progressive \\"Harold Land\\" and the minor hit \\"Sweetness\\", which keeps its moments, but no composition in the album could be compared with \\"Survival\\" which not only shows an outrageous instrumentation and melodies, but it can also be seen as one Yes most recognizable songs into their music expression, too bad its too underrated, while their amateur expressions can be noticed on their most original way of covering songs, specially in The Byrds' \\"I See You\\", where there is an incredible and furtive style and blues-jazz tendencies better reflected in interested musicians like Bill Bruford, while The Beatles \\"Every Little Thing\\" cannot match their other interpretation. This can stand as an outstanding, breath-taking promising album full of pieces but this will only be appreciated by fans or experienced listeners, while some casual listeners could appreciate (of course, there's a lot of musical tastes) this way of characteristic music, the album could have been great if it would not have been overshadowed by the band's still amateur musicianship and production ignorance, and far beyond it almost doesn't sound more than just a '60s beat-off or any truly progressive rock or pop rock face, while their truly overwhelming, breath taking, imaginative, boundary breaker musical characteristic won't be present neither in this album until Fragile, all in all, Yes is a band which is better causing sensational emotionalism rather than story telling concepts or unocassional musical signatures, their virtuoso style is far away present and won't fit into casual listeners despite its promising talent, as Yes was still a young and mildly tense band, but if we could talk about Time And A Word it would be a worst situation. This is one of few albums that I would suggest the listener to draw his personal conclussions, I've been as objective as I could but the only thing I can do with all confidence is recommend you to buy a second album from Yes since Fragile and THEN we can discuss with all confidence, and most of all, this remastered version is pretty incredible, I may be tired of listening to \\"Dear Father\\" as a bonus track in every remaster but this version not only possesses bonus tracks of unissued songs' versions, but it also has a fantastic, high sound quality and a booklet detailing how the band was formed and what you could expect.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Rarely has there been any presentation that so captures the reality we currently live in! This excellent movie provides hope in a world systematically overrun by political deception.  This deception is for a PURPOSE and has a PATTERN of lies, manipulation, corruption, and false accusations that needs to be recognized by the people at large. Seeing and recognizing this pattern is one of the first lines of defense against tyranny, fascism, and dictatorship. It's no wonder that certain members of Congress campaigned against the release of this movie. Watch and study it closely to see why.

B00005JPS5|4.0|Barry B. Benson (Jerry Seinfeld), a bee who graduated from college, isn't enjoying his new adult life. He's forced to make honey for the rest of his life, and his parents (Kathy Bates, Barry Levinson) and friend Adam (Matthew Broderick) aren't giving him much encouragement. Disillusioned, he joins a pollen jock bees, and in the middle of a roundabout, he gets lost from the rest of the gang. It turns out to be good, however, as he makes friends with kind-hearted florist Vanessa Blume (Renee Zellweggar). However, this also presents Barry with a scary truth: humans are stealing honey from the bees and selling it for their own profit. Now, along with Vanessa, Barry hopes to fight a menacing D.A. (John Goodman) and reclaim the bees' source of life.    I sort of agree with a small number of critics that \\"Bee Movie\\" may not be a grandstanding breakthrough of an animated comedy. It's taking the \\"Shrek\\" formula by mixing in un-PC humor (with jokes that I'm surprised even got past the censors), a gorgeous 3D environment, a huge star wattage (with Larry King, Ray Liotta, and Sting making cameos), and a score from frequent Dreamworks composer Rupert-Gregson Williams, but not doing too much. This is a very good movie, but with Jerry Seinfeld (who also produces) a solid comedian who usually comes in balls out, willing to hit the jugular, \\"Bee Movie\\" sort of has him on a leash.    Still, it's hard to deny a film that isn't overstuffed with family-friendly moralizing to please the simple-minded. Even though you'll have to sit through the first quarters of the film hearing agonizing, half-baked bee puns, \\"Bee Movie\\" has plenty of good gags here and there. Whether it's Barry imagining a date with Vanessa, riding a bouncing tennis ball, or going against the court and talking to various celebrities mentioned above, the stuff is safe, but deserves credit for its creative originality. Think of it as an Amanda Bynes film if it was animated, and it had Seinfeld.    Speaking of the comedian, Seinfeld does a really good job in his first leading role. The material isn't meaty, but Seinfeld has plenty of energy and determination in his attempts to make lemons out of lemonade. And he recieves good company in the form of Renee Zellweggar, whose reliable sweetness and charisma counteracts any formulaic story devices. Both of these talents always brighten up the atmosphere in case it reaches for bottom-of-the-barrel animated comedy cliches.    I did wish the side cast was given meatier material, however. There's some solid work from Matthew Broderick, Chris Rock, and Patrick Warburton. But it seems like the creators feel like letting audiences play \\"spot-the-celebrity\\", with limited appearances from Kathy Bates, John Goodman, David Herman, Barry Levinson (following Martin Scorcese's foots from \\"Shark Tale\\" as another director looking to broaden his plate) Megan Mullaly, Michael Richards, Oprah Winfrey, and many more. I was surprised they didn't squeeze Uma Thurman in there (actually, she was going to appear in the movie, along with \\"Saturday Night Live\\" funnyman Colin Quinn).    \\"Bee Movie\\" is competent entertainment, and I could pass the shortcomings. Seinfeld, while not impressive, manages to make a competent enough debut in his leading man role. And it's not crappy. It's just a shame that, after being wowed by solid films like \\"Surf's Up\\" and \\"The Simpsons Movie\\", it's a shame this film didn't have more bite.
B00099BPP6|5.0|This recording is still the best overall recording of the opera.  Kubelik is far superior to all conducting competition.  Fisher-Dieskau may not have the normal weight for the role but his understanding of the Verdi style and line easily compensates.  It is also effectively complete and the singers stick to Verdi's notes.  Most notably the last line of the opera, where instead of singing the usual stupid high option, Fisher-Dieskau sings the same curse motive which he sings at the end of the earlier act.  An actual attempt at a real leitmotif and ignored by all but a few Italian dominated recordings.  I have found in general the most satisfying recordings of Italian opera have either German conductors or are sung in German by German singers.  What is referred to as Italian opera \\"tradition\\" is what destroys most recordings...rushed tempos, scooping, sloppy diction, dropping or altering notes for ease of performance or mere vocal display, numerous absurd and ridiculous cuts, crappy, uninvolved conducting,...  If you're interested try some of the recordings on Walhall available through the Berkshire Record Outlet.  Start with the Fricsay Lucia with Haefliger, Stader, Fisher-Dieskau...the sound is excellent and virtually all the interpretive barnacles have been removed and you actually here the pure music.  If you can resist Stader in her first act aria or Haefliger in his final aria, you have problems.  There is a Fricsay conducted Don Carlo with Greindl as the King.  The performance of the big aria before the Inquisitor scene is nothing less than a revelation.  Greindl is no Christoff, BUT he and Fricsay reveal more than of the potential musical and interpretive content than ANY other performance I have ever heard, hands down.  Warning: the sound on this recording distorts at high volumes and the poor tenor has got to be the worst I have ever heard...obviously a baritone-tenor conversion which simply did not work.

(hogg is definitely NOT anti-breastfeeding, as some reviewers have claimed.)    and she gives solid advice about how to get your new baby to sleep in her own bed WITHOUT crying it out.  this is huge, because i am very against the whole baby-wise ferberization trauma.    however, i came across this book 13 months into my own parenting adventure, with what hogg refers to as \\"accidental parenting\\" firmly entrenched.  we live in a studio apartment and don't even have room for a crib, let alone a separate bedroom for our little guy.  we have been doing the attachment parenting thing from birth: babywearing, co-sleeping, on-demand feeding, you name it.  and the truth is, we were 95% happy before we read this book.  our only real issue is that occasionally ben's naps are spent with me having to lie there with him while he suckles, or else he can't sleep.  so i've learned to adapt and use that time for reading (that's how i managed to read hogg's entire book in 3 days, even with a very active little guy).  fortunately it isn't every nap.    what this book did for me was to help me become extremely unhappy with our current mode of parenthood (even though our son is a very happy, sociable, healthy boy).  i felt ridiculously guilty for the ways i'd trainedhim to eat & sleep. i became anxious and in a hurry to fix the problem (using her 3 steps that are not really all that helpful -- don't be deceived).  and THAT caused major tension with my son and husband.      finally after a few days i decided to place everything i'd learned from the baby whisperer into a mental file to reconsider next time around, but to carry on with our first child as we were.  and peace was restored to our family.  it seems like if you don't begin at the beginning or in the first 6 months with hogg's m.o., you're somewhat screwed.    so my advice to parents of older babies is: don't read this book unless you are truly miserable with your style of parenting.  if your style is working for you, let it ride.  read this book before you have a second child, perhaps, but don't try to start from scratch with your near-toddler.  it will only end in tears.  ;o)      and if you ARE going to read this book as an expectant or new parent, i highly recommend that you also read \\"Attachment Parenting\\" by Katie Allison Granju (an excellent book; i liked it better than dr. sears' \\"the attachment parenting book,\\" as granju seemed more objective) as well as one of the books by ferber or the ezzos (or whoever represents the opposite end of the spectrum).  if you at least skim through one book from each of those 3 perspectives, you'll get a balance and safeguard yourself from hearing about a concept a year into your parenting adventure and wishing you could turn back time.  not that i really do -- ben is so happy, i think my \\"accidental\\" attachment parenting happened for a good reason. :o)    p.s. as i'm finishing up this review, ben is sleeping peacefully on our cal-king bed, 10 feet away from my breasts. :o)
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Two nights ago I made a special trip to my local music store for the express purpose of purchasing this CD. It was worth the drive. I'm listening now for at least the tenth time, hearing something new I didn't notice before and certain that when it's finished I'll be starting this epic musical adventure all over again. That being said I decided to take look at Amazon to see what others are saying about the progression of Avenged Sevenfold. Many people get it and that's great. For some A7X is just not their thing and I (trying desperately not to forget that it's okay that we're all different) get that too. What I do find disappointing (though not suprising) are the reviews from some so-called A7X fans putting this CD down because it's not Waking The Fallen or City Of Evil. Of course it's not, these guys are artist not copy machines. If you criticize these extremely talented young men for growing musically you may as well criticize a new born for breathing. I can only imagine how horrible it is to be a person who can only appreciate a single, etched in stone, black and white style of music, tragic ... auditory color blindness
B000UR9T8C|2.0|Spiderman movies are supposed to be fun, action, adventure and just general coolness with Spiderman himself. This one was just full of whiney crying sookiness from the main characters. And the singing and dancing?! Oh please, this isnt a broadway musical! When I watch Spidey movies, I want to see SPIDERMAN webslinging and taking out the villians...with his mask ON! He seemed to have it off more then on in this one. Why would i want to see Peter Parkers nerdy wimpy face in a Spiderman costume instead of his mask? And what was James Francos character? A villian, The Hobgoblin or The Green Goblin mach 2? Does anyone really know? And again, no mask! Boring. The two villians were the best thing about this movie, particularly Venom, for the all too short amount of screen time he actually got. Overall this was dissapointing, I really enjoyed the first two but Sam dropped the ball with this one.
B000003TBP|5.0|Beck's second album is often called his masterpiece, and I'm not arguing much. Like last time out, he often succeeds in bridging the gap between rap and everything else, most notably rap, surf-rock and techno on the amazing yet stupid \\"Devils Haircut\\" (with lyrics that mock death-metal), and rap, jazz, and soul on the brilliant, sample-laced hit single \\"Where It's At\\", which to many is Beck's shot at artistic credibility. But it's every bit \\"goofy novelty\\" as \\"Loser\\". Let us not forget that a lot of samples on the song are from an obscure sex-ed record. Yeah, that's mature. Thankfully, I can't praise the song enough: the samples are amazingly integrated into the song, the organ is beautiful, and every time I hear the song, I pick up on something I previously missed. Plus who can forget that chorus? \\"I got two turntables and a microphone!\\" He also pumps out a couple very solid alt-rockers, like the nerdy \\"Hotwax\\" and \\"New Pollution\\", which ends in an unforgettable sax loop. And just to prove his eclectism, he throws in some odd material like the Eastern drone \\"Derelict\\" and the impossible-to-classify, overbearing \\"Novocain\\", which has turntables, buzzing guitars, hip-hop drums, R&B horns, bass, electric piano, and vocals all going at more-or-less the same time. To me, that's where the album caves in - it's like he was trying to show us just how much noise he could pack into four-and-a-half minutes. This is redeemed by the ironically beautiful (or should I say ironic beauty?) of \\"J*cka**\\", a very lovely song with a title that suggests just the opposite. Confused? So am I. But there are times when I think only Beck knows what he's intending. It contains a deadly accurate Dylan harmonica interpretation, provided by Them (it's a sample of Dylan's \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\" - again, seamlessly incorporated!). Continuing on my \\"Beck-does-everything!\\" thread, \\"Minus\\" is a solid bit of sludgy hard rock, and the humorous \\"Sissyneck\\" is entertaining country-funk. Yes, that's right, country-funk. And \\"High 5 (Rock the Catskills)\\" is the closest thing to pure rap I've ever heard Beck do. Well, up until that weird classical loop that he throws in just for the sake of throwing it in. And then turns around and delivers heavy guitars. Okay, forget what I said about pure hip-hop. It's a super song, though - that spoken part at 2:40, after those weird samples, is funny, all right. And unexpected. I'm unsure what I think of \\"Ramshackle\\", though: it's pretty and well-written, but it's kinda boring and has a kinda crappy hidden track - just a minute of Beck strangling his guitar. Thanks, man! But the songwriting here is exceptional; it's eclectic; and it's packed with all kinds of weird surprises. And Beck's a capable multi-instrumentalist, adding guitars (lead, rhythm, and slide), bass, drums, a wide variety of keyboards, and vocals. \\"Novocain\\" is horrible, but most the rest is stellar.'s right, country-funk.

B000Y44LBG|5.0|What's not to like about American Gangster? Throw in great director Ridley Scott, top actors like Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe, and add the always popular subject of the mafia and you have a classic combination. While I didn't feel it was better than Goodfellas or The Sopranos (Season 1-3 only mind you) it was still an excellent piece of work. I would be surprised if this doesn't go up for some major Oscars.<br /><br />4 and 1/2 out of 5 stars
1594481938|4.0|This is my first Nick Hornby book, and I was pleasantly surprised. Overall, the book is amusing, sensitive, unique, and perceptive, especially when dealing with its main subject matter: suicide.<br /><br />A Long Way Down is the story of four people who find themselves on the roof of a London building, which is also a popular suicide spot, on New Year's Eve: Martin, Maureen, Jess, and J.J. All have vastly different reasons for being there, ranging from marital problems to teenage angst to career disappointments. The four also have nothing in common apart from their desire to commit suicide. Martin is a 40-something washed-up morning show host, haughty and self-important. Maureen is a quiet mouse of a person, a middle-aged woman with no life whatsoever. Jess is an insolent teenager. J.J. is a 30-year-old American musician working as a pizza delivery boy. Each chapter follows the viewpoint of a different character, and we follow the four characters as they talk themselves down from the roof and possibly out of suicide altogether.<br /><br />Hornby does an excellent job with the narrative. I did not find the shifting viewpoints jarring at all, but instead funny and insightful. He has mastered four vastly different voices, even to the extent that Maureen, in her narrative, does not curse, even when she quotes other characters cursing a blue streak. As I read the book, I really thought that the end would make or break it, since ultimately, you are reading to find out whether the group, or part of it, kills themselves or not. I can't say that it was a perfect ending, but I was content with it and it didn't feel contrived or fake, but instead quite realistic.<br /><br />Despite being about suicide, this is an amusing book - I laughed out loud in many places, and really enjoyed the characters playing off each other. I also loved that Hornby didn't just make this a suicide parody or a plot device. He has interesting insights into the idea of suicide and what someone contemplating it might feel and think. This is a quick read, and I definitely recommend it. I, for one, will probably be picking up Hornby's other books soon.d think. This is a quick read, and I definitely recommend it.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This band was much better than I realized during their brief moment in the spotlight.  Shame they melted down due too much fame, cocaine, booze and broads.  The feeble attempt by Axl Rose to rgain the fame today is a faint echo of the original bands greatness.  Sometimes ya just can't go home again...enjoy this retrospective for what it is:  a brief shining moment in rock history.
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrells book reads like a modern day version of the last stand of the 300. When Luttrells squad of four seals are compromised by goatherding taliban in the mountians of Afghanistan what follows is one of the most gut wretching battles in history as four Navy Seals go up agianst hundreds of taliban cutthroats. This book is awesome.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|to me Britney is hit-or-miss, and a big majority of her music misses.  however, to my surprise, this album hits.  it isn't bubblegum pop like the rest of her CDs, it is a dance CD with a techno feel.
0465011020|4.0|This and Google Earth are pretty much your only looks into North Korea.

There's a lot that would be good to understand. This book might help us a bit.
055358894X|5.0|I am trying to decide whether the fact that something about this Lynch novel reminded me of the best of the fabulous and uneven Thieves' World series is only because of the sects and the thieves. I have decided \\"probably\\" and agreed to agree with myself that the resemblance is only in my own head. Still, I had that thought (kind of a sense association) when I was reading The Lies of Locke Lamora-- and definitely in a good way.<br /><br />Locke is one in a long and honorable line of fantasy anti-heroes. Orphaned, talented at all the wrong things, imperfect and endearing and clever. We learn enough about him to make him extremely real. Still, there is enough mystery left under the surface (his mysterious lost love) to make me anxious to read [[ASIN:0553804685 Red Seas Under Red Skies]] once it appears in paperback.<br /><br />The book has some messy moments, and some elements that might have been sewn up more tightly or more perfectly. Still, I enjoyed myself immensely while reading it. I wouldn't change a word.<br /><br />Messy or not, the spirit was somehow just right.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Shooter was a pretty exciting and entertaining movie. It's not the kind of movie that you can take real seriously and judge it by its intelligence-think of it as like a Jason Bourne movie that's making fun of itself a bit. Mark Wahlberg plays this guy whose name is--get this--Bob Lee Swagger. The plotline is basically the same as the Bourne Identity: Bob Lee Swagger--I love saying that name--is framed for trying to assassinate the president (of the United States, no less). The US government's idea is to chase Bob Lee down and kill him; he is the last surviving witness to a sneaky US government conspiracy in Ethiopia. The whole movie, basically, is a failed coverup attempt by the government.    Wahlberg is very effective in portraying this big-shot, gung-ho, stop-at-nothing tough guy who gets to shoot lot of people from long distances and watches-all cool and collected-as pipe bombs blow up all around him, killing basically everyone else but somehow doesn't get him. Michael Pena is excellent as an FBI intern whose importance grows as the movie progresse; Danny Glover is great as a high-ranking officer whose actual behavior is very different from what he claims.    The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the cliche love scene (it's pretty darn stupid, I don't have time to explain it to you), and the fact that many of the actors (including Wahlberg) seem to be mumbling at various scenes for no reason. The story doesn't flow that well at points, but this is a cool movie that's fun to watch that you'll definitely enjoy if you don't take it too seriously.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|Blackout by Britney Spears is a sad little album. Everyone seems to adore this release but almost every track is embarrassing. Her songwriting is childish and mundane, her voice is still lifeless and timid, and whoever produced this album didn't put any thought into it. This is a bad album, don't buy it!
B000002H97|5.0|This review is WAY overdue in coming.  Sorry to all for the delay.    First, a bit of my personal 'tallica' history.  I personally discovered Metallica in 2005 when a friend of mine handed me a CD with 101 Metallica MP3 songs on it (Kill Em through Garage,Inc).  Having not been a fan before, I hungrily listened to these songs and loved what I heard, for the most part.  I have been a hard rock/metal fan, listening to AC/DC, Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Kiss, The Cars, Boston, etc.  I found Metallica to be right up there with the best of these other bands, and I particulary liked the heavy 'riffage' and screaming solos found in many of the songs.  I'm kinda picky about the quality of sound, too, and some songs were clearer in production than others, a discussion for another day.      So, having discovered Metallica \\"all at once\\", maybe my perspective will be valuable to some.  I must say, though, that the Black Album is one of the finest CDs I've ever heard, from a production, musical and rocking standpoint.  Powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics (Wolf and Man notwithstanding), rockin' drumming, heavy riffage and screaming solos galore make this a fantastic listen all the way through.      The first time I heard 'Sandman' I shook my head and thought \\"where have you been all my life?\\".  'Sad but True' was also an instant favorite.  'Wherever I May Roam', 'The Unforgiven' and 'Nothing Else Matters' made also made an immediate positive inpact on me.  Other favs on here are 'The God That Failed', 'My Friend of Misery', 'Through The Never', and 'The Struggle Within'.  The others are good hard rockers but not personally as satisfying as the above mentioned.    I think that Metallica helped their own cause very much by releasing this awesome album.  There is no doubt that people who started listening to Metallica with the Black Album, like myself (sorta kinda anyway), had to go back and buy everything else released before (afterward, too, for me!).  I can't remember mostof what I was doing in 1991, but I know that I missed a lot of great releases, with this one and Ten by P.J. being at the top of the heap.  I'm glad for friends' recommendations and the secondary CD market for helping me play 'catchup' in my musical discoveries.  Don't miss this one!
1416524800|4.0|Deception Point is classic Dan Brown, for better or worse. If you like his other work, you'll love this one.<br /><br />This book kept me hooked from the first page, and it doesn't let you go. In this fast paced book, you are pulled all over the world and fearing for the heroes as they flee from savage killers, after uncovering a government conspiracy. The action never stops, and you never know who will die next.<br /><br />Of the three Brown novels I've read so far, this one probably has the most complex and original story. It keeps you guessing, and it's not a boiler plate plot thats reused and re factored over and over.<br /><br />When you examine all the implications of the situation, it's hard to decide which side you're on. On one side you have what seems to be a good  guy engaged in a bad guy act, and vice versa. The last quarter of the book I became torn as to which side to root for. It's not as cut and dry as it seems.<br /><br />This book lacks a 5 star rating simply because I think the dialog and character development leave a lot to be desired. Maybe it's just my personal preference (I enjoy good character development), but it seems all his characters are rather flat, and cliche. The dialog is often dull and a little too explanatory, as if the author is trying to flex his intellectual muscle. The fact that some of the things stated in the book are untrue, it seems a futile attempt. Also, there were parts of the story that were too improbable, or predictable, and thats where the star went.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book to fans of his work, or fans of the genre. It was really well done, and kept me hooked throughout.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|All I can say is \\"wow\\". With all the bad press she's been getting lately and the abhorrent MTV performance, it is almost unbelievable that it is Britney Spears actually singing on this CD. I don't know how she pulled it off. It's not a CD full of substance, but if you're looking for a fun, dance album with catchy tunes then this CD is for you. It's my new guilty pleasure.
B000URDEB0|5.0|I first learned about Nightwish a few years ago and thought they had  huge potential.  There was something, however, that kept me from really LOVING their music.  After many listenings I realized that it was Tarja's voice that I didn't like.  If you ask someone to imitate an opera singer - what they will do is sing like Tarja.  If you listen to real opera music, you'll know that real opera singing rarely sounds like what Tarja did.  It wasn't \\"bad\\" singing, but it wasn't right for the purpose either.<br /><br />I was shocked when Nightwish publicly fired Tarja in 2005.  Nightwish was a band with a real dilemma:  They had a lead singer who was impossible to work with, but whose voice made up a large part of the sound of the band.  Faced with this situation, most bands would have taken the easy way out and broken up, but not Nightwish.  Nightwish chose the \\"Rock and Roll\\" thing to do and fired Tarja publicly.  I'm sure it was a hard thing to do, but if you care enough about the music you don't let ANYTHING or ANYONE stand your way.<br /><br />Dark Passion Play should be thought of as the first album from the New Nightwish.  The old Nightwish is gone.  People keep wondering how Annette will handle singing the old songs... Maybe they won't play the old songs.  They won't have to if they keep putting out records like DPP.<br /><br />I tend to agree with other reviewer's assessments of each song so there's no need for me to repeat.<br /><br />As great as this album is, I am already looking forward to their NEXT album.  I hope they haven't written the songs yet.  Nightwish is touring the world, playing every night and living together 24 hours a day.  When the tour is over - they will be much stronger as a team.  They'll know each others skills and strengths which should make their next album one of the great masterpieces of Rock and Roll.<br /><br />Dark Passion Play is a fantastic album.  Buy it now.
B0000DBJDM|3.0|The rating given above is a mixed one I'd give four stars to the original cut of the film and two stars to the extended Director's cut. In  1972 Adrian Maben met with Pink Floyd and made the ultimate anti concert film. Live at Pompeii feature the band playing its early experimental music to the empty amphitheatre at Pompeii.    The effect of the ruins together with the music make for an interesting hour of viewing. Both the images and sountrack is haunting. The new Director's Cut extends the show by adding fly on the wall interviews recorded in Paris and some studio material from the recording of Dark Side of the Moon.    In 1971 Pink Floyd were in a transitional phase. While they had a large fan base they had yet to move into the concept music which would begin with the release of Dark Side of the Moon in 1973. This concert shows them playing the earlier music that would later be rarely played for audiences again.    The track selection is impressive. Starting and ending with the massive composition Echoes and includes Careful With That Axe Eugene, A Saucerful of Secrets, One of These Days,Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun, and a howling dog doing the blues piece Mademoiselle Nobs.    The disc, as did the film, will primarily interest fans of the group but it does provide an interesting look back into the days when the now classic rock era was being born.    The disc features an interesting 24 minute interview with director Adrian Maben and some conceptual art and other images. The main problem with the disc is that it does not offer anything but a standard stereo mix.    Worth checking out if you are a fan. But if you are a fan you've already seen it and should stick to the original.
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|A man without memory is a man without past, illusions and hopes; with a broken soul in which the nostalgia means nothing.<br /><br />The little conventional methods which were employed to induce the forgetfulness in our renegade, will arouse to a febrile human chase by all the well known devices; from Moscow to London; from Madrid to Tangier, in order to get some valuable information, to restore his own identity.<br /><br />There will be lot of kinetic actions and hair raising sequences (The realist shoot in the train station, the chase by the roofs and the brutal car chase are of first-order).<br /><br />The presence of Scott Glen and Albert Finney is fabulous. To my view, the trivial lines of this first class actress as Joan Allen never fitted taking into account her stature: On the other hand; Julie Stilles' portrait was extremely reduced, confining her to irrelevant parliaments; she is owner of a driving force character (Do you remember her in Business of strangers, in which she never undeserved honors taking into account she was working with Stockard Channing ? ) . On the other hand, we have to make special kudos for this promising Venezuelan actor, Edgar Ramirez; he looks totally convincing in his cold blooded role; and from here I would like to wish him future roles for the next years to come.<br /><br />Some unfinished narrative holes here and there and a very doubtful fact hard to believe (How could Jason get into the master in command's Office, without having been watched by any security Agent? Give me a break! )  and some questions without answer, a moralistic end are just simple defaults in this moving and absorbing thriller that make us think there will be a new entry according the open final<br /><br />A true and veridical tour de force all the way thorough. Don't miss it.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|\\"Troy\\" was a bit of a fizzer the first time I saw it, actually. With Brad Pitt trying to pull off Achilles, and some pretty sickening, almost Australian accents in some of the actors, it was a fairly mediocre experience all round. This was not helped by my suspicions it would be complete crap with all the big names in it. However, after watching the movie for a second passing, it started to endear itself to me.<br /><br />Brad Pitt was still a bit of a miscast Achilles, and Peter O'Toole an odd choice for Priam, the King of Troy, but the bad guys were very well cast, I thought. Agamemnon and Menalaus were both brilliantly portrayed in all of their warlike savagery. Orlando Bloom seemed more plastic than normal as Paris, second prince of Troy, and the lover of Helen.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cinematography was simply superb, and when the CGI was used to assist, it was of very high quality. The overall visual effects were exception, from the sets used right through to the battle scenes.<br /><br />The special features in this edition are fairly good, and well worth the look themselves. I found them informative and interesting, though unless you are a \\"The Making of...\\" geek like me, you might want to pass on them.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is not the best I have seen, of course, but for a big budget, Hollywood production with the big name stars, it is not too bad at all. I could easily sit through an additional viewing or two and not be spending too much time eating.
0385522401|4.0|a neat phrase on page 120: comedy was an erotic poison. a phrase entering the text after the peregrinations of the narrator on getting his virgins to the marriage bed, with interruptions into the past lawrence sterne might had appreciated--very funny writing. who knew mcewan could be so humourous? and with a deft touch he moves comedy to the erotic, and, with an anecdote of violence in edward's personal history, mcewan marches his story to tragedy.    edward's 'preparation' for the big moment. i couldn't help thinking, while in london had he never thumbed thru the pages of a playboy magazine? and if not pausing to read the articles at least stopping to  read the playboy advisor.    a great choice for a reading group discussion.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Although not a movie I would, under normal circumstances, choose to sit down and watch, \\"The Illusionist\\" was one that I surprisingly enjoyed a hell of a lot. Filmed in sepia to reflect the early 1900's period that the story is set in, the overall feel and aura of the film was hanutingly excellent.<br /><br />The basic plot is that Edward Abrahamovich, (Eisenheim), and the Sophie, Countess von Techen cannot be together due to differences in family ranking. Eisenheim is not in the \\"in crowd\\". He vanishes and years later turns up in Venice, sporting a new name, a new profession and whole lot of cool. With illusions that defy explanation, he causes a stir, especially when he gets up the nose of the Emperor's son, Leopold, who is due to marry the same Countess von Techen from years before. Soon Eisenheim and Sophie are lovers and...well, see the film.<br /><br />Edward Norton plays a very calm and collected, (and quite cool), Eisenheim. Paul Giamatti was a particular surprise, giving a great performance as Leopold's toady, Inspector Uhl. All in all, the movie was very well acted, and all the actors and actresses set this film a cut above average.<br /><br />Although a romance, I thoroughly enjoyed the spectacle that this movie presented. In some ways, it almost drew one into the atmosphere of the film, and you could almost feel the wind of the raven's wings as Eisenheim throws his cloth out over the audience.<br /><br />Setting it in the early 20th century, filming it in sepia, and centering the plot on an illusionist all serve to the make the film a true work of art. Even if you are not a romance movie goer by nature, I would suggest at least giving this one a chance. Both creepy and endearing in feel, it is an intriguing movie.

Her mom is wicked, her sister messed up, her step-dad off in his own little world.  She sees old friends and every single one of them has problems and are all messed up, either on drugs or booze or both.<br /><br />Camille was a great character and I enjoyed her personality and how she handled herself.  Her narration was very well written and fun.  However, the rest of the characters just made this book too too too too unreal.<br /><br />The plot was good, the mystery of who-done-it kept me guessing, the writing was good.  The characters just didn't help this story and bogged it down.  I do, however, think Gillian Flynn holds much promise and will check out future books of hers.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Pam
B000001DV2|3.0|ADRENALIZE, is, in many ways, not only the end of an era for Def Leppard, but for hair/pop metal as well.  Between 1983, when PYROMANIA came out, and this album came out (in 1992), the band had endured tragedy and continual setbacks.  Drummer Rick Allen lost an arm in a car accident, and had to learn how to play drums all over again.  Steve Clarke drifted in and out of alcoholism, and went thru several rehab periods.     They tried recording the followup to HYSTERIA, but ultimately the project took forever to get off the ground due to Clarke's addiction problems.  Eventually, Clarke had a six month leave of absence in 1990, and was found dead by his girlfriend in 1991.  The band, rather than finding a replacement, decided to carry on as a quartet and finish the album.  Not only that, their producer for PYROMANIA and HYSTERIA, Mutt Lange (Shaniah Twain's husband), jumped ship, producing Bryan Adam's rather dismal WAKING UP THE NEIGHBORS.     It helps to understand this history before you start listening to the album itself.  In nearly a decade, Def Leppard only managed to produce three albums, mostly due to the aforementioned circumstances.  And of these three albums, ADRENALIZE is easily the weakest.      For starts, the song writing has some issues.  The best songs are those co-written with Steve Clarke, but without his talent, the whole album gets dragged down.  It's not that the band really departs from their signature sound established on PYRO and HYSTERIA.  All the bombastic hair metal that the 1980s junkies loved was here.  Def Leppard crafed well polished hair metal that featured infectious melodies, panaromic scope, and an overall sense of contagious fun (something that was very lacking in 1992 in contemporary rock).  Still, parts of the album fill stiff, and Phil Collens is simply no Steve Clark (Phil had to play the guitar parts set aside for Steve, as well as play his own parts by overdubbing).  Also, some of the tracks are borderline ridiculous, especially the big single \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", which is a teenager telling his father he won't take out the trash or tidy his room, and imploring his friends \\"let's get the rock out of here.\\"  Lyrically puerile, and I confess it's rather hard to picture Joe Elliot, at the time over thirty, singing such adolescent lines.  Just bad.    For a Def Leppard album, ADRENALIZE is rather ballad heavy.  Still, \\"Tonight\\" is one of their best all time songs.  \\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad\\" sounds like a rewrite, if not musically then lyrically, of the Bad Company song \\"If You Needed Somebody\\", which came out in 1990 just before this came out, and contemporary with the ADRENALZIE album.  If the Bad Company track had any influence, I'm not sure, but they're both unrequited love and extremely similar.    The record itself, when it came out, sounded totally out of place from what was being bought by the public and played on radio stations.  Grunge had taken over by this point, and Def Leppard, like Van Halen, was one of the few bands that managed to see their way through this difficult time for hair/pop metal bands of their ilk.  What worked for PYRO and HYSTERIA, by the time this record came out, feels anachronistic and rather out of place in 1992.  But that leads us to the sales statistics for this record.    Given the music industry's environment at that time, an era dominated by grunge and the \\"Seattle sound\\", amazingly ADRENALIZE went to number one both in the UK and America for five weeks straight.  This would be the last hair-metal album that would go triple platinum and really reach such a wide-spread audience.  Perhaps due to the lack of output by the band (only two records in nine years), the purchasing public rewarded the band for their efforts by buying the album in droves.  This really was the last adrenaline rush that Hair/Pop metal would see before it was killed off by grunge.    Sadly, ADRENALIZE, though financially successful, sounds like a pale imitation of the band's former glories, but the imitation was good enough to satisfy a lot of the fan base.  The album does have some of Leppard's best songs (especially \\"Tonight\\"), but it's easily the most dispensable of the Decade Trilogy.
B000BC8TBE|5.0|An astonishing display of vocal range and artistic perfection,no one can even come close.The singing is obviously superb but the dual disc technology is amazing especially for audio and videophiles. If you love mariah or simply love to have a quality holliday cd,get this version..your expensive multichannel hometheater system will thank you.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Who would think we'd have a new Pumpkins album in 2007, seven years after the band had, well, disbanded.  Of course, the world knew Corgan would be reforming the band when he took out the full page adverstisement in the Chicago Tribune back in 2005, the same day his solo album TheFutureEmbrace, came out.  That was the first time the public was aware of Corgan's intention to reform the band.    Apparently, it was also the first time the actual band members themselves had heard of it.  According to James Iha, he hadn't spoken to Corgan in years, and D'arcy likewise was MIA.  When it came to actually record the album, only Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin, the Pumpkins drug-addict drummer (at least he was a druggy back in the 1990s), were on board.    So what does this all mean to the band's image and the public'c perception of the album?  Note, I'm not talking about the actual music on ZIETGIEST, which is actually quite good.    Cynics felt Corgan was trying to cash in on the Pumpkins' name, since no one has really paid that much attention to his solo efforts, either with his one-off band Zwan, or his record FUTUREEMBRACE.  People tend to dismiss ZIETGIEST out of hand, simply because it only features half the original band.  Both cases (though there may be some truth to the first charge), are not really valid, or if they are valid, don't really effect one way or the other how the music actually sounds, or diminishes the Pumpkins' legacy in the least.    Now, some bands can survive personnel changes.  Some can't.  The Doors couldn't survive Jim Morrison's death, even though they they have toured in recent years under the moniker Doors of the 21st Century, till Densmore sued Manzarek and Krieger, an so changed the name to \\"Riders on the Storm,\\" still a Doors derivative.  I'm a huge Doors fan, but didn't even bother with this distraction.  Then we have Led Zeppelin, who, after John Bonham died in 1980 after choking on his own vomit due to drunkenness, wisely called it quits.  R.E.M., perhaps unwisely, decided to remain an active recording unit after the departure of drummer Bill Berry in 1997.  Then we have The Who, who not only recorded two albums after Kieth Moon's death in 1978 (they would not record a studio album for well over twenty years following these two panned records), but continued to tour and even record a new album after John Entwhistle's death in 2002, leaving only half the band.    What does all this mean to The Smashing Pumpkins?  Well, a lot actually.  It proves when it comes to personnel changes, you must look at each band individually.  To take one aforementioned example, Zeppelin quit because the band's success relied totally on all four members.  You could probably argue the same with R.E.M.  With the Pumpkins, however, that's never really been the case.  Sure, D'arcy and James helped contribute, but they are also there to service as much a part of the image of the band as for what they brought to the sound.  And here's why.     The Pumpkins have always been about Corgan, almost to the point where you could argue that of all the major rock bands to emerge in the 1980s and 1990s, the Pumpkins sound the most like a backing vehicle for Corgan's music.  Most of the Pumpkin's songwriting is credited to Corgan.  There's been allegations that SIAMASE DREAM was almost entirely recorded by Corgan himself, as he was not happy with the band's playing.  As it's always been about Billy anyway, though I do miss Iha and D'arcy, their absence doesn't mean this isn't a Pumpkins record.  That allegation would have a lot more weight of D'arcy, James, and Jimmy all recorded an album without Corgan.    As far as Corgan trying to cash in on the Pumpkin's name, I have more respect for him than that.  While I do think it's true he is trying to get back into the forefront of rock audiences, I think it's more about trying to get back into the mainstream than to do with pure money.  He should be set for life anyway, but who the hell knows with celebrity finances.    All that said, what about the actual music itself?  Well, thematically, it's something of a departure from the band's previous subject matter.  Corgan said the album was largely about \\"love, loss, and the government\\", and largely in that order.      The music itself is largely in the vein of their previous album MACHINA, only without the confusing-as-hell storyline (if it even does have a real plot to it, which I doubt).  The music is hard driving, with plenty of guitar solos, etc, and phenomenal drumming by Chamberlin.  For those looking for the next MELLON COLLIE, don't bother.  ZIETGEIST doesn't have the eclectic songwriting that made MC so fun to listen too, nor does the band branch out in so many different territories as they did on MC.      Chamberlin has said that was intentional - they wanted to keep the sound of the album more basic, and not really get far out into the whole artsey-fartsey scene.  \\"The mindset of the record was to put our best foot forward and not get too artsy. We wanted to try to create a body of work that was concentrated enough to bring back a fan base and invigorate a new fan base. We kept it pretty close to the chest, and we didn't branch out too deep into art zone while we were writing the record.\\"  It's sad, really, because it was fun seeing how far out the Pumpkins could really get out back in the mid 1990s under Corgan's leadership.    The band has never been really overtly political, and this is the first really political record Corgan's ever made.  Actually, this political awareness gives critics a lot better ammunition against Corgan than the whole idea he's trying to \\"cash in\\".  It's clear from the whole affair that Corgan is using ZIETGIEST as a bid to become culturally relevant again in an era where the media and the public really haven't been following him for the last several years.      As there's been a lot of political commentary in rock and roll, from Greenday's rock opera AMERICAN IDIOTto the soon-to-be very dated Neil Young effort LIVING WITH WAR, you could make the argument Corgan was using politics to make himself a voice that people listen too again.  Even the coverart, which reminds one of the famous ending of the 1969 film PLANET OF THE APES, feels rather reactionary.  To Corgan's effort, the politics doesn't sound forced, and he does incorporate his political ideoligies pretty well into the Pumpkin's image, but it still feels rather odd, given how unpolitical the band has been for the majority of its lifespan.    Overall, a good record, and sounds, minus the politics, a natural progression from ADORE, MACHINA, and the never commercially released (but widely distributed) MACHINA II.  Some good rock songs too.    CHART POSITION:  Album: US #2, UK#1  \\"Tarantula: #2  \\"Doomsday Clock\\": 81  \\"That's the Way (My Love Is): #23    The following B-sides have been released: Death from Above (4:06), Steller (6:22), Zeitgeist (2:49), and Ma Belle (4:08).

B00005YU1O|4.0|Waking, I mean?<br /><br />This spectacular animation leaves me with two conflicting impressions. The first is that it's among the most innovative animations I've ever seen. The technique looks like non-photorealistic renderings of actual films, as was also done in \\"A Scanner Darkly.\\" The graphic style works well and consistently, but it's the background objects that give this film its dreamlike quality: the feeling that nothing is solid, nothing can be trusted. Sofas don't sit stolidly in the living room. Instead, they bob like corks in a creek, even with someone sitting on them. A driveway doesn't sit quietly where it's told; it encroaches on the lawn, then retreats, while nervous shrubs patrol the narrow perimeters of their assigned places. Only the people seem solid and fixed.<br /><br />At least, until they talk. Internally, they wobble hollowly, a psychic echo of the insubstantial world around them. Only the protagonist seems real, a seeker for something he can't even name.<br /><br />Although it appears to present philosophical depth, the depth is only a veneer of breathless, rambling exposition. What is real? What is a dream? How can you tell? It reminds me of sophomore year, but without the alcohol.<br /><br />That takes nothing away from its visual importance. Even if the actual words spoken as philosophical diatribes don't amount to much, the protagonist's trek through a mundane but unstable urban landscape carries an emotional truth. It's the sense of only oneself as real, in a world so unreliable that even stone can't be trusted to be solid.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000VSBX34|5.0|OK, I'm sure there will be 100's of reviews of the film itself, so I'll just skip to the tech review of the disc:    Video:    Full marks to the restoration team; as this is the best you're ever going to see this colourful 1965 classic.  Nearly every scratch and dirt speck is gone and the colours look fantastic on DVD.    Sound:     A full 5.1 DTS remix (not much help if you still only have Dolby Digital). Very similar to the Anthology/Love mixes of their mid 60's stuff; not many flashy rear effects (just a bit of reverb to fill it out) but for the modernists - the drums are in the centre and the new mix is a beefy one.    Extras:    A Missing Scene: Just to save you the same disappointment I had - THIS SCENE IS STILL MISSING! However, we do get Wendy Richard, Richard Lester and other insiders; giving an in-depth rundown on the lost SAM AHAB scene.     The Beatles in Help!: A great documentary featuring period interviews of the Beatles with lots of behind the scenes footage interlaced with some snippets of outtakes and 8mm home movies. Very informative. Richard Lester details some of the problems of filming in the mists of Beatlemania (there's even footage of mass crowds in the Swiss Alps!). Neil Aspinell also appears; confirming the well worn stories the Beatles recreational drug use on set.     The Restoration of Help! - An in-depth look at the restoration process.    Memories of Help! - More focused on the crews experiences making the film than the 30-minute documentary. Contains behind the scenes and home movie footage.    Plus two 2 US trailers, a spanish one (with no dubbed Beatles - sadly) and hidden Radio promos.
B000MV9026|1.0|It's not happy.  You can't see their feet.  The ENTERTAINMENT value was LEFT on the editing room floor to preach to everyone about the evil threat MAN posses!  I am so tired of Hollywood thinking they need to educate me.  I can find better sources of ecological education nearly anywhere else.  I don't want to be preached to by a cartoon!    I cannot recommend this movie to anyone but Al Gore.  He probably laughed through the whole thing.
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|Wish I'd saved my money.  It was so disappointing to listen to wonderful guest singers married up with inappropriate songs.  This was strictly a money-making proposition.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|For those that have watched \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", then, you shall have a good idea of what to expect for this movie.  Yes, the story is cliche.  Diane's character is a young, smart and attractive divorcee and a teacher in a preschool.  She happens to be from a tight and loving family that finds all ways to get her to be fallen in love again.  As quoted in the movie, her sister remarked that it's been 9 months!  Is that really a long time to grieve over a marriage that doesn't work out?  Anyway, as story would have it, the sister, played by Elizabeth Perkins from \\"Big\\", enlists her in an Internet dating website and Diane's character meets a few oddballs which draws a few laughs.  However, the crucial \\"mis-dates\\" would be between her and John Cusack's character who himself is coming to term with his own break-up by watching Dr Zhivago reruns over and over again.  However, there is a hiccup in the form of Delmot Mulroney's character.  Would they come together in the end?  I have to say that this movie is patchy at best.  Outstanding cast around such as Christopher Plummer in his rare light-hearted role, as Diane's character's father and even Stokard Channing from West Wing.  An easy movie for a lazy day.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Brilliant nature photography with a series of vivid scenes, warning though that the eat or be eaten scenes will be hard to swallow for some. recommended without reservation
0765348276|5.0|One of the downsides to getting older is that it is easy to get caught up in a past that probably never existed.  The music was better then.  The television was better then.  The books were most certainly better then.  I have read very little \\"new\\" science fiction because there are hundreds of titles and it is hard to find good science fiction among all the mediocre novels.  Then I encountered \\"Old Man's War.\\"<br /><br />I credit my son Corwin with finding this one for me.  I guess his recommendation is payback for getting him interested in Robert A. Heinlein.  He told me that I really should read this book.  Now that I have finished it, I know why he made that recommendation.<br /><br />First, let me tell you that this book has faint echoes of \\"Starship Troopers,\\" but it is not that book.  Second, let me tell you that John Scalzi writes in a manner similar to Robert A. Heinlein, but he is different from Heinlein and while I consider Heinlein influential in Scalzi's plot and style, Scalzi is different from Heinlein.  Now that I have just about written the summary of my review up front, let me tell you about this wonderful novel.<br /><br />In the future, mankind will be divided into two groups.  There will be those who continue to live on our home planet.  These people will live there and grow old there, but many of them will not die there, for in old age there can be a new life in the Colonial Defense Force (CDF), protecting human colonies from numerous alien races seeking to take planets for their own.  How can someone in their 70's fight wars?  I must leave that question for a reader to discover, or an inconsiderate reviewer to reveal.  I will reveal that geriatric humans will discover a new life among the stars with abilities unimaginable to their former friends and relative on earth.<br /><br />One thing that is a given in the immensity of space:  the motivation of other species will be different from our own just at least as often as the motivation is the same.  Our first mistake will always be to believe that other species have the same desires and think the same way we do.  The people that think that way are nearly always the first to die.  When those people are not the first to die, they are the first to be killed by the people who have to clean up their messes, if the people who clean up their messes get the chance.<br /><br />The Colonial Defense Force tries hard not to make assumptions about the motivation of other races.  Their only mission is to protect human life as humans attempt to expand into habitable planets throughout the galaxy.  Rarely does the CDF try to negotiate with alien species, because most alien species have little they want from us, unless they find us to be a tasty morsel for their dinner table.<br /><br />John Perry is one of those people who have left their lives on earth behind for the mysteries of space.  We follow John as he becomes more than human and then trains to become a part of the CDF.  John becomes a battle-hardened veteran of the CDF and we are able to get a great perspective on John's life from the details that he provides.<br /><br />I will provide one more word about Heinlein.  The ending of this book was so much like many of Heinlein's endings that I just got all nostalgic and teary-eyed.  Dang but Scalzi nailed the ending.  If you liked the endings in Heinlein books like \\"The Door into Summer,\\" you are going to love this one.<br /><br />There are many ways to do science fiction wrong, and few of doing science fiction right.  Scalzi did such a wonderful job that I have to give this book five stars.  The dialogue is realistic, full of the cheesy things that real people say to each other, not to mention full of lovely expletives that make you feel as though you are in military basic training.  One of the things about military anywhere is the wisecracks you make to get through the always difficult proposition of being in a continually stressful environment.  As in a real war, thebook initially revels in deep emotional content, which Scalzi mutes as he places the protagonist in situations where emotion becomes a liability.  I also loved the modifications that made the CDF soldiers (but you'll have to discover those for yourself).<br /><br />\\"Old Man's War\\" has made quite an impression on the world of science fiction and on me.  It was nominated for a Hugo for Best Novel.  Looking at the reviews for this novel thus far, approximately 90% of the reviews are four or five star reviews.  The reason for this adulation is simple.  John Scalzi has written an original modern science fiction story using a classic style.  Many modern science fiction writers get caught up in motivations and psychology or they have some sort of message or theme and they fail to remember that the most important part of science fiction for most readers, myself included, is to be entertained.  This book is highly entertaining, and I look forward to future books from John Scalzi.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!utes as he places the protagonist in situations where emotion becomes a liability.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD it sounded all the same and did not inspire me as much as previous work from them. The more I listen to it the more I love this band. It sounds fantastic in my car and the bass really gets a good thump at high sound levels. Everything is top notch and I can't wait for them to come around or produce another CD. The added pictures and lyrics is a nice touch. Not many bands now put this much effort or talent into what they do.
B000WSHF4E|5.0|I enjoyed this film so much I actually watched it twice on the big screen! Something I have not done in a very long time. The acting, costumes, screenplay, cinematography and soundtrack are all fantastic! And, since this magnificent film is based on a true story it makes it all the more gripping!<br /><br />To all those who feel this film is in some way anti-Catholic, portraying historical truth does not make the Elizabeth: The Golden Age, prejudiced. The Inquisition, Spanish, and otherwise, lasted for SEVERAL CENTURIES! All those nice people we watched in this movie would have been at best imprisoned, and at worst, put to death because of the Roman Catholic Church & their allies in the Spanish government had the armada succeeded in its mission.<br /><br />If the Spanish Armada had been successful the United States would probably not exist! England would of ended up a Spanish colony like the Netherlands eventually did! And all of history would have been radically changed for the worse. At least in England they had the Magna Charter! Spain's legal system, on-the-other-hand, was an absolute dictatorship. A legacy that did not end until 1975 with the death of  the dictator Franco!!<br /><br />Quite simply, being Protestant made you a member of a minority religion in Queen Elizabeth's day! Thankfully, in most parts of the world we have now grown-up and accept minority religions as a fact of life. But during Elizabeth's reign you were literally putting your life on the line. Something this brilliant film makes crystal clear, regardless if Queen Elizabeth was no saint!
B000000W5P|5.0|I'll just second what all these other rave reviews are telling you.  \\"Some Girls\\" is a lot of fun, full of humor (I love Far Away Eyes) and great music.  This release is easily as good as Beggars, Bleed, Sticky, and Exile.  I was skeptical about buying it but shouldn't have been.  It's among their 5 top releases and I should know, I own every single release from \\"England's Newest Hit Makers\\" up to \\"Tattoo You\\" and then a couple of the live releases and \\"Bigger Bang\\".  Great stuff!  Eat it up!
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I wish the cd's would have been wrapped in plastic wrap.  For being new, on the good side I haven't had any problems viewing.
B00000IOSU|3.0|This live recording is not as good as the studio version. It is nice to get a feel of the crowd but the quality of the recording is not there.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|I keep seeing all these reviews saying how this was the perfect end to the trilogy; I have to disagree.  The third movie totally disregarded the story of the first two movies, but it seems no one else realizes it.    In the first two movies (not to mention the books), the Bourne character had retrograde amnesia after being shot on the boat (first movie); he always knew who and what he was up until that point.  He only didnt know who he was later because he was shot, left in the water, and got amnesia.  In the third movie, they completely disregarded this and changed the whole story into an evil U.S. Government brainwashing story (stupid).  On that note, I have to disagree that it is the perfect end to the trilogy; I think it actually contradicts the first two movies and ruins the \\"trilogy\\".   As far as a stand alone movie; it's still pretty good.  Even though I dont like they changed the entire plot, or how they changed it (the whole U.S. Government is evil BS), I still enjoyed it.  If they ever put it out on blu-ray, i'll buy it.      UPDATE: Okay, seeing all the \\"unhelpful\\" votes to my review of the movie and it's got me wondering why?  I said the movie was good, but I also said was bad in a \\"trilogy\\" sense as it changed the whole premise behind Jason/David's loss of memory.  So what exactly is there to disagree with?  That I said the movie was good?  No, I think not; if one didnt like the movie they wouldnt be here reading and answering the reviews.  So does someone disagree they changed the whole plot concerning his memory loss, which was firmly and definately established as being amnesia from being shot and left to drown in the first movie (and books)?  No, you cant disagree to that; because, as I mentioned, it was previously established.  So whats left to be so disagreeable about then?  Probably the fact that I said it was stupid they took a good plot and at the last moment turned it into a stupid U.S. Government is evil story.  It does seem the same people who believe all that anti-U.S. philosophy are the same people who will vote critically of something that is in all respects true because they dont like the views of the person telling those truths.  So, click unhelpful all you like; it still doesnt change the fact they \\"did\\" change the plot.  Personally, I kinda find it insulting to the viewing audience they would take this great franchise's story and just change it out of the blue.  All in all, I still stand by my four stars for the movie, none the less; rather then all the lower three star rating reviews on here that were clicked \\"helpful\\" on because they didnt say the new anti-U.S. Government story was stupid.  Go figure.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|47 million people are without health insurance. The United States is ranked just above many third world nations in terms of its overall health care. The average life expectancy in the U.S. is three years less than in Canada. Moore rattles off some interesting statistics about the business of health care. He focuses, however, on individuals who have health care with conditions that are denied routine treatment because they suddenly become \\"experimental\\" or retroactively deny benefits that have been approved because a health insurnace company has found a loop hole. Moore's film has its own editorial point of view or slant (how could it not?) whether or not you agree with him will largely depend upon your experience with health care in this country and the impact the film makes on you.<br /><br />I particularly found touching the vingette on the woman who's husband was denied a bone marrow transplant because it was \\"experimental\\". The man's brother was a match and it looked good that he would have a chance. He died after his last chance at treatment was denied.<br /><br />There is also a story about a woman who had a daughter denied treatment because she was taken to an ER that didn't take their health insurance. While that is unusual, it documents the corporate issues that can contribute to the death of a child.<br /><br />While socialized medicine may not be the key here (there are plenty of complaints about waiting lists for treatment, limits on doctors, etc.), we need to have a way to untie coverage from employment and allow patients to receive reliable, good coverage from haalth insurance companies. More importantly, though, we need to have ethical reviews of practices to may sure this fiasco doesn't occur again for patients presented in the film.<br /><br />More of an editorial than a documentary, Michael Moore's \\"Sicko\\" although far from perfect, provides an education on the problems within the health care system in the United States. Politics always play a part in any discussion of health care and this one is no different. There are those who disagree with Moore that our health care system is broken and just as many that suggest we could take a lesson from other nations about how the to effectively treat others with universal health care.<br /><br />The film comes with a number of special features including \\"Sicko Goes to Washington\\" where Moore went to nation's capitol to see if the Rep.

1595141715|4.0|The premise is intriguing:  a boy listens to tapes sent to him by a girl who committed suicide a couple of weeks ago.  And I'll admit, I stayed up late to finish the final third because I was that curious about how it would turn out.  I can imagine teens - male and female - enjoying the twists and turns.    But.  This doesn't rise to my highest tier of young adult literature.  Although it is at times fascinating, there are several pieces that Mr. Asher doesn't work out to my satisfaction.  The biggest problem is that it is just too easy to buy Hannah's taped versions of events and blame others for her suicide.  I also didn't quite grasp Clay's attraction to Hannah or his reaction to her recorded remarks.  The drama felt forced. For developing teen readers, the many characters would make this a tough read, while accomplished readers would probably find greater satisfaction in other thrillers.    So while I enjoyed the book, I won't recommend it unequivocally.

6304076517|2.0|I respect Gielgud for his magnificent stage and film career, I love Shakespeare, and have tried to see as many versions of the plays as I can that have been made into films.  So I gave this a try, since as far as I can tell, it is the only version of The Tempest that has been brought to film.  Like another reviewer here who gave this one star, I'm as willing as the next guy to keep an open mind for avant-gard productions, modernist approaches, and creative staging of a play.  But Prospero's Books is just ridiculous, and nearly unbearable.  It comes across as a queer patchwork of ballet, theater and musical performed in an aquatic nudist colony.  No one but Gielgud speaks more than a very few lines, and it is nearly impossible to follow the progression of the acts and scenes.  The only redeeming features are that this version does use the play's actual text, and you get to listen to a genius like Gielgud deliver most of it.  Better get a recorded version of him reading the play and skip this one.
B000QUEQBI|5.0|When I bought my Toshiba A20 I picked a few movies to start out with.  Having personal sniper training, I thought this would be interesting, so I bought it with the player. The sniping is dead nuts on.<br /><br />One of the main themes is there are two governments - the one we all elected and the back room cigarette smoke filled ambiance that really controls what happens in the USA.  The plot twists are numerous and one unknown actor does his part with grace and dignity.  That \\"curious\\" part of the human beign comes out to show that the patsy was really setup, but the teaching of the art of sniping comes into play to bring the bad guys down.<br /><br />To give you an idea of how powerful this film was I bought it with one staring a favorite actor, Morgan Freeman, and 3 of 3 people who watched The Shooter felt it was better than Morgan's showing.  I already expected Morgan's film to be better, but the shooter was just too edge of the seat to let me down.<br /><br />For anyone entering the HD-DVD market, I'd highly recommend \\"the shooter\\" and any X-Files fans will immediately watch it twice.<br /><br />Both the Morgan Freeman and The Shooter were exceptional HD-DVD films.  I've quit buying DVDs now because of the picture quality on my home theater.  This ranks a 10/10.
0440419514|5.0|His Dark Materials (as the series is called in the UK)  is ostensibly for children, but it incorporates such topics as quantum states, parallel universes, the political nature of religious intitutions, and the nature of the soul. All three of the titles in the series are fascinating and a great read. I highly recommend the series to readers of all ages.
0525950079|5.0|Ken Follett brings to life another set of contrasting characters in this continuation of the saga of Kingsbridge Priory. Set some 300 years after The Pillars of the Earth we have the descendants of that book fighting the same Religious / political battles, most of which are fought with wits and deviance. Pillars was my favorite all time book and this is its equal, I could not have thought it possible, the only disappointment is when you finish and realise Ken Follett most probably won't write a third.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|I don't know how to fix the star rating for this movie, but with the help of Amazon Unbox personnel, I was finally able to download this movie. Simply because of the DRM restrictions on the product, I need to knock one star of the rating of this otherwise fine movie. I thus rate it 4 stars as opposed to 5.<br />I love Westerns that are well made, and this one is well made. It has all the famous actors from the era in which it ws filmed and tells a great story.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I was so giddy when I saw this on the shelf at the store.  I remember when it was first released.  It was before TV on DVD was a big thing.  I thought $89.99 was so much to pay for it.  Then the box set was discontinued  & sold on the internet for nearly $200.00.  I was so bummed I didn't get it.  I just kept waiting & hoping they would release it again and here it is.  One of the best shows of all time.  If anyone watches this show and doesn't relate to someone on it, then they aren't being honest with themselves.  This show is timeless.

B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|I like movies that challenge my intellect and have me ask: `What if?'    Most of us have been to magic shows, palm readers, and / or psychics. We probably went for fun, not really expecting to see a miracle or see into our future. Few of us will take a palm reader or a psychic seriously. There is a cartoon I once saw of a psychic opening shop and advertising in big letters on the shop's front window, `Opening day: See your future. Only $20.' One week later, the big letters on the window said, `See your future. Only $10.' Two weeks later, the letters now formed the following combination of words: `See your future. Only $2.' On the third week, the shop was dark, with the letters on its front window now saying, `Bankrupt.' Obviously this psychic could not see the future.    But what if, out of the millions of psychics, palm readers, and magicians out there a few are for real? What if some of us could actually take a glimpse of the future, or achieve some amazing feat? Are all magic tricks just that, tricks? Or do some magicians practice real magic, like Harry Potter for example?    This movie is about just such a man, gifted to see two minutes into his own future, but days ahead when it comes to his loved one.     Terrorists have planted an Atomic bomb somewhere on American soil, and the FBI seeks Cris Johnson (played by Nicolas Cage), to help them see into the future and try to tell them the location of the bomb. However, Johnson refuses to cooperate, since he can only see two minutes ahead of his own future only, and thus feels he will be unable to help them. Wrongly accused of trying to kill a man at a casino, and videotaped holding a gun, he becomes sort of a fugitive. With his ability to see two minutes into his own future, he is able to evade capture, since he knows ahead of time his captors' position and intentions. To complicate things further, the bad guys are also trying to kill Johnson, fearing that he might actually have the ability to see into the future and thus know ahead of time the location of the bomb.    This is really a roller-coaster of a thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat. There are many twists in the movie that will keep you guessing at what will happen next. `Next' is what's it all about.     Next time you go to a magic show, or visit a palm reader or psychic, just wonder at the possibility that you may have stumbled on the odd-man out. And just maybe, you'll have a glimpse of your future. Nothing is impossible!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I didn't see this at the theater cause I'd heard there was a \\"torture\\" scene in it and I don't like those kind of movies, but I later watched it on DVD on the recommendation of friends.  But I must say, this movie is very relevant to what's going on in the world today, and what our future could be like if we don't do something about it!  The parallels are truly eerie...
B00005JPFH|4.0|Peter Parker a.k.a.

Peter's bestfriend Harry (James Franco) becomes a new Goblin to get revenge on Peter while our hero persues the Sandman to get revenge. Later, a black alien symbiote from another world attaches itself to Spider-Man's costume making it black and with more advanced powers then ever for he must fight with Sandman but the costume somehow changes both Spider-Man and Peter's personality especially with him having a possible relationship with the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) making M.J. jealous. New photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) becomes Peter's rival and wants him to be fired so he can be the best photographer as later Brock will be absorbed by the black costume to become the fanged alien creature named Venom, only Spider-Man must the madness from within him and stop the madness going on.<br /><br />A weak but entertaining entry of the Spider-Man cinematic saga is not as great as the second movie or as good as the first movie but does have some good and bad points. The bad points is that it has a complex storyline that goes over some of the audience's head especially using three villains instead of one and a goofy moment where Peter starts to be like Jim Carrey's The Mask at the jazz-bar which seem to be out of place,  the villains weren't deep or developed enough like the last two ones. But there are good points like some the returning cast like J.K. Simmons and Rosemary Harris back especially a couple of cameos by Stan Lee, William Defoe, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell and there's some of Sam Raimi's trademark direction like in some of his films with stunning special effects even on Venom and good action sequences.

1401207928|4.0|I watched the movie before i read the comic book, and that makes me wonder whether i would have felt the same, had i read it first. Though it is a masterpiece, both in the art work, the plot, the dialogs, and the way the story is knitted together, the ending in the comic book seemed to me as icomplete, something that the directors of the V movie \\"corrected\\" in a way, with an explosive, cathartic ending. It is nonetheless a gem on my book shelf, and a reminder that if we the people take no action, sooner than later we will be living in a world as depicted by Moore.
B000HF2NF8|5.0|Remember, remember the fifth of November,  Gunpowder, treason, and plot,  I know of no reason why the gunpowder treason  Should ever be forgot.  Guy Fawkes, Guy Fawkes, 't was his intent  To blow up the King and Parliament.  Three score barrels of powder below,  Poor old England to overthrow;  By God's providence he was catch'd  With a dark lantern and burning match.  Holloa boys, holloa boys, make the bells ring.  Holloa boys, holloa boys, God save the King!    V FOR VENDETTA ROCKS!!!!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|After months-long search, i finally found the movie and watched it.    I still can't name that feeling it produced in me and it was the best i got out of this movie. I don't even know how to describe it: like when you are scared and crouched on a dark cold corner and this feeling comes to straighten you up and shine warmth through you as you stand your height.     It definitely makes you want to go out there and Do something about the world situation that is unfolding before our eyes, just like is depicted in this movie: surveillance, the creation of an enemy and virus outbreaks by the government in order to control the populace through fear, the manipulation of truth, and the sleepiness of the masses... then V comes!      One scene that really stood out for me: When the inspector asks V (from memory) \\"Why did it take you so long?\\" and V replies, \\"I was waiting for you\\". A man with conscience to come along, who will be able to See the situation objectively. A sleeping person who is willing to awake for the sake of truth.     Excellent movie! Excellent soundtrack too! Very pertinent to this day and time.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I have to say that V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies of all time.     With the 5th November tomorrow and thousands of people in England will be lighting their bonfires and celebrating Guy Fawkes day I think that after watching the bonfire and eating toffee apples everyone should settle down  and watch this movie.     It is a powerful and moving story, and packs a powerful punch to the establishment who should be quaking in their boots at the prospect of V for Vendetta becoming a cult movie similar to the Matrix trilogy. For make no mistake, it was not by accident that you never saw this in your movie theatres and if you did it only played for one day and if you blinked you missed it. They DO NOT want this movie going into the mainstream.....Why?.........Watch the movie and become enlightened.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|A previous reviewer noted that Britney's voice on these tracks is almost unrecognizable. It's terrible sounding. I don't think it's only due to the vocoders and frequency modulation. Must be extreme vocal strain or something like that. Also noted in another review is that the production is amazing on this album. It's not, however, anywhere near the pop music category anymore. The backing tracks are almost pure electrofunk, closer to something by Andreas Bolz (Bolz Bolz aka Funk Taxi, owner of World Electric music label)than to timberland. I would definitely purchase an instrumental version of this album if they release it. Her lyrics and voice should be avoided. However, a lot of people don't buy pop music for the lyrics; i'm sure it will sell a lot of records.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Watching this movie at the theater was a great experience, I couldn't believe that such a powerful message was being sent to the big public! We're experiencing it right now, people don't want war and governments goes to war, people don't want to be deceived and propaganda is spread to the four winds through the media networks, all the time.    V is not the usual pre-packed hero that, too much often, back ups our fears,  wishful thinking and psychological weaknesses; he's actually the voice of all the sober citizens who know, that there are just too many lies around in the World today.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I just purchased this movie on 11/1 and I was completely blown away. I grew up on Spider-Man and have been a fan of the films, although I thought the second one was a little weak. I had read the reviews of the film when it was first released and had elected to wait until it came out on DVD to see it. Now I wish I had seen this epic on the big screen. This movie is a none stop action packed roller coaster ride. I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but let me just say this is the best of the three films so far. It will be really interesting to see how they follow this one up. Topher Grace is excellent as Venom and the special effects for Sandman were simply amazing. My only critism is Kirsten Dunst, I wish they could have cast someone better looking to play Mary Jane.

B000002LRX|5.0|I recently picked this amazing album up again after over twelve years, and was once again just as infatuated with this album as I was when I first heard it. It really is difficult to express how far ahead of their time this band really was, and how anti-establishment this album was. After winning a grammy and becoming a household name, Mike Patton and co. release a completely bizarre, surrealistic, anti-commerical album that must have made record company execs pull their hair out. Whether intentional or not, this album must have seemed like a big middle finger to people who expected this to be popular. Judging from Mr. Patton's subsequent work (Mr. Bungle, Fantomas), I can only assume that FNM knew exactly what they were doing.<br /><br />This album plays like an auditory David Lynch-esque journey through a nightmarish post-modern, absurdist American landscape. Crushing near-death metal riffs from oddball guitarist Jim Martin collide sideways into Mike Patton's powerful and melodic vocals, throbbing bass lines and odd sampling and eerie piano and keyboard effects. Lyrically this album reflects Mike Patton's near Da Da-like affectation for the surreal and absurd aspects of life in modern society, as well as being rather dark and anxiety provoking at times. One of the few completely original albums out there, and a real classic. Faith No More were alt before alt, nu-metal before nu-metal, and progressive in their own completely unique way.
B000HNC7S8|5.0|I'm sorry there are so many history books written now only because we are compelled to think we have to keep up with the most recent. As if it mattered. No, there will be histories of histories  but it won't change now to then in reality. There will always be a separation. So, the insatiably hopeful reader, like me, has to realize that he/she ought to be reading only the best, regardless of subject, since our time is limited. Barbara Tuchman had a Shakespearean comprehensiveness and sympathy for her subjects. She seemed to understand in a general way how things work: how this having happened, this must follow. She had a keen sense of character. The shadowy hero of this book, Enguerrand de Coucy, is shown to be virtuous by implication, by contrast with his boorish contemporaries. It's great stuff. It's history taught in equal parts of intuitive intelligence and intellectual intelligence.<br />At the time she wrote this the calamitous 14th century seemed more of a reflection of our world than it does at present. So the distant mirror aspect may or may not prove relevant, it is nevertheless a superb example of what history should be and fascinating in and of itself.
B000E6UK5K|4.0|I have long given up hope that Pink Floyd would reunite for a new album, so I was very excited after hearing that David Gilmour had a new solo release coming out. Floyd have always been one of my favorite bands, and Gilmour one of my favorite guitarists. I have long considered him one of the most singular creative talents out there, with an inimitable playing style and tone, and a near-genius-level progressive sense of arrangement and composition.<br /><br />For all you Floyd fans out there, Pink Floyd this ain't. Certain echoes (no pun intended) of the band remain (especially in the spacy, near psychedelic intro \\"Castellorizon\\" and \\"The Blue\\"), but by and large this album is a more blues/folk oriented disc, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It certainly shows Gilmour's maturity, and is still laced with his beautiful, magical guitar soloing and tone (I swear, this guy picks up a Strat and something miraculous seems to pour out), but is not quite as grandiose and progressive as a Floyd release. Still highly recommended, and great \\"chill\\" music, with a mellow vibe. Recommended!
B000003N8R|5.0|Of all the magnificent peaks of John Coltrane's legacy, this one is the highest and most perfect. It should \\"Crescent\\", not the overrated \\"Love Supreme\\" or any other album, that should be considered the standard, appealing to Coltrane novices as well as the most hardcore collectors looking for musical challenges. This album is stunning from beginning to end, every track beautifully intense and urgent, yet controlled, with no flaws. \\"Crescent\\" may be considered by some as Coltrane's \\"darkest\\" collection (with the exception of one bright blues, the tone is somber), but it is in its haunting otherworldly quality that it stands apart.
1591391105|4.0|Darwinian, or sink or swim transition management is a poor strategy for developing leaders. Michael Watkins proposes the 'STaRS' model, which translated into four situations: sustaining success, turnaround, realignment, and start-up. Matching right strategy to each situation is key. How you position yourself with the team, with your boss, and even your own mental self will make or break or your career. The author walks through all of these steps offering numerous examples and great commentary - this book will not guarantee success, but it may well relieve some of the stress associated with the transition.
B000ICL3KG|4.0|I saw \\"An inconvenient truth\\" about a year ago. I enjoyed the movie, but even though I take global warming seriously and have taken steps to reduce my own carbon footprint, I was not entirely impressed with the movie. First of all it contains too much junk science. Second of all it is politicized. Because of these flaws I initially gave the movie two stars. However, I realized that a rating of two stars was too harsh and I also realized that many global warming skeptics are posting here with unfair ratings, so to counter that I reposted with a better rating.<br /><br />As many have pointed out Katrina cannot be linked to global warming since it was not a statistical anomaly (but the European heat wave of 2003 can be linked to global warming). The polar bears did not die from global warming (some died from a naturally occurring storm), the glacier on Mount Kilimanjaro is not disappearing because of global warming and the coral bleaching and the drying up of Lake Chad cannot be blamed on global warming either, etc. That is all true. When I first saw the movie I was already aware of some of these problems with the movie and therefore the movie did not inspire me like it should have. Al Gore may have said he invented the internet, but in this movie he is inventing facts for increased effect.<br /><br />Also the movie has a clear political tilt to it (Democrat good, Republican bad) when the truth is that people from both parties need to get together on this issue, and both parties are to blame (Democrats coziness with big coal and Republicans coziness with big oil).<br /><br />The junk science and the politicization of the movie are turning off a lot of people who are, so to speak, on the fence. When you preach to the choir you will not be scrutinized but preaching to the choir is not what is needed. I believe the movie had a positive influence in the beginning, but at this point I believe it is unnecessarily turning off a lot of people. The movie could have been better if Al Gore was more of a scientist and less of a politician.<br /><br />Still we have to take global warming seriously. The degree of scientific consensus on global warming has never been stronger. The scientific consensus on the warming that is happening now is that it is to a large degree human induced, not natural, and it is also very rapid, and it is still only the beginning. There is a lot more CO² to be released into the atmosphere. The opinions on how badly this will affect us vary among scientists, and some of these opinions are very grim, and some are less grim, but it should not be taken lightly by anyone.<br /><br />There is also a small chance of catastrophic climate change, meaning the changes we are causing may yet induce other natural changes in yet unknown but possible positive feedback scenarios (oceans releasing stored CO², methane releases from melting arctic bogs, undersea methane clathrates, etc.) Also don't forget the possibilities that no one have thought of yet. See the climatologist Broecker on this issue. The chances are perhaps low, but I am not willing to take the risk.<br /><br />Another reason to take global warming more seriously is that the rest of the countries in the industrialized world (except for a few countries) are taking it very seriously and they are getting fed up with countries that don't, especially the United States. In my home country Sweden, there is a new wave of anti-Americanism (which I very strongly oppose) and it originates in the U.S. not ratifying the Kyoto protocol and being among the worst CO² polluters in the world (per capita). Global warming is very visible in Northern Sweden and some people are enjoying it, but many are also getting very scared. Many feel that the U.S. is destroying their children's future by not being a team player. This may be unfair and I don't think the U.S. should have to adjust to please Europeans. However, we all share the atmosphere; it isn't ours alone, so this case is a littledifferent.<br /><br />So let's not dismiss the problem, and let's not be crazily alarmist either. Let's all consider the facts and come to an honest conclusion, and a workable action plan. Personally, I have switched my electricity away from coal to wind and water, I have insulated the house, I recycle, use energy savings lamps, I use air conditioning moderately, (and my next car will be a Toyota prius).<br /><br />Instead of the movie \\"An inconvenient truth\\" I would like to recommend \\"kicking the Carbon Habit\\" by William Sweet. Nature magazine also has had a lot of good research articles on the topic.oblem, and let's not be crazily alarmist either.

He's subtly humorous, has excellent timing, and is quite pleasant to look at.  There are many layers to the show keeping you thinking about it the next day.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|James is back with a fuller sound, more distinctive tracks, and a better overall cd compilation than Back To Bedlam.  Obvious favs are Carry You Home, 1973, I Can't Hear The Music, and I Really Want You.  He teams solid instrumentals with interesting lyrics and his trademark haunting falsetto to produce an album that's a must-have for any rock lover, particularly if you like soft, mellow ballads.  I give the album a solid 4.5 and sense that this artist has even more to offer.
B00000FC5H|4.0|I am not a huge EW&F fan, but my fiance is.  I bought this for her and watch her bop in the car while traveling.  There are many great classics on this CD, enough to keep me interested.  Let's Groove kicks, and September, and others.  I still hear live bands play this music.
B000Y179KO|5.0|I have been reading the consumer reviews so far and found that most are very complimentary (smart) and a couple are downright funny and some people just don't like ANYTHING! Well, those who have chosen to pan this need to listen more carefully or they need new ears!    The Eagles are truly one of the finest bands to have ever recorded. That said, this new release is another example of the elegance these guys are capable of. You cannot have this kind of staying power unless you are downright and unmistakenly great. The writing, the vocals, the instrumental prowess, the arranging --- all of it! And......to reach our age and still sound this good is truly a gift.    I reacted upon first hearing by thinking 'oh, more of the same' but by the time I had listened to it the third and fourth time, I realized I was hooked. The new melodies were going through my head again and again. Their harmonies are unequaled in the industry as is their song craftmanship, and their supporting musicians are of the best. The production is amazing. It's absolutely another Eagles classic and shall be recognized as one of the great records of 2007.    Way to go guys! Oh --- and you detractors --- give this record your undivided attention for a few hundred more  listenings!

042521771X|4.0|Although I had heard of some of Amanda Grange's previous books, such as Mr. Darcy's Diary, I had never read them. Recently, I got the chance to read a copy of Grange's [[ASIN:042521771X Mr. Knightley's Diary]] and found that it is a fantastic take on Jane Austen's Emma.    I haven't read Emma in probably a couple of years, so it was refreshing to read the story through Mr. Knightley's eyes. He's a very interesting character and I don't know him as well as Mr. Darcy.    Grange takes the reader into Knightley's (should I be so bold as to address him as such? Emma might not like it.) world and enables us to go with him when he is absent from Highbury. Readers of Emma will remember that Knightley misses Miss Taylor and Mr. Weston's wedding because he is in London. In Mr. Knightley's Diary, the reader is with him! We get to find out what he is doing when he is not with Emma. Haven't you always been curious?    The diary spans just over a year and recounts any number of events found in the original novel in a slightly different, more masculine way. Knightley is constantly worrying about Emma's behavior, hoping she will be more mature and leave off matchmaking, and trying to decide if, and who, he should marry. Just as Emma tries to pair Harriet with various gentlemen, Knightley meets several women (including Jane Fairfax) and tries to see if he feels any sparks with them. Of course, as we all know, in the end only Emma will do.    Our favorite (and not-so-favorite) secondary characters still play largely in this novel, though through Knightley's eyes. Mr. Woodhouse is still the same old valetudinarian that we all love (and wish would stop saying that cake is bad for one's health!). Mr. Elton and his wife, as always, quite irritating, though Knightley is polite. He finds Frank Churchill to be somewhat suspect, rather than the charming gentleman the ladies believe him to be. We also see more of Knightley's brother John and his wife, Emma's sister. I was quite glad to read more about them, as they are not a huge part of Emma.    I highly recommend [[ASIN:042521771X Mr. Knightley's Diary]] to all Jane Austen fans. It was a very enjoyable take on a beloved book.
B00003OO3O|5.0|Listen to great classic rock as Schenker continues to put on a show at lead guitar.  A pleasure to sit and lisen to this entire CD non stop.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|What the in the hell happened to the franchise??? The dance scene in the middle of the movie made me attept to hang my self. I am so damm mad I cannot explain how horrible this movie is. Remember when Marvel put out greatness like Blade (the first one)???? This is a rental and I still snapped it in half. I rather watch the Hulk, no wait better yet, Electra. If this offended you, sorry.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|A true A7X fan knows this band is the revolution. This album is innovative, experimental, and musically incredible. Who wants to hear the same stuff over 4 albums? This album encompasses the rawness of waking the fallen, the musicianship of city of evil, and surpasses that with a new sound that any REAL music fan can appreciate. Full orchestras, choir singing, beautiful acoustic work, and all out brutal metal and rock. Are you kidding me? This album has everything. People who say they have \\"sold out\\" or say \\"go back to screamo\\" are totally ignorant.\\" Im completely surprised that within all their touring and heavy partying they could put out such a meaningful album. I can listen to this album over and over and get something new out of it everytime. Every little guitar lick, drum fill, and lyric has been meticulously worked into this album making it easily a contender for album of the year. If you are openminded and can truly appreciate an amazing eclectic album, this album is for you. If you are a \\"scene\\" kid with tight jeans, black eye liner, long black hair and cant comprehend and appreciate anything beyond metalcore, move on - you dont deserve to own this album.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|If this were another time and another era and if Britney Spears weren't \\"Britney Spears,\\" this album would be selling like Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller.\\" Because \\"Blackout\\" really is her best album.  She really is one of the best commercial Pop artists ever.  Britney has certainly had some of the more recognizable Pop songs over the past 10 years like \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and \\"Oops!...I Did It Again.\\" As a recording artist and celebrity, she has captured the public's imagination on multiple levels.      Britney Spears has gotten notably better since her debut album. I think the first signs of evolution were with 2003's \\"In the Zone\\" and now once again with her 2007 release \\"Blackout.\\" Where she has succeed and where some of her young peers haven't is that she's been able to stamp her image and persona on every song like Michael Jackson and Madonna have done.  Even though slick producers like Timbaland's protégé Nate \\"Danjahandz\\" Hills (Gimme More) along with Bloodshy & Avant (Piece of Me) deserve at least half of the credit on the album \\"Blackout,\\" without Britney Spears on these tracks they just don't sell. She's the secret ingredient on all of these songs. Only she could get away with something called \\"Get Naked (I Got a Plan).\\"     After 83 million albums  sold WW, Britney knows her game very well and it's most evident on \\"Blackout.\\" As a recording artist, she gets what works for her and what doesn't. We're not going to hear her trying to warble her way through Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston power ballads. Let's face it, some people try and it just doesn't work. Britney knows what her strengths and weakness are like Madonna does and she plays to them perfectly on \\"Blackout.\\" She's a Dance/Pop artist and she has never pretended to be otherwise. Britney's never tried to be the next Celine Dion and shouldn't be faulted for that. Most people can't sing that well. You have to put her talent in perspective with the type of music that she's recording.  If you do that, then she's A-list without a doubt. She's the best of her age group. If she continues to make albums that are as good as \\"In the Zone\\" and \\"Blackout\\" then in time she might be a true icon like her idol Madonna is. Her ascent to the top of the Pop world should continue if she can rise above the 24 hour media circus and put her legal problems behind her. Because \\"Blackout\\" makes a damn good argument that she should be next in line for queen. And her former Mickey Mouse mate Justin Timberlake might join her as king. Who knows?     But come on folks, Britney Spears deserves some credit. In the midst of probably her darkest moment, she has delivered her best record. Most people in the same situation under the same circumstances wouldn't have come even close. Appreciate her ability and her music for what it is and you won't be disappointed. I hope the Grammys remember her in February of 2009. An album like \\"Blackout\\" shouldn't be ignored.

0805209999|5.0|It would be strange to not give a book of this reputation 5 stars.  I do so with no reservation either, but this wasn't really what I'd call a literary masterpiece.<br /><br />The story traces the logic of K a man arrested without cause.  The stream of thought never really ends in the book as his thoughts are influenced by his encounters with other people and as he is disillusioned about the society he lives in to some degree.  He never becomes disillusioned enough to see what awaits him though.<br /><br />The tone and style of the writing is immersive, consistent and relentless putting us in the mind of the accused, and the writing is clear and certainly makes a clear and fine exposition out of what the author set out to do, which was to show the madness of giant bureaucracy with little care for the life of others.<br /><br />Its a good read, and one thing that occured to me is how much smarter the system is than an actual human being, which gives that trapped feeling that the author does so well.  How could it not be \\"smarter\\" especially today, with pages and pages of rules and paid positions and so forth at that time and now add in computers the power of bureaucracy probably only increases.<br /><br />On the one hand its not a great literary masterpiece, but on the other hand it is such an important book that I don't really care.
0618680004|1.0|Dawkins has finally lost his noodle by diving head first into the depths of atheistic fundamentalism.  He consistently misrepresents the theistic position by selectively representing it with only the most negative references and then by spinning outdated and clich&eacute;d rhetoric its way.  He has clearly departed from an honest skepticism to a fundamentalist position that behaves irresponsibly with regard to the available facts.  To make matters worse, Dawkins continues to promote his much less than scientific idea of the \\"meme\\" to the point where the reader is sure to grimace intellectually at the hyperbolic musings therein.  The book is certainly worth reading for the sake of understanding what atheistic fundamentalism is all about and just how much one needs to \\"check their brain in at the door\\" in order to live the atheistic life.

B000UFAURI|5.0|I've been listening to this CD, I'd like to say non-stop, but I do have to work for a living. There's just so much variety and nuance. I think it's very powerful work for the band.    There's classic 'FF' stuff, as well, but as a whole it's a great surprise to this long-time fan. Buy it, give it a listen. You'll love it like I do, hopefully.
1592402038|4.0|Lynn Truss should be awarded on the Queen's Honours List for her services to language. After all, the common perception that punctuation is not that crucial to the art of the language is terrifying. After all, a misplaced comma, semi-colon, exclamation point, and period can wreck havoc in the perceptions of those who think that there is nothing wrong. Truss has it right that the definition of a panda is that he eats shoots and leaves and how the comma is purposely misplaced to make a point. A panda doesn't eat, shoot, and leave in actions. He eats shoots (maybe bamboo shoots) and tree leaves possibly. For those of us who teach language arts, I admire Truss' ability to reach out and educate the readers with a sense of humor. Punctuation is never really taught to the extent that it should be in our schools. Two Weeks Notice is missing an apostrophe over the \\"s\\" in weeks and we see the author in the back cover of the book trying to put it there.

B000R7GKQE|5.0|This is one of the few shows on television worth watching. I am afraid that it will not last much longer due to the trend in TV to present irreverent and inane content. The show has shown love between family members and concern for the fellow man. I love the series and I like to watch the collection uninterupted by comercials. Good buy, I bought this set as a gift to my daughter for Christmas.
B000VWYJ8Q|2.0|It's a shame that this, and the other two films in the series, are not available in Blu-ray.  I'd defintely buy it then.  Otherwise, I'll refrain from buying it in DVD, and certainly won't purchase it in this format.  One day, when this stupid format war is over, then we can all buy one format and be assured that our purchases won't become obsolete in a matter of months.

B000JVT1U0|5.0|[[VIDEOID:15738981]]Well, here it is, my first video review.  I'll apologize for this ahead of time, but I just had to try out my nifty new camera.  I know I am a far better writer than a speaker -especially when forced to sit still, but bear with me.  I also broke my usual review mold here by reviewing a product with over 200 opinions already entered on this edition alone. I usually prefer to review products that haven't been reviewed completely, fairly, or at all, but \\"The Wicker Man\\" is a true classic and I was in the mood to try something new so here it is. I could have said a lot more (and I did in my initial run at it), but file size is a big issue so I had to settle for a quickie review, but let me add that Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland are unbelievable in this film.<br /><br /> Post jokes, criticisms, and patronizing remarks below and let me know what you think.  Also, please note that I am in no way condoning human sacrifice conspiracies or frowning on Christianity here, but am just offering a view of this film from a different angle.  If you can sit through this whole review (relatively short as it is), God bless you.

B0009UC7H0|1.0|I've seen my share of stupid movies, I've seen zombies bite though people's skulls, a giant snake slither though LA without anyone seeing it, and people taking out giant rhinos with a spear, but this movie takes the cake. There are really only two things I have to tell you about to prove this movie stupid, I don't even have to talk about the awful acting or the crazy nonsense plot. one, they shoot down a helicopter with a Civil War cannon that's been buried under the sand in the SAHARA desert for 150 years, and an armored column surrenders to cavalry.<br /><br />Here's why that's so insanely stupid for all those who don't get it, and I'm going to use historical examples to prove it. During the battle of Gettysburg the army of Northern Virginia opened fire on the union army with their long ranged cannon, and MISSED! They couldn't even hit an army. now, fast forward to the modern day, give a cannon that's been buried under the sand since the end of the war to three Indiana Jones want to be's and give them the most impossible target to hit, a helicopter. What do you think happens? Well, they shoot it down, duh.<br /><br />Second, an entire armored column, I think there must have been more then a dozen tanks, surrenders to an enemy army on horse back. Now, does anyone remember when the Polish army fought German tanks during WWII? Anyone? Well I'll tell you, uh, they died. Yeah, they all got killed because there is no possible way for mounted cavalry to defeat armor, and yet the tankers in this movie didn't seem to know that. Pathetic.<br /><br />There's a lot more I could rant about, like how on earth could a Civil War battleship get to the Sahara desert, but I think I've made my point. This movie is simply one of the dumbest ever made, and I've seen some doozies. Stay away, for the love of god, stay away from this flick and just see Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Replay value; Very low.
B000V6BE6C|2.0|\\"City of Evil\\" blew my mind, and also pissed me off.  I like nothing about this band...their stupid eyeliner image, thier willingness to sell out to MTV, etc.  That being said \\"City of Evil \\" was one of the best metal albums I had heard in years.  The same cannot be said here, and I couldn't be happier.<br /><br />The problem here is that the songs don't have any life of their own.  Anyone familiar with Mr. Bungle knows that the song \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" blatantly borrows heavily from the Bungle song \\"Carousel\\".  The rest of the album just has no direction.  There are bright spots here and there.  But overall the songs don't maintain any momentum they build, most of the songs sound like the band gets lost after they find a good groove. Maybe they riffed themselves out on \\"City of Evil\\", and are creatively gassed.<br /><br />The soloing is still pretty sweet.  That is the redeeming value here.
B000W0B0G6|5.0|Lucky me.  I had not heard this album for 20 years, had forgotten about it.  (After college in the 70's I got heavily into jazz, and guys with a guitar and small bands didn't matter anymore.)  But in recent years I have listened to them again, and today i picked this up in a flea market.  It all came flooding back, so beautiful and perfect a musical statement.  It succeeds so strongly on several counts: first of all the songwriting is superb.  Anyone with a smidgin of talent could play these and provide an evening's entertainment.  Cat is/was not only melodic, but he built surprises, musical twists, and strong emotional punch in the lyrics.  As much as Dylan, he was singing about the mood of the ages, and not on topical or political themes.  Several of the songs could stand alone as poems, such as Into White, Where do the Children Play?, and On the Road to Find Out.<br /><br />Next, Cat is/was a great singer and arranger, who conveyed the song's meaning and feeling as only the writer could.  Now for that, you need more than a smidgin of talent.  His blend of solo playing, mixed judiciously with accompaniment, was suited just right for each song.  The band comes in, and lays off, and plays just what they should and when they should.  They were great musicians to boot.  Cat set the standard and trends for the next 20 years.<br /><br />Finally, you get the feeling Cat made this album with almost no concern about its commercial success.  He simply wanted to share his songs with the world, and we were lucky that he had the talent, and that perhaps the musical world was in just the right condition, to allow him to actually achieve success in the process.<br /><br />BTW, I agree with the writer who said that while Tea for the Tillerman's overall quality may not have been as high as Teaser and the Firecat, it hits the higher notes.  Unfortunately each album's overall quality continued to slide, in the late 70's.  Few people, perhaps only Dylan, could maintain this level of quality production for more than just a few albums.  But Tea for the Tillerman was IT, people should never forget it, and it belongs in everyone's collection.ore than just a few albums.  But Tea for the Tillerman was IT, people should never forget it, and it belongs in everyone's collection.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Normally I wouldn't have bothered writing this review; after all, Spirited Away has close to 700 5-star reviews on Amazon already, so who would ever bother to read mine, even if they dug it out from beneath all the others?  But having just rewatched this movie for the bazillionth time--I've honestly lost count by now--I found myself motivated to sit down and write a review that may never be read, simply because I love the movie so much.  (If you're reading this, thanks!)<br /><br />Let me start by pointing out that I'm a huge fan of all of Hayao Miyazaki's works, but Spirited Away is easily the best of them all (at least until his next movie, which is scheduled to be released in Japan in the summer of 2008).  Let me also point out that you don't have to be a fan of anime to enjoy this film.  To be sure, the plot does draw very heavily on the Shinto faith and its associated stories and legends; but even those who have never heard of Shinto can watch and enjoy Spirited Away.  The reason is simple: In spite of its religious trappings, the movie is at its core a story of love, sacrifice, and growing up.  In the beginning, Chihiro is whiny, depressed at having to move to a new home, and generally incapable of seeing anything beyond the tip of her nose; she complains a lot, doesn't do much of what she's told, and generally seems determined to make the worst of everything.  Of course, she's learned her lesson by the time the credits roll, but the movie never feels the need to hammer that lesson home for the viewer; like the best of storytellers, Miyazaki-san is a master at delivering the medicine with just the right amount of sugar.  The universe itself, as fantastic and whimsical as it is, is so beautifully presented that even the unbelievable seems completely plausible; CGI is used in a few instances, but only in small amounts, and even then the computer graphics blend with the traditional animation almost seamlessly.<br /><br />Which brings me to the movie's other major selling point.  Spirited Away is truly a sight to behold, full of colors and movement that would have made Walt Disney lock himself in his bedroom and never speak to anyone again; light and shadow and colors are used with impeccable skill, and when combined with the work of what has to be the most talented foley team in history and music by the unparallelled Joe Hisaishi, the result is a movie that you can quite literally lose yourself in.<br /><br />It's hard for me to say which voice track I recommend more; on one hand, the original Japanese with subtitles is a little bit closer to Miyazaki-san's original intent, but on the other hand, the voice acting on the English track is so spot-on that, if such a thing as \\"perfection\\" could be said to exist, it would be fair to just go ahead and call it perfect.  (The English vocal track also fills in some of the gaps for American viewers who aren't familiar with the customs and trappings of Shinto.)  Since the movie was released in the US by the Walt Disney Company, the vocal cast is star-studded, a rarity for an anime release; John Ratzenberger's brief poetic interlude near the middle of the movie (improvised on the fly in the recording studio) is particularly noteworthy, and hilarious to boot, as is David Ogden Stiers' performance as Kamaji.  Of course, the Japanese voice acting is beautiful too, so you really can't go wrong either way.<br /><br />In the end, there's very little that could be said against Spirited Away.  There is violence and bloodshed, to be sure, but it's of such a fantastical quality that I honestly don't see most viewers over six years old having a problem with it.  Plus, the main character, for all of her initial flaws, turns out in the end to be incredibly bright and resourceful; this is a hallmark of the works of Hayao Miyazaki, an avowed femininst who believes that women and girls are every bit as capable as any male.  Since I happen to agree with him, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.To anyone who's sick of the sort of cookie-cutter garbage that's marketed as good family viewing nowadays, Spirited Away will provide all the relief you'll ever need.t of cookie-cutter garbage that's marketed as good family viewing nowadays, Spirited Away will provide all the relief you'll ever need.

0143038419|1.0|I see absolutely no value in this book.  I was extremely excited to begin reading this book and now I'm extremely disappointed that this is actually a best seller.  I believe this book has no point and I simply do not care for the character at all.  She is like a girlfriend who complains and cries about everything and she simply won't stop her self loathing.  Her whining and obsessive need to express detail is enough to put me right to sleep at the end of the day.  Therefore, I take back my sentiment that this book is futile because it does accomplish one thing for me--sleep! My recommendation is this: do not to waste your money, time, and intelligence on this poor excuse for a novel.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Very good movie with good plot, script, and actors. A good role for Will Smith. Excellent CGI. It is not quite as I remember the novel from my childhood reading.
B00006G8K0|5.0|Horror of Dracula. Very good. On this dvds back cover it states its one of Hammers best,and it doesn't disapoint. Peter Cushing is good once again. I've seen the 1992 Dracula film and this 1959 version does stick to the dracula story  at least to start with. I would recommend this to others.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I have fond memories of \\"Little Shop Of Horrors\\" as it was the subject of my very first newspaper movie review, but it's special in so many ways that it's hard to list them all.  I can't think of another movie that so skillfully combines so many elements - music, horror, comedy, romance - with each done so well, instead of the usual case where a movie works in one area while suffering in others.  There are moments of genuine thrills, followed moments later by equally real huge laughs, and the love story between meek Seymour and the sweet Audrey evokes some of the most deep, heartfelt emotions ever created onscreen.  You long deeply to see them not only survive, but to end up with that happily ever after in the tract house with the white picket fence far from skid row.  The music by Menken and Ashman is just genius in its cleverness and wit, some of the very best and most memorable, sing-able tunes ever to grace a soundtrack.  The performances are perfect, with Rick Moranis wonderfully cast (and surprisingly, a decent singer, especially evident in the full version of \\"The Meek Shall Inherit\\" on the soundtrack CD), and Ellen Greene reprises her original off-Broadway role as Audrey, making the heartbreakingly damaged girl with a heart of gold into a character you can't help but adore and root for, and her amazing voice soars to the heavens.  And of course, Steve Martin must be mentioned for his achingly hilarious turn as the sadistic dentist (the Academy completely robbed Martin of a much-deserved Supporting Actor Oscar for this role), and Bill Murray as his all-too eager patient nearly manages to do the impossible and steal the scene from Martin. There's not much left say, this is simply a movie that must be seen to fully grasp its popularity and irresistible, timeless appeal. Sheer perfection, and an absolute joyous movie! I can't possibly recommend it highly enough - \\"go get it!\\"
B000001FFR|4.0|this 1985 masterpiece from anthrax is the follow up to fistfull of metal,both are high quality metal discs,this disc is awesome!this disc along with others kickstarted the thrash/speed metal scene which had been growing since the early 80`s,to me this disc has it`s place in metal lore,along with slayer,metallica megadeath,exodus,known as the big 5 that basically changed the world of heavy music.this is a classic disc and anthrax is a classic band,
B000N3STBQ|4.0|I can't believe how good this album is.  Why do I say that?  Because in the early `90s when I bought it for the first time -- on cassette mind you -- I actually *exchanged* it for something else because I didn't like it at all!  And the funny thing is, this was coming from a group that I did like at the time, ever since I fell in love with their brand of electronic synth pop upon listening to the \\"Catching Up\\" compilation (and the fact that I'm a keyboard player doesn't hurt either).  I guess I can only conclude that my musical appreciation skills must be getting sharper.    I admit I only have a small portion of the entire Depeche Mode discography.  I'm not even sure if this is their absolute best album -- maybe that's why I didn't fall in love with it at first (Violator, Playing the Angel, and Music for the Masses are their finest masterpieces in my opinion).  Still, I think anyone who likes the dark tones and somber imagery of Depeche Mode will truly appreciate this CD.  You obviously have to listen to it carefully -- and, of course, probably more than once -- but it will definitely strike a chord with you if you give it a chance.  The songs really flow well from one to the next, and there is no escaping the blasphemous melancholy that is clearly evident in the music and the lyrics.    I have to admit, I sometimes don't like their slower ballads, but if you use them as a means of transition between the more energetic tracks, then it's certainly possible to enjoy them (\\"A Question of Lust\\" and \\"Dressed in Black\\" are perfect examples of songs that serve this purpose).  And that's what's so great about this album -- there's a near perfect balance between soft beauty and gritty intensity that really takes you on an incredible artistic journey.  It ranges all the way from the extremely appropriate opening title track, to the abrasive and soul-pounding \\"Fly on the Windscreen,\\" further on to the peaceful \\"Sometimes,\\" and then all the way back to the semi-industrial motif with the deceptively titled \\"New Dress.\\"  \\"A Question of Time\\" functions as the obligatory hectic dance tune, \\"Stripped\\" sucks you into an exotic chasm, and you'll even be treated with a slight diversion from the predominantly black mood of the rest of the album with the track \\"Here is the House,\\" which is a lovely, upbeat song that has a very catchy melody and an almost happy, optimistic feel to it.    To sum up, \\"Black Celebration\\" is a terrific piece of work by an ingenious band.  It is well worth purchasing and listening to.

B000002KB8|4.0|A must have for most every metal fan.      What can I say that hasn't been said already?
B000T05R8Q|5.0|The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn is a true masterpiece, and sadly, the only Pink Floyd album to feature Syd Barrett at his best (other than a few select tracks on the Saucerful Of Secrets album - Jugband Blues,for example) before succumbing to his well documented breakdown from LSD and schizophrenia. The overall package of the 40th anniversary edition design is fantastic!!! It is made to resemble a cloth-covered children's story book, created by Syd's (and Pink Floyd's) friend Storm Thorgerson. It includes a journal of Syd's poems and art-work, which is a nice touch for every Syd Barrett fan!!! Lots of GREAT Piper-era photos in the booklet!!!  The album package itself is a 50/50 toss-up, as would be expected from most Syd-era Pink Floyd fans. It's great to hear the mono version of the album, as it gives some new, interesting mixes of the album to hear (this was also the original album's mix when released in 1967,and the U.S. single version of Flaming/The Gnome), but still, a lot of the tracks (mainly guitar and vocals) become buried in the mix. Still great to hear, though. The stereo version is FANTASTIC as always!!!! This truly shows Syd at peak perfection!!! The downside - here goes, you've seen/read it before - the 3rd C.D. of singles and bonus tracks!!!  It's great to finally see the three single releases (minus Scarecrow - it appears on the Piper album) on this 40th anniversary issue (they were intended to be included with the 30th anniversary edition, but were finally released on their own as an import as ''1967 - The First Three Singles'' sampler). But when the 3rd C.D. clocks in at 32:06,and in this day and age when a C.D. holds 74 to 80 minutes of music,and Pink Floyd fans knowing of the un-released music in the vaults, it looks to me like another missed opportunity to finally release some long overdue gems!!!  Although, the stereo version of Apples And Oranges,and an alternate version of Matilda Mother, and two versions of Interstellar Overdrive are great tofinally have in officially released form, there are STILL a number of Syd-era tracks that could have made this 40th anniversary edition all the more better!!!  For example: (1) Lucy Leave ,(2) (Baby I'm A)King Bee - both of these songs pre-Piper Floyd recordings with Bob Close on lead guitar, (3) Stoned Alone (one of 4 tracks recorded when the band was recording songs for their first single release - Arnold Layne/Candy And A Currant Bun), (4) Let's Roll Another One - the ORIGINAL song title and lyrics for Candy And A Currant Bun, before the record business types made Syd change all the drug references so the song could be released , (5) Sunshine - a Piper album instrumental out-take, (6) She Was A Millionaire - another Piper album out-take (the tapes are rumoured to be lost,etc.,etc.), (7) In The Beechwoods - instrumental out-take, also known as In The Greenwoods. Other alternate recordings/mixes of the album's released material would have also made this more worthwhile!!! Adding the lyrics for the single-only releases in the booklet plus other info.(chart positions,etc.) would have been a nice touch as well.  As for Scream Thy Last Scream and Vegetable Man - these were recorded AFTER the Piper album was completed and released, if only by weeks/months. It's understandable why they are not a part of this Piper 40th anniversary package. As I can't recollect a 30th anniversary edition of Saucerful Of Secrets, I doubt very much we will see a 40th anniversary edition with these songs - but it's nice to dream (nudge,nudge,wink,wink!!!). Also include It Would Be So Nice / Julia Dream, Point Me At The Sky / Careful With That Axe,Eugene, excerts from the Have You Got It Yet! sessions, John Latham, Silas Lang/Swan Lee, various untitled/instrumentals, alternate recordings/mixes (Jugband Blues), live, and BBC recordings!!!!! If not that, I'll GLADLY take a RARITIES ALBUM when somebody gets around to it!!!!! (Nudge,nudge,wink,wink!!!!!). This version of Piper is a must-have forevery Syd Barrett/Floyd fan!!!

B000PY52EU|5.0|An amazing movie that will keep your eyes clued to the screen. Featuring the talents of Samuel L. Jackson, Christina Ricci, and Justin Timberlake. This movie is one that has to be watched. Samuel L. Jackson plays a man who has been left by his women and is going through a rough time. He finds a women (Christina Ricci) lying in the middle of the street one day all beaten up and half naked. He nurses her to health and trying to help her with her problems. This is a great movie that should not be passed up. Plus you get to here Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci sing! Go get Black Snake Moan today!
B00005JPS5|4.0|This movie features many voices we have grown to love, Jerry Seinfeld, Renee Zellweger, Matthew Broderick, John Goodman, Chris Rock, Oprah Winfrey, Larry King, Sting, and more. While not being the best computer animation film out there, it holds its own well enough and is an enjoyable viewing experience for all ages.  Some very young children won't get all the jokes, but the fun factor and eye candy make it worthwhile.  I liked the spin put on the movie that bees could communicate with humans but weren't allowed to by traditional bee law.  Complications ensue due to the law being broken by the main character Barry, and he ends up getting involved in a lawsuit meant to assist bees everywhere from being exploited for their honey.  It goes well, but doesn't exactly turn out like Barry intended.  Fortunately he finds a solution to the problem he unwittingly created.  A solid four stars from me.
B00005JPFH|2.0|This Spiderman was a rushed job. It had a lot of action but not enough plot. Topher Grace was great as Venom. But by the time he make an appearance it was close to the end of the movie. In this case too many crooks spoil the pot.
B000VS6P9Q|2.0|One of previous reviewers said it best. Dylan is the best interpreter of Dylan. If you are young and new to Dylan (and you would have to be very young), skip this CD.  If you are older and enjoy Dylan, stick to his versions OR to insightful interpreters such as Mauldur.   This CD convinced me not to see the film.
B000002TQV|5.0|pretty much one of the best albums of all time. If OK Computer is Sgt. Pepper, then this is Revolver. It's dark and moody, but still has songs that can stand on their own. If you don't like this album, I don't want to be your friend. too bad.
B000O179EK|3.0|I bow to no one in my high regard for The Big Lebowski as one of, if not the, funniest movies of all time. It is just excellent. Every time I watch it (12 times so far), I laugh.<br /><br />Now as to the HD-DVD version itself. It is no better than the basic DVD version and simply not worth buying if you already have the regular DVD version. The HD-DVD format is simply a disappointment.<br /><br />- nopcbs
B000Y179KO|5.0|I was never a big Eagles fan (or rock fan for that matter) until the late 90's when I listened to Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975}. I heard excellent musicians and singers performing well crafted tunes and then I dug the Eagles. Eden, to me, is like Their Greatest Hits (1982-1994).  That is, their best material gleaned from the half dozen albums that they should have but never did record during their breakup years.  This explains the dated styles with an evolutionary shift  from guitar heavy rock to keyboard backed arrangements with richly textured harmonies.  This is just good old Rock'n'Roll music, written, sung, played, and produced with the excellence we have come to expect from this fine group. Thank you, Eagles.
B00005JPD0|1.0|this movie is terrible. I imagine this will be the new form of torture, being forced to watch really stupid movies. Yet a lot of people actually like this film. HAHAHA sheep.
B0000041DF|5.0|Before hearing Argerich's rendition of the Rach #3, I had always agreed with the great pianist Josef Hoffman (to whom Rachmaninoff dedicated this piece).  Hoffman never played the Rach #3 because he didn't care for it, claiming that the piece \\"lacked form\\".<br /><br />Argerich clearly understands this piece, and has technique to do it justice.  It is now one of my very favorite piano concertos.  This is a performance to cherish.  But why settle for just the audio feast, when you can get the DVD of this landmark performance through Classical Video Rarities?  The visual is as intriguing as the audio.  She's the master!!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|All I can say is......wow.  As a longtime Springsteen fan, this is a tremendous collection of songs.  I think this is the best collection of Bruce songs since The River.  This CD rocks.  As a true great CD should, the more you listen, the better it gets.  I'd list my favorite songs, but it really is almost all of them.  Awesome.  And of course - the E Street band is tremendous as always.
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|Paul Greengrass has stepped into the director's shoes for this third installment of the Jason Bourne identity crisis and in doing so has created nearly two hours of tension that would make Robert Ludlum proud! This is an example of how Hollywood can shine when it integrates all of the components of an 'action suspense thriller' by capitalizing on finding the best contributors available - actors, producers, cameramen, stunt men, script (Tony Gilroy, George Nolfi and Scott Z. Burns), composer of music (John Powell), editors - everyone of the hundreds required to pull off this superlative film. It is as fine as any thriller can be and reflects the intensity of concentration and understatement and respect for the viewers' intellect that crowned his excellent UNITED 93 and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY. The result is a polished movie that remains compelling form the opening frame to the final credits.<br /><br />For those who have read or watched Ludlum's Bourne trilogy the story line is at core very simple: Jason Bourne has lost his memory and struggles through terrifying confrontations with all governments and potential assassins, endures relentless chases, and defies the machinations of the world's intelligence sources to discover his true identity. The rest of the novels and films are the how.<br /><br />Matt Damon has come into his own as an electrifying screen presence as Jason Bourne: his acting is keen and his ability to hold our concern through impossible situations would be difficult to duplicate by other actors of this genre. The supporting cast includes such superb actors as Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn, Albert Finney, Paddy Considine, Daniel Br&uuml;hl, Joey Ansah and a very large cast of others. The pacing and use of Intelligence techniques is extraordinary and is beautifully captured by the cinematography of DP Oliver Wood and finessed by the editing of Christopher Rouse.<br /><br />One aspect of this film that is the most frightening is to observe just how invasive the Intelligence portions of our government can be: there seemingly are no secrets about even the most personal aspects of our lives that cannot be flashed on multiscreens in the war room of the CIA and associated organizations. Perhaps this film will be a red flag to alert public attention as to how our right to privacy has been so visibly raped by the government in the name of security - a factor that makes watching this excellent movie even more terrifying!

0307387178|4.0|Although he was only 23 years old, Chris McCandless knew that a conventional lifestyle was not for him.  He wanted to experience life in its most primal form.  \\"Living off the land\\" was his idea of being one with nature.  He needed to fine his own inner soul and he thought he could find it in the harshest environment, Alaska.  Little did Chris know, his legacy would be inspirational, nonetheless controversial, and the focus of a major motion picture.  Jon Krakauer explains McChandless' motivation and the terrible tragedy this young man endured in his newest novel, Into the Wild.<br /> I was expecting a play-by-play account of McChandless' adventure, a retracing of his footsteps; however, Krakauer encorporates other adventurers such as, John Waterman, Everett Ruess and Krakauer's own climbing of Devils Thumb.  Although the stories are compelling, I would've been more fulfilled with further details about McCandless's escapade.  As several of Chris's acquanitesses attest, he seemed like such a pleasant, quiet young man.  He was an intelligent idealist and I was rooting for Chris to be enlightened and return to civilization rejuvenated; however, it was not meant to be.<br /><br />Whatever his reasoning, Chris lead his life just as he wanted.  Chris may have died from ingesting poisonious seeds, however if he had not severed all communication with his family, he might be alive today.<br /> Krakauer tells a griping, true-life experience of a young man disillusioned with civilization, seeking something intangible in his life.  But, so much more to Chris McChandless's story could've been told.
B000J233SK|4.0|McKennitt brings new life to the Celtic genre with her dreamy lilting voice and haunting melodies. Book of Secrets was inspired by her journeys through the world and many of the songs call upon ancient tunes and traditions. The music is simple but not boring and carries a nice blend of Celtic and middle-eastern influences.<br /><br />Prologue is mainly instrumental, though Loreena uses her voice to impose a countermelodious \\"la\\" sound. The sound is very slow and dark, using a deep bongo drum (though that may not be the right word) to provide the beat and what sounds like a finger-plucked mandolin. Perhaps an oboe in the background? The sounds are nothing like the things most Americans are used to; she uses instruments from many different cultures.<br /><br />The Mummer's Dance is based on the historical \\"mummers\\" who dressed up in straw masks and ribbons and carried greenery to homes as they sang. It was an action associated with springtime and fertility, but this song is not the typical happy springtime song. The lyrics are about nature.. \\"The songs of birds seem to fill the wood/That when the fiddler plays/All their voices can be heard/Long past their woodland days.\\" but the tune carries the same instruments as the Prologue and is somewhat dark.<br /><br />Skellig begins with a lonely violin that is gradually joined by the rest of the strings and then a wood (tin?) flute. The story tells of Irish monks who often lived in remote places such as the Skellig Islands in Ireland, copying texts and striving to reach closer to God. Reading the lyrics (\\"I'd hear the ocean breathe/Exhale upon the shore/I knew the tempest's blood/Its wrath I would endure\\"), I can almost smell the salt water and see the lonely monk walking barefoot along the rocky cliffs.<br /><br />Marco Polo is another almost entirely instrumental song that distinctly conjures up images of a harem and belly dancers. It's what I would have referred to as \\"snake charmer music\\" a few years ago. I find myself irrepressibly swaying to the beat of the drums and I must say that if I were a snake, I'd definitely be charmed!<br /><br />The Highwayman is my favorite song from this CD. Based upon Alfred Noyes' poem of the same name, McKennitt does an amazing job of setting the words to music and her wistful voice tells the sad tale (\\"The wind was a torrent of darkness/Among the gusty trees\\") of a highwayman who had fallen in love with the landlord's daughter (\\"Bess, the landlord's daughter/Plaiting a dark red love-knot into her long black hair\\"). The highwayman leaves to perform his questionable job, assuring Bess that he will come back that night (\\"Watch for me by the moonlight/I'll come to thee by the moonlight, though Hell should bar the way\\").<br /><br />Unfortunately, an old man listening at the gate overheard this exchange and warned the lawmen, who sent troops to hide in the cottage and wait for the highwayman. They tied up Bess, roping a musket to her side, next to the window so that she would see him approaching his death. Bess, though, refused to let that happen and twisted her hands around until she grasped the musket trigger (\\"Shattered her breast in the moonlight and warned him with her death\\"). The highwayman quickly turned around, for he knew he was in danger. He found out in the morning what Bess had done and flew off in a rage (\\"Back he spurred like a madman, shrieking a curse to the sky/With the white road smoking behind him and his rapier brandished high!\\") but the troops were still alert and shot him down (\\"Down like a dog on the highway\\").<br /><br />The tale says that his angry ghost still haunts the inn where his now-dead love once lived (\\"When the road is a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor... A highwayman comes riding up to the old inn-door\\").<br /><br />A very sad tale, with Noyes' fantastic words and McKennitt's voice that is so well-suited to storytelling, this is an amazing song.<br /><br />La Serinissima is purely instrumental, with mainly astring quartet and a plucked acoustic guitar. It is, as the name implies, extremely serene and is a nice come-down after the intense emotion of the previous song. It turns to a major key for its melody and eases the transition from depressing love song back to stories of nature.<br /><br />Night Ride Across the Caucasus returns to the minor key and middle-eastern instruments with a slow, introspective melody about the human desire to learn the secrets of the world, and the lengths to which a curious mind will go to find them.<br /><br />Dante's Prayer, the last song, begins with a cathedral-ish chant but quickly gives way to a soft piano/violin combination as Loreena wraps up her journeys with a quiet melody about rising to a higher level of life. Her voice fades out and the cathedral tune comes back briefly then fades as well.<br /><br />This is one of the few albums that I can actually listen to while going to sleep. It's conducive to meditation and a relaxed state of mind.. another good \\"bathtub album\\" if you will. It's also enjoyable to listen to this CD through an open door while you sit on the porch with your soda/beer/cigarette/other vice and contemplate the stars. This CD is a great introduction to Celtic-style music and I'm glad Loreena shared her journey's book of secrets with us. I'll end with a quote from the liner notes.. \\"Music and singing do not produce in the heart that which is not in it.\\" Ponder at will, and enjoy the album.s, extremely serene and is a nice come-down after the intense emotion of the previous song.

B000UX6THK|4.0|Overall, a fantastic set, but the menu programming doesn't function correctly on at least my disc 4 and 6 (individual episode selection is broken), and maybe more, from reading the posts in the discussion area. I'd send it back for replacement, but unless there is a re-release, I doubt it would do any good...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|i really have the hardest time believing that fox could have had the nerve to cancel this ridiculously brilliant show.
0142410349|5.0|I am 9 years old and enjoyed this book. I especially like how it is written and the story line. It is full of fantastic mystery all the way up until the last sentence. There ae three adults who are trying to kill a fox who is eating some of the food from their farms. The adventure is all about Mr. Fox trying to get away from the farmers and still trying to feed his family and friends.  It was fun to live the life of each character from the adults to the foxes, moles, rabbits and all the other animals. If  you like mystery and adventure you will love this book.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Once in awhile a movie comes along that instantly draws you so deeply into another world that you just don't want it to end. Where every shot, every frame, is a surprise. Where you marvel at how someone could come up with such a complete universe where you never want to leave...<br /><br />My friend watched \\"Spirited Away\\" and then she called me and said in a reverent tone, \\"you really have to watch this. I'm going to save the netflix DVD until you can see it.\\" I don't care for japanime, so two weeks went by before I finally got around to watching it. But from the moment the film started, the house could have burned down around me and I would not have stopped this movie.<br /><br />The story is about a ten year-old girl named Chihiro, who is traveling through the countryside with her parents on the way to their new home. Taking a shortcut, they get lost in the forest and ends up at a hillside tunnel. The parents decide to go exploring, but end up in a strange, deserted village. Chihiro is separated from her parents and left alone to discover that the world in which she now finds herself trapped is the spirit world. \\"Spirited Away\\" is about her journey home. Along the way, she meets a panapoly of fantastical creatures, must work as a slave in a bath house and battle the unknown evils of the spirit world - all the while struggling to retain the memory of her former life, her parents and her name, which she needs if she is ever to escape.<br /><br />I can't recommend this film highly enough. There is more inventive genius wrapped up in this film that I can't wait to watch it again, knowing there will be plenty of new discoveries awaiting me.  Even if you aren't a fan of Japanime, this film is sure to please.

B000OVLBGC|4.0|When I first started watching this movie, I thought I was in for a polemic rave about the Communist regime in East Germany....which it is to an extent. But it is so much more.<br />A man employed by the Stazi police in EGermany sets up a listening post near the apartment of a left wing playwrite and his lover. He \\"spies\\"on them by listening in through the multiple microphones implanted in the apartment.<br />Along the way,  he somehow gets involved in their lives and starts trying to influence or manipulate the outcome of the story. I don't want to spoil the ending, so I won't say more about it, except to say it is both tragic and beautiful.<br />I was extremely moved by this movie. It bears watching again in order to savour each scene.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Many comic books and graphic novels have been turned into movies for the everyday viewer. Movies like Sin City, the Hulk, Spider Man and countless others make it to the big screen because they are action packed, exciting and at times, very truth telling. V for Vendetta is at the top of the list! This futuristic flick is far from Science Fiction, it is our reality presently in a nut shell!<br />Having added this movie to our personal collection we watch it as much as twice a month and as a commemoration to the 5th of November we are having another showing.<br />Our teenagers have memorized this movie and can tell you word for word the dialogue V shares and the wisdom he espouses.<br />I recommend this flick to anyone interested in enlightening themselves on the current state of tyrannical governments around the globe. V displays the power and courage that is needed by each individual to stand up and call these governments precisely  what they are Psychopathic.<br />If we as humanity do not stand up and share what we all seeing happening around us we too will be the prisoners of some torture chamber in some countless location around the world.<br />Will you choose to watch V and take a glimpse of what might be around the corner for your town or community? Put on your Guy Fawke's mask and make a statement for truth.
B000RW3YYA|4.0|I just finished watching the third season DVD set, and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show, I was rather disapointed.<br /><br />Here's why.<br /><br />(Warning!  Spoilers below!)<br /><br />First, story arc failure. I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith, but it just didn't happen.  Sure, they appear in a few good episodes, but it didn't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.<br /><br />Second, killing off Dr. Beckett.  I really liked him.  Maybe I'm dating myself a bit here, but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head.  This very lovable character will be missed.<br /><br />Third, rehashing the replicators.  With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series, why do the replicator thing all over again?  It was original enough on Stargate SG-1, but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too.  Are they going creatively bankrupt already?<br /><br />Fourth, rehashing old sci-fi standbys, like the \\"weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other\\".  Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode \\"The Naked Time\\" and wasn't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series?<br /><br />Fifth, bringing back a whole ship full of \\"ancients\\" just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode.  So, the \\"ancients\\" have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device.  We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two.  Couldn't an \\"ancient\\" or two have been spared and used as secondary characters?  Wouldn't that have been interesting?  They could have helped explore the rest of the city.  Their ship could have been recovered.  There's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.<br /><br />Sixth, lack of character development.  Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom, but she seems little more than a pretty (to say the least) face with a great body who never uses contractions (reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie) and tilts her head a lot.  And then there's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he's still there.<br /><br />Still, the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of.  And, of course there's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets, and that greatly adds to the value of the set.<br /><br />I haven't seen any of season four.

B000HLDFM2|5.0|This movie is what really got me into the Asian cinema scene, because it's so damn good.  Too bad there aren't many other movies like it.  It is also really hard to explain why this movie is so good too.  Don't get me wrong; Oldboy is sick.  I don't really want to get into that without spoiling the film.  Let's put it this way; any unsettling thing you have read or heard about this movie is probably true.  Just trust me.  It is super sick...and I would not have it any other way!  Let me remind everybody that this movie is not for everyone.  I have very very very particular tastes in everything and what I like is probably not for most people.  This being at the top of my list.  If you want something different and are bored with the cookie cutter Hollywood trash that spews out every month, see this movie.  I recommend this edition if you can find it cheap.  I'm not into special features that much, but if you are , by all means buy this one.  It has two whole discs loaded with commentary, deleted scenes, making of, ect.  Whats really cool is it comes with the first volume of the manga, which is a pretty good read.     In closing, this movie is awesome...if you are sick in the head (which I think we all have to admit we are).  Not for the squeamish one bit
B00005K3OT|5.0|CHOCOLAT is one of the few movies I could watch again and again. The cast is superb - blending humor and pathos in a mix as smooth as the chocolate stirred up in the film and every bit as delicious. Juliette Binoche and Johnny Depp's romance is tasty and Judi Dench's crusty grandmother role ensures the viewer will not O.D. on sweetness.
B000HF2NF8|5.0|In this day, this time, this place, this illusion that we have no control, no place, no will, no choice and no power we find the flaw in our thinking.  We miss the opportunities that are placed before us to see and then do something about it.  I know it's hard, that you and I wish or would rather have someone else handle what we see, what we feel creeping in and that fear grips our hearts as each day passes with the situation only getting worse.

B000VSBX34|5.0|This terrific looking restoration with crisp surround sound is a time machine to another era.<br /><br />Ringo's drums are sharp in \\"You're Gonna Lose That Girl\\" and Lennon's acoustic guitar has real presence in \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away.\\"  I liked the electricity of Harrison's Rickenbacker in \\"Ticket To Ride\\" and the heartfelt bass of Mccartney in \\"Another Girl.\\"  I have never heard the Beatles like this and if you have a high end home theater system, you can shut your eyes and swear they're in the room with you.  After all, the music is what matters and the incredible remix of the seven original songs is stunning.<br /><br />The original idea behind \\"Help\\" was to take a look at the real life of the Fab Four.  But the sex and drugs made it unlikely so a ridiculous plot was formulated as an excuse to travel to the Austrian Alps and the Bahamas.<br /><br />The intervening years will melt away as you sample this delightfully poignant celebration that reminds us we are indeed mortal and as the years pass some of us have already faded away.  But with a little help, and a little love from our friends, the melody lingers forever and maybe that's more than enough.  All we have is this moment.  It's all we'll ever have.<br /><br />Recommended -- for the music and the memories.

B000OY8NII|1.0|Here's the latest lousy high concept, THE X FILES meets NORTHERN EXPOSURE.  This is a low budget, cheap looking show that tries to be funny and misses by a mile.  I don't get why the Sci Fi channel has so much trouble coming up with good orginal programming to match BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  How many X FILES meets (fill in the blank) concepts do they have to air on that channel?  What of the biggest stumbling blocks about this show is that it is far too complicated for its own good.  The acting is uneven and the more you watch it the more you lose interest.  I got the box set as a gift and traded it at Amoeba for DISTURBIA.

1595141715|5.0|I'm finding myself at a loss of what to say.  This book is gripping and not the normal kind of thing I would read. For one, before I even opened it I knew that Hannah would be dead, so I knew I wouldn't have the HEA I'm always after.  For two, it deals with the subject of teen suicide, which is a bit darker than what I read about.  I like the feel good books, simply because I deal with enough darker subjects in real life so books make a great escape for me.  This book made me think.  A lot.<br /><br />Hannah had thirteen reasons why she killed herself.  And each of those reasons was sent a copy of the audio tapes to listen to as to why they played a part in her deciding to end her life.  And while I read each of these reasons, I couldn't help wondering what would have happened if just a small part of the scenario had changed in each of these stories.  Would Hannah still have made the decision she did to end her life?<br /><br />Mr. Asher writes a great story.  I found myself reliving (rethinking?) my teen years a lot while reading this book.  Unfortunately, I think we're all affected by suicide in someway ~ whether knowing someone who thought of it, who did ~ or whether we're one of the ones who's contemplated it.  This made me think of how our actions really do affect the lives of others.<br /><br />This book is Excellent. Read it.  I urge you.  But if you buy it, go to amazon.com instead of the bookstore.  You'll save $7.00 ~ which is what I found out after coming home from B&N with my coveted purchase.
B00004RFFI|4.0|[[ASIN:B00004RFFI Twister]] Excellent DVD  was worth buying kept you on the edge of your seat, it was almost like being in a twister.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|And just when people thought Britney was gone, she comes back...with MORE.  More edge, more sound, and more Britney!  I love this album, every track is just great! My favorite tracks are \\"Radar\\", \\"Piece of Me\\", and \\"Why Should I Be Sad\\". The whole album is just non stop dance and will put you in a good mood after a hard day of work or just whatever you're stressed out about!
B000TGJ8CQ|2.0|Okay, let us start with the positives.  Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast are fantastic.  Special affects are nice. and the whole look into the future for two minutes thing is a neat and original idea.  Action scenes are fun and fast paced.    But...    The writing is terrible.  The FBI knows that an A-bomb is going to be detonated and they know where.  But instead of detective work and attempting to find the people who are going to detonate the bomb, they are dumping their resources (not all their resources but the use of even one agent for this would be criminal) into finding a guy who can see 2 WHOLE MINUTES INTO THE FUTURE!!!  Yeah, that is useful.  Julianne Moore's character thinks she can use Cage's ability to find the bomb which is somewhere in L.A.  Of course, if the bomb isn't within 2 minutes travel time of her office her plan won't work.  Oh, and her bomb squad will have less than two minutes to de-activate the bomb.  Oh, but wait the films premise gets even weaker from here.    The bad guys are also looking for Cage's character.  How do they know who Cage is?  How do they know what his power is?  How can they be as stupid as Julianne Moore by thinking that Cage could stop them?  We don't know and we are never told.  The ending of this film is terrible and cheats its way out of having to explain most of the problems with the script (But I won't spoil it).      The bottom line is that Next is a movie with a premise, a twist, and without a plot.  It is a fun movie to watch, as long as you turn your brain off early in the film, and I think it is worth a rent.  But it is a little disappointing that the movie producers couldn't find anyone to write a decent script for this movie.
B000TGJ7ZY|3.0|It could be a great Blue Ray transfer but they have done a lousy job again. This movie deserves a better treatment.
B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|This Blu-ray disc is, to put it simply, awful. Reading serious professional reviews, I didn't have high expectations, but I love the movie and gave it a chance. I wish I didn't, becouse I have seen upscaled standard definition discs that look much better then this. Colors are drab, picture is both grainy and fuzzy, awful, awful. To be fair, there is a lot of supplements, but I didn't look at them, frustrated by the scandalous picture quality of the movie, which should be the thing that really counts here. I really tried to find what was so nice about the disc that other reviewers praise, but couldn't find that. I just hope they do a remaster, like they did for \\"Fifth Element\\" which now looks and sounds great. \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is not that old a movie and can look much better. Look at \\"2001\\" Blu-ray (although, it may not be fair to compare, since it's source was 70mm film). Just look at any other Blu-ray or HD DVD disc, becouse this one is simply THE worst HD disc (both Blu-ray and HD DVD) I have ever seen. Beware!!!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Upon hearing this, it seems like the focus here is more on Chester and less on Mike. To me, Mike is the better vocalist, while Chester sings like Eric Cartman throwing a temper tantrum. This is not a good recipe for Stinkin' Park at all.    The single \\"What I've Done\\" was featured at the end of the movie \\"Transformers. It was the only bad part to end an awesome movie. Even my girlfriend said it was horrible and would rather hear thrash metal than this and she doesn't even like thrash metal.    The album sounds like the band is shedding their rap-rock roots in favor of an emo friendly sound. I understand a band must grow and try different things, but the question is if a band is trying to do different things can it be done right? It didn't work for Metallica and Avenged Sevenfold (who suck also). It's not working for Stinkin' Park either.    If you want hard rock or metal done right, I suggest you go out and buy Pantera's Far Beyond Driven and you will quickly find out that Stinkin' Park doesn't have the talent to even be in the same class as Pantera. Trust me.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|Love this set! I've been waiting for years to get Next Gen and I'm glad I waited. The overall quality is great, though there are a few early episodes that look like straight from video transfers....    The special features are a Trekkers delight, tons of behind the scenes info and rarely seen interviews.     If you love Next Gen - buy this set!
B00005RHGL|5.0|As the back of package says, this is \\"one of the 5 greatest Westerns ever made\\". How the story goes on the timeline along with the real history is just great and never gets watchers bored. I personally like Val Kilmar's acts the best as dying Doc Holliday. Probably most of those who love this movie say the same. The interaction between Doc and Johnny Ringo is worth watching besides Wyatt Earp's reputation. This movie is great for everybody: from casual watchers to hard-core westerners. If you are one of each or somewhere between, I suggest you to check this out!!  SY
B000002GYR|5.0|This early submission by Tom Waits may be his most accessible, most diverse album.  From the almost Folk-ish opening of Ol' 55 to the ending Closing Time Tom transverses many a musical genre in an amazingly short period of time.      People are constantly referring to this album as a  collection of \\"drinking songs\\", amdd while it's true that's a particular genre that Tom develops over time, that's really not the case here.  Yes, there are some of that sort, but they do not predominate.  This is more a straight out blues album with drinking references than a besotted drinkers anthem.    Of particular note are the opening Ol'55 and it's immediate successor, I Hope I Don't Fall In Love with you.  The former is a folk song at heart, the latter a blues dirge of surprising optimism.    Along the way we have the country-ish Rosie, the fiery Lonely and the torcher of a lament, Ice cream Man.    Tom Waits is a national treasure.  He got pigeon holed along the way as a drunken blues artist--not with reason, I will admit.  He is more than that of course, and one has to look no further than this work to see that.    If you have never really given Waits a try, start here and move on.  It will be a remarkable and joyful journey!
0375847227|2.0|I must say, I saw the preview for the first book in this series and was completely taken with it.  It looked like exactly the type of thing I love.  But I did some digging first, because I heard my sister make a comment about the series that piqued my curiosity (and foreboding) about the author, not just the book.  Among other things, I discovered that Mr. Pullman is an atheist (okay, fine, it's a free world, right?) and that in these books, to an increasing extent, he shrouds an attempted rebuttal of religion, faith, and God Himself with some spewings about how \\"it's just how he perceived God for the story,\\" and so on and so forth.  Most of us know that.    It is possible for Christians to support and love fantasy, even \\"secular fantasy\\" (which arguably is the home of the wonderful, outstanding Harry Potter series), unless it's not fantasy, but rather one man's degrading and absolutely off-center portrayal of many things that believers profess.  No doubt to erase questions in his own mind, Pullman, like others, has insisted that the portrayal of God and the Church (what an original \\"fantasy\\" subname for the real church, eh?) is a completely generalized treatise on religion.  Again, if that were the case, fine.  Religion is as manmade as a microwave.  God, and faith, however are NOT, and this seems to be something Pullman believes he has tapped into.  Indeed, he has dabbled in something deep (which I think he will regret at some point, either in this life or the next) but it has nothing to do with truth.  Rather, escapism.  That's where the fantasy comes in for people like him.    But the whole point of this review is to caution other Christians or even  others who hold to no particular faith but want to avoid the occassional grotesque offering of children's literature.  As an example:  Most of us, Christian or not, can find something about C. S. Lewis' The Chronicles of Narnia to cherish.  For most of us, it's a wonderful tale (but not a story, in this respect) that speaks to us on a spiritual level, as well as a delightfully engrossing, humorous, and entertaining read.  And even non-Christians usually agree with the latter.  They're just good books.  In more ways than one.  However, Pullman disagrees.  This quote of his, among others, was enough for me to chuckle to myself and decide that Pullman's work will never intentionally be read or seen by me:      \\"But there is no doubt in the public mind that what matters is the Narnia cycle, and that is where the puzzle comes, because  there is no doubt in my mind that it is one of the most ugly and poisonous things I've ever read.\\"    I sense poison indeed, but it's coming from another direction entirely than Lewis.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|Sky Blue Sky is an album that is at one sweet and soulful.  The melodies are Southern California-ish with a blues twist.  An album of love and love lost, this is one of the cleanest and most emotive works I've listened to in a long time.    The acoustics are sweet and the electric counterpoint somewhat disharmonious but engaging and stand in optimum counterpoint to both the acoustics and the vocals.      Particularly engaging are the opening track, Either Way, which is an unusually wistful tune, the bluesy Hate it Here, a song of love lost, the title track which is easy listening at its best and the closer, Walken, the most morose yet engaging true love song I may have ever heard.    I have to admit that Wilco is a band that mostly has passed me by.  My son gave this to me as a gift and I have listened to it for a bit every day for 3 months.  It's an album that gets under your skin and that begs for another spin.  What more can you ask for?    The DVD portion is fine--but the bottom line is that this is an ageless album both musically and lyrically.  For those who crave intelligent, tuneful rock, this is an A1 pick!

B000U7169W|3.0|Rather than review the acting and overall story of this movie, my review will focus on the BD transfer.  I would give the picture quality three stars.  The picture quality in the first half of the movie is bad.  The outside shots are either too blurry or too soft.  I was especially disappointed in the early scenes where Hillary Swank is exploring the forest.  But this doesn't compare with the evening/low light shots.  This movie has a lot of night time shots and boy does the picture take a nose dive. The picture is filled with a lot of grain and the image is over saturated. A lot of the skin tone from Hillary Swank is lost during night shots. Her skin looks a little on the gray side.  All is not lost.  In the second half of the movie, picture quality really improves.  The day time shots in particular show a lot of detail and depth.    As far as audio is concerned. The audio in the first part of the movie was pretty bad. It was hard to hear conversations. I had to boost up the volume in my receiver a number of times. However, things pick up in the second half and the audio sounds clear. They even make good use of the rear sound channels.    Overall a disappointing transfer.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|After Gone in 60 seconds, in this movie the character played by Nicolas Cage (Cris Johnson) has supernatural ability to see into the future for 120 seconds.  It turns out, that besides approaching and attracting a girl in a restaurant, this time limit is also sufficient to agree to cooperate with the FBI and to plan the whole-scale anti-terrorist operation. Here comes my perplexity. To catch a sight of those forthcoming events Johnson is simply staring at the ceiling, whereas to specifically locate the bomb, he is being forced by a government agent to watch breaking news. The girl is being taken hostage, but terrorists, even knowing about Johnson's phenomenal ability, better take their chances shooting at him, rather than at the hostage. At the end, though, it remains uncertain, whether the FBI agents, the girl and the viewer is persuaded that the power to see the future can prevent somebody from pulling the trigger.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is one of the few musicals I actually love. This show was simply amazing and it's  not hard to understand why it's become such a hit. The musical score as well as the lyrics are amazing and engage you from the first second of listening.

B000NA28IE|4.0|The movie was ok and I understand th eneed to deviate from the original book but somethings were just off the wall.<br /><br />The graffics in some parts were a little substandard IMO, and the crew of the movie could have done a little better quailty work in general. Acting was a little weak in a couple spots as well.<br /><br />For the most part it was a good movie, but there are some areas that kind of spoiled it for me.
0385486804|5.0|I thought this was an excellent character study.  Jon Krakauer is a wonderful descriptive author.  His blending of his own experiences with the main character of the book is a unique stile of writing.  I recommend this highly.
B000JLSLZG|5.0|For as old as this movie is it's great. They really did the best job of making a massive book into a movie. It's a long movie but it's worth the time invested to watch it all.<br /><br />I picked this up not to long ago and fianlly had the time to sit down and watch it and damn was it worth it. being that this movie is from 1981 the acting did leave a little to be desired but was also far better than a lot of older movies. The graffics were done as best as possible at that time and worked rather well for it.<br /><br />All in all it's the best you're going to come to the book. This is a classic that everyone should have.<br /><br />Not too great for kids to be watching though with the level of violence and nudity in it. Also the way things are done most younger children don't need to be exposed to the deception and seduction that is protrayed.

0763627410|5.0|I went to a workshop at the local library on early literacy. This was one of the books the librarian recommended I try. This is the first book my son would sit through at 5 months. I tried other books every day, but could only get through a couple pages. We'd alway end up right back at Hooray for Fish.     Positives of this book:   - Bold colors and stark contrasts  - Simple pictures    - Great rhythmic text. \\"Upside down and round and round\\" \\"so many friends, so many fish. Splash, splosh, splish\\"   - There are a couple pages that could be search and find pages. \\"Can you find a fish that looks like a pineapple?\\"

One can never have enough batteries especially for a camera! I have learned from hard experience that 3rd party vendor batteries just do not work as well or as long as an original Canon battery pack.<br /><br />Which is why I only purchase Canon made battery packs. This one is no different than the other Canon battery packs I have purchased, holds a charge a long time and when in use gives me 1500-1800 photos per charge.
B000AGTPUK|4.0|An excellent movie that warms the heart when the weather turns cold. My children have really enjoyed watching this movie over the past weeks. Can not wait till the holiday season starts so that we can all enjoy it as a family. Highly recommended for all out there as its evident that your childhood lasts your entire lifetime & you never out-grow it.
0805079831|4.0|I have mixed opinions about the book, but they lean toward the positive.    I have no doubt that any historian that has studied these issues in depth will have issues with the book because it's so clearly one-sided. Although I am sure that the nefarious intentions described in the book proably existed, and are generally true, things are rarely as one-sided as they are made out to be in the book.    But if you go into it expecting to only get one side of the story, it's very good food for thought. Particularly if you haven't followed the economic history of the last 50-100 years or so that closely, you will be able to trace a lot of the problems with today's top-heavy economic organization back to their origins, at least as a starting point to further research. There's a lot of ground covered in the book, and I think it's an important book for under-read North Americans to read (I include myself in this category).    Admittedly, though, this is one of those books that trendy liberals will put on their coffee table to display their liberalism, after reading only about the first couple of chapters and putting it down permanently. It's not likely to be a book to spark serious debate because of its clear partisanship.

B00005ATQ9|5.0|Having finally seen the film, I am now curious to read the novel.  Kubrick's three-hour epic requires a bit of patience but it is worth all the time you will need to watch it.  It is set in beautiful countrysides, with lovely costuming and makeup, as well as fine performances and an appropriate score.  I would nickname it \\"The Rise and Fall of Barry,\\" since that's exactly what happens:  Ryan O'Neal portrays a poor Irishman who yearns for his cousin's affections but ends up having to leave town, joins the British military, and then becomes a spy when captured by Prussians.  He builds his fortune by gambling and making social connections, but this leads to his downfall, as shown in the second half of the film.<br />He marries a woman of means and has a son with her, but he does not truly love her or his stepson, whom he treats so badly that he sets in motion a series of events that lead to many misfortunes.  By the end, Barry is a shattered man, having lost his leg after a duel with his stepson and having lost his biological son as well due to an accident.  Needless to say, he loses his wife as well and is sent back to Ireland in disgrace.<br />Call it a cautionary tale.

It is nowhere near as good as I remember\\".<br /><br />I agreed with her.<br /><br />I remember the film as being so powerful all those years ago........ now all we could see was some stiff acting, and poor characterization that made us not really care if Ali's character died or not.<br /><br />Certainly a far cry from the LOVE STORY we remembered.<br /><br />Another dissapointment from the 70s was BRIANS SONG.<br /><br />Seeing it again thru older matured eyes, it was too short (only a 71 minute movie) that never really developed the relationship between Piccolo and Sayer.<br />It looked like a made for TV movie<br /><br />I think some of today's actors are really better than we give them credit for as we remember some of these older film actors thru rainbow tinted glasses
0316067598|5.0|This book was well written- Fast moving and intense.    It should be required reading for all high school students- so they can experience first hand what sacrifices the military makes- to preserve our freedom here at home.    I am glad that Lutrell tell it like it is- War has no place for a liberal media involvement in special ops.  He and his comrades in Special forces deserve the eternal thanks and respect for their service and sacrifice- on behalf of the free world.
0743298039|4.0|This book is a Merchant-Ivory film waiting to happen.  A run down estate on the moors in England, madness throughout the generations, a well developed plot and characters that draw you in yet somehow unnerve you all make this a compelling read and potentially a wonderful film.  As I was reading I couldn't help but play casting director (see one of the other reviews for details on these characters). Helena Bonham Carter as Margaret, Dame Judi Dench as Vida Winter and a special appearance by Anthony Hopkins as John-the-dig.  I smell Oscar!    This is the type of book where you clear your claendar, light the fire place, pour yourself an aged port or a fine claret and get ready to enjoy a wonderful 'tale'
B000W1V44I|1.0|Way back when, well at the time anyways, it seemed that the Backstreet Boys had prematurely released a greatest hits album called \\"Chapter One\\". However...judging their two albums after it, it seems that Chapter One will remain their greatest and Chapter two will be horrible and painful to watch.    Now...onto the album at hand. Who knew that booting the group's most boring member would actually produce dull boring material? I mean, Kevin is gone and the music got....worse? How can this be?? People say that you don't notice he's gone...like that's a good thing? How would do you think that would make Kevin feel. Anyways..i disagree. He had a strong voice and sway among group decisions. they never showcased his vocals much but any documentary you ever watch of them...you see he had a big hand in decision making.    Hoaky? Cliche? Bland? Overproduced? Insipid? Um, yes,yes,yes,yes and um yes again. So sad too.    I love these guys. i devoted a significant portion of my teenage years hopelessly devoted to them. but...    My mom wouldn't even stick around to hear the album one time through. She's a fan also. MY MOM.    THEIR TARGET AUDIENCE. yes ladies and gent's. They've switched from teenage girls..to the teenage girl's mothers.    Okay. it's not all bad. Anything but mine has some life. But the rest is so calculated that the sum is wrong.     One thing they improved on is that their is a whole lot of audible harmonizing....painfully missing from Never Gone.    But what Never gone had going for it was some good material. good songs.    Unmemorable. a much better title. Try again guys, and try harder!!

I especially love how she revealed what everyone has wondered about \\"Why can't I meditate?\\" It's like the  skeleton in the spiritual closet being revealed. Everyone runs around saying \\"I meditate\\". But do they really? It's super hard as anyone who has ever tried knows. This isn't the only little skelton, that we all have, that she has choose to talk about. I highly recommend this book. ,

0375847227|5.0|In addition to the original and well-conceived story of this series, what struck me the most was Pullman's really great pacing of the whole thing.  Usually, stories have slower and faster moments to keep the reader moving along, but this series truly keeps your attention from the moment you begin until its conclusion.  You'll find it hard to put down, so I recommend either getting this omnibus edition with all three books included or at least getting all three books at the same time.  You'll be in agony waiting for the second or third book to arrive after reading the first!<br /><br />The His Dark Materials trilogy (The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, and The Amber Spyglass) is ambitious, original and intelligent.  While geared for and marketed toward young adults, the complex themes and undercurrents in the story are relevant and fascinating for adult readers as well.<br /><br />Kudos to Pullman for creating such a high-quality literature offering!
B000UOOT1W|5.0|I'll admit, I never knew more than a handful of this Latin rocker's tunes growing up, and until he released SMOOTH with R. Thomas, and THE GAME OF LOVE with M. Branch, I never bought a single album.  This one, however, has brought me up to date on the Carlos Santana of later years, and for new fans such as myself, it is the perfect compilation of some old and lots of recent hits.  I know the original fans of this icon won't appreciate that many of the early hits are missing here, but for a new recruit like me, it includes the well known older songs, plus all the recent ones and is one terrific disc.  It's already on REPEAT in my disc player.  Bravo!
0440238609|1.0|I hated the first book, hence I only got to about page 40.  Can't speak for the last two.  I found the first book completely non-engaging.  I found myself not giving a rats hoot about any of the characters. I found myself not caring if I ever read any further. Maybe I just didn't \\"get it\\", but I found the strange juxtaposition of a fantasy world with the real world as we know it very disjointed.  The blending in of the \\"Church\\", the \\"made up\\" places with bits of places that really exist, the made up groups of peoples that sort of corresponded with the real world were to me, just silly, not to mention confusing and annoying.  I couldn't tell if it was supposed to take place in the past, present or future. Was it Earth, another planet, another dimension?  Who knows and who cares?  Certainly not I!    I couldn't tell if there were bad guys, good guys, and what the bleep were these \\"daemons\\" that everyone had? And as for the plot...what plot?  I couldn't dig one out of this pile with a backhoe. To compare to other authors, I have found both Tolkien and Rowling books completely engrossing from the first printed word. I understood completely who the characters were, I loved them, both the good ones and the evil ones.  I couldn't wait to read the next page and the next.  These Pullman books are just...I don't know...STUPID!  BUT...go ahead and read them for yourself.  It seems I may be the ONLY one in the UNIVERSE that HATED at least the first one enough to NEVER read any of the others. Comments, anyone?

B000Y179KO|5.0|Four and half stars, rounded up.<br /><br />If you are an Eagles fan, you should buy this six-years-in-the-making album because who knows if the band members can stand one another long enough (or will come through another band member's hotel room with a chainsaw) to make another album together since this is the first studio album since 1979, \\"Long Run.\\"  The story was that the Eagles so hated one another on stage at times due to drug-fueled ego clashes that they vowed to never make another album until \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" -hence, the name of their live album. That said, this could be a collectors item.<br /><br />I found listening to the album quite fun to hear each of the four lead singer Eagles band members  singing songs.  What a treat to hear Frey, Henley, Walsh, or Schmit each sing different songs on one album and to be able hear some harmonizing!<br /><br />I think it's a great buy to get 20 songs for $11.88.  Maybe you'd rather pay .99 for song?  Not me.<br /><br />There have been complaints that this album is boring since the Eagles haven't done anything new with with their southern California country rock pop sound.  Who would like some rap or some other genre mixed in?  The trend today is for bands to change the style of their subsequent albums to do something new.  For every band that does that there is plenty of gnashing of teeth and pulling of hair.  Many wonder where the old sound they so liked went.  Others are delighted with the bravery to add a new twist to the band's sound.  I think there's a couple new twists in here.  I can only say most people who are Eagle's fans would be seriously disappointed to get an album without the classic Eagles band sound, which is what you'll get with this album.  If you are a past Eagles fan, you will still be a fan.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoyed with this album was the artistry to make the war protest songs.  I think the song \\"Long Road Out of Eden\\" is just perfect.  I think the middle-eastern instruments set the mood for the song and the slower tempo doesn't seem too last very long before you get some interesting lyrics and excellent guitar.  If a 10 minute song is too long, try the 18 minute song \\"Ordinary People\\" on Neil Young's Chrome Dreams II album.<br /><br />Disc 1<br />1.  No More Walks In The Wood 4:00 - Eagles great intro acappella harmony, slower tempo song.<br />2.

B000WSHF4E|1.0|What can I say, the 1st Elizabeth was simply great, the kind of movie leaving you riveted to the edge of your seat!    Unfortunately this one is very much the complete opposite. So yes the costumes are great and the few CGI special effects (basically the couple of minutes of action featuring the ships of the spanish Great Armada) are well made.    But apart from that it's a 2 hours torture that could have easily been reduced to a half-hour. There's no rhythm, it's very very slow, with many supposedly 'key' scenes just  dragging on & on & on (e.g. the execution, the baby, the kiss, etc etc...). The trailer pretty much shows what's worth watching out of the 2 hours movie, how sad is that?    Kate Blanchett's acting is possibly the only positive note overall & Clive Owen is pathetic as usual (though his worst performance is still Children of Men). As for Geoffrey Rush I really like him but he doesn't have much to do in this movie.    In the end, you feel the director made an attempt to depict some kind of intimate portrayal of Elizabeth: her fears, her doubts, her loneliness... Fine, but then stick to making some BBC TV documentary. Because for a full-length cinema feature it's definitely not good enough! Kapur should have stuck to the winning formula that worked so well for the 1st movie: the intrigues, the twisted plots, the action...    Sorry, just didn't do it for me.

It will be helpful for almost anyone, but especially to those in the creative field.

6305311463|4.0|The film opens with the twin towers standing proud and tall in New York City. We are in 1998. The US had not yet been the victim of that deep fit of terror fright which is just as frightening as space fright. It was a time when the US were already deeply obsessed by the end of the world (as always and ever in their short history), and since the USSR did not exist any more, and China was not yet seen as the new contender, they were exploring the danger from outer space anew. They could accept the idea of more or less showing a few Moslem pictures along with dominant Christian ones. The strict separation of religions had not yet reached Hollywood. The enemy that the US mind needs to be able to think the proper way was a big piece of rock coming from far far away in space and the size of Texas, read my lips of course. But why do the US always think the world as having to come to an end and why envisaging this end as having to be a fight, even against a piece of rock? If the world has to have an end, and it sure has to because nothing is eternal, why not prepare for death that may occur any time? If humanity has to have an end too and it will have an end since it had a beginning, why not just getting ready to meet that end in dignity? Why always see that end as a catastrophe? What's more why do the US always end at once thinking of themselves as the saviors of the world as soon as they speak of that end? The world will have to come of age and be able one day to face its future, no matter what, in other terms than a savior and a mass of repenting and grateful individuals? But the film is a lot more interesting when seen ten years after its shooting. The world can be saved by the human race itself. Good. We had not reached the great paranoia of climate change yet. To save the world one individual will have to sacrifice himself for it and that one is the father and not the son. That is a complete inversion of the Christian myth. But even better, in fact worse, that savior, that redeemer, that self-sacrificial person is a man, as if women were not yet of age for that kind of selfless sacrifice. But note that father has a daughter and there is no mother anywhere. Is it a sign of our times when families are broken up everywhere? Or is it a sign of the superiority of men, though there is another divorced couple with a son and the son is taken care of by his mother (inverted situation). So where is the real truth about this question? I personally have the impression that the film is ten years old and that in Hollywood they could ten years ago still produce such films that are definitely slightly male chauvinistic with just a light, very light touch of female liberation if not only female presence to avoid any gay ambiguity. Slightly pass&eacute;, and also a little bit long as for the scenes on the meteorite.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesthat redeemer, that self-sacrificial person is a man, as if women were not yet of age for that kind of selfless sacrifice.

0679731377|4.0|When I read the first two chapters of this book I was blown away.  The first is absolutely hysterical, and the second begins that way, but leaves you staring at the book in disbelief, unsure what to make of what just happened.  I couldn't wait to read the rest, but I have to say that I was a little disappointed.<br />While each story is very clever, and the connections that run through the book are fun to find, I found myself getting a little bored.  The chapter titled \\"The Mountain\\" seemed to go on for much too long, and wasn't as witty as the others.<br />Nonetheless, I think this one is definitely worth reading.  Even if it does become a bit slow in places, I can't argue with the mastery of Barnes in connecting all of these seemingly unconnected chapters, and in his ability to really make you think about the world around you.
B0000029PC|4.0|I have always admired Szell's recordings so I am going to take my time to listen to all of these and compare with a few DDD recordings of more modern vintage of single symphonies. These are analog from the late 1958-1960.  I just want to report that the packaging is without fault in my double CD,as much as one can expect for a single box,(flap type double- sided plastic insert) jewel box. The booklet insert is unusually complete and meets the usual Masterworks reputation with fun copies of early LP covers too. No cardboard. Amazon shipping process never ceases to wow. I am not a hi fi guru, but I will give these interpretations a good workout and make my comments on the recording quality and my views on same later.

Rather, it is a story to tell to your grandchild about how you loved their mother or dad unconditionally. The mom tells her child in a little song how she \\"Will love him forever\\" until the tables turn and her manchild has to love his mother FOREVER. I gave this book to a new grandmother for a shower present; I read it to the group and there wasn't a dry eye amongst us. It was WONDERFUL!!!!

B000V6BE6C|5.0|Once again has a well established group of our generation chosen to approach a different angle of hard rock.  And yes, I did refer to it as \\"Hard Rock\\".  For all of the critics on here complaining that they are sell outs, and that they have lost their metal edge....get with it.  If you are a true fan of music you will know that ALL bands end up different than they start.  Musicians are human too, and because of it they age and mature just like the rest of us.  This album's production quality alone gives it five stars.  The tracks are extremely catchy and well put together.  If you listen to this cd with an open mind you will like it through the first listen, and love it after the second.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|Anyone who was in the military or worked for the government during the cold war will find this moving.  Also, if you liked the earlier Tom Clancy novels this is a movie you must see.  When  you compare that era with what is happening with our own government, it brings up  the \\"Those who forget history and doomed to repeat it.\\"  What the East German police were doing to its citizens, isn't that far from what our own government has the power to do now.  Very thought provoking movie!

The best aspect: the soundtrack changed, thankfully, the only thing i hated about the theatrical release was the annoying soundtrack, but this versions is a million times better.
0743298039|5.0|Beautifully written a real page turner-subtle but yet gripping I loved it I see why it won the Quill award
B000BNI99K|5.0|Rod Stewart, in my opinion, merely plays a minor role in this collection; it is his phenomenal back-up musicians who are responsible for the flawless  renditions herein. While Rod's voice certainly blends well with the updated arrangements of these classic tunes, the band's musical interpretation of   each song within this box set is awesome. Kudos to the band!!!!
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Great CD!! I love every song!  It has turned me into a huge Brad Paisley fan!
B00005JPRD|5.0|The reviews of this movie in the media in general have been extremely mixed. But I have to say that in my opinion this is an EXCELLENT piece of film-making. If you like Julie Taymor's work you will love \\"Across the Universe\\" which blends art, music and the visual aspects of film-making beautifully to evoke an era and an unabashed declaration of love to art as the thing that makes humanity redeemable.      My sense is that if you enjoy theater then you will enjoy this movie. If you want Mel Gibson style narratives and linear plots then this will not be the movie for you.    As a number of the other reviews have pointed out, this is an impressionistic peice of movie-making.  Like the best of Almodovar's work or Cuaron's  \\"Y Tu Mama Tambien\\".  I was born in the early 60s so missed first-hand knowledge of what the late 60s were like (unless you count playing cricket with the neighborhood kids in the back land and trips to the park in our parents' Morris Minor) but the emotional resonances of this movie rang true to me in terms of my own feelings about that time period and these songs.    One of the archly intelligent things Taymor and musical producers T. Bone Burnett and Elliot Goldenthal did with the music was not to replay them note for note but to riff on them in the way a jazz soloist does.  We all KNOW these songs so well that we can put in the horn parts or the bass lines if we want them to be there.  This in turn allows the music to be fresh and familiar at the same time.  I very much doubt if there is any musical group since the Beatles whose works are so universally familiar that this would be even possible on such a wide scale, but the Beatles were that popular and that GOOD.     As with almost everyone else who liked this movie I'm still humming and singing Beatles songs aloud as I walk down the street weeks after I saw the movie for the first time.  My partner and I are planning to go again real soon and take a whole bunch of our friends with us.  In it's own quiet way, this film is a direct challenge to those of us who love art to place that art more visibly in our everyday lives.      That's a pretty remarkable thing to be able to take from a movie these days.  I would urge anyone who reads these reviews not to waste the opportunity to experience \\"Across the Universe\\" in a theater.  Even the big screen TVs that you can get now won't do the visuals justice.    This is a beautiful, evocative, intelligent and moving peice of film-making.  All around it's the best thing I've seen in quite a while.
0767836286|5.0|The first time that I have seen this movie was about two years ago. And, I was a bit disappointed in the fact that the 'good guys' did not win. However, I have watched it again and again recently, and I have realized that it actually showed the true aspects of our reality. It is an idea that everyone can be manipulated to do what the real terrorists wanted them to do or to \\"bring the bomb into the building\\" without their being aware of it.<br /><br />I would highly recommended this movie because it is closer to what is happening in our society, including the 9/11 events and other 'terrorist' attacks.
0156027321|4.0|Although it took a bit of work to slog through the first 60 or so pages, this book took off like a rocket thereafter...Wild imagination coupled with moral issues, and the never ending theme of  \\"The strength of the human spirit\\" made this book a wild ride with a great ending!  I would recommend this book to any avid reader!
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Bruce has done it again.  Every song on this CD was a winner.  This CD has some new rhythm and beats but it's still Bruce.  You can envision the words as you listen to the songs and play the video out in your mind.  \\"Girls in Their Summer Clothes\\" is one of those songs that you keep singing to yourself afterwards.  It's a keeper!
B000TFINY6|5.0|I am so excited that LOST is finaly being released in HD. Even better so on Blu-Ray! Which will without a doubt have a much higher resolution and sound quality than the ABC 720P Original Broadcast. Its a Must Buy!
B000TGCR38|5.0|I consider that Black Box was suspenseful, well acted and very much a thriller.  RPB, Massachusetts
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Some time ago, I watched \\"V for Vendetta\\" soon after it came out on DVD.  At first viewing, I felt that this film is quite remarkable.  This remarkable film was created by Wachowski brothers, whom also created the \\"Matrix\\" trilogy, which is one of my treasures. These films are gifts to humanity for they provided wonderful yet strong analogy of our reality.  If you look closely to these films, you will see the underlying messages as relating to our current situations.  While both \\"Matrix\\" and \\"V for Vendetta\\" presented the theme of control, \\"V for Vendetta\\" is the best presented as a government's control of the people.  This film brought about the idea of how media is being controlled to keep the people 'asleep' or unaware of government or of dictator's doings.  The common people portrayed in this film did not see how controlled they are until the up-lifting appearance of a character named \\"V.\\"<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I highly recommended this movie.
B000LC51TM|5.0|Amazing and powerful.  No one in the world today puts together a stage show like Rammstein.  Till Lindemann's lyrics get better with every album and the band constantly add new dimensions and musical depth.  In a world filled with vapid commercial music \\"product\\" like Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears, et al, it is refreshing to see something orginal and powerful, and not meant to please the masses.
0143038419|1.0|This book was recommended to me by people whose intelligence I respect, so I began it with the expectation of loving it. For the first part, I did indeed like it somewhat despite being annoyed by the self-centeredness of the writer. I found the visual, sensory description of Italy simply wonderful -- at first. But, increasingly, the sense that the author was using everyone around her (and her readers) wore me down. By India, I took a serious dislike to her story. By Indonesia, I couldn't stand her and her story and couldn't finish this tripe.
B000Y179KO|4.0|I feel like the Eagles wanted to copy Boston's absence between releases and The Eagles certainly did with a 28 year absence between studio albums.  If nothing else at least they give you around 90 minutes of music for all those missing years.  Is this cd worth five stars, hard to say.  As people, of course, will review this and trash it because they're still stuck in the past, this cd is still a good listen.  All the trademarks are here - harmonies and everyone pitching in to sing lead.  Mostly Henley and Frey, but Schmidt and Walsh each contribute a couple to the collection.  I always hate reviewers who compare to music in the past done by groups because each album should be different from the last.  In this case some reviewers are comparing this and want it to be Hotel California all over again.  News Flash \\"Ain't gonna happen\\".  Nor should it.  If you want another Hotel California or Long Run or On the Border, then keep listening to them.  This is actually a good cd if you're willing to separate yourself from life in the fast lane, check out of the hotel, cross the border and grow up.
0156027321|2.0|The author deserves praise for his creativity. This is an interesting story but it is probably not worth your time. I know a lot of readers who simply quit. I suffered through to the end. There is a hidden meaning, but you have to get through a lot of boring and tedious material to get to the end.     If you don't have patience with slow moving stories, then I recommend you skip this one. On the other hand, it is simply written and relatively short and if you enjoy philosophy and animal stories you may find this a pleasant read.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman has to be one of the animated best Christmas films I've ever seen! When I was little, I used to watch this over and over because I was so fascinated by it. One would think an animated film without any words wouldn't be able to hold a child's attention for very long, but this is a major exeption. There's something beautiful about the portrayal of the little boy's innocence and his vivid imagination. The soundtrack alone is enough to make you watch it multiple times. I highly recommend this film for children and adults!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A friend of mine wanted to see this movie in the theater and I had no idea what it was about.  I ended up with tears in my eyes with the masses of people standing up at the end.  I could not believe how relevant this movie is - how accurately this movie describes not only where our society is headed, but where it already is.    It's a lot of fun to watch too - great acting, great action, great dialog and so many characters who draw you into the story.     This movie uses lies to tell the truth - if you haven't seen it - do.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|I have waited a long time to post this because I wanted to get over the original excitement of the Smashing Pumpkins getting back together and touring the world with their Rock n Roll anthem rock.  Sadly, since summer has passed, I have not loaded this disc.  It is tired and just the sight of the jewel case makes me want to listen to something else.    I am not sure specifically what it is about this album that doesn't register with me, but there is no feeling that comes from it.  The other albums, you could really sense something in the abrasiveness of the music and Corgan's lyrics were equally as biting, but not here.  Instead what I found was another attempt at bringing back the dead, which is a mistake that too many artists make.  This album isn't bad enough for me to tell them to not make another record, but it is far from impressive and to be honest, at this stage of the game, I expect a lot more.
1400079179|2.0|I didn't see the movie, but this book is written and begs to be turned into a Hollywood blockbluster. Don't expect to read a great piece of literature here. It's entertaining in a cheesy way. Characters are like cartoon characters - they don't seem like real people.<br /><br />If you are looking for a \\"light\\" read perhaps on your next vacation then you probably will not be disappointed. It is fast paced fluff if that is what you're looking for. It has little educational value. If you just want to keep up with pop culture (which is why I forced myself to read it) then consider watching the movie - it will take less time.
0743455967|4.0|On Writing is a combination biography and advice on how to write.  Most of the information about his life is at least loosely connected back to how it affects his writing so there is a loose theme that ties it all together.  The tone is light and somewhat self-deprecating.  The book is also short enough that those who don't want an exhaustive biography need not worry.      It's worth mentioning that the section specifically devoted to writing is at least as minimal as the biography.  This is by no means an exhaustive set of rules and guidelines for writing.  If you want lots of structure and details, this is not the book for you.  He shares some things that he believes are important.  He outlines his basic approach.  And that's about it.      Overall, I found this book to be very interesting.  It was a well-written glimpse into his life.  He goes into some detail about the horrific accident he had while writing the book and that was certainly intense.  The advice on writing is well worth listening to and trying out to see if it works for you if that is your goal.  I would recommend the book to anyone who is a fan of King's and wants to know more about him or aspiring writers.
B0002SVW3O|5.0|As a huge fan of 1960s-1970s European psychedelic and progressive rock, \\"Berlin School\\" electronica, and American minimalism, I was delighted with this 1997 debut from Icelanders Sigur Ros. Stylistically, this album fuses elements of electronica, minimalism, the European avant-garde, and ambient styles (especially Brian Eno) with rock, and exhibits a level of studio wizardry that is vaguely reminiscent of psychedelic rock groups such as Pink Floyd during the 1967-1969 period.<br /><br />The overall mood of Von is windswept and grey, haunting, and at times, pretty creepy. A good example of the creepiness is provided by the heavily echoed \\"screams from outer space\\" on the 9'46\\" opening track (Sigur Ros), briefly at the end of Hun Jord, and on Syndir Guos. Interestingly, those screams made the hairs stand on the back of my neck just as readily as the bloodcurdling screams on \\"Careful with that Axe Eugene\\" (Pink Floyd, 1968). There are gloomy, brooding vocal parts scattered throughout the recording, although they do not comprise a large part of the compositions. Interestingly, the lyrics were written in a fabricated language called \\"Hopelandic\\" - the French band Magma (chamber progressive) did something similar in the early-mid 1970s in a language called \\"Kobaian\\".<br /><br />It is worth noting that the heavy opening of Hun Jord (complete with distorted guitar played at a crushing volume), the beautifully sad Myrkur, the title track Von, and Syndir Guos, in addition to the last few minutes of the final track Aukrym (albeit with backwards recorded parts) are the only pieces that resemble \\"songs\\", and for the most part, the pieces are instrumental and very lengthy. Although there are breaks here and there, musical themes are restated at various points throughout the album, creating a single larger work.<br /><br />Instrumentation is somewhat sparse, and electronic experimentation conducted primarily on synthesizers (possibly guitar synthesizers as well) dominate the aural landscape. Brief passages of electric guitar (heavily distorted in addition to clean tones) and acoustic guitar are present during the conventional \\"songs\\", in addition to bass guitar, drums, and very interesting percussion parts.<br /><br />In contrast to a lot of ambient recordings, which exhibit only extremely subtle permutations in musical themes within a given piece, Von is sprinkled with variations in tone and timbre, and displays use of both experimental and found sounds. This variability, coupled with the combination of vocal and experimental passages, in addition to the stark dynamic contrasts between the spacier passages and the heavy, \\"rocking\\" sections makes Von a very interesting recording.<br /><br />This debut album is recommended to those people that don't mind experimental approaches to rock music and are not put off by the absence of traditional song structure. In fact, I highly recommend this album to fellow progheads that are desperately looking for excellent music in the current prog scene.<br /><br />Further discussion of the band is provided on the Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock website - unfortunately it has not been updated.  However, the Prog Archives website provides a complete discography with reviews and should serve as a good starting point.sages of electric guitar (heavily distorted in addition to clean tones) and acoustic guitar are present during the conventional \\"songs\\", in addition to bass guitar, drums, and very interesting percussion parts.

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|It's true.  Nobody does Dylan like Dylan.  I have listened to Dylan so much, both studio, live and bootleg, and I know every song, every arrangement and every nuance due to the change in musicians over the years.  So...it's good to get a fresh take on his songs.  There is some amazing work on this collection including Roger McGuinn on One More Cup of Coffee and an amazing Senor by Willie Nelson.  It's all good.    And I for one think Dylan should qualify for an Oscar for I'm Not There.  After all, it's never appeared on an official release.  Does it qualify as a newly written song for a film?  How many artists are there with this kind of stuff in the can from 40 years ago?  He is the man.
1862055149|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this book is perhaps the book for Thai cookery published in English as it covers recipes ranging from street stall noodles right up to restaurant grade Massaman curry beef.  Thompson has used significant spaces explaining the characteristics of Thai cooking, the cooking philosophies, and the ingredients.    One thing that catches me is despite the cooking being very native in philosophies, the way Thompson creates flavours, and his demands on the exactness smacks me of Western (in particular, classical French) rather than Asian in attitude.  As an Asian it has been unusual for me to approach cooking from the exhaustively descriptive way.  We will state the food in Chinese cuisine should strive for colour, aroma, and flavour but we never quite make a big fuss about the philosophy behind it.  In a way I believe Westerners are reading too much behind it.    Much of the section on ingredients are useful for sourcing Thai ingredients, although I think for an Asian (Chinese in particular) the section will be largely redundant as it is likely he will find 80% of ingredients familiar anyway courtesy of they being Chinese in origin (eg preserved cabbage, fish balls, rock sugar).  As others have said, this book is very fuzzy in getting the right ingredients, which in my own opinion, is more French rather than Thai or Chinese in thinking.  I believe we should perhaps be able to relax on non-essential ingredients eg substituting cucumber for bell pepper if the purpose is to provide colour and texture - this is how Thai and Chinese cuisines operate, but apparently Thompson overlooks this point.  People living in the West may have problems finding certain ingredients, but I think for someone living in Asia, sourcing the right Thai ingredients shouldn't be a big issue.    Also bear in mind that in East and Southeast Asian cuisines, meat and vegetables are like garnishes built around the main staple - rice, so the amount of meat and/or vegetables usedwill be much less than the Western cuisine equivalents.  It is a fundamentally different cooking philosophy from Western cuisine, and this directly affects the cooking of Thai dishes.    Overall, I think this is a must serious Thai cooking for Westerners.  I understand native Thai foodies also recommend it for the authentic recipes.  I think for most cooks of Asian backgrounds, we should have no problems skipping the cultural context section and much of the introductions to ingredients as the underlying philosophies of Thai cuisine is shared by a lot of East and Southeast Asian cooking.  Simply jumping into the recipes.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Many have written great reviews of this awesome movie.  I just watched it twice again the last couple of days and have found things I missed in earlier viewings.  This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.<br /><br />Its fairly easy to perfunctorily view this film as a simple plot line: that is, man crashes in airplane, survives on island, loses lots of weight, grows beard, builds raft, gets back home, but, alas, not the ending he thought it could be. To view and absorb this movie on this superficial level is a waste of the art and symbolism that it contains.<br /><br />That's where the spiritual aspect of this film comes in that so many viewers have missed.  There is a great deal of spiritual symbolism on a deeper level.<br /><br />One reviewer thought it was weird that Tom Hanks made an imaginary friend in a Wilson Volleyball.  This is not strange at all.  I surmise that viewers that think along these lines have never spent great stretches of time alone without human contact.  To them I say, go camping alone for a month somewhere where you will not see people and you might begin to understand how \\"Wilson\\" helped keep Hanks alive.<br /><br />SYMBOLISM<br /><br />OK OK what is this symbolism I am speaking of???  The very last scene of the movie breaks us over the head with symbolism.  Hanks is standing in the flattest of the flat parts of Texas at a crossroads. Literally, he does not know what road to take.  Figuratively, metaphorically, his entire life is at a crossroads.  Chuck Logan has learned something new though.  He has been transformed by his experience and has learned how to listen to some voice deep inside instead of rushing around like a Fed Ex mad man.  He waits, contemplates until he feels his guide, the inner man, help him on his way.  This IN ESSENCE, is what this film is all about.<br /><br />THE WHALE:<br /><br />Whats with the whale and the spraying of the water.  Some people have missed that the spraying of the water is actually THE WHALE that has followed along with Hanks on the raft and has sprayed him, that is, woken him up out of his coma, at very key moments.  Some may think:  WOW, that is really far fetched.  Well then, I challenge you to go on a whale watch yourself if you have never done so.  When a whale comes as close to you as was accurately portrayed in this movie, raises its head out of the water, and its eye looks in yours and your eyes look into its eye, you can only come to one conclusion:  you are looking into the eye of an intelligent and sentient being that is quite capable of staying with Hanks.  Sailors have reported these experiences with whales time and again.<br /><br />No one has written about the GOLD WINGS symbol that Chuck Logan says saved his life.  Yes, that symbol saved his life but also Wilson saved his life, Kelly saved his life, the watch saved his life, and Chuck Logan saved his life by recognizing his powerlessness and transforming his life.owed along with Hanks on the raft and has sprayed him, that is, woken him up out of his coma, at very key moments.

B000002LQR|5.0|This is the best album they've put out, Don't get me wrong<br />I some of their other albums, but this album I can listen to strait threw.<br />\\"Braking the Girl\\", \\"Suck my kiss\\", and \\"Give it away\\" some of the best songs on this album.<br />Before Alice in Chains,Pearl Jam & SoundGarden there were the funky monks!!<br />I rate this album a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|TV shows that get canceled after one season don't get feature-length motion pictures made after them.  (Scratch that - they don't get ANY motion pictures made after them.)  So the fact that \\"Serenity,\\" the film spawned of Joss Whedon's lamentably short-lived \\"Firefly,\\" not only was made but apparently merited a \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD due to sales of the original edition, is quite unbelievable.  But it's a testament to just how good the series and movie really are.    Obviously, this is a must for any self-respecting Browncoat.  Two reasons why: First off, it's got the movie you love, plus a lot of special features thrown in.  Deleted scenes, a laugh-out-loud blooper reel, and some documentaries.  Some of these were in fact in the original DVD, but it's cool nonetheless.  And secondly, if enough of you buy this, there might be a sequel.  There are rumors about it.    But even if you're not a fan, you should try it out.  (Actually, get \\"Firefly\\" first and watch that.  The TV show is even better than the movie, and a lot of what happens in the movie doesn't mean as much if you haven't seen the show first.)
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|This is pureley information concerning this actual DVD boxset, as there are plenty of excellent reviews on the show itself, which I love (or wouldn't have bought it).    I was disappointed to find that the bonus features did not match up to what is advertised on the sleeve artwork. What the sleeve says is:  \\"Killer Special Features -   The Academy of blood - A killer course  Witnessed in Blood - A True murder investigation  Two episodes of 'Brotherhood'  Free episodic download of 'The Tudors'  The first two chapters of 'Dexter in the dark' - the new book  Two audio commentaries by the cast and producers  And much more!\\"    Aside from the fact that DVD bonus features should really just be about the DVD I just bought, not about trying to sell me some shows i have no interest in like Brotherhood and The Tudors, what's actually on the disc is much less - in fact the full list of features are:  \\"Witnessed in Blood - a True murder investigation  Two episodes of Brotherhood  Win an HD TV  Previews  Biographies\\"    At least there are the commentaries (just not on this menu) but i feel a more appropriate last bullet point on the sleeve would have been \\"And Much Less!\\"    Come on Showtime, dig out some interviews and put something juicy on there for season two. This was just a lame attempt at bulking out the first season dvd.
0440238609|5.0|His Dark Materials is not a children's book, nor is it meant to be one. No more than Animal Farm is, as George Orwell claimed, a \\"fairy tale.\\" Those that assumed it is a children's book made an improper assumption. Both works feature deep layers of allegory, many of which children will not come to appreciate until they grow older.    This work of literature presents the reader with a poignantly expressed case for spiritual freedom. Not atheism, not agnosticism, but freedom of spiritual choice. It blasts Christianity less than it highlights the detriments of blind dogma, the same kind of knee-jerk dogma that drives a number of reviewers here to condemn the book as \\"evil.\\" These people fear their children thinking outside the box, even if it furthers their spiritual understanding. I am a Christian, and believe the faithful must base their faith on enlightened choice. What is there to fear from a novel, when it is obviously a work of fiction? Those that assert this book is especially unfit for children are tacitly admitting children are most vulnerable to brainwashing... their own. Why else wail like the Sirens about \\"researching\\" the author, save to make haplessly sheltered children even more sheltered? Indeed, today's brand of \\"pray and get a Lexus\\" faith, as seen here perpetuated by ignorance not understanding, has fallen pitifully far from the original purpose.    Mr. Pullman also makes a powerfully written case for readers to be the best people they can be. Better people not in judgment, not in dogma, not in conviction, but in attitude and action. In that regard, Mr. Pullman's fantasy world presents a better case for Christ's compassion than the below basketload of pharisaical fundamentalists. To those of you more open minded to one of the greatest works of fiction from the last decade, purchase His Dark Materials for your own enjoyment and judge for yourself whether your children deserve such a treat.
B00003CXWV|5.0|A very sad movie of how a man wastes all his life selling drugs & spending time in jail.<br />I would recommend this movie.<br />I rate this movie a 5 of 5 stars!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I'm so impressed with Britney's new album, Blackout. Its really fun, easy to listen to and really catchy. It represents Britney the way she is now, really wild and a lot of fun. Sure, she is going through her stuff but I like the fact that she didnt try to make a comback album like her old music, this is the new Britney and she is fantastic! Everyone should buy her album!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This modern day classic speaks very clearly and powerfully to the advent of fascism in the western world and manages to be very entertaining to boot! 'V' is all about how a psychopathic regime has taken over in England's near future and how the main characters, those who aren't \\"in control\\", have all been personally affected and/or deeply wounded, or even killed outright by this regime.    The Guy Fawkes-inspired hero/anti-hero, V; one part Zorro, one part Batman, and one part George Galloway(-; has himself been a victim of the pathocratic government. Since choosing to transmute the pain caused by his oppressors, he makes it his mission to bring awareness of an alternative to totalitarian governance to the public.     Along the way, V meets Evey, a young woman with a history of her own. In one of the most potent and emotionally stirring scenes of any movie I think I have seen in a long while, V compels Evey to face her own fear and victimization by the regime. 'V for Vendetta' is therefore just as much a story about Evey's re-birth as it is about V's Vendetta and how he carries it through.    The film makes reference to world events that appear to be happening! This makes 'V for Vendetta' a very relevant and timely film. It was interesting to notice that the mainstream reviewers who spoke negatively about the movie at the time of it's release sounded so much like the pundit who is the government's propaganda mouthpiece in the movie!    Anyway, 'V for Vendetta' should be put up there on a list with other great films of a political nature: 1984, 'Z' by Costas Gravas, The Manchurian Candidate, and The Parallax View, to name a few. It is an excellent and informative movie that, like those just mentioned, will be remembered.
B000T05R8Q|4.0|well i have enjoyed this product since i have received it. yes the music is very dated, but since i never had a copy of it i am very happy with this set. i really like the way it was put together, as i am a collector of deluxe or box sets.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|I am a DIE HARD Johnny Depp fan. He can make ANY movie glow. This is a really good movie! I was worried it would detract from the original classic (which I have seen too many times to count) But, it was JUST different enough to flow on it's own.<br /> I HIGHLY recomend this movie!!!!
B000VNMMR0|5.0|An excellent movie with non stop action.Like the energizer bunny,it never stops.Why after hundreds of near death experiences, Bruces injuries are cleared by some form of instant plastic surgery..Pure fun.The one liners are perhaps funnier than the plot..As this is pure entertainment,you are expected to overlook the impossible.As to the plot,despite all the claimed safeguards,i believe could happen.My review applies to the single widescreen edition,released overseas,which has great sound and picture.Thank You.
B00003CXWV|5.0|I would not have liked this movie as much without Johnny Depp. Johnny just amazes me with his acting. He actually makes you SYMPATHIZE and feel SORRY for a DRUG DEALER! Well written, and well directed. I also liked Ray Liotta as the father. He did a great job too.

B000RG1FMO|3.0|I don't know what it is, but Graduation just doesn't have the same effect as Kanye's previous two efforts. It might have to do with the fact that while the other two had Kanye talking about things that people can actually feel and relate to, most of this album is nonstop ego. I mean, mcs have always had a swagger to them, but at least they had the rhymes to back it up (ie. Rakim). This album's not bad, but it's definitely not as good as his first two. And it's definitely not the best of 2007. O yeah, and Mos Def needs to start rapping again instead of singing in every track. And Kanye needs to collaborate with better artists than T-Pain and Lil Wayne (horrible voice and lyrics). Actually, maybe that's why I didn't like this album as much.    Favorite Track: Flashing Lights
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Note: Your \\"helpful\\" votes are appreciated. Thanks<br /><br />\\"North by Northwest\\" begins when a man is mistaken for a CIA agent. He  is soon caught up in deadly chase all over the country. It ends, of course, with the famous scenes on Mount Rushmore.<br /><br />I'll keep my review short. Longer reviews are best read after seeing the movie. Nevertheless, I would note that I was surprised at all the sexual innuendo in this movie. I wasn't offended, but Hitchcock was way ahead of its time on that score. The two lovers were really hot.<br /><br />I think we show too much nowadays and loose some of the mystery of sexual encounters. Just talking around a subject can be very sensual.<br /><br />I would also recommend \\"Vertigo,\\" by Alfred Hitchcock. This is one of the ten best movies ever made--very compelling.<br />[[ASIN:B000M2NLO8 Alfred Hitchcock The Masterpiece Collection - Psycho / The Trouble With Harry / The Man Who Knew Too Much / Vertigo (DVD)]]

1933784032|5.0|Having read this book I now know that: the Rebel Blockade Runner was initially the design for the Millenium Falcon.  And that becuase the Y-Wing fighter model was on an exhibition tour when needed during the filming of 'Jedi' they used a fan-art model instead.  The pages of this book are chocker block full of interesting trivia that will deligt us Star Wars fans, though this is first and foremost a picture book. Very detailed photographs of the models and puppets, even several fold-out pages.  If I should name anything that I would improve with this book is that it doesn't cover enough.  Almost all spaceships are there, and many aliens, but when you skip through to find something on, say, Jabba the Hutt, you realize that's not covered. I guess they had to limit the amount of stuff they could put into this book, and I sorely hope for a volume two.
B000ETRCMQ|5.0|This film caught me by surprise.  I had been warned by friends that the content was out of the ordinary, but I decided to watch it because I had purchased a copy and was involved in a class on diversity at the same time.  The film delighted me on many levels.  The characters, though all out of the ordinary, were very likeable and in many respects, the film is instructive about issues facing transsexuals, street hustlers, and the dysfunctional situations that give birth to them.  While the themes are very serious throughout, the film has a comic side that makes it a delight.  I would not recommend watching this with children, by any means ... but if you're willing to open your mind and to take a look at a side of life that is foreign to most of us, you won't be disappointed.
B000H309Q0|5.0|The Third solo record from peter it was probably the zenith of his creativity stilled linked to the first great era of progressive music witch began to change a few years after this release!  The entire band plays on this record including Sprit's guitarist randy california who died trying to save his son from drowning ( not confirmed) years later! Peters lyrics, guys drumming, Hugh keyboards and davids sax's and flute's are completely gothic years before the style  was invented! \\"Red Shift \\" opens and the VDGG classic \\"A LOUSE IS NOT A HOME\\" proves that as a writer and artist no one can touch peter hammill, although the band broke up this reassuring record keeps the faith alive! released in 1973.
0978607651|5.0|this book is well worth the investment. charley's simple drawings are inspirational. the design of the book compliments the artist's style.
0061150142|5.0|Jodi Picoult writes another gripping fictional story that can unfortunately be yet another true tale of teenage suicide.  It is written with such detail and description that one has a difficult time putting this book down. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading, but especially to those with teens. It reminds us to pay attention to even the smallest evidence that they might be considering this as a way to solve their problems.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Everything was already told by other reviewers. Maybe you like the movie, maybe you hate it. Me, I watched it 3 times (2 in English, and 1 in Russian). The movie is definitely worth your time. My only complaint is the main character is TOO silent. Of course, he is a spy and all that, but he should talk sometimes. I hope, DeNiro will continue this story.
B000W1V44I|2.0|Out of all the boy bands from the late '90s, the Backstreet Boys were, are and will always be the most talented. You can hate them all you want, but you can't take that away from them. This is why I still want to be a fan, but they're making it really hard, because it seems to me that they are trying to be something they're not. They know that they're too old to continue churning out bubble-gum pop, and something tells me that it's not what they want anyway. So what did they do? They took the adult contemporary route. Because, you know, they're adults now. So they have to make music for adults. Don't get me wrong, Unbreakable is a good album, better than Never Gone anyway. It's just not great, because it feels like the BSB are trying to be taken seriously instead of doing what they do best: making enjoyable pop/dance music. Someone needs to tell them that pop music doesn't have the same meaning it had 10 years ago. Take Justin Timberlake, for example. I'm pretty sure that the people who buy his albums aren't all teenyboppers. Treat Me Right is, in my opinion, the strongest track of the album, the only one where BSB really shine. The BSB used to make me dance and sing along with their tunes. And I wish things could still be that way.
B000VDDWE2|2.0|You can almost see the guys sitting around a table planning the movie. They want disasters. Lots and lots of disasters. Lets do a tornado. No, that's been done. How about a bunch of them all at once? Great idea! And there, let's have high winds. What about earthquakes? Do we have time for that, while we're putting all of New York under ice? Hey, Frank, how long did the other ice ages take to start? I dunno Bill, but didn't I read somewhere that geological time is like a thousand times faster than normal time? Yeah. Something like that. Let's see now, do you think we should put in some science to try and explain it? Uh, okay, we'll say it's, uh, that's it's due to global warming! Yeah! And it's believable, that's what I like about it!!    Come to think of it, maybe I'm being too generous with the 2 stars.
B000R8YC18|5.0|Great extras here - love the commentaries which have subtitle options.  They took time with the extra docs on the second disc, there's a nice one where they talk to cabbies and a great one that shows the locations then and now. (Although the documentary that has the most from DeNiro and the rest of the cast is clearly from some time ago and it would have been nice to know when.)<br /><br />The film itself remains a raw, audacious classic.  It's like an American Look Back in Anger, full of the bitterness and rage of its time.  The outcast filmmakers seize the medium for expression of the culture's hostility, confusion and prejudice.  It's the classic journey through Hell with an unreliable tour guide: Travis Bickle, the psychotic antithesis of the sensitive 70s male.  He's the Vietnam veteran who wants to be Ethan Edwards rather than Kris Kristoferson.  (He points his gun at the kids dancing to Jackson Browne on Bandstand.)<br /><br />My take:  the two scenes that don't feature Travis only happen in his head.  The first is the scene in the campaign office where Albert Brooks acts out the actions of someone disfigured in the same manner as one of Travis' later victims.  (Travis spends much of his date with Betsy talking about how \\"silly\\" this guy is, whom he's never met or heard.)  The second scene is between Iris and Sport dancing in their apartment.  When he turns on a record the music we here is Travis's theme - the sax melody that competes with the jarring street theme in the film's earlier scenes.  (Also, everything that happens after the shoot-out is either a fantasy or Travis's coma dream.)
0618680004|5.0|Until I read this book, I considered myself an agnostic.  Since I was born and raised in the Southeastern United States, it has always seemed to me that regardless of which church or denomination you are a part of the existence of God is pretty much assumed.  Although you may not carry your Bible with you everywhere you go or even attend church every Sunday, or you may even disbelieve Christian mythology entirely, you \\"know\\" that \\"He\\" is out there because \\"His\\" existance is treated as a forgone conclusion by everyone you encounter in daily life.<br /><br />So from that background I always sat on the fence thinking, \\"You know, according to the evidence I am almost certain there is no god, but I'm unwilling to cast aside the possibility entirely.\\"  If I never would have encountered in Dawkins' book the idea that the existence of god (big G or little g) should be considered a scientific hypothisis like anything else, I probably would have continued sitting on that fence.  I never would have considered the absurdity of simply assuming the probability of the existence of god based soley on the fact that everyone else believes in him.  Not to mention, the argument of intelligent design based on the concept of irreducible complexity attributed to my reluctance to hop over to the atheist side of the fence.<br /><br />This book helped me navigate my way through the \\"god hypothisis\\" in clear, easy to understand arguments.  I now find myself sitting comfortably with the other atheists in the world.
0553582038|5.0|If you haven't read all the books in this series - lucky! - you are in for some really entertaining reading.  These books are full of wonderful well drawn characters, interesting creative plots, great battle scenes and lots of different cultures and societies.  All the books are good and if this one gets some critism it's because the bar has been set so high by the previous installments.  Fantasy with a dollop of horror - at it's best.
B000W1V44I|5.0|Don't think any of their previous album can compete with this one. Truly think that a lot of people are going to be surprised when they hear this, as long as they give it a chance. It's a really strong effort from start to finish, check out the samples and you'll be able to tell.
B00005JPFH|2.0|For the third installment of the \\"Spider-Man\\" film franchise that was released in 2007, director Sam Raimi (who directed the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" films in 2002 and 2004) also took on the role of screenwriter.  While Raimi is no stranger to taking on both roles, 15 years had elapsed since the last time he both directed and wrote a film, and that was for the 1992 horror/comedy \\"Army of Darkness\\", which was part of the ongoing \\"Evil Dead\\" film franchise.  Assisting Raimi in writing the screenplay for \\"Spider-Man 3\\" was his brother Ivan, who also cowrote \\"Army of Darkness\\" in 1992, but had not done any writing since his involvement as a writer in the very short-lived (13 episodes) 1997 TV series called \\"Spy Game\\".  Assisting the brothers in writing \\"Spider-Man 3\\" screenplay was writer Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 \\"Spider-Man 2\\"; but it was the Raimi brothers who took full credit for writing the \\"Spider-Man 3\\" screen story.  Thus, unlike the first two \\"Spider-Man\\" films, \\"Spider-Man 3\\" was predominantly a Sam & Ivan Raimi effort; and the results were rather disappointing:  whereas the plot & characters of the first two films were interesting & engaging, neither can be said for the characters & plot of the third film.    The film begins with Peter Parker, alias Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), planning to propose to his long-time love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) after she is highly criticized for her role in a musical play and is subsequently replaced.  Being totally oblivious to Mary Jane's pain over this for the entire film, Peter is instead preoccupied with his own ego & glory when the city of New York presents him with an award.  In the meantime, an escaped criminal, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), is accidentally transformed into the Sandman while fleeing police; and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is bent on destroying Peter/Spider-Man because of his father.  Later, Peter becomes the host to an alien symbiont creature that brings out the worst in Peter & Spider-Man; but he manages to separate himself from the creature only for it to join with a photography rival, Edward 'Eddie' Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes a new nemesis for Spider-Man named Venom.     Thus, Raimi made the third installment of \\"Spider-Man\\" have three criminals: the Sandman, Harry as the new Goblin, and Venom.  On the surface, this sounds exciting; but in writing an engaging & character-driven plot, this becomes a liability when providing sufficient background & screen time to develop three completely separate characters, each of which must do battle with Spider-Man, as well as provide sufficient screen time to develop the relationship between Peter & Mary Jane.  The result: a plot weakened by too many antagonists, inadequate character development for the antagonists, and the unfortunate transformation of Peter from an engaging protagonist in the first two films to a non-engaging one in the third.  Especially damaging to Peter's character were the jazz club dance scene and his attempt at acting cool on the sidewalk (albeit under the influence of the alien symbiant), that not only turned the heads of bystanders (film extras) on the streets of New York in disgust, but many members of the audience as well.  So, in spite of lavish special effects of Spider-Man swinging his way through New York and doing battle with his three foes, the disjoint relationship between Peter & Mary Jane take away from the excitement of the final climatic battle, as well as the loss of interest already felt by many in the audience by the time the climax occurs.      With great special effects & wonderful cinematography, but a poor plot and non-engaging characters, I can only rate \\"Spider-Man 3\\" with 2 out of 5 stars.  A fourth film has been announced with Stan Lee as executive producer, but no announcements have been made regarding who will direct, write or act in this proposed 2009 release as the contracts that Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst signed were onlyfor three \\"Spider-Man\\" films.
038572179X|5.0|Atonement is a story about a wealthy family in England in the 1930's. It's mostly a stream of consciousness book, in the first 175 pages only 24 hours passes. The writing is quite captivating and beautiful, the scenes were simple, yet breathtaking, The perspective on each character was engaging. Even so, it made me feel claustrophobic, I wanted out of that day. (I know, that was probably the idea.)<br /><br />There are 4 sections to the book. The first section involves the family waiting the arrival of their cousins, whose parents were divorcing, and their oldest son, Leon, in his 20s, with his wealthy friend. Meanwhile the oldest daughter, Cecilia, is back from Cambridge, and bored while the youngest daughter, Briony, 13, is a budding novelist as well as a budding adolescent. Also on the scene is the charwoman and her son, Robbie, whose education the family has supported at Cambridge. Briony witnesses some interactions between Cecilia and Robbie, as well as between the 15 year old cousin and the wealthy friend. She jumps to conclusions, makes accusations, and her actions define the rest of the characters' lives and the atoning they do (or not.)<br /><br />The second section takes place 5 years later. It follows the character Robbie as he is a soldier in WWII, retreating with the army back through France toward Dunkirk. This section is war, up close and personal. It's unflinching and grim, with barely a glimpse of humanity or hope, which only serves to bring the horror in relief.<br /><br />The third section has Briony working as a nurse in a hospital in London as soldiers are brought for care. Here is another slice of war. Briony does a different kind of maturing in this section, and moves to make amends for her errors of the evening in the first section.<br /><br />The fourth section takes place in 1999.  It is Briony's 77th birthday, and there is a family reunion back at the site of the first section to celebrate. Briony is losing her mental capacity, and she reflects on her life and those of the other characters.he other characters.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|North by Northwest, the classic Hitchcock thriller, remains a timeless thriller even for today's standards. Cary Grant gives a humorous and believable part as he races to clear his name, and survive.  For anybody who loves the Hitchcock classics, this remains one of the best to this day.
0345494997|3.0|Loving Frank is a story about Mamah Borthwick Cheney, a woman who was Frank Lloyd Wright's paramour for seven years. Mamah was a feminist who had married late in life (for back in those days.) Her husband and she hired Mr. Wright to design their home, they became friends with the Wrights, and somewhere along the way Frank and Mamah fell in love and began an affair.    The story takes place in the early 20th century, when women didn't have the vote yet, and a woman was seen as her husband's property.  Mamah and Frank were eviscerated by the press.  Mamah left her family to live in Europe with Frank, afterwards they built a house on his mother's acreage outside of Chicago, where they lived together until the end of this story.    The characters in this novel are very unsympathetic. Mamah deserts her family, breaking the hearts of her very young children, her husband (who was loving) and her sister, who lived with them. Frank has affairs, lies, and doesn't pay his bills.    The book focuses a lot on how the press published lurid accounts of their affair. The book does what Mamah and Frank complain about the press: it takes away attention from the brilliance of Wright's work by putting his character under a microscope. It underscores that underneath, our geniuses are human. We expect them to be flawless, and are somehow captivated (relieved?) when they aren't.     It's apparent that the novelist, a journalist, worked hard to put the pieces of Frank and Mamah's story together. She lived in the town where Mamah and Frank had lived when they met, and became interested in the role that Mamah played in Frank's life. She did a tremendous amount of research.  I wish she had lived in a town where a more morally-inspiring genius had lived on which to ply her trade.
B00005JPD0|3.0|I expected way more from the hype about this. Instead I got a standard modern hollywood thriller, lifted only by Denzel; yet this is one of his weakest movies, I'd say.<br /><br />I know that opinion is not shared by most, but I do like Denzel in most films, and here he just can't rise above the cop-movie-gone-sci-fi premises. The time travel idea doesn't really seem that convincing, the concepts are dealt with far better in many other films (and Twilight Zone episodes), and the film is 30 minutes too long. I couldn't care much for anyone in it, so there was little suspense.<br /><br />I think Fallen and Training Day are twice as good as this, and even Man On Fire is far better, to name a few Denzel flicks I've enjoyed over the past few years.<br /><br />This ain't a bad movie, but no way would I want to see it again, for any reason. There are so many better time travel movies, and Denzel movies, and just movies period. It's only that so many new movies suck that makes this look decent next to them.<br />Not really worth watching.
0440238609|1.0|Upon finishing the first of the Pullman trilogy, \\"The Golden Compass,\\" I'll admit, I was captivated by the initial story line.  It was unique, entertaining, mysterious, and slightly bizarre.  I was very excited to read the other two books.  Unfortunately, I did.<br /><br />Basically, this is a series that explains to our children that the struggle between God and the \\"fallen\\" is all misunderstood--It is God, His angels, and followers who are evil, degenerate, and wish to destroy all things beautiful in life.  The fallen are portrayed as true angelic beings who wish to preserve life in all it's goodness.  In the end, God is actually represented as a decrepit, senile, old man and is killed.  Because God and His henchmen are now removed from the world, all creation is liberated and equality, true love, and justice established for all time.  Pullman even allows his two pre-adolescent hero's to fall in \\"love\\" and share a romantic Adam and Eve experience.<br /><br />Pullman claims to be a staunch athiest.  However, his writing's contain belief's commonly held by individuals considering themselves satanists.  I strongly encourage all people of faith to: first, read these books for themselves so that you can speak about this series with knowledge; second, do not allow young, impressionable children to have access to this series or the upcoming movie based on \\"The Golden Compass,\\" (apparently a watered down version of ideology); third, tell everyone who will listen what this series is really about; and finally, pray for the author, Philip Pullman, that God may show him true love through Grace.

B000VZC4CQ|4.0|A remastered version of Joy Division's second [and last] official album.  The second disc features a live show from 1980--unfortunately there are few left in existence and sound quality is always an issue.  Great to have another one however.    Recommendations for JD in studio, etc. still are the 'Heart and Soul' box [if you can afford it] and 'Substance' [if you can't].  'Closer' is a great album, but I prefer JD without P. Hammett strangling their sound.  You will get tracks from it on both of these compilations.    Speaking of a live disc, the best is still 'Les Bains Douches 18 December 1979'.  Absolute classic that captures the amazing power of this band.
1400034205|4.0|Razor's Edge was a book recommended to me by a friend from campus who very much thought it was a book that I, personally, had to read. I was very anxious, having already read \\"Siddhartha\\" and becoming interesting in these stores about \\"searching for oneself, for enlightenment\\". I have to say though, I agree with the reviewer Kirk. I was quite surprised to find out why Maugham himself said to \\"skip chapter six\\" when in reality this is the chapter that makes the book!     There is a lot of society throughout the book and very little of Larry, and that was one of the disappointments for me. But I understand the reasoning behind these characters as they pose as contrast to the character of Larry. I couldn't really care for the bourgeoise characters of this book and for the most part found them to be pretentious, that was the intention I think. Whenever Maugham writes about Larry my attention is at it's highest. And indeed, his stories are quite exciting and help explain the individual that is Larry. But... CHAPTER SIX is the VERY ESSENCE of this book. READ IT, soak it in, do whatever, but do not skip. It's the moment where we see Larry's transformation.
0525950079|2.0|This book has a good plot line and gives an interesting historic perspective of daily life in the 14th century.  However, it is routinely mired in predictable, adolescent descriptions of the anatomic and physiologic responses in human sexual arousal, a subject much better and more objectively covered in the Kinsey Report fifty years ago.  The endless, repetitive description of these events appears to have no other purpose than to hold the interest of those readers who have a voyeuristic, purulent desire to be titilated by such juvenile, low-level, trash.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I think this album is pretty damn good. Very catchy pop hooks and such. Let's leave it at that.
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Bad movie, just bad.  Way too much going on here; too many villians, too much wooden acting, Kirsten Dunst is still the helpless damsel in distress.  This movie is highly implausible, even for a superhero flick.  Are we to believe this intelligent alien lifeform just happened to come down in the park where Peter Parker is and glom onto his little weenie scooter?  I think Raimi was trying to cram way too much into this film.  And the romantic scenes between Parker and Mary Jane are laughable.  I suppose the fight scenes are pretty good, but then, it's hard to botch a fight scene with the computer animation and the budget that this film was slinging around.  One more bone to pick:  it infuriates me that this was only released in widescreen dvd format.  What about those of us who purchased the first two movies in full screen?  If the other two movies were released in both formats, then this one should be as well.  Let's hope this is the end of the Spider-Man movie franchise.  Superhero movie sequels can only go so long.  Look what happened to the Batman franchise before Christian Bale came along.  That George Clooney Batman film?  Horrible.
1904920209|5.0|With a few simple alterations in technique and measurements, you can go from the heavy brick like permeated with the overwhelming scent of yeast American type bread to delicious artisan bread as good as you can buy in the bakery if not better.  Having the dvd to see exactly how Richard Bertinet works the dough is a wonderful addition. I felt like a bread-making genius after the first loaf.  I didn't know you could get great bread from a normal oven at home.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|The Butterfly Effect still confuses me to this day. The director's cut alternate ending is probably better than the original ending. Ashton Kutcher looks out of place in this role, and Amy Smart always pulls off a convincing performance. They have great chemistry together but the plot is a little far-fetched and contrived. This is one film you will either love or hate, for me it just gave me a headache.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is a fantastic 4 disc set. It's in 16:9 aspect ratio so it fills the screen, and it's very addictive footage. I am often left thinking - how did they get that shot. This is my number one title in the collection...
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I am a Wilco fan, loving what they've done from their Uncle Tupelo origins through \\"A Ghost is born,\\" but this, I believe, is their best release. I was originally disappointed its the mellowness on the first few listens, but then the bluesy 70's folk-rock caught me. I wasn't sure what to expect with the claim that this album would be a return to their roots. Did it mean a style like \\"Being There,\\" or \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" without the electronic mixing, or even a return back to Uncle Tupelo type music? But even with that, would that be like \\"No Depression\\" or \\"March 16-20, 1992\\"? This is different than any of that. It has rich layers of music with lyrics that are simple, yet poignant. Once again, they've challenged their fans to keep up with where they're headed.
B00008977N|2.0|I like Peter Gabriel's voice and some of his songs, but I'd say that perhaps it's better to listen to his music than watching his DVD. Parts of it are too weird. I did not like the quality of the image either. The female singer is another minus. (He should take tips from Yanni and Phil Collins at the time of selecting his supporting singers).
0345494997|5.0|\\"Loving Frank\\" was riveting from start to finish, both for the insight into Frank Lloyd Wright and the complex dilemma presented of a turn-of-the-century woman longing for 21st century freedoms.     Mamah Borthwick was educated and intelligent, but fell into the trap of marrying Edwin Cheney, a good but boring man. In Wright she felt she had found her intellectual soulmate, but the mores of the time rendered her decisions disastrous. Even from a 21st century perspective, however, I was troubled about her decisions, especially to leave her children with a friend to follow Frank to Europe. Mamah's and Frank's belief that someday their children would appreciate that their parents chose the free life struck me as dangerously naive. One of the great strengths of Horan's novel is that she presents this dilemma in all its complexity, most notably through the character of Lizzie, Mamah's sister.    There was also enough about Wright's architecture in the novel to send me off to the library for photos of his early Chicago houses. They were indeed revolutionary for their time, with long and low lines, capturing space and light in ways never before contemplated.  The Cheney home was one of the few smaller prarie houses, of wood and brick melting into the lush greenery that surrounds it. You'll want to see it after you finish this fascinating novel.
B000M341QE|2.0|This is not a bad movie.  The story is great.  The duality of good and evil used to be a staple of Hollywood film making during the noir era.  This tradition has found worthy heirs in Hong Kong directors, while Hollywood has happily descended into the moral clarity of Spielberg land where you can take a still shot and immediately tell who the good and who are the bad guys are.      Scorsese went to great lengths arguing that Departed is \\"not a remake\\" of Infernal Affairs, because the scriptwriter has moved the plot from Hong Kong to Boston.  Yeah, right.  Departed is as faithful a remake as any, up to the ubiquitous cell phone rings, etc.  There are only three changes Scorsese makes, and all of those are disastrous.  (Attention: spoilers --- skip 1.-3. if you haven't seen it yet.)  1. The antagonists Damon and DiCaprio fall in love with the same woman.  It's the cheapest trick ever to establish a connection between the two.  The original version works beautifully without such conventional soap opera techniques.  2. When Damon, the mobster mole in the police force, shoots his gang boss Nicholson, he does so in self defense, as Nicholson is about to kill him. In the original version, Tony Leung kills the mobster in cold blood to get rid of the only person who knows about his true identity. Only by killing him can Leung break free from his past and truly become the respectable member of society he feels he has become over time anyway --- needless to say, a much stronger message.  3. There seems to be a Hollywood mantra that bad deeds must not go unpunished.  So Scorsese has to have Damon killed at the end in an utterly implausible epilog.      All these modifications are in line with Scorsese's apparent attempt at domesticating the complex plot of Infernal Affairs for, well, us.  It is a manifestation of a great plot however that it survives those mutilations and still functions.  As has been said about the music of J.S. Bach: it cannot be destroyed by bad interpretations.      The acting in Departed is good throughout, with the exception perhaps of Nicholson who at this point in his career can only play himself.  Otherwise, even Damon delivers his goods, no comparison with his droopy-eyed \\"hug me, I'm not really evil\\"-performances of the Bourne trilogy.        In the ocean of rip-off artists that is Hollywood today, Scorsese stood out by reliably coming up with original plots.  Aviator and Las Vegas cannot not stand up to his earlier work, but at least they were genuinely Scorsese --- catholic male rage and all.  It is not surprising that his peers denied him any Oscar honors until he joined the camp of copy cats of the Soderbergh ilk.  Still, if you live somewhere without access to foreign films shown on big screen, watch it.  If you have the chance to see Infernal Affairs instead, don't waste your time on Departed.
B0002DB52M|2.0|Talented filmmaker Lars von Trier turns his eye toward America, delivering a strident diatribe thinly disguised as drama.  A young woman (Nicole Kidman) running from gangsters seeks refuge in a small mountain town during the Depression, where she is enslaved and brutalized by the inhabitants.  Von Trier appears to believe that Americans are uniquely violent, unfriendly, and racist.  Not only is the film set in the United States, but his decision to film it on a soundstage with outlines marked on the floor to represent the buildings and to use an omniscient narrator to comment on the action are reminiscent of \\"Our Town,\\" a play which is widely recognized as a slice of small-town Americana.  In case there are still any lingering doubts that von Trier intended this as a comment on human nature in general that just happens to be set in the US, at the end he treats us to a montage of photographs that show extreme poverty, ignorance, and cruelty while David Bowie sings \\"Young Americans\\" on the soundtrack.    Of course, von Trier has a right to express his opinions about the US, even if he had never been here when he made his film.  America makes a lot of noise on the world stage and pretty much forces everyone to have an opinion about it.  However, even trying to look past my distaste with his message, I don't think it's a very successful film.  The running time is far too long and there seems to be a sadistic impulse toward the characters that is off-putting.  It benefits, however, from a truly extraordinary cast.  Kidman and James Caan, as a gangster boss, have a fascinating conversation at the end.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|2005's \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" features a host of talented actors (Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Peter Stormare, Maria Belluci, Lena Headey, Jonathan Pryce), an experienced director (Terry Gilliam), and a franchise on the famous childhood fairytales, along with the CGI technology to bring everything to life.  The movie as delivered is therefore something of a disappointment.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger play Will and Jacob Grimm, two 18th Century con-men roaming a French-occupied Germany to rid small towns of their ghosts and goblins, for a price.  The two con-men run afoul of French law enforcement.  The local military governor (played with over-the-top menace by Jonathan Pryce), by way of punishment, sends them to stop a rash of child kidnappings in a small town, under the watchful eye of his chief torturer Cavaldi (played with manic energy by Peter Stormar).<br /><br />In the small town, the Brothers Grimm find themselves for the first time up against the real deal, an enchanted forest inhabited by monster trees and animals, at the center of which is a mysterious tower haunted by a long-missing queen. They enlist the aid of a local huntress (played with Amazonian strength by Lena Headey), who guides them into the forest.  The two brothers wrestle with the mystery of the missing children, racing the clock to head off a mythic tragedy while staying one step ahead of the vengeful clutches of the French military governor.<br /><br />The on-screen presentation is visually dense almost to a fault.  Scenes are packed with details, which creates a textually rich experience, but which is delivered far faster than the average viewer can absorb.  The storyline is also dense with allusions to aspects of the original Grimm's fairytales, which unfortunately have little to do with the plot of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest challenge of the movie is that it can't decide whether to be a straight-up horror movie, a comedy, or some dramatic hybrid of the two.  The result is a frantic but uneven and often incoherent mash-up.<br /><br />This movie is visually exciting to watch; viewers with limited expectations who are fans of Damon and Ledger will find it entertaining but not much more.incoherent mash-up.

B000UJ48WC|4.0|I think the blu ray does this film alot of justice.  I did enjoy finally seeing it this way.  But have to admit disappointment in that I was expecting to see something along the lines of an extended cut or deleted scenes.  This release has none of that which considering the brilliance of this film.  Is probably for the better.    I found the new documentary(s) a little on the tedious side.  Listening to Hollywood people spout on and on about how brilliant Kubrick was gets to be pretty annoying after you've heard it a dozen times.  It's like,  yeah... we got it people.  Tell us something we don't already know.
B000Y44LBG|5.0|Take a pair of great actors at the top of their game and add a director who plays this movie to his greatest strengths. Add a solid supporting cast. Find a true-crime tale that mixes classic good vs evil into a Mobster story, and you have \\"American Gangster.\\" For those that have well viewed copies of [[ASIN:B0000AMRJC Scarface]], [[ASIN:B000H5TH20 Bugsy]] or [[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather Collection]] in your DVD library, then \\"American Gangster\\" should be on your shortlist for fall theater going.<br /><br />The interesting parallel stories between Crowe's Richie Roberts and Washington's Frank Lucas are what makes a near three hour movie rush by so seamlessly. Both men are doggedly determined to be the uncompromising men they know they should be, with Roberts getting into rocky ground by turning in - and not keeping for himself - a huge stash of found money, and Lucas by deciding he is going to take on the drug trade by reshaping it in his own image. Each man has quirks that show their character's depth, be it Lucas' strict codes of behaviour (a scene where he dresses down his brother for looking like a bad 70's blaxploitation character is very funny) to Richie's marital discord. These scenes show two men on a collision course. Indeed, they don't even share any real screen time till near the end of the movie.<br /><br />But it is that headlong charge towards the inevitable that gives \\"American Gangster\\" its edge. There are hardly any wasted moments here, and given the film's running time, that lack of filler says a lot. Standout performances from Ruby Dee as Momma Lucas and Josh Brolin's cop-on-the-take Lt Trupo also give the movie power. The contrast in lives (Richie's collapsing family as he battles evil compared to Lucas' exceptionally tight-knit family that goes to church on Sunday and distributes Thanksgiving Turkeys even as they sell heroin to anyone with a ten dollar bill) makes for some jarring, disturbing moments. A dark humor leavens parts of the violence...this is a movie that opens with a particularly grisly murder just before a main character bemoans the dearth of local businesses in the old neighborhood. Lucas takes his cue from his old boss, telling his new bride \\"The man I worked for had one of the biggest companies in New York City. He didn't own his own company. White man owned it, so they owned him. Nobody owns me, though.\\"<br /><br />However, the real story is that Lucas does make his mistakes, which begin as he breaks one of his own rules and wears a conspicuous coat and draws the eyes of Richie's unit. Lucas' luck lasts as long as the VietNam war plays out, but Scott also throws in one more great line from the overseas supplier that Lucas gets his heroin directly from. They both know that the end of the war means not only is the game over, but anything else they do is of a great risk. What gets Lucas caught is ultimately his own greed, because even his supplier tells him \\"It's not in my best interest to say this Frank, but quitting while you're ahead, is not the same as quitting.\\" Lucas still can't stop, and arranges one last big score.<br /><br />The fall of Frank Lucas may filmatically begin there, but this real life \\"Superfly\\" is still a bad man we love to see. Washington plays him as all charm and control, love of efficiency and family, a shiny smart veneer covering an explosive and dangerous person. He's the perfect movie villain, and watching Washington play him makes you smell Oscar. After all, we love our Gangster Dramas come Oscar time ([[ASIN:B0001NBNB6 The Godfather]], [[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]], [[ASIN:0790729725 GoodFellas]] and [[ASIN:B00029NKU6 The Untouchables]] to name a few), and with a film as brilliant as \\"American Gangster,\\" it will be hard for the Academy not to notice.ie that opens with a particularly grisly murder just before a main character bemoans the dearth of local businesses in the old neighborhood.

B000023X9W|3.0|When an artist creates a masterpiece, he creates a double-edged sword for himself.  On one hand, his work is lauded and he creates a following of devoted fans.  On the other hand, he's set the bar so high for himself, that all of his subsequent work will be compared to his previous excellence.       That's what faces Neil Young in the twilight of his career.  Every time I hear of a mellow, folky release from Young, I get excited.  I want to hear timeless classics like \\"Old Man\\", \\"Harvest\\", \\"Harvest Moon\\", \\"Natural Beauty\\", \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\", and \\"Unknown Legend\\".         Unfortunately, nothing on this album measures up to that.  The tunes are mellow, but there's just nothing dark, powerful, or moving.  Most of these are more like throwaway tunes he wrote tinkering around on his front porch.  \\"Good to See You\\", the title track, \\"The Great Divide\\", and \\"Razor Love\\" are pleasant enough.  They're just not GREAT.  Even \\"Red Sun\\", with Emmylou Harris' nice harmonies, falls short.  Meanwhile, \\"Daddy Went Walkin'\\" and \\"Buffalo Springfield Again\\" should've seen the cutting room.         I love Neil Young, but this one is strictly for diehards.

B00003CX8N|5.0|After reading the book, i was delighted to discover there was a movie. Hopkins and Bankroft were the perfect actors for the roles they played. I am obsessed with books and work at a book store. Unfortunately there aren't many independents left so I'm at a chain but wouldn't trade working with books for anything so that is one reason this story attracted my attention. Another was the building of the relationship between the customer and the booksellers. Being able to get to know a person these days is a priviledge and a rarity. Usually customers are in such a hurry to get in and out of the store that if you come across one that actually has time to share a piece of themselves, it is so refreshing. I guess it goes both ways. I was touched by their correspondence and her sense of humor. The English didn't have quite the open sense of humor or sarcasm but it grew on them and they saw her intent was good and she cared about their well being by sending things they weren't able to get during war time. I really loved the movie and highly recommend it to all book lovers, writers, or anyone who sees the importance of relationships with everyone they come into contact with from day to day.

1400064287|4.0|The essence of the book is crystal clear - when you present things, use Simple, Unexpected, Credible, Concrete and Emotional Stories. If you want more meat on the bones - listen to Chip in his 1 hour presentation as he did the latest Innovation Immersion Conference in Phoenix. If you still want even more meat - buy the book. It is a good reference book that I am sure you will revert to.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Exceptional edge-of-your-seat crime thriller.  Be prepared, though, to wade thru some urban slang which required a decent grasp of the English language and vocabulary to decipher at times.  Almost like a new language.  I found myself liking the movie immensely and being able to keep up with everything in spite of the jargon/slang.  However, I thought the dialog so well written that I found myself rewinding some scenes, hitting the mute button, and reading the dialog on closed caption.  A bit obsseive compulsive on my part but I wanted to get every wonderful word and nuance.  I'd be interested to know if anyone else found themselves trying this.  Exceptional acting with an exceptional musical score.

B000Y179KO|4.0|With \\"Long Road out of Eden\\" the Eagles return to form, churning out song after song of those old familiar melodies and they really sound like an old friend you haven't talked to in a long time. Some tracks are a bit of a departure like \\"Fast Company\\" with Don Henely sounding almost like Justin Timberlake, and it works. \\"No More Walks In The Woods\\" is 4:00 of pure Eagles Harmony.  \\"How Long\\", the first single, could be \\"Take It Easy's\\" couisin. The title track, a 10:17 social commentary epic, contains beautiful searing guitar work. Joe Walsh's \\"Last Good Time in Town\\" is the stronger of his two tracks, with a delivery that almost comes off sounding like Steely Dan. I grew up with this band ruling the radio charts. These songs remind me of those classics that blasted from my old transistor radio in the 70's.     Of the 20 new songs here, most are written by the band. Don Henley's songs sound like his solo stuff, and so do Glen Frey's. The stronger songs like \\"Center of the Universe\\" blend the two and produce that sound that was so purely \\"The Eagles\\". Joe Walsh and Timmothy B. Schmidt take lead vocal on a couple tunes each, reminding you both of the strength and chemistry they have as a vocal band. This album capitalizes on those strenghts. Sonically, I do not believe there is a better sounding Eagles album made. So buy it just to hear those wonderfully produced harmonies.    Old fans will like it, it's what you've been waiting for.
0765357151|2.0|I purchased this book/short story in anticipation of the upcoming Movie.  Generally i like to read the book first, because most of the time, they are different, and the book is usually far better.<br /><br />This remains to be seen in this case.  I cannot recommend this book, it starts out good, and it feels like it will build to a natural climax, but it does not, it kinda just fades away, and ends.<br /><br />I really hope the movie isn't the same.  I paid $14 for this, and i'm disappointed. 170 pages is the short story, then the rest of the 300 and something pages is alternate stories.  Don't be fooled at the size of the book itself! Off to ebay!
B000UR9TQO|4.0|I was surprised at how many folks hate this movie and the concert recording therein. Many of the complaints are about the sub-par show. I disagree. Maybe it's because I don't think the show is that bad. I enjoy the soundtrack a lot. In fact, the version of many of the songs are more enjoyable than the originals for me, especially (gasp) Stairway to Heaven.<br />The footage is grade A cheese, but so what? Is there no value in Jimmy Page and his devilishy horrible glowing red eyes or the bizarre mafia sequence or John Paul Jones scaring the crap out of his kids? As a special kick for Pittsburgh folk like myself, the opening sequence of the arrival at the airport and the supposed drive to the MSG show was actually footage from Pittsburgh and not NYC, so that always got a rousing cheer from us stoners at the Stanley Theater midnight showings.<br />This is a classic bit of raw rock and roll. It isn't studio wizardry, especially welcome coming from master producer and reknowned anal retentive control freak Jimmy Page. I still enjoy the charm of this movie despite the flaws. Live music is about more than perfection. Perhaps it is the perceived smudge on the shiny veneer of the Zeppelin image that many of the fans have. For me, it just makes the band that much more appealing. Carry me back, indeed.
0061547832|5.0|I picked this book up while browsing at a local Borders Books recently. I actually chuckled as I began turning pages and skimming through the table of contents and the first few pages.    Soon, I found myself sitting down - the book still in my hands. Next thing I know, I'm at the checkout paying for it. What happened??    Trump is an egotistical, self-serving man, no doubt. But let's be totally objective, as I was that day: good advice is good advice. And, most writers do not have the courage to dispense such advice in such raw terms as Trump does.    This book holds nothing back. Trump lays it all out on the table with blatant opinions, ideas and thoughts about those who've crossed him, helped him, etc. He tells you how you need to be (not just what you need to do - read that again!) to be successful. However - and this is the most important point of my review - there's truth to so much of what he says. It's helpful. You'll look at yourself differently. You'll gain insight, and you'll learn things about yourself that you did not previously know. You might even be vaulted to a new level based on what you read; I don't know - that depends on you, the reader, and your potential application of what Trump discusses.     I'm not a huge fan of Trump, the man, but I cannot argue with his success. Forget those who claim he was born into money; that may be true, but he continues to make headlines with regularity. His projects are everywhere; his stamp is clearly there in the real estate world.    If you like Trump, you'll love this book. If you don't care for him, and can put your personal feelings aside (he's never done anything to hurt me, so I was ok in that area!), you're in for a mind-altering , no-holds-barred, shot-in-the-arm volume of encouragement, confidence-building tenets.    This book made me want to run out of the bookstore and head right for my office to go to work (and it was Saturday afternoon). Highly Recommended!
0375758992|4.0|In 1972, England-born (1969) Alexandra \\"Bobo\\" Fuller moved to South Africa with her mother, father, and elder sister, Vanessa \\"Van.\\" By that time three generations of her family had lived in various parts of Africa. Even so, the Fullers struggled to eke out an existence as tobacco farmers, probably in part due to their (p 306) \\"...knack for choosing bad-luck patches of land on which to farm...\\" They lived in Rhodesia (Zimbabwe), as well as Malawi and Zambia, and survived, along with an obligatory group of servants (treated as second-class citizens by the Fuller family members young and old) and a varying assortment of dogs, on the proceeds of the harvest. Life was difficult, dangerous, and far from ordinary for Bobo and Van, being raised by an alcoholic, mentally erratic mother (p 210) \\"living with the ghosts of her dead children,\\" and stoic, capable father, who kept the family afloat but provided little in the way of typical fatherly love and affection. Notable events and topics: a snake encounter, integration of the schools after Independence, the loss of the family's farm, several intra-continental moves, deaths in the family, the 1976 war, violence, and racism. The book's biggest strength is its forthright tone; flaws: its choppy all over the place nonchronological order, prevalent stringing together of word chains, and choice of cover photo (why not the one on the Reader's Guide?). All in all, Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight is a wonderful, genuine portrayal of one white farm family's life in South Africa. Also good: The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls and The Twelve Little Cakes by Dominika Dery.

074356619X|1.0|There are dozens fo books on this subject, and this is among the most supurfilous.   Like a commerical, it introduces the concept to the masses, but doesn't really tell the reader anyting they couldn't find for free on the internet. It doesn't explain how to do it except in broad terms.  The author just quoted a bunch of people to the extent of her own understanding, which... is sadly lacking.  A much better choice is \\"the Law of Attraction\\" by Esther Hicks and Jerry Hicks, but honestly, the second half of that book is much better thant he first.  Esther Hicks channeled that information, and the entities who wrote through her know a great deal about this subject and go into very understandable and useable detail about  the laws behind it.  When you read it you feel like you're really learning somethiing powerful, not just perusing the surface.

B000FS9FCQ|5.0|At its most basic level I thoroughly enjoyed the move V for Vendetta simply for its swashbuckling style, its lyricism, visual effects, great action sequences, its music (especially the stones song \\"street fighting man\\" at the trailer)! and I enjoyed V's use of poetry to convey his eternal idea\\" of justice (an idea which cannot be destroyed) behind the Guy Fawkes mask.     Some people might see the movie as violent but they miss the point that these scenes in the movie can be overlooked when you see that they could stand for metaphors relating to the disintegration of those twisted and psychotic govermental/media institutions that had brought about London's Orwellian futuristic totalitarian regime.     I think that there will always be some violence in movies such as this  but in the movie 'V for Vendetta' I think  that it was more about the power of ideas to change things much moreso then the 'power' of violence.  In my view the movie had far more meaningfulness then meaninglessness.  Definitely worthy of a 5 star rating.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is a sweet and funny animated film.  This is a story about Remy, a young rat, living in the French countryside, who wants to be a famous chef.  Now who wants a rat in the kitchen?  Remy has high hopes and follows his dream. He watches a TV show, \\"Anyone Can Cook,\\" that features his favorite chef.  Somehow he arrives in Paris, looking for the plump French Chef he saw on TV.  Remy is shocked to find that his amazing chef is dead. Remy has a wonderful memory for recipes and a \\"taste\\" for good food and knows how to make it.  Somehow, he and a clumsy new garbage boy get a job at a French restaurant.  Because people don't like rats in the kitchen, Remy controls the garbage boy while under his chef's hat.  He knows cooking and competes with the other chefs for the best meal.  The interactions and jealousy of the chefs and restaurant owner are a delight.<br /><br />Wonderful characters throughout, however, the restaurant critic is absolutely perfect!<br /><br />Many smiles and laughter, great artistry with animation, and the plot had many twists and turns.  The time went fast and an excellent film for all the family.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The photography is astonishing and I doubt anyone could watch this and not feel genuine awe about the world.  Attenborough's narration is excellent (excepting his one use of a non-word: \\"disorientate\\").  The short pieces explaing how the photography was achieved, immediately after each show, are sometimes even more interesting than the show itself.  The final disk of commentary is alternatingly uplifting and depressing about the state of the world, its diminishing wilderness, and where we might be heading.

B000R7HY0K|3.0|OK I like Tarrentino movies but they are getting a little too similar.<br /><br />The dialog in the movie is totally pointless.  Yes thanks Q for trying to give us a sense of who these girls are, so we care about them when you crash your car into them.  But it seems so forced.  I know you are doing it.<br /><br />I'm also getting tired of snuff flicks.  What's the point besides desensatizing us.  I think these directors want us to be ok with the idea of people being tortured and butchered.<br /><br />Anyways, when the movie FINALLY gets to the action it's pretty good.  You may as well just go to those scenes.  There is absolutely no point in the rest of the movie.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I was very worried about what to expect on Britney's comeback album. Honestly, I don't really know if this will be her comeback considering all the bad press she's been getting lately, and that the style of the album does not easily fit into what is mainstream right now (and by mainstream I mean totally predictable, cookie-cutter crap ripped off from other artists, with a random rapper featured in every damn song) but I'm pretty sure more selective niches will enjoy this. Now before I continue, let's take a minute to be thankful that Timbaland did not co-produce this.    The album moves away from the pop/dance style of \\"In The Zone\\" and instead is an entirely new musical entity, which I am classifying as \\"Minimal Electro.\\" The production value however isn't as good as that of \\"In The Zone\\".    The album's first single \\"Gimme More\\" is a really dark and haunting, almost trip-hop-esque track that sets up the album perfectly. It's unfortunate that this song will be forever linked to Britney disastrous  VMA performance. Other stand out songs include the second single \\"Break The Ice\\", \\"Toy Soldier\\", \\"Hot As Ice\\", the autobiographical satire \\"Piece Of Me\\", and \\"Perfect Lover\\". My two favourite tracks however are \\"Radar\\" and \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\", which was one of the songs that Britney personally co-produced. Coincidentally, these two songs are both done in triplets, which is rare in a lot of popular music (probably because this makes them less danceable).    Overall, the album itself is solid, though I don't think it can be considered as her Britney's comeback. Maybe she should get back into shape and go on a super sexy tour like her Onyx Hotel tour.
B000C65Z1G|5.0|This film was very \\"Hollywood\\" in aspects such as over-generalization of issues, and putting the aforementioned issues on the back burner at times in an effort to focus on the romance between Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisz.  However, the film did justice to certain issues which countries in Africa face.  And it did so in a way that makes it accessible to mainstream Americans.  Some of the more intense or artistic types may be aggravated by instances of \\"simplicity\\" in the film or the \\"mainstream\\" aspects.  Yet at the same time, this film is a work of art.  It has a wonderful love story intertwined with the intensity of one of the larger issues that Africa faces.  For those who are less in touch with global issues, after showing them this film, they'll become more aware.  The actors did a spectacular job and the film acts as an eye-opener.  It takes the mainstream of filmography but twists it in such a way that you can thoroughly appreciate it as a meaningful film as well; an interest in the world at large blossoms in your heart to a point where you truly realize that life doesn't always consist of simple electronics ready at your fingertips.  America needs a mainstream film that can introduce Americans to the issues at large, issues they generally complacently ignore.  Here it is.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Despite What Other \\"Haters\\" Are Saying,This Album Is Great..Although I Do Agree Small-ey To What They Said About Britney's Vocals Sounding \\"Studio Tricked\\" But Only In The Song \\"Radar\\" Which Is One Of My Favorites.  I Love:  \\"Gimme More\\"  \\"Piece Of Me\\"  \\"Radar\\"  \\"Break The Ice\\"  \\"Toy Soilder\\"  \\"Ooh Ooh Baby\\"    I Dont Understand Why These Songs Never Made It To The Album?    \\"What You Sippin On\\"  \\"Sugarfall\\"  \\"Get Back\\"  \\"Fed-Up\\"  \\"Come And Get Me\\"  \\"State Of Grace\\"  \\"Everbody\\"    BUT ANYWAY I Really Think Everyone Should Give The Album A Chance..It Didnt Sell 124,000 Copies It's First Day For Being \\"Stupid\\" !!!  \\"I Wanna Kiss You All Over\\"

B000QXDED6|1.0|This was one weird movie. Spartan society was brutal, totalitarian, and slave based with institutionalized pedophilia. You would wonder why someone would idolize such a culture. In the movie, the Spartans are fighting for freedom, yet what kind of freedom do they mean--the freedom to own slaves, the freedom to murder, the freedom to molest children--very strange indeed. The movie starts out with a little, half naked boy, then he gets tied up and whipped. The men wear skirts or boy shorts and shave their legs. I am not sure what kind of hair removal system the Spartans used, maybe bic shavers or epilight. Also, all the spartans had specially digitized six pack abs and big pecs like Arnold Swarzenneger. I didn't realize that they used steroids back then. I found it weird that the Persians looked like dirty versions of the Shiite Mahdi army--sort of a slap at the Arab culture I suspect. It is a movie that worships maleness, militancy and violence. Even the special effects looked like more than a video game and the Spartans go \\"Hoorah\\" just like the marines or guys in a football. To sum it up, a very strange movie, but one that elicits some speculation. What were the people who wrote this thinking? Were they deranged, racist, or mentally ill? It is hard to tell.

B00003CX9E|4.0|Up until recently I had never seen Citizen Kane in toto.I had seen bits of it here and there in arts classes and on TV.After watching this movie and reflecting I can only envision one man that could ever had played this part to perfection and that was Orson Welles himself.This movie is as much autobiographical as it is biographical,that is there is as much Welles in this picture as Hearst.From what little I have read on both subjects over the years it is amazing how much these two men had in common in real life in their personalities and their subsequent dealings in whatever concerns were of most importance to them at any given moment.It was almost art imitating life imitating art.<br />But in 1941 both came together in one glorious time which would never be repeated.The picture earned Welles and company I believe around 10 OSCARS(if memory serves) of which only one was issued denying Welles his just due.Hearst had won the battle but in the end Welles won the war.<br />On further reflection another thing that very much jumped out at me as I viewed this film was the cinematograpy.The camera work was phenomenal.The lighting,the angles and the placement of shots added totally to the entire feel and execution of this picture.<br />And another aspect that I noticed was the editing.Of course as Welles controlled just about every aspect of the picture this,I would assume,could also be laid at his feet.But take for example a scene which involves Kane and his first wife.It lasts about five minutes in all but it shows them sitting at either end of a large table.Through several dissolves we see Kane and his wife going from a newly happily married couple to two distant and cold individuals.Brilliantly done.<br />Technically this picture has been cleaned to perfection.It is a fine transfer.There are two discs here,one has the movie along with clips from the original trailer and opening night,a short interview with a co-star and two different commentaries.The second contains a special which(again) I only saw part of a few years back on PBS called:\\"The Battle for Citizen Kane\\",which was part of the American Experience series.You will notice that this disc alone is for sale so it is worth every penny to be included in this set.<br />All in all I highly recommend this set to everyone.I have really no complaints in any department.While I don't think this is THE greatest movie ever made,I do believe it is one of the most important and best ever done.And when you compare it to some of the best works ever to come out of any film producing nation in the world it is no small praise indeed.n) I only saw part of a few years back on PBS called:\\"The Battle for Citizen Kane\\",which was part of the American Experience series.You will notice that this disc alone is for sale so it is worth every penny to be included in this set.

B0002M6QLS|4.0|I guess the Germans just like picking on the French. In the 1998 French action/comedy film TAXI, notorious German bank robbers, dubbed the Mercedes Gang, are giving fits to the French constabulary. These brazen criminals have a habit of publicly stating their intended target days prior to commiting the actual robberies. And they've been getting away with it. The Marseilles police force get word that their city is next and make preparations. Which prove to be embarassingly futile as the Mercedes Gang once again have their way, thanks to the bumbling of hapless young Police Inspector Emilien Coutant-Kerbalec (Frederic Diefenthal). This sucks even more for Emilien as he's been trying to impress Petra, the gorgeous teutonic Chief Inspector.<br /><br />But TAXI is also a buddy film so Emilien gets a break when he bumps into Daniel Morales (Samy Naceri), a pizza delivery boy turned daredevil taxi driver. Emilien, who can't drive, catches Daniel massively speeding and sees potential in the cabbie's skills. Daniel drives his tricked-up taxi so fast that his passengers vomit upon disembarking. Under threat of wresting away Daniel's driver's license, Emilien forces him to help ensnare the Mercedes Gang.<br /><br />If you've only seen the lame American version of TAXI, you might be wondering about the original French picture. Is it worth it? Yes, it is. Do yourself a favor and get your mitts on it. The original TAXI is funny and action-oriented. Action mostly by way of gripping car chases and stunts, mind you, but these sequences are shot with vivid, testosterone-raising energy. Naceri (Daniel) and Diefenthal (Emilien) make a good odd couple and come thru with several hilarious moments. Naceri - street savvy, brash, yet sweet - is definitely the breakout star of the film. Bernard Farcy, who plays the very politically incorrect and befuddled Commisioner Gibert, gets a chance to flex his comedic muscles. But I probably laughed the hardest with the bit about the Korean cabbies.

B000VWYJ86|5.0|I read in an online interview that, while Matt Damon hasn't entirely ruled out filming a fourth Bourne installment, he's put the kibosh on doing one in the immediate future. If he does end up not doing any more, this franchise goes out on a very high note. The Bourne movies have been consistently graced with intelligent scripts, diligent acting, and peerless production values. Oh, and nonstop adrenalin rushes. With THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, this series reaches its crescendo.<br /><br />The movie picks up with an injured Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) still being pursued in Moscow, Russia, where the prior film, [[ASIN:B0002ZDVEU The Bourne Supremacy (Widescreen Edition)]], ended. Bourne, of course, easily handles his predicament. The focus then shifts to a London journalist who's gotten a sniff of a potential headliner. Soon, his newspaper The Guardian is outing a front page story involving our amnesiac superspy, which naturally draws the eye of Bourne. The article also doesn't sit well with various clandestine government agencies (the CIA and the NSA). Specifically, one unhappy intelligence officer is Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), who ramrods Blackbriar, the hush hush CIA black ops program ressurected from the ashes of Treadstone. Treadstone being the original project which trained and programmed assassins, of which Bourne was the primary guinea pig. Naturally, the paranoid Vosen wants to, once and for all, eliminate Bourne, who is the mother of all loose ends. But Jason Bourne, too, has had enough. After running for three years, he wants all the answers regarding his past. And he wants it now.<br /><br />THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM keeps you rapt in your seat with two hours of intricate and well choreographed entertainment. The film's got smarts and forces the viewer to constantly pay attention as it doesn't linger too much on any reveals. And when things get revved up and Jason goes into action mode, the jittery hand-held cameras evoke an atmosphere of immediacy, of things barely kept in check, even though we assume that Bourne knows exactly what he's doing. There are screaming car chases here and extended rooftop pursuits and plenty of frenetic scenes with Bourne outthinking, outrunning, and, when it comes to it, just plain outslugging the foot soldiers of his near omnipresent and overwhelmingly equipped opponents. Nothing cute about his fights, either. His one-on-one, life or death struggle with the assassin in Morocco takes your breath away with its speed and primal brutality. No posing or James Bond witticisms here as it's made clear that the only objective is to take the other guy out, promptly and without any wasted moves. However, my favorite scene in the film takes place in Waterloo Station as Bourne aids a targeted reporter and attempts to talk him thru to safety via cell phone. Never has a sequence put more of an exclamation point on just how resourceful this guy is and how fast on his feet he thinks.<br /><br />Our government agencies once more come under scrutiny. Again, we are reminded of the immensity and scope of the power and tools at their hands, and of how easily such things can be misused. It boggles my mind that any cell phone conversation you may have can be accessed and recorded for posterity, and your every little secret can be ferreted out just as offhandedly. In the parlance of these covert agencies, a mundane statement such as \\"Let's activate the asset\\" carries grim connotations. The film presents these assets - apparently, the new euphemism for assassins - as unthinking automatons who linger in their hotel rooms as they await their next target. You get a feeling that, until they do receive their next assignment, there in their hotels they stay. On the other hand, Jason Bourne, who's strayed from his programming, has come to display clear remorse. In one evocative scene, as he gazes at his bloodied knuckles, he breaks his silence by stating, \\"I can see the faces of everyone I've killed. I just don't know their names.\\"<br /><br />The unassuming and formerly boyish-looking Matt Damon was 36 years old during the filming of this, and while he still looks unassuming, the boyishness has given way to more weathered lines on his face, which works to convey more weight to his character. Fortunately, there's enough warmth in Damon to keep his stoic and laconic super agent from becoming merely robotic and too impersonal for the audience. As he goes thru his memory loss, performs his amazing feats, and takes a lickin' but keeps on tickin', one can sense the internal conflict going on. Matt Damon has never been known for his loquaciousness, and his natural reserve and everyday guy demeanor serve him well in this role.<br /><br />He's backed ably by a cast of veteran actors. As the main villain, David Strathairn nicely personifies the burueacratic mentality of Bourne's adversaries. It's not personal with these bad guys, they're just trying to clear out some red tape. Meanwhile, Scott Glenn has such a minimal role that I'm ambivalent about his performance. Returning to the fold are the very good Joan Allen as the agent with principles, Pamela Landy, and lovely Julia Stiles, who gets an expanded part as Nicky Parsons. A prior history with Bourne, possibly a personal one, is hinted at by Stiles' character, so it's unfortunate that their story arc seems to sputter out.<br /><br />With the cast and crew trotting the globe as they film on location in Moscow, Paris, Madrid, London, Tangier, and New York, it's no wonder Matt Damon wants to take a break. But it's all been worth it, to have had this wonderful capper in the trilogy. Finally, we learn of Jason Bourne's true identity. Of course, if you've read Robert Ludlum's novels, you would've been privy to it by now. But never mind. After all that Jason Bourne went thru, I feel good for him as he finally sees thru the muddle and gets a sense of closure. And, going by the raucous audience reaction at the final moments played out on the screen, I wouldn't count out another sequel. But, hopefully, Mattie's in it.es.\\"<br /><br />The unassuming and formerly boyish-looking Matt Damon was 36 years old during the filming of this, and while he still looks unassuming, the boyishness has given way to more weathered lines on his face, which works to convey more weight to his character.

B000OYC7A8|3.0|Having seen Gilmore in concert, it was fun to remember it when we saw the DVD. There are some terrific cuts, but the \\"new\\" songs and the acoustic numbers were forgetable. Never a good sign when you have to skip songs before they end to see if you like the next one better. My thing is that if you buy Gilmore music or go to see him play live, you go to see or hear his searing/tasty electric solos against the base line and synthesizer. You don't go to see him break out his acoustic guitar. There is just enough of the good stuff on this DVD to make it worth buying.

0385486804|1.0|I normally enjoy reading any books on survival, or living in the wilderness, typically I can't put them down. This book on the other hand has gotten much undeserved acclaim (in my opinion).  Its basically the tale of a seemingly intelligent kid who graduates from college and decides to become a bum.  It details his relationships with his famly, friends, and other bums, and his efforts to get away from all the evils of civilization. Nothing exciting, just more or less what you would expect.   Eventually (late in the book) he does wind up in the wilderness, and  then the author explains what this kid ate, and eventually the outcome of his quest.   Bottom line...Don't waste your time.     If you really want to read about adventures in the Alaskan wilderness, read \\"The Final Frontiersman\\" by James Campbell. It's unbelievably good!

B000OQF6N6|4.0|First off, this is a review of the album, not a rant about whether its the Smashing Pumpkins or not.  If Billy Corgan says its the Smashing Pumpkins, than it is.  Bands change....look at history...Pink Floyd had different singers, Chicago had different singers and members, Def Leppard and Metallica have changed guitarists, Van Halen yadda yadda yadda.  This is the smashing pumpkins.. OK, I've joined the rant.    Anyways, this album is good. Its not quite to par with previous albums, but it stands on its own...with a familiar, yet new sound.  There are a lot of good songs on the album, but there are also some mediocre ones, which are rare in the pumpkin catologue. It doesn't really push the boundaries, but does open the door to hopefully more great music from the band, darcy and iha or not.  What's missing is the magical, dreamy quality of the past albums.  Perhaps that is because of the departure of Darcy and James...so be it.  Its still an album worthy of the name Smashing Pumpkins (door slam).
B000Y44LBG|5.0|I think that for a film to be truly successful, it has to resonate with the audience on more levels than mere entertainment. It has to be compelling, connecting emotionally as well as stylistically, in turn allowing for a genuine emotional response. Ridley Scott's \\"American Gangster\\"--based on Mark Jacobson's magazine article \\"The Return of Superfly\\"--is about as compelling as films get, giving an account of the rise and fall of Harlem heroine kingpin Frank Lucas. I never once felt as if I was watching an adaptation of a true story: every character and every event is incredibly convincing, so much so that it occasionally veers into unnerving territory. To be so uncompromising is both refreshing and repulsive, and that's probably why the film works so well.    Taking place between 1968 and 1973, \\"American Gangster\\" tells two stories that exist harmoniously, despite having no interaction until twenty minutes before the film's end. The first story focuses on Lucas (Denzel Washington), a hardened criminal who has no tolerance for incompetence or disloyalty; he'll willingly set one enemy on fire and shoot another in the head in broad daylight. At the same time, he's collected and low key, about as inconspicuous as an everyday businessman. Indeed, business is what he lives for, and he makes sure to follow the guidelines that define American Capitalism: work hard, give respect to those who deserve it, and reap the benefits. This would be fine if only it weren't through the distribution of heroine, which he buys wholesale from a Thai drug lord. Lucas credits his knowledge of business and loyalty to Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson (Clarence Williams III), who was a Harlem icon before his untimely death.    As a man who values devotion, it's disturbing to think that (1) he gets married, and (2) that members of his own family got involved in his drug trafficking. In the film, the only member left in the dark about his life is his mother (Ruby Dee), an elderly woman blindsided by hislavish gift giving (not only does he buy her a house on private property, he also places a perfect replica of a lost, beloved vanity table in her bedroom). At one point, his baseball-star nephew confesses that he doesn't want to play ball anymore--he wants to be like his uncle, making millions by overseeing the distribution of drugs. Lucas doesn't react to this immediately, and in that brief moment of sedate reflection, I couldn't help but wonder what he was thinking.    The other story centers on Richie Roberts (Russell Crowe), a New Jersey narcotics detective. For a cop that believes in doing the right thing, he certainly has a fair number of problems, not the least of which is studying to become an attorney: for one thing, his personal life is in shambles because of a bitter divorce and custody battle; but more importantly, his moral compass doesn't earn him any respect from the Department. Consider the confiscation of nearly one million dollars in drug money--he actually turns it in when he could have taken it all and shared it with his partners.    But as he delves further into the underground world of drugs, he learns that this is only the tip of the iceberg. A large number of cops, especially those in the Narcotics division, are taking bribes, not only from Lucas, but from many other dealers, as well. Roberts' superior--Detective Trupo (Josh Brolin)--is one of those involved, so much so that at a certain point, I found it difficult to determine whose side he was on (his own, probably). Roberts eventually realizes that Lucas isn't the one he should be after, but rather whomever Lucas is buying his stash from. In order to find out who this is and where the operation is located, Roberts has to find some way to catch Lucas. Of course, this won't be so easy; there's virtually no physical evidence linking Lucas to anything.    This detailed, complex sequence of events unfolds with extreme precision, so extreme that it almost becomes burdensome. But I think that was the point: a rough, multifaceted story is being told, and the audience needs to feel as much a part of it as the characters do. It didn't seem as if I was watching this movie, but rather participating in it, feeling and thinking along with the actors were thinking and feeling in their roles. I don't think I've ever had this experience with a film before, so I can't say that I'm used to it. But I can say that I deeply appreciated this film's ability to involve me, to draw me in so thoroughly that I left emotionally drained. And at a hefty two and a half hours, there's plenty of time for the draining to occur.    Oddly enough, this is the brilliance of \\"American Gangster.\\" Ridley Scott has crafted a film so focused that it doesn't just play, it actually happens. Both Washington and Crowe give incredibly realistic performances, pretty much to the point of not seeming like performances at all. I can't say how often this happens, but I'd guess that it isn't too often. It probably helps that the screenplay is based on actual events--a purely fictional piece is rarely capable of drama this compelling.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Compared to the first two, this is a cartoon, pancake revival version.  I can't believe Arnold agreed to reprise his role. This movie is a disgrace compared to the first two.  I wrote my own version of T3 in high school and it was way better this the script for this.  Instead of taking it to the next level, they took 40 steps backward and fell into a pond of fart. The only thing good about this movie is....really nothing.  Don't watch or buy.  Pretend it didn't happen.  Wait for a new Cameron directed version, not the cartoon, pancake revival one....
0345494997|3.0|An interesting way to tell a little-known part of Frank Lloyd Wright's life.  Although I knew of his affair with Mammah Cheney,  I knew nothing of the ultimate tragedy that ended this relationship. The dialogue that the author imagines between Mammah and Frank is believable and reveals   weaknesses in Wright's character that remind us he was but human. It also gives us some insight into the motivation that led Mammah to give up everything in order to be with Frank.  Very readable.
B000F1IQN2|3.0|Good movie, not as action packed as I have seen but I recommend it to anybody. It wouldnt be a waste of your time if you watched it.
B000WMVJ7E|5.0|All his past films stand behind this one like approving ghosts, as this is the best movie yet, a wonderful film, feeling its way against a backdrop so beautiful, so poignant that it becomes the lead character in the film, allowing the others to find the point/validation/ revelation they are seeking and bringing all of us --audience, characters, ghosts -- to a nearly perfect phrasing of what he has been trying to say relationships and idealism and hope from his  earliest movies.  While the personal, unpolished edges / dialogue delivery, reminds me of Woody Allen's quest-through-film, Anderson's earnestness is both more universal and more intimate.  And honest with love and humor.  I loved this film, every moment.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|As an XM subscriber, I have been hearing a lot of hype about this CD from the Squizz (XM 48) DJs.  The two singles, Critical Acclaim and Almost Easy were, in my opinion, amazing songs.  Some people seem queasy that Critical Acclaim is overtly political, but having grown up on a steady diet of Rage and SOAD, it didn't take anything from the song for me.  Almost Easy is just as amazing, and I figured with two singles like that, the CD would be amazing.<br /><br />It really wasn't though.  I only recently got into Avenged Sevenfold, but have been listening to City of Evil religiously since finding this band.  The other CDs are good, but I like the more epic melodic sound of City of Evil.  This CD almost feels like they are going even further away from their hard roots, which I think was a mistake.  There are one or two decent songs other than the singles.  I liked Scream, but it just lacks a little umph I think it needs.  Brompton Cocktail is a good song, but, well, I don't know, just not that good.  I took Little Piece of Heaven as the band wanted it to be taken; light hearted and pretty cool.  Other songs on this CD were just bad (Lost, Dear God, etc).<br /><br />I guess overall this is just not a purchase-worthy CD.
0374105235|5.0|So amazing I bought 12 copies for friends and family.  Everyone should read this book.  Ishmael Beah tells the story in a way that will touch your heart and spirit.
1569242739|5.0|Wow.  I'm a lactose-intolerant omnivore who is ecstatic to be able to have tasty, butter-and-milk-free baked goods.  If you equate \\"vegan\\" with \\"punishing\\" then you need to whip up a few batches of these chocolate cupcakes with chocolate ganache and get over it, FAST.  The book is smart, fun, easy to understand, and has terrific photos.  It fits well in the hand (yet fits in a cookbook stand), and offers valuable tips for anyone who bakes (including the value of an oven thermometer).  The ridiculously easy chocolate ganache recipe alone makes me want to weep with gratitude.  I foist these cupcakes on unsuspecting nonvegans and smirk while they exclaim praises.  I eat a cupcake and do not get sick -- in fact, my worldview improves dramatically.  Thank you, Isa and Terry!
0374105235|5.0|This is how Beah begins his compelling memoirs. At the age of twelve Beah finds himself caught up in Sierra Leon's violent civil war. Beah describes the attack on his home village and the sudden separation from his family. From there, Beah spends months wandering Sierra Leon, alone and with other young boys until he is faced with a terrifying reality; fight or be killed. Beah spends three years serving in the government army before he is rescued and taken to a rehabilitation center. With guidance, Beah comes to grips with his pain and learns to forgive himself for the atrocities he was forced to commit as a child soldier.    Beah's experience is unique and his vivid storytelling makes this book a very good read. His style is simple, straightforward, and honest, drawing the reader in. Beah's experiences were traumatic however he is not the focus of the story. Beah reminds us that one child's pain represents the pain of an entire country. Beah's is just one account of what thousands experienced during eleven years of civil war. I would definitely recommend this book.
B000XKZQ74|5.0|My boyfriend insisted that I watch this movie and it's easy to see why: \\"The Lives of Others\\" is a compelling and thought provoking movie about one man living vicariously through the lives of the people he's supposed to be watching.  The film shows his evolution from a top ranking Stazi investigator to a compassionate man who loses everything because he learned sympathy and respect for others.     The movie is interesting not only for the easy relation to what's happening in the US with privacy concerns today but also for what such scrutiny does to people psychologically (both for those watching and those being watched).      The only stumbling block is the language barrier.  If you have the patience for subtitles though, it's well worth watching!
B000UR9T8C|1.0|Of all the Marvel characters that have appeared on DVD, including the first 2 Spiderman movies, thia is by far the worst. Marvel comics used to be written for the more intelligent readers and most of the movies have held to this audience. Spiderman 3 is made for the mindless viewers. The story line is almost non-existent and the acting is not even worthy of the old \\"B\\" movies. This was a waste of money both on my part and on the producers part
B000RJO58M|5.0|The picture quality is markedly better than the DVD and a stack better than broadcast quality in NZ it runs on the NZ XBOX 360 add on HD DVD player.    GREAT MOVIE
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|300 is a great movie. Hovever, if you're looking for a movie to show off your new HD-DVD player you might want to pick something else. The film intentionally has a grainy washed out look to it. It's a cool effect and works great for the movie, but doesn't really show how sharp and crisp HD-DVD can look. If you already have Planet Earth to show off your player to all your friends, pick up this title. It's one of the better films out on HD-DVD.
1881273156|5.0|Every married couple, soon to be married couple should read this book, no matter how long you have been married. Any marriage that is having problems and thinking of seperating THIS IS A MUST TO READ before you do ANYTHING. This book will cause all people to grow closer together and renew and bring new life to their relationship
B000VI04HK|5.0|I have been waiting for a live REM CD for a while now.  They did the DVD not too long ago, but I love listening to live music in my car, REM is so damn energetic that this is something that I'll probably need to replace shortly due to overplaying!!  I wish they did more of their earlier stuff, but I'll take what I can get.
B00004W55E|4.0|I loved this CD.  I'm purchasing it for the second time because the first copy was loaned to my BF, who never returned it (he loved it too).  Anyway, I have a comment about her range...there are spots in the cd where her range jumps all over the place.  In some cases, that was good...in other cases, not so good.  I love Rachelle's voice and her abilities, but I truly think that she needs to limit that \\"jumping around\\" mode.  Sometimes, it seems like she's trying to show off.  I hope that she finds another way to use her voice and still show it off too.
0143038419|3.0|My wife's book club was reading this book and I read it on the side when my wife was busy elsewhere. I was intrigued by the countries mentioned in the author's travels, and I was hooked initially by her personal struggle after her divorce. Did her travel sabbatical offer any answers for the rest of us?    The book is an easy and enjoyable read, and the writer is very good at her craft. The problem lies in her subject. The book's main weakness is that the author, even back when she was married and extending to the travels in this book, doesn't seem to know who she is or what she wants. The devastation from her divorce is as much due to her surprise at learning she didn't want what she thought she wanted as from the ending of the relationship. I felt badly for her ex-husband, who seems to have been ambushed. Not knowing who you are isn't unusual or mystical; it doesn't require dramatic world travels. You just need to stop and think for a bit about what makes you happy and what doesn't.    At the end of her travels, she tells a story about an acorn. I won't give it away here, but after reading it I felt ambushed myself. I had read about the author's travels and troubles looking for insight, and what she ends with is something I've known since I was a teenager. Taking responsibility for your own growth and not assuming you want what everyone else does to make you happy is part of How to Grow Up 101.    Now I feel really gypped, because I had figured that out without any fun trips to other countries. Can I have a do-over?
B000TX7B5U|3.0|There's some good stuff here and I'm not about to bag on Mr. Tankian for anything major at all. His work with System and his general humanity have earned him quite a few free passes from me. But I must say that I don't find myself listening to this --- I listened to it once and currently keep shuffling past it on my play list --- where as the last 4 SOAD CDs are recordings that I still listen to each and everyday.
0393327655|5.0|If you want to read only one book related to faith and atheism, read this one. There is no other book that I have read which so clearly and eloquently illustrates the fundamental nature and problems with faith as an instrument for enforcing ignorance, bigotry and clan mentality. Religious faith is the most pernicious kind, but Harris nails the bizarre nature of all kinds of dogmatic faith that makes especially religious people believe in things they otherwise would never believe without evidence. Religious faith causes a strange and instant mental severing from reality that has been approved in society. Harris also talks about why \\"religious tolerance\\" is a utopian myth and how religion by its very nature cannot really be \\"tolerant\\" in the true sense of the word; on the other hand, Harris also makes it clear that some religions are more rigid than others and needless to say he focuses on Islam as one of the most rigid ones. In future chapters, Harris also distinguishes between religion and spirituality, the latter being open-minded while the former is essentially close-minded faith without evidence and further questioning. Harris is trained in neuroscience and explores psychological aspects of faith not found in other volumes. This is a fantastic book, one which is astonishingly insightful and revealing about the basic nature of faith. It should be required reading for anyone who is concerned about the future of reason, tolerance and free inquiry.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I have recently re-discovered the Chili Peppers and can tell you that this CD is helping me get through what seems like the world ending.  There are songs in it which you can really relate to..and I can't describe how helpful this has been.  Great CD.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wrapt in sorrow, of the high quality sort, this show is so intensely real it drenches you in its spirit.  Written with a poise and reflection only attained by the best fiction out there (and i am normally of the sort to espouse the quality of the written word over anything obtainable on screen), this show transcends both genres of book and moving pictures with the marriage of an incredibly rich script and an absolutely gorgeous presentation.  The diverse cast of characters includes Jayne, a gunman with loyalties to himself first and foremost and with an interestingly twistable set of morals.  He is basically the down and dirty type, but is humanized by his occasional reactions so basic in nature as to be almost childlike.  There is Zoey, the ex-military commando woman with a tough and straightforward way of thinking.  She never quite broke out of some of her military habits, including her way of relating to her superior officer. Zoey served under Mal, the ship's Captain, while they were in the failed revolution together, yet she is married to the ship's pilot, a doofey hawaiian shirt wearing man.  There is the 'companion', a sort of legalised prostitute and escort who had to attend college to obtain the respect and credentials given to one with her title.  She and the captain appear to have some interest in eachother, which obviously leads to some awkwardness for a working girl like herself.  There is the preacher who mysteriously has knowledge much at odds with his chosen profession, the doctor and his sister who are on the run from the law, and a sort of hippie hometown girl who plays the ship's mechanic.  All in all, the interactions of the vast array of characters and the dangerous situations their smuggling profession puts them into, are used to the utmost in an extremely creative and illuminating manner.  As a portal to this frontier created by man's exploration into space and the struggle to establish communities on new planets, each step you take into this universe will only make you miss it more, because it only offers more possibilities as the story thickens.  I have yet to see the Serenity movie based on the show, but as far as Firefly is concerned, it is simply the best constructed collaboration out of anything i have seen for the moving picture genre.  Besides the obvious interactions between the characters and their environments, the interactions between the incredible story, the simply poetical directing and the superb acting, all came together and played off of eachother to create the most well-made, stirring set of relationships and scenes i have ever seen on a tv screen.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|I love James Blunt and will probably buy ANY CD he puts out.  Back to Bedlam is my favorite CD of all time so I was excited about hearing his new material.  I didn't expect this one to be as good as his last one and it isn't, but you know what?  Its pretty darn good. You will enjoy the songs which are similar to his work on Back to Bedlam but there are also some new sounds that are good. On a scale of 100, I would give this a 90, so I would encourage all James Blunt fans to buy this one too.  I was not disappointed at all.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Vedder doesn't disappoint. This is a great CD to throw on and chill to - powerful lyrics, and the music perfectly reflects the mood of the movie.  Original songs for an original story.
B000TUXL2A|3.0|I really love Mark Knopfler's music - the folk, the rock, the whole collection.  He's fine songwriter, and that voice...well, it's the sexiest thing I've ever heard.      But this album was a bit of a disappointment.  The first track, \\"True Love will Never Fade,\\" is great songwriting and beautifully sung.  There are a few other standout tracks, too, but as I listened to the album, I started to think \\"hey, where's the guitar playing?\\"  Then I started to think \\"would it kill you to rock a little?\\"  And then utter dismay - one song features what seems to be a soprano saxophone!  Argh!  Nothing on a Mark Knopfler CD should make me think of Kenny G!    The album grew on me a bit after several listens, but it's not nearly as charming or as musically interesting as some of his earlier work.  If you're a Knopfler fan, by all means buy this one, but if you're just checking him out, maybe start elsewhere in his back catalogue (\\"Golden Heart\\" or \\"Shangri-La,\\" perhaps).
0743298039|4.0|This is a great story told by a first-rate storyteller.  The story unfolds at a natural pace.  If you appreciated THE SHADOW IN THE WIND you will enjoy this story.  Both include characters who have an affinity towards books and who love to read.  That is just one of the main attractions.  The biggest draw, I think, is the timing in which the mysteries manifest themselves.  This novel has a twisty, turning plot, characters that are fully developed, and a balanced amount of intrigue, sex and redemption.
B000P46QIG|4.0|This is a great album, especially for drummers - the exploration of different time signatures is totally intense, and Virgil Donati's mind blowing drum chops are unmistakable.  The songs have some interesting orchestrations, although occasionally I feel like the Planet spontaneously changes orbit - things sometimes happen very abruptly out of nowhere.  Brett Garsed's guitar work is fantastic on this CD, and his tones are amazing.  There is also a track that features Allan Holdsworth that completely rips it.  This album is totally about pushing the limits, but remains a great listen.
B000UR366S|5.0|This cd is up to Mitchells high standards.  Very, very enjoyable.  Every time I hear it, I get more attached to it.
6305263248|4.0|An excellent action thriller from director John Frankenheimer which I saw at the cinema twice and never tire of watching to this day. Frankenheimer is a top notch director having also made \\"The French Connection II\\" and \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\" (the original 1960's version). The cast includes Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Jonathon Pryce and Sean Bean. All are excellent and the opening setup scenes are tremendously well-done, with Frankenheimer making proper use of DeNiro and Reno's magnetic screen presences.<br /><br />The plot concerns the retrivial of a mysterious brief case. All of the above cast members are hired mercenaries paid to get it back for an Irish lady. This is where the title comes from. Ronin were effectively freelance Samarai. Frankenheimer has some great set pieces in this film, including a fabulous car chase and the initial exchange of money and weapons. There is nice cameo role for Michael Lonsdale (The Day of the Jackal).
B000UGG3A0|5.0|So I have been listening to these guys since i was in like 8th grade. I picked up the gangs all here back in 99. So 8 years of buying the new dkm cd when it was released. My favorite cds are The Gangs all here Do or die and sing loud, Sing proud. The meanest of times comes close though. Al Barr and Ken Caseys vocals are they best compaired to any of their earlier albums. Although its lacking on the bagpipes they still put togather a great album. My favorite songs are: Famous for nothing, God willing, Echos of A Street, Vices and Virtues, Flannigans ball, Fairmount Hill, Rude Awakinings, Johnny I Hardly Knew Ya, And Never Forget. This would be a great addition to any dropkick murphys fan's cd collection. It doesnt matter if you just started listening to them or listening to them for years, Get this cd you wont regret it.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|I am a huge SatC fan and I was VERY disappointed with the quality and packaging of this boxed set. Its basically a ringed binder with cheap cardboard sleeves for the DVDs which rip easily. I ordered one set and discovered that half of the DVDs skipped, were scratched or didnt play at all. Thinking this was an isolated incident, I returned it and got a replacement set. My replacement set had the same problem. There must have been something wrong with this print run. So I ended up returning both sets. Needless to say, for almost $200 I expected a lot more quality.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|The opening chords of \\"Love Song\\" draw you in immediately, and Sara's enduring vocals keeps you listening.  \\"Vegas\\" plays on the modern notions of happiness and dares the listener to rethink the cultural acceptances.  \\"Bottle It Up\\" is easily surpassed by the endearing \\"One Sweet Love,\\" where Sara Bareilles prays her time is \\"not wasted.\\" \\"Come Round Soon\\" is a cheeky and daring examination of a lost love, while \\"Between the Lines\\" is a more heartfelt and painful admittance of never noticing what was before her. \\"Love on the Rocks\\" has been featured in a Jennifer Lopez movie (Monster in Law) and is one of the more memorable tracks, while \\"City\\" and \\"Gravity\\" absolutely steal the listener's heart with their memorable chords and brilliant lyrics.  My absolute favorite track is \\"Fairytale,\\" a rather bitter song that asserts, \\"I can't take no more of your fairytale love...\\"    Overall, this album is a sure and worthy musical experience - worth every penny... Sara Bareilles' lyrics are brilliantly executed; and she is even better live...
B000PTYP5C|2.0|How weird that the departure of a keyboardist can lead to the demise of a band's quality, but there has NOT been a great album from this band since \\"Awake\\". The opening tracks on \\"Scenes from a Memory\\" and a couple songs I found on Limewire that don't even appear on \\"Train of Thought\\" even though they came out at the same time are the ONLY comparable tunes this band has come up with since \\"Awake\\".  Everything else has been so boring and pointless that it doesn't even matter these guys are so talented... the music has no rock 'n' roll soul whatsoever, and the lyrics are either a ripoff of \\"Operation Mindcrime\\" or some boring diatribe that doesn't contain the grabbing horror and imaginative images that the albums with Moore contained.  Thus, I'm 99.9% sure this new album is as disappointing as everything they've done this millenium, and I will not be giving it the time of day.
B00006HAZG|5.0|Radcliff did a super job as did the whole cast. A typical Dickens story. Well worth the journey and time to watch this movie. Give's a great insight to what life was about during the early 19th century. Maggie Smith was also in the Harry Potter movies and again did a great job.
B000002KHH|5.0|1970's self-titled debut gave Black Sabbath acclaim, albeit relatively low-key. It showcased a unique and wonderful sound - something far heavier and darker than any other metal bands around. Later in that year the band released \\"Paranoid\\" to surprising colossal acclaim, propelling the band into both European and US stardom. This rise bewildered leagues of music fans against the band's supposed satanic proclamation, stupidly labelling them Satan worshippers and disregarding the music on offer. \\"Paranoid\\" trampled over the naysayers, planting the band into legendary status.<br /><br />Most of the songs on \\"Paranoid\\" have become timeless classics. The title track is the song that everyone who doesn't know Sabbath, or doesn't really know classic metal and rock, knows. Supposedly written as a last ditch thing in the recording studio, the song's overt simplicity and various catchy hooks has become the public face for Sabbath. Ask a group of 40 year old mothers and I bet some, if not most, will know the song, or at least the lead riff. While I don't rank the song as particularly great Black Sabbath, I believe it to be a testament to their ability - their sound is so unique and wonderful, the simplest of Iommi riffs and most slapdash lyrics from Ozzy are elevated, boosted by a sense of raw energy and passion throughout. Obviously Ozzy leads this from the front, booming his voice from the get-go with the fabulous opener \\"War Pigs/Luke's Wall\\", one of my favourite Sabbath songs, galloping through sections, swaggering through riffs, solos and police sirens. The song is Black Sabbath at their best.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" is a wonderfully consistent album, flowing from song to song, and boasting no filler. While many of the songs have become anthems, such as the title track, \\"War Pigs\\" and the monolithic \\"Iron Man\\", the album has plenty to offer as a whole. \\"Hand of Doom\\" is up there with the best moments in the album, containing a great galloping sense and trademark Iommi riffing. \\"Fairies Wear Boots\\" is another underrated Sabbath song, and another that could have easily hit the mainstream popularity as others.<br /><br />Many people have loosely thrown the abuse of Satan worshippers at Sabbath, and most particularly Ozzy Osbourne. Yes, he did bite a live bat on stage, but as he has said in countless interviews and retrospect programs - it was a stage mix up, and he was under the impression of it being rubber, as planned. Yes, the album imagery is dark and intense, but this was their image, it was their aesthetic style of branching out and creating an identity, a menacing identity. Lyrically, confusion seems to be in the band's interest in the occult, with the band members, and especially Geezer Butler having experienced bizarre experiences in their earlier lives. The obscure lyrics were easily misinterpreted, and even the less obscure ones, such as the poignant Vietnam War attack in \\"War Pigs\\", in which Ozzy paints a gloomy portrayal of humanity, with Satan \\"laughing\\" as he watches. Hardly proclaiming Satanism. While thousands of fans have argued as I am, the \\"evil\\" stigma became something of a tag, wrongly giving the band a controversial and mysterious label. It is for this that I can concede the criticism proved a double edged sword, as it certainly boosted the bands legendary persona.<br /><br />\\"Paranoid\\" broke into mainstream success, giving the band ultimate stardom, and creating endless influence for the metal genre and many of its offshoots. Fans of classic rock should pick up this album, and discover the wonderful journey of Sabbath's lengthy and stellar discography.r Boots\\" is another underrated Sabbath song, and another that could have easily hit the mainstream popularity as others.

0195067142|5.0|I purchased this book after watching \\"The War\\" on PBS. The author Eugene Sledge is one of the people featured in this film. This book is like none other I have ever read on WWII. It is so down to earth and very moving at times. Eugene graphically brings to the reader so much detail of war, some of which I have never heard of before. This book isn't about strategies,politics,or leadership. It is about one young marine who wrote down his personal experiences,feelings,and hopes. It helps you understand what the individual soldier went threw while fighting on islands like Peleliu,Okinawa,Iwo Jima,and the like. I am so glad he turned his memoirs into this book.
B0002WS3RS|4.0|The trilogy moves well one into the other, if you like one you will like them all
B000RW3YYA|5.0|Adding to the rich set of civilizations out there, the Ancients make a brief comeback, then there is the new threat of Replicators which was an Ancient experiment gone wrong. Won't add spoiler details here but season 3 manages to keep our interest with good plots incorporating old episodes and new ideas. And yes, there is even the demise of one of the core team members (again no spoiler who it was) which adds a touch of realism and stirs up one's emotion after being through so many \\"save the galaxy\\" adventures with the same crew. Definitely worth continuing the journey with them.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I simply do not understand why people hate this movie. It has amazing action sequences, brilliant execution, and to top it off great actors. So what if the love story is a bit cliche (which I don't agree with but I will compromise) I believe that this movie like many others is one of those misunderstood movies.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Mark Wahlberg was great. The plot was far-fetched. Danny Glover is absolutely obnoxious with those braces on, and mis-cast as the bad-guy heavy (unbeknownst to Wahlberg). The technical jargon for snipers was very real and accurate. If you can ignore Glover in this, it's pretty entertaining despite the aforementioned far-fetched plot. Still a very good action movie with lots of shooting.
B000J10EQU|5.0|I don't understand why so many people are downing this film. In my opinion, it's the best Superman film ever made! I loved the plot and thought that it was a breath of fresh air compared to all of the other comic book hero movies they make in which it's all just beat 'em up, shoot 'em down and whatever. This movie has it's share of great action scenes, drama and something alot of movies of this kind don't have....emotion. We actually get to see the human emotion of Superman and how he actually does feel. I really love this movie and I wish you guys would get off the comic books and just watch this for what it is....a great movie!
1592332803|5.0|As a regualr listener of Colleen Patrick-Gourdreau's excellent Food for Thought podcast, I have been awaiting the release of this book for quite some time. As an avid cookbook fan (espcially baking ones), I am very pleases with the final product. I would recommend this volume to a variety of bakers. For the novice baker, this book is chock full of excellent and sound advice on baking techniques. The more experienced baker, especially one who can't imagine making a cake without eggs and butter, will expand their cooking repertoire as Colleen shows you that vegan baking is a) not some new-fangled fad but a technique that has been used throughout the ages for various reasons and b) delicious! You don't need chicken's eggs and cow's butter to make cookies. Believe me. Try eating Liz Lovely or Alternative Baking Company cookies and tell me you miss the yolks. Then bake your own using Colleen's recipes.<br /><br />Beyond the many cookie, bar, cake, and muffin recipes housed in this collection, Colleen also shares recipes for pancakes, crepes, waffles, breads, puddings, smoothies, and so much more. For starters, I am dying to make the mango sticky rice and German apple cake. Besides all of this, you get a chart on various baking apples, the deal behind the differences between baking soda and baking powder (I never knew!), easy and cruelty-free alternatives to using eggs, milk, cream, and butter for baking, and indices that are broken down by type of ingredient and occasion.<br /><br />At the heart of this book, however, is Colleen's clear and eloquent explanations of her journey as a joyful vegan and her reasons for this choice. Although I am not vegan, my food choices have radically changed over this past year. As a once committed carnivore who never imagined dinner without chicken or pork, I now live without eating poultry and meat with ease at all times. Anyone--vegan, omnivore and vegetarian alike--will have much to learn and enjoy from this book. Also, please listen to Colleen's excellent, moving, and, quite possibly, life-changing Food for Thought podcast ([...])
0143038419|5.0|I started reading this book over a year ago, while visiting my best friend in MA. I finally bought the book in October and absolutely loved it. The only problem with the book, was that it went from page 52 to 85 through 116 and then started again at page 85. I wanted to order about 6 of the books for friends and family, but am concerned that the other paperback copies may be the same.  Am I the only person who had this experience?
1569242739|5.0|I'm a vegetarian working on going vegan, and I bake all the time. This book is awesome - I've made 5 of the recipes so far & they rock!  I usually only bake chocolate stuff, but lots of these non-chocolate ones tempt me. I made the margarita ones & my husband said they were the best cupcakes he's ever had. I also made the mexican hot chocolate ones but didn't use the almond meal (because it cost $14 and I don't like almonds) - I just used whole wheat flour for that part, and cornmeal instead of corn flour - so good!
B0000844M8|5.0|Saw this movie when it first came out in the early '60s. Quality of the DVD is very good. It's what made me love the big cats and I've loved and respected them ever since. If I could, I'd devote my life to them as George and Joy Adamson did.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|At 45 minutes, something happened.  Then something happened again about 45 minutes later.  This is a tedious talk-fest with some shocking acting (sorry, that stuntwoman CANNOT act).   There was no story to speak of.  'Grindhouse' films are normally fast, furious, short and entertaining - this film was none of those things.  A massive disappointment.
B000MZHW40|5.0|I've gotten more comfortable admitting that DiCaprio is a good actor.  I must say that with this film more than others his heart seemed to be into it, not just his talent.  Hounsou is brilliant, and I hope to see him in many more productions.  Connelly was not stellar in this film.  I realize her character was supposed to come across a bit detached, but it translated more as a lack of chemistry between her DiCaprio, and even Hounsou.  I tend to think that when you are dealing with such charged subject matter that the acting doesn't have to compensate on any level, but this character/role is an example of how that is not true.  I failed to see her character's humanity, while in the other two characters, Archer and Vandy, I got very emotionally and psychologically caught up in them.  The premise of the story is volatile from the beginning, and the plot supports that momentum all the way through.  The film raises many questions about the world's involvement with and repulsion of Africa, no stone unturned.  For that reason alone I am glad to see such provocative probing of the western subconscious cast onto the silver screen.  That we see this mirror held up in a huge budget Hollywood production is great contradiction, one that I thought of often throughout the film.
B00005K9LK|5.0|i`ve been a priest fan since 79,unleashed in the east was my introduction to this soon to be metal king,priest was every thing that metal was,like pearl jam and the grunge look,priest was metal and the metal look.certainly not the originators of leather and chains in music,priest invented a certain style within a style,and they took it to the top of the metal world and beyond.screaming for vengence is the culmination of a metal bands rise through the world of rock&roll,by 1982,priest already had a good sized library of albums,starting in the early 70`s with rocka rolla.by 82 they had payed their due`s(so to speak),and off of their 2 years removed first real commercial success british steel, they were ready to become the metal god`s.after years of slugging it out in the biz, priest were ready to release one of the most defining moments in r&r history,the recording of screaming for vengence.this album is the definition of the phraze heavy metal,young or old this is an essential piece of musical history for anyone`s collection
B000QXDED6|5.0|Gods bless ab loungers.  I'm not sure when I've seen better scenery in a film.  I adored the dark comic art rendition and over-the-top feats of victory.  A well done piece of art, if you can stomach war being your entertainment alongside your daily news coverage.  That said, the message of tyranny and suppression of expression speaks loudly from history into the present.  I'm not one to measure how it performs historically or intellectually, but my guess is, with all the super hero posturing, it probably misses those marks.  One of the loveliest brutal films you'll see.
0194316513|5.0|The dictionary is excellent. I bought a Longman dictionary earlier this year. Though excellent, it didn't have enough words for my daily need. This Oxford has more than enough words so far and the explaination for each words is very ealy to understood.     The included CD software doesn't run at all. And I sent an email to tech support. So far it may have passed one month. Never hear anything back.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|The \\"Across the Universe\\" film is plagued by a diluted meandering script that manages to rise above mediocrity when the songs are playing....the musical segments are original and at times, stunning.<br /><br /> No gripes about the vocal performances; the re-worked Beatles songs are treated with respect and convincingly sung by the cast. I have my favorites, but I can say that there's not a clunker in the bunch.<br /><br />The film would have tanked without the Beatles music and the love of fans from across the generations. I am also pleased to find out that so many kids are finally understanding why my generation thinks the Beatles are the greatest rock band ever.<br /><br />P.S.  I feel that the most effective use of adapted Beatles music was in the film \\"I Am Sam\\". Great heart wrenching script, stellar acting, and great versions of Beatle classics. Buy that soundtrack with this one!
0307341550|4.0|Ok so I was ready to just donate this book during the first 25-30 pages; and I set it aside for 2-3 weeks; then i picked it up one Saturday afternoon, and was obsessed with it until I finished it on Sunday.  Very dark.  I really enjoyed the way the plot evolved - the characters were developed slowly, and answered the questions I had during my reading.  Good, intense, but very dark.  Just get through the soft, slow beginning.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This is the story of a dreary little man who unexpectedly grows a conscience.  Gerd Wiesler is an operative in the East German Secret Police (the \\"Stasi\\") before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  He eagerly accepts an assignment to listen in on the private life of Georg Dreyman, a well-known socialist playwright, because he believes that \\"getting the dirt\\" on Dreyman will advance his (Wiesler's) career.  But while listening in on the lives of the writer, his lover, and their friends, Wiesler slowly begins to change his stripes from those of a grey state drone to those of a human being.    There are a number of painful plot twists, and an ultimately satisfying ending.  I was very glad to see something like this coming out of Germany, and I'm sure it deserved its Academy Award for best Foreign Language Film.
0143038419|5.0|This was the most inspiring book I had read in a long time. I love how Liz can share her vulnerability .  Her journey is mesmerizing. Now that I have read it,I am ready to read it again.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This is definately Bruce and E Street returning to their roots. This album could have easily been released between Darknees on the Edge of Town and Born in the USA.    Bruce, you did it again!!!!!
B000SFJWLU|5.0|This band is growing and growing fast, With good reason. After a brief conversation with lead singer Ivan after there performance at the family values show in Hartford Ct. About the late \\"James Lynn Strait\\" may he rest in peace. I respected him like a brother, To come out and talk with fans like he does. The music is just pure metal and so much talent in the band. I couldn't wait for the CD to come out I went and bought it the day it came out. And been listening to it since, The band is well put together the production quality is amazing. There is not one song on the CD that you can label your favorite its just not fair to the album. All the songs are just amazing this is just simply one of the best albums to come out in 07. So do your self a favor and buy it, And if you get the chance see them live do it you will not regret it. The way of the fist is exactly what the title says, It will make you want to clench your fists and get in the pit.
0743455967|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of Stephen King anyway not so much for his horror stories but for the way he is able to tell his stories.  I've read some other author's books where the dialogue seems stiff and the descriptions seem out of place and irrelevant to the story.  They were painful to read.  Stephen Kings writing is not like that. He is able to pull the reader into the story.  This book helped me understand how he was inspired to write and how he thinks it should be done.  He discusses that grammar, vocabulary, talent, and motivation are key.  He makes it clear that writing a good book is hard work.  He says you have to be willing to work your a** off.  He also describes his belief that not everyone can be a good writer.  Talent and inspiration are essential.  This book was a little discouraging for me since I have never written but want to learn how.  Only time will tell if I can be a competent writer.  This book gave me a good idea of where to begin.  As he recommends I will start off by reading lots of books.
0553805460|4.0|From what I've read thus far, Jordan Bedfort writes with the reader in mind.  At times you will feel as if you are standing right there beside him...better yet, you feel like you're him...well, without all the money.  Super humerous.
1401308201|4.0|I purchased the book because my director wanted similar costume styles for our local production of Charlie and the Chocolate factory.  The pictures and information given on the costuming was an excellent resource for me.  In addition, I love the story of the show and was excited to learn about the behind-the-scenes aspects of production.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|This DVD was to remind me of the best concert I ever attended so far. I was in London with the love of my life, and we had such a great timt then it just brings back memories that I wish would have lasted forever.    Mark
B000002ADT|2.0|I bought this CD for an assignment for a Music Appreciation class.  And that tells you what I know about the elements of music that make it good (or bad).    My biggest gripe is that I can hear hiss and other noises that could/should have been removed when this was remastered.    As for the music itelself, this is what I think of when I hear people talk about Jazz.  But it sounds like every small Jazz band I hear at formal events.  maybe they're all coppying this?  But it is pleasant to listen to.    Now how do I expand that into 3+ typed pages?
0684803356|4.0|Hemingway's \\"For Whom the Bells Toll\\" an entertaining read but more importantly a very moving read.  It does not say that war is terrible it says what's terrible about war.  Everything in the book has a meaning; the imagery beautifully shows Robert's changing understanding about life, the allusions show an interesting blend between Spanish and American influences, and his abstinence personification and metaphors shows how concentrated Hemingway is on real life.   However the symbolism found in real life is surprisingly poetic especially in the book, where Robert lay at the same position he did as the book started only this time he lays with his heart against the forest floor.  This of course means he learned how to use his heart by connecting it to the love interest Maria, who symbolizes Spain the country Robert finds his family in.  Truly the lessons learned by Robert is the lessons every one learns, and Hemingway was smart enough to put it into a thrilling war novel with impeccable historical influences.
B000003CMB|5.0|[[ASIN:B000003CMB The Allman Brothers at Fillmore East]]    I bought \\"Beginnings\\" as an LP, including the first two ABB records.  Wow.  Could these guys play, even if the songwriting was uneven.  I knew Duane from \\"Layla\\", and knew he was an All World guitar player, and loved, and I mean loved, the way a slide guitar sounded.    I read a couple of reviews of \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\", and bought it.  From the opening strains of \\"Statesboro Blues\\", with Duane...what's a good word...making the strings scream, to the last gasp, the band just blows you away.    Dickie Betts has his moments as well, and ain't afraid to step up to the front of the stage.  Still isn't, come to think of it.  I had a professional musician friend, and he commented, \\"he knows when NOT to play as well as anyone.\\"  I THINK he meant that there wasn't a lot of noodlin' by Dickie, er Richard.The other guys can all play, Butch Trucks, Berry Oakley, J.J. Johanny, Brother Gregg, but this is a GUITAR band, my friends.  Its Duane and Dickie's show, and they just burn the house down.  Other cuts from the night are to be found on other ABB albums, and all are equally amazing.  Highly recommended is \\"Mountain Jam\\".    Poor Duane died, and so did Berry, and the band continued, but as a keyboard band with Chuck Leavell.  Make no mistake, Chuck can PLAY, but the band would never have the sting and fire it did as recorded on this album.    I think the thing I like most about Rock music is the teamwork of a great band.  Lyrics are fine, catchy songs are OK, but I want the band to ROCK, to play together with FIRE, and kick some rear end.  The stunning harmony guitars are on display in spades here, the twin drummers sound as one.  Berry is a monster holding the bottom, and Greg can sing and play.    But Duane and Dickey were the show, and it's here for all time.
B000008H1Y|5.0|This album came out when I was 13 years old; my older sister bought a copy.  I remember sitting for hours listening to these songs while staring at the album cover, transfixed.  There has always been something about the woods which has...well, haunted and seduced me.  When I'm in the forest, I feel unlike I feel anywhere else, sort of like I'm home again--there's comfort--but there is also mystery and enchantment and fear of the unknown.  And, there's also a sense of being unaccountable, somehow--because nobody can see.  Somehow, the instruments, lyrics, and style of this album brings forth these same emotions.   It affects me like no other music ever has.  I'm instantly transported to some lush medievel wood with its simple pleasures and pains, its magic and superstition, its lust and love.      I remember listening to the sexually suggestive Velvet Green (one of my all-time favorites) and Hunting Girl and being mesmerized as their subtle meanings slowly became apparent to my budding adolescence: (\\"And August's rare delight may be April's fool\But think not of that, my love\I'm tight against the seam\And I'm growing up to meet you down on velvet green\\" and \\"She took this simple man's downfall in hand\I raised the flag that she unfurled\\")  What indescent, romantic, seductive, passionate stuff this was for a 13 year-old!    Listening to Tull's Songs from the Wood even today brings forth these feelings just as powerfully as it did for me 30 years ago.  It has always been my favorite, and most unique album and I highly recommend it.
0767840135|5.0|This is a great show. i love the Cirque and specially the performances on this show, the statue performance is breath taking!!
B000R7PYU2|5.0|I love Horace Rumpole, and I love him in this book.  He is at his grouchy best, and we see the old war horse trying to deal with modern-day problems such as terrorism.  These books are each gems in their own right, and they are extremely funny.  We also get to see \\"She Who Must Be Obeyed\\" coming into her own in this book when she decides it's time to write her own memoirs.  Looking at things through Hilda's eyes is incredibly funny, and we see just how far off base old Rumpole is even though he thinks he totally understands his wife.  The plot is clever and the characters lovable and real.  No wonder we all love Rumpole so much!  Thank you Mr. Mortimer for many hours of wonderful reading!  I heartily recommend that you read this wonderful and funny series.
0375842381|5.0|I purchased this set for my 10-year-old who is (was) a die-hard Harry Potter fan. I told her that some believe this author to be better than Rowlings and she scoffed. She came down the next morning having devoured the first novel, and agreed that it was right up there with the Potter series, and was possibly superior in some respects. She also has discussed some of the sociological aspects of the fantasy world painted, and I love that because it makes her think and compare and contrast these sometimes idealized and stylistic fantasy worlds with the reality she experiences here in the 'real' world. Get it for someone (or yourself) as a special gift. Get the hardbacks. They are worth the cost to have as good literature in your library.
0143038419|5.0|I saw that the author of this book was going to be on Oprah, tuned in to see what it was all about.  Liked the author, ordered the book.  I may have been almost the last woman in America to not have read this book according to \\"O\\".  But, this book turned out to be one of the best I have read in maybe forever.  Elizabeth Gilbert has a comic wit and a way of telling a story that makes you feel like she is sitting in your living room talking to you.  This book will make you laugh and cry.  It may be about her approximate 1 year journey to find peace and a backbone(you have to read the book to understand that) but in the couple of weeks it took me to read it (amongst other reading and duties) I felt like I had gained a great deal of peace as well from the comfort of my reading chair.
B00006G8K0|2.0|its not very good its tipical and tiresm after a bit it just seems to drag on i have seen this great and wonderful actor do such great work in his movies that this is just him being faithful to the production company to even consider doing this film.
0792839749|3.0|It has good family values. It touched my heart in some scenes where it unfolded the love and joy shared by the father and his 2 children. One of those moments was where the father prepared breakfast for his children and he sang something like this \\"Life is not a chore... when I have you two..\\"    This movie has some funny moments but it drags in a lot of scenes. For example, in the candy factory, they sang for a long long time, at least more than 10 minutes. That distracted me from the story. The director seemed to concentrate more to the music and dancing than the plot.     This movie is good but I won't watch it the second time. I prefer Sounds of Music.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Finally, Quentin Tarantino has returned to \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" and \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" in terms of truly creating something new, exciting and offbeat.  A movie that will not be for everyone, except those who loved and devoured the first two films.  Kurt Russell is terrific as always, and perfectly cast in the title role.  With respect to Tarantino's \\"women,\\" what can anyone say except \\"Wow!\\"--and that applies to their acting as well as looks.  The film contains some of the best stunt driving ever filmed; and the dialogue is classic Tarantino.<br /><br />Keep making more like these three, Quentin!
B00005JO5L|4.0|The waiting was worth it. I have waited for years to watch the uncensored version on dvd. Al Pacino acts great and he is really into the character.  Although the story is not that good to me this film is a document  of how the GAY leather scene was in the seventies/eighties.  The making of .... on this DVD gives a lot of information I did not know yet. For example: all the movie sounds are \\"handmade\\". Great job.   Al Pacino is not too happy about this film I think because he is not in the making of.... and that is bit of a bummer. I would love to hear his opinion in retrospective about this movie.   Besides the storyline of murderer kills gays the message is clear in this movie: do you know who you really are?   Very universal, don't you think?
B000W7M1F8|5.0|Listening to the new Britney Spears record is an experience indeed - despite the obvious hooks, the singalong choruses, and the perfectly times beats, there also lies a certain depth and soul that was sorely missing on all her previous albums. Yes, the songs are good (just ask any critic), but what makes this album special is its tremendous replay value (I suggest you buy a physical copy of the CD), and the intricate attention to the production. Unlike other reviewers, I have to give credit for Britney's vocal ability as well - she is not the best singer, but one listen to her on tracks such as \\"Heaven on Earth\\", and you realize why it is that she is still so endearing.<br /><br />Whats even more astonishing is Spears' ability to remain culturally and sociologically relevant in an era that has virtually wiped out all of her classmates from the late 1990s. Though I do respect Christina Aguilera and her recent \\"Back to Basics\\" album, I have already played \\"Blackout\\" more than I have that other album. That's a testament to what Britney is - it may be disposable, it may be too commercial, but through it all it remains relevant and addictive. You can't deny that, and if you're new to the circus, I would recommend that you pick this album up as soon as possible.<br /><br />\\"Blackout\\"'s strengths (and there are many) - is that every song on this 12-track album could be a successful radio single. I cannot think of another album in the last ten years that I could say this about. Even if you're not a fan of the generic pop genre, you will find something here to love. Primary single \\"Gimme More\\" (which rates alongside \\"Toxic\\" as Britney's best single ever) is just the beginning of the brilliance. To give you an idea of the multiple genres that Britney has employed on this record, let me compare some of the songs to the artists they most closely resemble. You can base your opinions on this, if you like:<br /><br />\\"Piece of Me\\" : Many call this the standout track of the album. I think its pretty great, but not a Britney classic. The production her is very `Neptunes', and the track itself is very reminiscent of something that came out of the UK Underground club scene. Great repeat value, and the rooster instrumental effects, coupled with the very singable chorus will guarantee that this is a track you will be playing a lot in the days to come.<br /><br />\\"Heaven on Earth\\" - Easily the best track on the record. This is 1980s electro-pop goodness. I would go so far as saying that this one track is better than anything on the new Hilary Duff record (\\"Dignity\\" - where Hilary tried to channel the `80s as well). Why is this song special. Well, for starters, it mixes electronic pop with ambient trance, and layers it with a synthesized Eurythmics sensibility. Think an Annie Lennox song done by Kylie Minogue, with DJ Tiesto as the producer. This is that track. I love the vocals on this - frail, tender, vulnerable. The song is undeniably sexy, and one that I will hail as the one of the best of Spears' career. And the line \\"Waking up, with you next to me\\" sound eerily like Imogen Heap!<br /><br />\\"Toy Soldier\\" - What production! The opening beats alone deserve to be played loud on your car stereo system. This is the jam she was born to make. The highly digitized vocals only enhance the overall effect of the track. Yet another song that you will have on repeat. The companion track to this is \\"Freakshow\\", which to me is not as memorable as this one, but still as good.<br /><br />\\"Break The Ice\\" - Remember how Janet Jackson always brought the best track on her album as the album opener? Well, I only wish they had chosen this song to open the album - it so deserved to be Track 1. Its tailor made for radio - listening to it now, it seems to marry the best of the R&B and Hip-Hop genre, and infuses it with a very pop sound overall. A universally acclaimed track, this is the perfect foil for \\"Gimme More\\".<br /><br />\\"Why Should I be Sad\\" - Justin Timberlakecould only wish he made such a Timbalandesque jam on his last album. This is the slowest track on the record, but with a very poignant vocal from Britney. Production is stellar, and it's a superb closer to an already superb album. I highly recommend listening to this on headphones to truly appreciate it. It speaks of her marriage, divorce, and relationship issues, but she doesn't position herself as a victim - just as an observer, and I found this very classy.<br /><br />Standout tracks include \\"Radar\\", and of course the much-maligned \\"Hot As Ice\\". Many people call the last track the worst on the CD. Granted, its not that great, but if you take it with a sense of humor, you will actually start to like it. The background vocals and singers sound like they're channeling the Oompa Loompas from \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" - listen to it to see what I mean!<br /><br />The only downside to this album, is that its too short. Some of the best tracks that Britney recorded from the era (And available on the net in various avatars) are missing from this. My absolute favorite from this Era is the unreleased track \\"Sugarfall\\", which easily is one of the best songs Spears has ever recorded. Two ballads remain missing - \\"Baby Boy\\" and \\"Let Go\\" (the latter shows off Spears' vocal training to full effect). Another winner, \\"Get Back\\" is possibly the song that should be immediately released as a single (what a chorus!) for for inexplicable reasons was left off the CD entirely. Heres the thing - there are at least 30 songs floating around that Britney made for \\"Blackout\\", but only 12 made it here. My guess is that some of these will surface at some point on some foreign editions of the CD. Please do look out for them - they are totally worth it.<br /><br />So what would I compare this album to. Well, in terms of the groundbreaking genre and production, there are quite a few peers. If you liked this album, you would love \\"Neon Nights\\" by Dannii Minogue, \\"Come and Get it\\" by Rachel Stevens, \\"Ray of Light\\" by Madonna - but the truth is, there hasn't been an album quite like this before. It breaks new ground with every track, and there is literally something for everybody. Just when you think the songs getting repetitive, theres an electronica solo much like Imogen Heap that blows your mind, and traces of Eurythmics, Duran Duran, Modern Talking, A Ha, and even Debbie Gibson are found throughout this album. Is this a good thing? Yes it is! If anything, you cannot possibly be bored by this album.<br /><br />Britney Spears making a classic album was considered an impossibility a few months or years ago. But with a great team behind her, she has finally achieved what she set out to. I'm no defender of her personal life, nor a huge Britney fan, but I do know likable and essential pop music when I listen to it. This review is for her new album, not her personal life. And that said, this is easily the best pop release of the year, and the finest of Spears' career. I would say - forget the person and concentrate on the music. Even if you remove Spears' persona completely from this record, its still a masterpiece of the pop-electronica genre, and you can't deny that.<br /><br />Five Stars. Pop Album of the Year, and an instant classic.m on his last album. This is the slowest track on the record, but with a very poignant vocal from Britney. Production is stellar, and it's a superb closer to an already superb album. I highly recommend listening to this on headphones to truly appreciate it. It speaks of her marriage, divorce, and relationship issues, but she doesn't position herself as a victim - just as an observer, and I found this very classy.     Standout tracks include \\"Radar\\", and of course the much-maligned \\"Hot As Ice\\". Many people call the last track the worst on the CD. Granted, its not that great, but if you take it with a sense of humor, you will actually start to like it.

The only downside to this album, is that its too short. Some of the best tracks that Britney recorded from the era (And available on the net in various avatars) are missing from this. My absolute favorite from this Era is the unreleased track \\"Sugarfall\\", which easily is one of the best songs Spears has ever recorded. Two ballads remain missing - \\"Baby Boy\\" and \\"Let Go\\" (the latter shows off Spears' vocal training to full effect). Another winner, \\"Get Back\\" is possibly the song that should be immediately released as a single (what a chorus!) for for inexplicable reasons was left off the CD entirely. Heres the thing - there are at least 30 songs floating around that Britney made for \\"Blackout\\", but only 12 made it here. My guess is that some of these will surface at some point on some foreign editions of the CD. Please do look out for them - they are totally worth it.     So what would I compare this album to. Well, in terms of the groundbreaking genre and production, there are quite a few peers. If you liked this album, you would love \\"Neon Nights\\" by Dannii Minogue, \\"Come and Get it\\" by Rachel Stevens, \\"Ray of Light\\" by Madonna - but the truth is, therehasn't been an album quite like this before. It breaks new ground with every track, and there is literally something for everybody. Just when you think the songs getting repetitive, theres an electronica solo much like Imogen Heap that blows your mind, and traces of Eurythmics, Duran Duran, Modern Talking, A Ha, and even Debbie Gibson are found throughout this album. Is this a good thing? Yes it is! If anything, you cannot possibly be bored by this album.      Britney Spears making a classic album was considered an impossibility a few months or years ago. But with a great team behind her, she has finally achieved what she set out to. I'm no defender of her personal life, nor a huge Britney fan, but I do know likable and essential pop music when I listen to it. This review is for her new album, not her personal life. And that said, this is easily the best pop release of the year, and the finest of Spears' career. I would say - forget the person and concentrate on the music. Even if you remove Spears' persona completely from this record, its still a masterpiece of the pop-electronica genre, and you can't deny that.     Five Stars. Pop Album of the Year, and an instant classic.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|A wonderful movie about a family in St. Louis 1904 right before the first World's Fair.  What's lovely is how the movie revolves around a few holidays and seasons and showcases the family at those points in time.  Some scenes and dialogue are laugh-out-loud funny and humorously tongue-in-cheek, with some tearjerker moments, beautiful set decorations heightening the atmosphere that make you feel you're living the scene too; colorful costumes, and outrageous singing by Ms. Garland, and the scene-stealing Margaret O'Brien is a treasure.  Why they can't make movies like this anymore is a sign of our times indeed.

0805079831|5.0|Massive research, incisive thinking and 'out of the rut' perspectives inform this treatise on the economic guerrilla war that has quietly changed our world while we watched the coups d'etat, wars, terror plots and genocides on night-time news. This book is required reading for those interested in the directions that our world is taking socially and economically.    Once in a while one reads books such as this that seem to capture and crystallize what one has often glimpsed or thought but dismissed as too preposterous to be true. This is such a piece of work - and backed up with mountains of research and interviews with the players in the massive economic changes that have occurred in the past 40 years.    Since I started reading this book I have begun to watch international events from an entirely different perspective. The elections today in Trinidad and Tobago take on a whole new light. Is the rhetoric against the incumbent being fomented by economic gurus who want to destabilize the country so that they can 'rescue' the people with their special brand of 'realpolitik'?    I fear for my own country when I read that 'right-wing' think tanks have actually tried to create the circumstances for shock therapy in Canada by trying to manipulate the country's bond credit rating....go figure.    Every conscientious American should read this book and decide how they will vote based on understanding that Naomi Klien's information is as valid as what they are told by the media controlled by their current government.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Godlike. A landmark metal album. I wholeheartedly disagree with the negative comments about \\"Christ Illusion\\". This is as solid as thrash gets. Every song here combines brutality along with prime songcraft. The end result is one hell of a release. Possibly the best metal album EVER. Slayer forever!
0783216084|4.0|For years after this movie, people all over the world complained about a phobia of swimming.<br />The opening scene with a beautiful young woman, Chrissie Watkins (Susan Backlinie), skinny dipping and then being sucked under the water to her death, sets the scene and made Susan into a celebrity though she played such a short part (short but memorable).<br />The movie always keeps up the suspense anytime anyone is swimming, and keeps one wondering always who the next victim will be.<br />One can ask however why Chrissie could put up such a fight, while the shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) was swallowed up by Jaws towards the end of the movie pretty quickly.<br />Good scenes at the beach, especially the mass panic that was created everytime the shark was sighted and all the bathers stampeded out the water.<br />Although one could also ask why their were so many people in the water when the whole town knew about the shark scare.<br />Also how could Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) have let his own kids anywhere near the beach knowing what he knew.<br />Big break for Richard Dreyfuss as the excitable shark expert Matt Hooper.<br />Good scene with the kids waving to the camera during a news report- seems like these were not trained extras but was a impromptu performance by a bunch of kids asked to pose for themovie, and of course wanted to get into the picture seen by the world.<br />Fanatastic and chilling close ups of the Great White during the second half of the movie.<br /><br />This was a classic of the seventies, whatever anyone might say about the filmography with the hindsight of today's technology.

B000TXZVGQ|5.0|There have been many excellent tv shows over the decades.  All in the Family,  Seinfeld,  M*A*S*H,  etc.   My So-Called Life outshines them all.  It's not even close.  The quality of the writing,  the depth of the story lines and symbolism,  the talent of the actors,  it is simply unmatched in television history.      Just check the reviews on here,  as of this post,  there are 19 reviews,  all are 5 stars.  That may not be scientific but you'll be hard pressed to find another show that has a perfect rating.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|What made this album work so well for me personally was listening to it as a response to some of his more youthful cynicism. Playing this against Darkness on the Edge of Town or, more particularly, The River shows the growth not of Bruce the Musician (since I think he was fabulous even in that earlier era) but of Bruce the Narrator or perhaps just Bruce the Human. His rock-and-roll rebellion has found more appropriate targets (e.g. the unemployed, dismissed Vietnam vets, 9-11 survivors, Afghanistan soldiers, etc.) than his father and his hometown. Listening to \\"Long Walk Home,\\" it's hard for me not to think that this is the son of \\"The River's\\" narrator (or the son of \\"My Hometown's\\" or of \\"Born in the USA's,\\" take your pick), a young man in the 21st century who prizes his town the way his father couldn't...In short, the magic of Magic is that Bruce may have finally made peace with his youth while still maintaining his rock-and-roll soul.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have never bought any of her music till now. I only bought it because everyone was making such a fuss and I love it. The album is great and even though her life is a mess it just makes me like her even more. It shows she is truely just like everyone else money or no money!!!!!
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|If you like this CD, it will have nothing to do with Britney.  The producers, musicians etc. made cool songs.  But Britney's \\"singing\\" is so painful that it just ruins them.  C'mon, she just cannot sing!  The way they try to alter her voice is just a joke . . .if her voice needs that much alteration, why is she even in the studio?      Tedious and annoying.  Anyone saying they love it is nuts.
0802130208|5.0|This is really just the most absurdly hilarious book that I have ever read.  The characters are so well crafted in their idiocy that you feel a huge sense of loss at the end of the book.  It is such a shame that such a talented writer died before his time and before he could write an entire library of books.
B000JCETC4|5.0|Brilliant album, great live.    Check out the version of Syd Barrett's brilliant Astronomy Domine. Powerful!

B000MXPE74|5.0|A great album. I can't tell you how many times I've bought an album and been disappointed because there are only a few good tracks.  Costello Music is great from start to finish. It's upbeat and energetic.  I've listened to it many times and haven't tired of it yet.  Even my four year old asks me to play it for her again and again.  Hope this helps!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This review is a spoiler for one simple reason: I don't think anyone should ever see this movie. I simply cannot understand the high reviews this movie received from various websites, not to mention my friends. I feel that it was completely pointless. If, for some reason, you actually liked this movie, please feel free to comment as to why.    First off, I had high hopes. There were good reviews, my friends liked it, and Tarantino has directly the occasional good movie. I am also a big fan of Kurt Russell. Well, Kurt has been in some stinkers, and Quentin has directed some real dogs. This is both of them at their worst.    Let's start with the total lack of plot. Girls go out to party. Bad guy has crash resistant stunt man car. He crashes into them and kills them all because he's messed up in the head. Local Sherriff thinks he's a bad guy but can't prove it. End of act one. Act two: repeat. Except this time he picks the wrong party girls to mess with. They shoot and wound him. He cries like Nancy Kerrigan and tries to escape, wailing that he's sorry and he didn't mean it. They make him crash, drag him from his car and beat him to death. The end.     It takes two painful hours to tell this story that I typed in less than a minute. The worst part is that they set up Kurt to be a \\"cool\\" bad guy, and then turn him into a sniveling little wimp in the second half. Lame, lame, lame.     I realize that this movie is trying to do a 70s thriller camp thing, but the writing is awful. The dialogue rambles on aimlessly and reveals nothing about the story. Real people don't talk anything remotely like they do in this movie. The dialogue is about as genuine as a twenty dollar Superbowl ticket and everyone talks at hyper speeds while absolutely nothing happens. There is so much nonsensical blather going on I'm certain they killed extra trees in printing off the script.    All of the characters are annoying. The women aren't even good looking. In the first half, the one that looks half decent (Rose McGowan) gets stuck in some hideous wig, and this is magnified by the fact that I could never consider a woman who was married to Marilyn Manson attractive. She's tainted for life because of that. Rosario Dawson's infamous lap dance scene has her belly hanging out so far she looks like she is entering her second trimester. In the second half there is one nice looking woman (Lee), but she plays an insignificant role. The others are so annoying I actually want Kurt Russell to kill them, but he turns into a pansy and gets killed by them instead.     There is one character who swears like she is trying to be a female version of Samuel L. Jackson, but she fails miserably. The only person who can do Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson, so don't even try. I was disappointed when she and her annoying friends didn't die.     The one minor redeeming quality of this move was Kurt in the first half. He was mildly interesting. Instead of expanding on that for the second half they turned him into sissy. Maybe Planet Terror will be better.
0977326403|2.0|The item was received in excellent condition.  The contents are certainly not Great, and rating it Good is generous. If it isn't mandatory reading, don't buy it.
B00005JMJG|2.0|I found this movie offensive, only occasionally funny, and not just a little bit depressing.  Perhaps I'm too far removed from the zeitgeist to appreciate the emotional ties, the current \\"language of love,\\" and the easy jump in/jump out of  relationships among modern couples.  In years past, the young would extend more courtliness to whores than these people extend to each other.  I thought this movie stunk.  It's a shame too, since Jim Carrey, one of those \\"Look at me, how outrageous I am\\" clowns, acts almost human herein.  And he does it well.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|I had never even heard of Arcade fire, I was far more into Led Zeppelin and the Beatles.  Somehow I stumbled upon this album.  It is brilliant, with each song being distinct and mind-pleasing.  The music is really original.  Every time I listen to it, I like it more.  The vocals bothered me at first, but now I just can't put it down.  Wonderful.
B000002BYD|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam and most of what they do. Most of their CDs start out good, but then slow WAYYYYY down, so I skip those slow songs. This usually means that I am skipping 4 or 5 tracks-per-14-song-disk. Yield is the only one that I can listen all the way through with no skips. It is a solid release with all of my personal favorites, including two quiet but well done songs, Given to Fly and Wishlist. I give this CD a 5 out of 5. This disk is staying in my CD player for months to come.
B000N6TYLW|2.0|Gilmore Girls was an amazing show.  Unfortunatly, the final season was a disaster after the creator left.  It is really too bad.  If you want real Gilmore Girls, watch the other seasons instead.
1594489505|5.0|A novel written with such splendour and brute beauty, it is like a shockwave. With a story so immersive, and characters so beautifully wrought, the effect on the reader is mesmeric.   A truly majestic work, and one that also serves as a solemn reflection and collective lesson on the follies of a not-so-distant chapter in western political history.
0553805460|2.0|This is a perfect example how a good (perhaps great) mind can be totally distorted by ego.  This guy's ego is so much greater than his talent that it's distasteful.  The guy's a loser; rich, infamous, but a loser extraordinaire.  He's the only one who ever referred to himself as \\"Wolf\\".  That's probably because he's smaller than most, probably in all his body parts, and tries to compensate by being larger than life in his own mind.

B000UR9T8C|4.0|Personally I liked this Spiderman the best. I not only liked the fact they showed that everyone can have a dark side, but Parker didn't seem as kiddish as in the previous movies. I enjoyed the new bad guys Venom (Spiderman copy with nasty big teeth), Sandman (a muscular thief that gets rematerialized with sand), and a new Goblin (Son of Goblin), and the turn around of two of them. Spidey uses the force to turn them, well something like that. Nicely done effects added to the good story and acting. Overall plenty of action, and a more in depth look at Parker and those around him. I bought this on DVD since I had the other two already. I'm glad to have this one in the set. Excellent quality DVD with several extras.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This movie is wonderful for the young and young-at-heart alike.  Harry is full of innocence and a desire for good despite the horrible treatment he has received for 11 years.  The entire film is full of the \\"magic\\" of love and triumph of good over evil!
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|No surprises here. It's Annie Lennox doing what she does best with powerful vocals. It's very much the same kind of songs that she has on her other albums. If you're looking for a new sound - this isn't it. But if you like her style, it's more of the stuff you like.
0143038419|5.0|The book is very well written it makes you laugh and have those ah ha moments but also makes you cry. The author defiantly thought through every word and created a master piece..... Keeps you interested and before you know it you're done with the book.
B000VH3FV8|3.0|I agree with most that this could have been better.  For Luther fans, most will have about 3 CD's worth of the songs.  In this day and age it doesn't take much to make your own CD with all of his songs.  What I do wish for are unreleased songs and even a couple of CD's with nothing but duets.    Other than that, its a nice addition to my Luther collection.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|I surprised myself that I bought this album. But after the positive reviews from music critics, I was curious. This album is fun to listen too. It seems classic Britney. Lots of mixing and techno voice work. I have a feeling if Britney actually performed one of these songs live and did not lip synch, she would not sound good. With enough money and the right people and equipment, I think anyone with any kind of voice could sound good. Look at Paris Hilton!
0143038419|5.0|This book is amazing, hilarious, and life changing. The journey she takes to find herself is eventful, thrilling, and exciting. This book is a total page turner! I would recommend this to anyone who is trying to find themself, the meaning of life, love, and religion.
B000AMF7BK|5.0|The music is hypnotic.It drifts in and out of your conscience and leaves you spellbound. There really isn't a proper way to describe how this music sounds , it is such an eclectic mix of many elements.Soft and loud at the same time. Gentle and abrasive, smooth and rough. All seemingly opposite ends of the spectrum , yet it flows seamlessly. Buy one Sigur Ros release, and I would be very surprised if you didn't then seek them all out.

B000O75F7C|4.0|The songs left off this cd, which are on the Nil Recurring cd, are essential to enjoying this album to its fullest.  For some mysterious reason, the band chose not to include four great songs from the FoaBP sessions, but they are available on the Nil Recurring ep.  If you have this cd, buy Nil Recurring and combine them into one disc.  Personally, I thought that Fear of a Blank Planet was not as heavy--or as good--as In Absentia or Deadwing.  But the addition of the four leftover tracks on Nil Recurring elevates it from 4 to 5 stars.  Find it, buy it, and enjoy this album even more than you do now.
0743496728|4.0|A timely, social-issue related story that is well crafted as Picoult moves from one character's point-of-view to the one best suited to narrate the next scene.<br /><br />How does a child become a mess murderer? Picoult does an excellent job showing how years of bullying by other children--starting in early childhood on the school bus--develops into a murderous rage.<br /><br />The people responsible for it all are the adult who ignore the signs and the facts--the parents setting high standards (in this case the older, perfect-child brother), the school teachers that treat the victim and victimizer as equal partners to the misbehavior, and the school administrators that do not set the limits--and the punishment for intolerably cruel behavior.<br /><br />Once, when I mentioned to a group of Jodi Picoult's fan that her writing was \\"commercial\\" they were deeply offended. Not understanding the distinction made in the publishing industry between commercial and literary works, they might also be missing some of the literary ploys Picoult uses.<br /><br />All too often, the short passages and scenes end with a declarative line to ensure that the reader goes on reading. After a while, the frequency of these \\"cliff-hanger\\" lines creates a monotonous sound. An accomplished writer, Picoult should lose this style in favor of just trusting the reader to stay with her work. The events are strong enough to allow herself to just go on with the story.<br /><br />The character of Peter, the boy-turned-mass-murderer is well delineated. Not so the character of Josie, the girl whose boyfriend was killed during Peter's shooting rampage. The girl who emerges in the end is nothing like the girl the reader gets to know. There is nothing in her past to explain the conclusion of the book, and therefore, it is a story twist that is forced. Most cliche is Judge Cormier, a \\"mold\\" of a cold, ambitious woman whose motivations and emotions are confusing, if not inconsistent. The detective forever remains an obscure person when it comes to his personal life. Conveniently, both he and the Judges are romantically unattached, adding a soap-opera flavor to a novel that could have done without it.<br /><br />These flaws notwithstanding, I read the novel to the end, which is not a simple feat for me when so many other books are clamoring for my attention.

B000UR9T8C|2.0|My wife and I discussed the plot and how it could be improved. The accusation of too many villains has been suggested by reviewers. However, each villian contributes in substantive ways to the emotional climax. My biggest complaint is the reworking of how Peter's uncle died. It didn't quite fit with the original movie.     I'm not sure what's wrong with the plot, but it just seems weak. It has been a while since I've read the comic book; however, this plot seems like a soap opera. Peter and his girlfriend have many troubles. However, they seem more like troubles kids would have in junior high rather than two adults in their twenties. For the soap opera plot devices: amnesia for Goblin is introduced; Goblin is then healed and is evil again; and then forces MJ to break up with Peter.  Also a character who is a top model, the commissioner's daughter, and is in all of Peter's classes is introduced just to make things complicated.    Another problem with the plot is venom. A meteorite hits and it just happens to be a few hundred yards from where Peter is. This gives venom an opportunity to slither onto the Peter's scooter. Talk about Deus ex machina.     The movie lacks humor also. There are a few very good lines, but on the whole it is not very entertaining.    On the positive side, the CGI and other special effects were very good. The Sandman effects were very good. Spidey's swinging was even better than the last film. The acting was ok. I thought Church was very good. Maguire looked a little emaciated, he almost had the Gollum look going on in some scenes. There were musical numbers in this movie and they just did not fit.     In summary, the movie is ok. It's long, so keep your expectations low and it may work for you.

B000MZHW40|3.0|An excellent film for three quarters of the time but the trite ending, where the bad guys get their comeuppance and the scrappy girl journalist triumphs, spoiled what was originally a very realistic film. As one who was in Rhodesia during its troubles I can attest the Di Caprio's accent is spot on and  the treatment of a country in the throes of a civil war was excellent. Djimon Hounsou, as always, gives an first rate performance but again the ending is so improbable as to lose the viewer.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|\\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" completes one of the best film trilogies ever made. I think if you look at these three films as separate entries, they each stand up as very good examples of filmmaking. And as a trilogy, they are exemplary.<br /><br />Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) limps along a snowy Moscow street, trying to elude the police. But they quickly spot him and he has to evade them before making his way into Western Europe. There, he reads a story in the Guardian, written by columnist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine, \\"In America\\"), about him, the death of his girlfriend in India and more. Clearly, this reporter has talked to someone who knows a lot of secrets. He arranges to meet Ross, but a covert arm of the FBI, led by Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) has also learned of Ross' knowledge and wants him dead. Bourne spots the FBI agents at their designated meeting place and has to help Ross elude the men before they can meet. This leads to a terrific game of cat and mouse throughout Waterloo Train Station. Bourne eventually gets to talk to the reporter and learns about Operation Blackbriar, an extension of Project Treadwell, the project Bourne initially joined. Bourne's next stop, Madrid, where the informant is located. Frustrated with his inability to stop Bourne, Vosen brings in Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) to help track the elusive agent. In Madrid, Bourne encounters Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) who was reassigned to this station after their last encounter. She decides to help him as much as possible, and they momentarily throw Vosen off the track. But they are now on the run. With every step, Bourne's memory comes back to him and he soon remembers everything. EVERYTHING. Leading him back to New York. Leading him back to Vosen, Landy and Blackfriar.<br /><br />Picking up basically where \\"Supremacy\\" left off, director Paul Greengrass (\\"The Bourne Supremacy\\", \\"United 93\\"), writer Tony Gilroy (\\"The Bourne Identity\\", \\"Supremacy\\" and \\"Ultimatum\\") and star Matt Damon bring us to the conclusion of this fantastic trilogy.<br /><br />Even with two different directors working on the series, all three films have had remarkable consistency. If anything, Greengrass brings a more frantic style of cinematography to the films he has directed. How does he do this? With a lot of handheld camera work. This may turn some people off, in \\"Ultimatum\\", I counted maybe two shots that were not done with a handheld camera, but this technique works very favorably for this type of film. Using a handheld camera does two things; it gives us the eye of the surveillance watching Bourne and all of his counterparts and it makes everything very close to us, a little more frantic and more dangerous. Because Bourne is always being watched, or more accurately, someone is always trying to watch him, the handheld camera gives us the feel of surveillance cameras swooping through train stations and public places trying to pick up the subject. One of the more memorable scenes in \\"Ultimatum\\" shows Vosen (Strathairn) and his team, in New York, using all of their tools and tricks to track the Guardian reporter in London. They make it look so easy, and I'm sure this isn't far from the truth. Since Bourne is trying to meet with the reporter, he is also aware of their tricks and has to choreograph the meeting, getting the reporter into a safe place, helping him to elude the surveillance. It is a nifty piece of cat and mouse action. Throughout the film, the camera remains very close to Bourne and when he has conversations with people, we see them from over his shoulder, or vice versa. As they talk, the camera will shift a little and the subjects shoulder fills in more of the frame, giving us a small view of Bourne. Again, this helps to bring us into Bourne's world, giving us a feel of the claustrophobic, dangerous quality his life has.<br /><br />Because \\"Ultimatum\\" is about Bourne remembering things, and trying to get his life back, the character has to go through a lot of change. As Bourne learns more of the puzzle, his memories gradually return. Damon has a lot on his plate to make this part of the character believable while the film continues to deliver all of the action we are hoping for. Bourne has been a killer and covert agent for a long time, so his emotions aren't going to come flooding back to the surface. I don't think he is capable of showing more than a little emotion at any one time. In \\"Supremacy\\", when his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente, \\"Run Lola Run\\") is killed in India, he is disturbed, but he never breaks down and cries. He doesn't have time for this.

Damon has a lot on his plate to make this part of the character believable while the film continues to deliver all of the action we are hoping for. Bourne has been a killer and covert agent for a long time, so his emotions aren't going to come flooding back to the surface. I don't think he is capable of showing more than a little emotion at any one time.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|Wow! Truly an imposing spectacle. I've never seen such a wonderful documentary before this one. Every moment, every image says how nature has a powerful potential to amaze us. The camera angles, the Landscapes  and topics, the transformations scenes to describe the season's change or the growth of plants. All of these show us a unique and precious world. This world is the one we live within. Better than any other television program, these BBC Series convince us to struggle for protection and preservation of our marvellous planet.
B000UR9TQO|5.0|I am shocked at the comments of some folks who believe this footage   of the group to be awful. Each to his own, but in my humble opinion - it is absolutely smoking... Page's guitar-work alone is some  of the most creative, melodic and powerful of his career.  His extended journeys on Dazed and Confused, and his solos elsewhere  blaze - several songs feature his rarely heard jazz-inflected harmonic side, neck-in-neck with typically fierce blues riffing  and angular lines..some of his most accurate playing as well. All this about the guitar! suffice to say, the singing,   bass, and drums add their own live-wire energy to the mix. The rhythm  stomps with big boots. Each pillar of the group brings the magic in this set.
B000654Z2I|3.0|Unless you were a krautrock devotee in the late sixties and early seventies or were an avid reader of obscure music publications, chances are you never heard of Can until latter-day hosannahs became ever more frequent in today's nearly universally accessible digital world. Heck, I don't think the term \\"krautrock\\" had been coined at the time Tago Mago was current so if you lived in North America at that time and had actually heard Can, then you were avant-garde indeed!  I bought Tago Mago because it generates the most rapturous commentary in the music magazines to which I subscribe. After listening a few times, it became quickly apparent that this is not everyday fare. This is an album you have to be in the mood to enjoy although judging from some of the near-orgasmic reviews, some listeners are always in that mood.   If I was asked to classify the music, I would say you might call it proto-ambient or proto-trance. Indeed, some of the cuts seem as though they are meant to induce a trance-like state in listeners. I have found that I like it best when driving through an area of monotonous scenery, like the road between Gila Bend and Yuma AZ.  Anyway, what strikes me most about Can is their use of percussion. Its very relentless on a couple cuts and for me it sets the mood, sternly guiding, but not overshadowing what else is happening. My favorite cuts are Oh Yeah and Halleluhwah. But the cacophonous din of Aumgn, Peking O, and Bring Me Coffee or Tea do very little to excite me.  There is enough interesting material on Tago Mago to get me to hazard another Can album, but its not the kind of gripping, soul-stirring work I had been led to expect. If you haven't heard this recording or Can before, by all means read some of the other reviews to get a balanced view. If you have heard it, then you already know whether or not you like it. This remastered issue comes with an attractive booklet, the best features being a couple of short essays that broaden the listener's appreciation of what the band is about.
B000VZBCWE|4.0|When I first saw this being released, I'll admit, my first opinion was \\"oh no, now they're releasing stuff to make money\\". But, as usual, like any true fan, I bought it! And how happy I am!     To anyone with a home theatre, who owns the previous release, this is NOT a waste of money. There is a definate improvement in sound. A HUGE improvement in sound. Much more low end, more even sound. I really enjoy this release, unlike the previous version, where I felt I wasn't part of the concert. This puts me right in the middle. An important record of this era of the band.    Queen have been releasing very special concerts representing important eras of the band, and this is no less important. Keep up the great work Brian and Roger! (and John? where are you John!)
0765315246|5.0|Oh yes, this one is a keeper... and not only the book, but I am adding John Scalzi to my favorite authors list.  Creative and entertaining, Mr. Scalzi writes 'real' and that resonates with me. Since reading this one, I have read more of his work and I look forward to future writings in whatever genre he chooses.  Highly recommended - and if you loan it out, it best be to someone you love, because they may keep it!
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Im a big movie fan and collect movies as a hobbie and i have to say this is the best movie ever made. i truely think this is the best movie of all time! kate winslet did a wonderful perfomence in this movie! what makes this movie sooooooo good is the fact that it is like two movies in one. you have what is probly the most romantic love story ever and then you have a great disaster story to go along with it. what makes this movie evan better is the 3 disc collectors edition. when this movie first came out on DVD in 1999 i was disopointed that it had no special features. but this special edition has all the speacial features you could ever want. the best thing is that the movie has been digitally remastered. the picture quallty is like 20 times betta then the other DVD copy of the movie. so dont listen to all the people bad mouthing the movie. take my word for it this movie is really good. it won lots of Academy awards and was a kiling at the box office so if you love movies like me this is a keeper!!!!!

1594489505|5.0|When I read the Kite runner, I knew I had to read this book. Mr Hosseini is blessed with the gift of storytelling. I love the ease with which he writes making the book readable. This book makes me believe in the human spirit and what people have to do to endure all the hardships that may come their way and the sacriifces people make to their country. I have told my children about this book, and can't wait for them to read it. I hope they have the courage to show love and to sacrifice for America the way Afghanis have sacrificed for their homeland. It also tells me that even in Afghanistan, love endures all ills.

B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I have always been a Britney fan....however, I was very skeptical when I heard she had released a new album.  I just did not think she had it in her.  I was wrong!!  This album is her best, by far.  She ditched those pseudo deep slow songs (Sometimes, Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman) and went for a more 80's pop, electronica sound.  This is a new sound for Britney.  I am sure she will be criticized for having her voice synthesized in some songs...but with the style of music she is doing, it is acceptable.  Even if you hate Britney, you should still sample the CD, you will find yourself moving to it!!
B000NA1OXY|5.0|i'll admit, i wasn't a fan of hers 'til now...after hearing the song 'girlfriend' a lot, but the album is really good.  take the time to listen to songs like 'runaway' 'innocence' 'hot' 'contagious' 'keep holding on' 'when you're gone' those are all my faves... this cd and the britney blackout cd are the 2 best albums i've bought this year...def. recommend.
B00005JNTX|5.0|What better way to watch Sin City without commercials, than to order the DVD? All of Frank Miller's graphic novel vision is stunningly recreated in the film. From orange skinned bad guys, to long coated good guys to hellish [...], Sin City is rich in texture and long on characterizations and surprises. I wholeheartedly endorse Sin City as more than a good investment. It is providing for one's self a movies both exhilirating and seductive.
B000Q66PXE|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my closest friends.     Now, everytime we talk ... I get a freaking book review of the most recent episode. I sincerely believe they are addicted.    They tell me that it is historically accurate and very realistic. Their daughter has a doctorate in Latin and their son married a vegan, so I think they are pretty creditable people.    I watched only 15 minutes ... and I got hungry for a Ceasar's Salad.    I don't want to ruin this series for anyone by giving away the ending, but from what I understand, in the end - everyone becomes Italian.
0810993139|5.0|My son hates reading so a parent told me to buy him this book. When I gave him this book, he seemed disinterested as usual, but when I told him to read it during his scheduled reading time, he could not put the book down even past his reading time. He loved the book. He read the book for once cover to cover. He even took it to school and read it during their scheduled reading time at school. The pictures helped a lot, but more importantly, it was the story that grabbed his attention. I totally recommend this book for kids who do not like to read.
B000NVL1XQ|5.0|The first review is completely out of control. Would a film about 3 victims killed in a bar be called the Hurricane? Maybe if they were actually killed by a Hurricane. The movie itself was very good. You must know that they did take and immense amount of dramatic license to get the film story told. They were very good performances and Denzel was recognized by the academy for his excellent work. I enjoyed it for what it was. So will you. Maybe if the film wasn't directed by a great Jewish director and didn't star an Immensely talented and charismatic African American actor, the \\"reviewer\\" above wouldn't have had such a problem with the film.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|Du Maurier's classic takes the reader back to an earlier time when class and gentility were prevalent in the countryside not far from London.  Mental images of the characters and the opulent house and grounds at Manderly will fill your mind.  The female reader will easily identify with the young bride as Maximillian brings her home from their honeymoon in Europe.  You find yourself wishing you could have such a life, except of course for the evil Mrs. Danvers, housekeeper at Manderly and personal maid to the first Mrs. de Winter.  The suspense builds and holds you spellbound till the last page as the tale slowly unfolds.  I had read this book as a teen and remembered loving it, but was still surprised by the ending!  (Memory for details of this kind fade over 40+ years!)
B00000294R|4.0|Big L's first album is one of those releases that bring back memories of what NYC hip hop was all about before the commercialization of hip hop(via Puffy). Put It On was the first single and was a great choice for the lead single because it showcases Big L's skills on the mic. No Endz, No Skinz is the old school track that still rings of truth as L explains how the chicks are. 8 Iz Enough is the street banger featuring Mcgruff(what happened to him?) Cam'ron (back when he was decent), Terra Budda Bless and others. He spits some of the most wittiest and grittiest rhymes over dark production on tracks like All Black. Danger Zone, Da Graveyard(I still laugh my a** off at Jay-z's verse!), Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous(great title track) and Let Em Have It L. Big L tries his hand at songs of substance on tracks like Street Struck where he explains how people can get caught up in street life and Fed Up With The Bull**** where he talks about Police Brutality. On I Dont Understand It, Big L shows his frustration with the game and how rapppers who suck are usually selling. MVP and Fed Up With The Bulls**** are two tracks that are far from garbage and far from suspect but they dont necessarily standout in comparison to the other tracks on the album. Bottom Line: Big L's Lifestylez Ov Da Poor And Dangerous is Big L's best work and is one of the best albums in 1995. Big L not only has songs for the hip hop heads but he also has songs of substance like Street Struck and Fed Up With The Bull**** that anybody of sound mind can respect. Not to mention that his delivery switches up from normal to fast paced on certain tracks and his rhymes are very impressive and punchlines hilarious. I strongly recommend this to anyone who is fan of real hip hop. Standout tracks: PUT IT ON, NO ENDZ NO SKINZ, ALL BLACK, 8 IZ ENOUGH, DANGER ZONE, STREET STRUCK, DA GRAVEYARD, LIFESTYLEZ OV DA POOR AND DANGEROUS and I DONT UNDERSTAND IT.<br /><br />REST IN PEACE BIG L!!!  1974-1999.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Her personal life may be in the toilet, but despite all of that Britney Spears has managed to record her best album YET!  The worst thing about this album is the cover.  Thanks Jive!  You guys took one of the most beautiful stars in the world and successfully made the ugliest CD cover in all of music history.  BUT, don't judge a book by its cover or in this case a CD by its cover!  The quality of music on this cd is AMAZING and some of Britney's best yet!  Every song is great.  They will get you moving and singing along as a good album should.  Blackout is the album everybody should own!  You won't be disappointed.  Viva la Britney!
B000UJ48XG|5.0|I was very much looking forward to this album, since I couldn't get enough of Gulag and Lon Gisland, and even with all of my great expectations I am absolutely delighted with the Flying Club Cup. The music behind Zach's fall-in-love-with-me voice is so complex and rich that Beirut can hardly be called a band - it is an orchestra.  Where else can you find such instruments as the harpsichord, glockenspiel, accordion, ukulele, and others that you simply don't hear much nowadays (unless you look!)?  Check out this album's website to see videos of all of the songs - you won't be disappointed.  They really look like they're having fun playing these incredible songs (on one they even use a watermelon as an instrument).  The sheer imagination and creativity of Zach Condon and company take this new album a long way in my book, but the beautiful melodies and Condon's haunting voice truly make this a success.
B0000BXGCN|5.0|This is true to Lara's style and brings another dimension to her career.  The pure delight of hearing her in new songs or reprises of older ones is such a rewarding experience.  I love this CD and just wish Lara was more prolific in her recordings.  What a shame that she stays a well kept secret in the US.  Her voice rivals Barbra and surpasses Celine and yet few have experienced the magic of her talent.  This could become my favorite ever.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|After a bit of a whirlwind with the first film, this one tries to build up more of plot. Nevertheless its still very slow in that aspect, but fast paced in the action. Kate is a real charmer in the role, and its nice to see the different spins on lykens.  Still looking to appear olde, the film could have benefited from more modernism. Nevertheless a good way to while away one and a half hours or so.
B000WSJNWQ|5.0|RENDITION has it all: Superb direction (by the masterful Gavin Hood of \\"Crash\\" fame); a great cast (Meryl Streep, Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Omar Metwally); a riveting and harrowing plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat; even an interesting twist at the end (which I won't give away) that had us all discussing the movie for an hour afterwards. And if all of that isn't enough, this is an extremely timely topic. Our government's participation in torturing people at secret prisons around the world is something that all American citizens should be discussing and debating. Unfortunately, this engaging thriller is not getting the audience it deserves. The fact that \\"Saw IV,\\" a warped glorification of brutality, has earned four times as much at the box office as Rendition suggests that for many Americans, out of sight is out of mind and escapism is the name of the game.
B0000042MY|5.0|This soundtrack has beautiful celtic/folk music. I listen to soundtrack music all the time, and this is one of the best ones.
0783116934|5.0|Between 1978 and 1990 Andrei Chikatilo murdered 52 women and children within what was then the USSR.  The official \\"party line\\" that serial killers were strictly a Western phenomenon did much to hamstring police attempts to locate and arrest this person (he was, in fact, arrested once, but released due to unusual forensic conditions).  \\"Citizen X\\" is a dramatization of both Chikatilo and the police officers who relentlessly pursued him over a period of several years.  Chris Gerolmo's understated direction makes for gripping storytelling without resorting to sensationalism.  He is aided by Stephen Rea, here portraying the Russian detective who constantly goes up against one bureaucratic brick wall after another as he doggedly follows the slender trail of clues (those who appreciated his performance as a police officer in \\"V For Vendetta\\" will be given far more to enjoy here).  The cast is also heightened by the presence of Donald Sutherland as a coolly sympathetic colonel quietly determined to help Rea, Joss Ackland as the very picture of a stubborn Russian bureaucrat, and Max von Sydow as the psychiatrist who provides the final pieces of the puzzle.  Kudos must also be given to Jeffrey DeMunn who plays Chikatilo: ably balancing the character between a man driven by uncontrollable lusts and a thorough monster.  Watching this film was like wandering through the reptile house at a zoo . . . you're sometimes terrified but you can't take your eyes away.
0345404475|5.0|To me, Philip K Dick's significance as a writer and a thinker is best described by Baudrillard, who (quote from the Wikipedia follows) \\"[saw him as] the ultimate articulation of hyperreality:        \\"It is hyperreal. It is a universe of simulation, which is something altogether different. And this is so not because Dick speaks specifically of simulacra. SF has always done so, but it has always played upon the double, on artificial replication or imaginary duplication, whereas here the double has disappeared. There is no more double; one is always already in the other world, an other world which is not another, without mirrors or projection or utopias as means for reflection. The simulation is impassable, unsurpassable, checkmated, without exteriority. We can no longer move \\"through the mirror\\" to the other side, as we could during the golden age of transcendence.\\"\\"      In plain terms, it means that the 21st century belongs neither to Orwell nor to Huxley.  It belongs to Phillip K Dick.  This is how it's going to be and this is how things, in many ways, already ARE -- because this is how we already THINK.  Remember that when reading this powerful and gripping novel, IMO one of Dick's best.
0525950079|3.0|I've liked Ken Follett.  He writes good fiction, and if I'm traveling on a plane or sitting on a beach a Follett book will be guaranteed to help pass the time.  Unfortunately, although I passed a lot of time on the beach, I felt at the end of \\"World Without End\\" that Ken Follett was reaching and perhaps tired.  Pretty much, one long contrived soap opera. 1014 pages of it!<br /><br />Gwenda is rodent-like, narrow set eyes, but hard working; and Ralph likes to look at her from behind.<br /><br />Ralph is inherently evil, violent and selfish, and he never seems to go away ever except to anger us at the newest evil violence perpetrated upon the good and hard-working.<br /><br />Merthin is Ralph's brother, and he is clever, creative, and constantly cheated by the evil selfish clergy(Godwyn,Philemon, etc) and disappointed by Caris, a liberated woman who cannot decide for about 800 pages or so if she'd rather be married to Merthin or married to the church or to her own self-absorbed undefined sense of feminism.<br /><br />There it is:  Gwenda, Ralph, Merthin and Caris.  Throw in a superficial description of the Bubonic Plague and the Battle of Crecy and a dialogue that reminds me of an extra in a Ben Hur movie still wearing a wrist watch....and you have it.<br /><br />Pierce Scranton M.D.<br />author, Death on the Learning Curve

B000W1V44I|5.0|This album is wonderful! I bought it along with the Britney Spears new CD, and I have to admit that I listen to this CD a lot more than the other! I have been a fan for years, and the Boys have really perfected their game. Strong vocals, something that you can't help but listen to. They consistently prove that you can create much more powerful music when you have great talent as opposed to a great computer!
0312370830|5.0|This book will stay with you forever.  It's characters though fictional take root in you and become very much real.
B000DN5W4I|4.0|Great DVD with Joe playing and singing as the genius he is.    Only thing that bothered me about the DVD (and this is true of many concert DVD's) is I really wish the camera would quit jumping around from view to view every couple of seconds. Stay on a view for awhile and then maybe slowly pan or fade to a different view. But this constant, frequent, and rapid changing of views is something I honestly dislike.    Despite my objection to camera views, I highly recomend this DVD to anyone interested in one of the best and most original guitar players around.
B000Y179KO|5.0|For a while the Eagles were an endangered species. Their brand of country rock formed an important part of life's soundtrack for so many people. 'Hotel California' speaks for itself, but their earlier work was always the solid creative foundation. They created atmosphere and their harmonies were simply gorgeous. The opening track on this album ('No More Walks in the Wood') begins with a simple guitar chord and then we have those harmonies. The hair stands up on the back of your head and you say to yourself \\"God, I've missed you guys - welcome back\\". The next track 'How Long' rocks along nicely and reminds me of 'Take It Easy'. And it just keeps getting better. All the songs on this double CD set are good and some are great ('Waiting in the Weeds' is really special, as is 'Long Road Out Of Eden'). The musicianship has always been there, and this album has the usual high-quality Eagles sound in great and gorgeous, technicolour quantities. This is not a comeback, it's their next album and it's great. I highly recommend this album - it adds to the soundtrack of our lives very nicely.

B000GIWS7E|5.0|[[ASIN:B000GIWS7E Dream Theater - Score: 20th Anniversary World Tour Live with the Octavarium Orchestra]]  An incredible captur of a video history of this remarkably flexible group's twenty years producing mind blowing musical masterpieces. John Petrucci shines in this live performance. Totally awesome to watch at high output thru a good video system!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series is a moving tribute to the men and women fighting in WWII.  It is a must buy for anyone interested in WWII, and in my opinion is one of the best films made about WWII - EVER.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I completely agree with another reviewer about seeing this movie multiple times.  I loved it at first viewing but thought the Evey plot distracting filler.  After seeing it again I realized how central it is to the deep meaning of the movie, how there are things more important than an individual life, that there are still ideals worth dying and maybe killing for.  Also there is freedom in refusing to surrender your ideals and ultimate freedom when you have nothing left to loose.<br /><br />This is a very important film, it should rank with the best films of all time.  It's an intelligent film that may go over many people's heads if they're just looking for an action flick.  It rewards the thinking viewer.<br /><br />The Amazon reviewer Rob Bracco got it completely wrong, concluding his review with, \\"the movie only offers a means with no ends, and those looking for answers may find the film stylish, but a bit empty.\\"
B000VI04HK|2.0|Having been a fan of REM for 19 years or so, since first encountering them on a business trip to the USA, I'm not sure what I hoped to get from this set, but whatever I hoped for, it is missing.    A pointless stopgap in lieu of a new album, now due in 2008 if we are lucky.
0385486804|5.0|The author does a wonderful job reporting what's known about Chris McCandless' life and death in the wild and detailing the thoughts and risks a young man is willing to take when competing against nature.  I heard Jon Krakauer's interview on NPR's Fresh Air a month ago and couldn't wait to read the book.  It really is a fascinating story.  I really felt for Chris, because I believe every young man has this thought that they can live off the land and survive, without help from anyone else.  It's a nice, quick read that I would recommend.    Enjoy.
B000V8I2QU|4.0|In the order of things that are magical, I'm not sure that this record has a very high rank, I'm sorry to say.  As a modern rock album, Springsteen's Magic is middling to above average, to be sure, and as an entry into the Springsteen catalog it's capable, but I suppose I'm in the minority of reviewers when I say that there's nothing really exceptional about this record to recommend it to the broader public.    The summary, for the uninitiated (whom I assume have been living in a cave for the past thirty years, or have only been alive for no more than ten or fifteen of them), Magic is the latest album from Bruce Springsteen (accompanied by the E Street Band, which is very relevant) at the time of this writing.  That's kind of a big deal, because he hasn't been producing quite as much music these days as he used to, and less of it (proportionally) has been with that aforementioned amazing backing band, due in no small part to the competing commitments of both Springsteen and the individual band members.  This is your average rock album, which means that if you just stumbled onto this product through some convoluted sequence of links and you are not, in fact, the type of person that likes that sort of thing, you won't like this record.  Fans of Springsteen's more folk-oriented fare (Nebraska, The Ghost of Tom Joad, etc.) exclusively will also be disappointed.    Well, that's enough of that - let's get to the meat of the issue, eh?  I don't want anybody to misunderstand me - I don't DISLIKE Magic in any sense of the word.  The sad fact of the matter is that I'm not particularly aware of it even when I have it on.  None of the songs are terrible, but they all tend to blend together into the background, rendering the record itself - dare I say - rather unexceptional, and that's the primary reason why I'm penalizing it by one star in this evaluation.    Sonically, Magic is very much a follow-up to The Rising, as should be evident to anybody who's heard both albums upon first listen.  The instruments have been cranked up to form an almost Spector-ish wall of sound into which Springsteen's capable vocal work is integrated (despite the fact that he cannot now and has not ever been able to sing, which is no small achievement).  Most of the music here is possessed of the sort of loud, echoing quality that I can only identify as vaguely uplifting and desperate at the same time, which is certainly interesting for the first few minutes, but kind of wears into a sort of gentle background noise after a while.    In evaluating this record, I'm forced to ask myself how it stacks up to other entries in the Springsteen catalog, and in that regard I have to say I'm disappointed.  This is in no way a competitor with Darkness on the Edge of Town or Born in the U.S.A. for top spot in his catalog.  What we have here is a solid piece of workmanship from a veteran of the genre, executed well enough to persuade me not to take it out of the player when it rolls around in the rotation, but perhaps not enough originality to motivate me to put it in there in the first place.    For Springsteen fans, there's little to be said.  You're going to buy this record because you're a fan, and you won't be dissatisfied, though you may be a little disappointed if you're like me.  For incoming fans, if you're just being introduced to Springsteen by way of the singles from this album, it's not a terrible place to start, but ultimately I have to say you'd be better served to pick up one of his more \\"classic\\" albums or a good collection as a primer on the man and his body of work.  I can't really say much to disparage the quality of this record - it's done quite well.  All I can say is that, for me, there's a very good chance that this CD isn't going to be played much not because it's awful, but because it does little to entice me.  All the same, I'm glad to see Springsteen still producing quality music of this caliber, and remain hopeful that his next record will incorporate more of the infectious hooks and wonderful composition that attracted me to him in the first place.

0062515675|4.0|Self-help books seem to be a dime a dozen. This book is actually fiction with the noble aim of improving the person who is reading it like a self-help book.     The book itself centers around the story of a former big-shot lawyer. The lawyer had a self-described wake-up call after a heart attack. This rude awakening led him to sell his possessions and to look for a more meaningful life from certain sages in the East. Of course, the rest of the book is him recounting what he learned.    This book has a number of practical suggestions to lower stress and help you feel happier. Things like breathing deeply, living in the present moment, serving others, continually improving yourself, making the most of your time, and taking time out for self-reflection. There are many important lessons about what's really important in life. Is having a big bank account more important than peace of mind? Do fancy cars and clothes bring more happiness than spending quality time with your family and friends?    I don't think there's any debate of the value of the message. Who couldn't put these admonishments to good use? I think the real challenge is practicing the techniques described. The book itself even advises that people need to stick with these techniques for at least three weeks till they become habit.    One thing that knocked the book a little for me was the cliches. For instance, the cliche of emptying your cup is used in this book. I've read this story of the master who keeps pouring tea into the cup till it's overflowing at least one hundred times. There were some other cliches used that I've also heard plenty of times. This made the book at times seem a little on the cheesy side and a bit unoriginal. Even with these caveats the book still has a lot of practical benefit. For these reasons, I think a person should pick it up if they're looking for inspiration or motivation in their lives.

I have bought 5 copies of this book to give away and sold out every bookstand in airports that I visit.  Read it NOW.
B0002SROSQ|2.0|Let me first say that I've been a fan of Nick Cave since the Boys Next Door and I've hardly found an album I disliked in those 25 years.  That changed on Nocturama, which I just thought was a let-down.  Now, we get 2 albums of similar material.<br /><br />Abattoir Blues is marked by 2 major shifts - the departure of Blixa Bargeld and the drum seat being taken over by Jim Sclavunos.  Overall, this album sounds like generic Alterna-Rock circa 1995.  It isn't BAD, just generic.  The guitars are up-front, the songs structured in a very straight ahead rock mode.  It doesn't sound like the Bad Seeds.  None of this would matter if the songs were memorable, but they just aren't.  I mean, when I first listened to this, I had to look at the packaging to make sure I hadn't put on a CD of B-sides.<br /><br />Lyre Of Orpheus finds Thomas Wydler back in the drum seat and a return to a more familiar sound.  Again, though, the songs just are not very strong.  The most memorable melody is Easy Money, which quite frankly, is a stupid song.  Even some of my least favorite Cave albums, Henry's Dream for instance, had top-notch songwriting.<br /><br />Hopefully, these albums are just glitches in a long and storied career.

B000PTYPAC|5.0|How do you even begin to try and top your excellent debut? Paramore seems to have that exact remedy.<br /><br />After listening to Paramore's newest offering, Riot!, it's obvious confidence is a determining factor for them in topping All We Know Is Falling. Gun to my head, I don't think I could've told you a single song from their debut that I thought Hayley went all out vocally. Not the case with Riot!. In almost every song you can actually feel the emotion exuding from Hayley, and, more importantly, you can honestly tell that they were simply having fun while recording this.<br /><br />Keeping the 'easy to listen through the entire CD' schtick going they upped the ante by incorporating some amazingly catchy songs throughout. Immediate favorites are sure to include For a Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic, Hallelujah, Misery Business, crushcrushcrush, and Fences. A couple others that kind of sneak their way onto your favorites list are When It Rains, Let The Flames Begin, and Born For This.<br /><br />They've kept one of my favorite aspects of Paramore firmly intact however, their stellar lyrics. Completely un-emo in every possible way, Paramore, and more importantly, Hayley, prove to be way ahead of their peers. Something new? An easily dance-worthy track found in the form of Fences.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Hallelujah, When It Rains, Let The Flames Begin, crushcrushcrush, and Fences. Paramore is getting A LOT more attention right now, so let's all hope that this new found popularity won't tarnish what has made them so loved in the first place (coughMTVcough). If you loved the debut you'll be reminded all over again why you love Paramore. New? You probably just found a new favorite.

B0009W5K0Y|5.0|There are bands that come around that you know you're going to get sucked into regardless of your feelings about them. Paramore is one of those bands.<br /><br />I heard of them a while ago--probably when All We Know Is Falling was just coming out--but once I found out they had the 'emo' tag following them around I immediately turned my back on them. That didn't last long. I started hearing bits and pieces of songs here and there and they sounded pretty good so I looked into them further. I don't really see any true traces of what makes emo bands so bad. Hayley doesn't whine about not being loved and she doesn't talk about wanting to kill and/or harm herself. In fact, Paramore's lyrics are pretty empowering. As far as the music goes, it's fairly standard. They definitely have some great riffs scattered throughout but none that will define any one song.<br /><br />All We Know Is Falling stands as one of those CDs where you can put it in and just let it play on repeat without ever tiring of it. You have your standouts like All We Know, Brighter, Here We Go Again, Conspiracy, and My Heart, then you have the rest which are still completely great and keep the CD interesting without really blowing your mind.<br /><br />My favorite songs are All We Know, Brighter, Here We Go Again, Conspiracy, and My Heart. I think the main reason Paramore is getting so much more attention now is because they are--regretably--in a genre dominated by men (emo), and here you have this cute girl churning out truly catchy songs that won't easily leave your head. It doesn't hurt that her voice is actually good and she never strains it to force a scream or anything which is another thing that helps out the end result. All We Know Is Falling is highly recommended.

B000SZMBQI|5.0|This is an excellent way to get both Volume's 1 and 3 without having to pay through the nose for an extra disc.  This cd is silver factory pressed.  The sound quality is superb.  When the they released the new Wilbury's 3-disc set why didn't they just put all the songs onto one disc and sell it as 1 cd and 1 dvd instead of making people pay more for 2 cd's and 1 dvd?  I guess the answer would be to make more money.
B000005DQR|5.0|Listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the first musical album ever to be created entirely from sampled sources, DJ Shadow's \\"Endtroducing...\\" took a genre that had been pioneered by Massive Attack and proved just exactly what it was capable of.  Even critics of this record have to admit that, like it or not, this album changed the collective face of electro-cloned hip hop.<br /><br />Using samples from sources as diverse as The Beastie Boys, Metallica, A Tribe Called Quest, Tangerine Dream, Nirvana, Bjork, Tears for Fears, and even Twin Peaks, DJ Shadow (Josh Davis) creates a world of drum-driven dreaminess.  Something instantly familiar without being recognizable.  A new class of listening pleasure that is akin to having a persistent itch being continuously scratched.<br /><br />His record is heavy on the breaks, his phenomenal mixing abilities shining through the most at this moments.  The Transylvanian \\"Organ Donor\\" and the funky free-for-all that is \\"Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt\\" are schizophrenic proof of this, and they're also great examples of how Shadow likes to take his energy at the tables and condense it into something that could be equally classified as \\"creepy\\" and \\"transcendent.\\"<br /><br />The mood, like the DJ's name, is dark, but it also implies something brighter.  You can't have shadows without light, and many of \\"Endtroducing...\\"s songs glimmer with the outlines of something crystalline and playful.  All three of the \\"Transmission\\" tracks (\\"Changeling,\\" \\"Stem/Long Stem,\\" and \\"What Does Your Soul Look Like [Part 1: Blue Sky Revisit]\\") are infused with such a loping lounge-y lilt that it's hard not to smile as you listen, even with Shadow shadows it all with his dark, trademark rhythms.<br /><br />The title of my favorite song on the whole album sums Shadow's mood perfectly:  \\"Midnight in a Perfect World.\\"  The record is about perfection, it's about ensuring that each molecule and vibration is set to the same beautiful frequency.  And then that aching beauty is saturated with the flavors of night, salted with stars, and basted in the ambient majesty of Shadow's lunar lunacy.  \\"Endtroducing...\\" is a night owl of a record, a musical journey that is always on the verge of dawn.<br /><br />Welcome to the shadows.aturated with the flavors of night, salted with stars, and basted in the ambient majesty of Shadow's lunar lunacy.  \\"Endtroducing...\\" is a night owl of a record, a musical journey that is always on the verge of dawn.

B000V6BE6C|4.0|Yea, i know it is nothing like there other albums, but please if they stayed one way it would get so boring. This album brings a new persective of what the band can do for there next album. I would recomend this album to every one, unlike City of evil i too wish they had more guitar solos in this album and longer songs, but what they did it blows me away. Try and make other bands produce there own albums they would have so much trouble it would just be funny. This album rocks and i cannot wait to see them in concert!

B000UR9T8C|1.0|My biggest gripe is this: What's up with the director making Peter do fight scenes without costume or a mask? Sacrilege! This is supposed to be about a superhero. Spidey is cool, Parker isn't. You can infect him with a simbiot if you want, but Parker will still be a geek. In fact, the only thing worse than a geek is a geek who THINKS he is cool. Parker is the Charlie Brown of superhero alter egos, and will always be. That is what gives him his appeal, a lovable loser. To put him center stage over the Webslinger absolutely killed this film, special effects be darned. And Harry's character as a supervillian? Trifling at best. Stupid plot, and a waste of my money. Take my advice: Unless you are a comic fan ala the Trekkies, rent this...don't buy it.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing David Gilmour in concert in Chicago last year, and watching this brought back pleasing memories.  David is spot-on with his guitar and his voice hasn't sounded better in years.  The production of this DVD is outstanding and the sound quality is stellar.  I especially enjoyed some of the more obscure stuff, like Fat Old Sun and Wot's Uh The Deal.  And David Bowie joining Gilmour on stage for a couple of numbers was awesome.  I have been a Gilmour junkie since the early 80's and this just adds to his legendary status among the rock gods.  Buy it and enjoy it on the biggest screen you can get your hands on, and you won't be disappointed.

1593080255|3.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is a classic novel about the consequences of eternal youth. Young Dorian Gray promised his soul in exchange for the favor of his body never aging. Instead, a portrait of him grows older in his place. An eerie idea, indeed.<br />While the concept and story itself are extremely interesting it was not the best execution. As another reviewer pointed out, it's not the easiest read for a modern reader. While the passages did not confuse me they did occasionally bore me. I found the book hard to get into - and once I got into it I had a hard time keeping interest.<br />I do not doubt Wilde's credibility as an author in the slightest I feel that, as a modern reader, this is a book that may not stand the test of time as well as others. An extremely interesting idea, but the book feel a bit short.

Sounds cool, to bad that Lockheed has nothing to do with the engines in the F-14.<br /><br />Yeah it's a small error, but just one of MANY.<br /><br />The plot is so improbable and unbelievable that it ruins any chance the story has of redemption.<br /><br />How many times can Brown have his characters \\"sense\\" something.  These are some very \\"sensitive characters\\" because they are constantly \\"sensing\\" things around them.<br /><br />I'd give this book negative stars if possible.
B00005JPFH|3.0|When we last saw our arachnid hero, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and lady love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) finally hooked up and Spidey-hating Harry Osborn (James Franco) has found out that the man he blames from his father's death is in fact his very best friend. Spider-Man 3 picks up not long after 2 left off. MJ is now the lead role in a broadway musical, Peter is about to propose to MJ, and Spider-Man is the toast of the town despite fast-talking Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson's best efforts. All seems to be going well, but Harry hasn't let go of his vendetta against the webslinger, a new superpowered foe has arrived in the form of the granular-composed Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church), a new love interest has entered Peter's life in Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), and a new photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is in competition with Peter for a staff photographer job at the Bugle. Things just got really tough for our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.    Too tough, in fact. The fact that the film has to juggle three villains really makes it tough to care about any of them. The performances are fine (particularly Franco's scheming Harry), but a lot of characters get wasted here because there just isn't enough time to give them all their due screen time. Harry's Goblin gets amnesia after a thrilling tussle with Peter (a plot turn that feels like it belongs in an afternoon soap opera rather than belonging in a big-budget Hollywood film), which takes him out of the story for a good portion of the film. His character is the only villain that gets any real resolution and closure, but you do see it coming a mile away and you start to feel that a simple five-minute sit-down with Peter would have straightened his entire storyline out.    Sandman literally gets washed down a drain and he disappears for a long period of the film as well. His conflict involving his sick daughter serves as a means to make him a sympathetic character and give him a motive,but it has a very weak resolution that could have been handled better.    And the final villain, fan-favorite Venom, appears only at the movie's climax and is disposed of rather quickly. Oh I'm sure a sneaky writer can find a way to resurrect him in later films since comic book characters rarely ever stay dead, but he gets the least screen time here despite being one of Spider-Man's deadliest foes and it is more than apparent that director Sam Raimi had his arm thoroughly twisted by Avid Arad and Marvel to squeeze Venom in. Venom could be the main villain all my himself. they should have saved him for Spider-Man 4 and gave him a whole movie to make Spidey's life a living hell.    This movie is also composed of a long string of improbable coincidences. Spider-Man rescues Gwen Stacy, who also happens to be Peter Parker's lab partner in science class, who also happens to be going out with Eddie Brock, Peter's rival. And it just so happens that the man who was really responsible for the death of Peter's uncle has escaped from prison and just so happened to stumble into a wacky science experiment and become yet another mutated madman for Spidey to tangle with. And it just so happens that a meteor crash-lands near Peter, some alien goo from the meteor attaches itself to him, and when Peter finally ditches it, Eddie Brock just so happens to be nearby to absorb the goo. Can anyone else say, \\"Oh come on!\\"?    And yes, Evil Peter (or as some on the Internet have dubbed him, \\"Emo Peter\\" due to his long bangs) just isn't dark enough. Heck, he dances and struts down the street like Travolta in Saturday Night Fever! He should be more malicious and angry than coming up with neat dance numbers to make Mary Jane jealous. True acts of rage and hate would have been more stark and startling.    In all, the action may be thrilling, but it's way too much for one movie. Much of what was going on in this one movie could have waited for Spider-Man 4, although it was doubtful that a fourth movie was...well, forthcoming. But since then, Marvel and Sony are pushing forward to do another Spider-Man film whether Raimi, Maguire, or Dunst are involved or not. Maybe if the prospects for a fourth film were more clear when Spider-Man 3 was in production, there would not have been the urgency to cram so much into this movie and try to tie all the plotlines up. That way, they could have given the characters their due screen time and saved great stories for future films instead of giving us shallow, rushed versions of them.
B000WC3AGM|4.0|Back in July, I saw this movie on a whim and realized that it was my first musical I was seeing on the big screen and I really liked it. It has one of those rare things in a movie these days which is a well casted film. Not only that, the songs are catchy as well and great to sing along with (which explains the kareoke version that was in theaters for one weekend).<br /><br />  The movie opens with Tracy Turnblad singing \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" which pretty much tells you the mood of the movie as well as the story. It is weird that the openining scene was a musical number and not with dialogue.<br /><br /> One of the other interesting things about this film is that it discusees racisim and segregation which is a pretty sensitive topic to some and while it may have been a risk, it was a bold stop which, knowing the film's storyline, made sense.<br /><br />  Speaking of which, Queen Latifah is perfectly cast but somehow her \\"going blond\\" doesn't look good on her. Was it for the movie or did she change her hairstyle? And while her role is a small one, nevertheless, it is an important role including the one with her son.<br /><br />  Did you know that Christopher Walken is a classicaly trained singer and dancer? Well, here he puts it to good use and by good I mean he can really sing. His \\"You're Timeless To Me\\" is a pure jazz number sung alongside John Travolta, really kicks it up a notch.<br /><br />  Michelle Pfieffer is a stuck up snobbby rich bitch who \\"gets her way\\" by threatning everyone else. This is her first musical since Grease 2 and she still has the vocals pulling off her musical numbers perfectly. Also, her bad girl is terrific and well suited for the part she is.<br /><br />  The original Hairspray, while good in it's own right, and not a musical, still stands the test of time and in fact, John Waters has a cameo in the opening number as a streaker. However play it against the musical Hairspray, you will probably choose the musical one for it's catchy beats, beautiful scenery and a great cast.<br /><br /> Hairspray: The Musical is a great film to watch over and over again to watch with family and friends whenever the mood should hit and I recommend it not only for the movie, but for the songs as well.Hairspray: The Musical is a great film to watch over and over again to watch with family and friends whenever the mood should hit and I recommend it not only for the movie, but for the songs as well.
0143038419|1.0|DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  This book is not worth buying.  It's a story of self loathing.  The book is stuffed full of self pity. The author writes page after page about how depressed she is and how bad her life is.  She is shallow, and I got tired of the book after only a few pages.  The author spends the whole book feeling sorry for herself for NO GOOD REASON OTHER THAN SHE GOT A DIVORCE AND SPLIT WITH HER BOYSFRIEND.   The author is PETTY AND SHALLOW and has no clue about what a really bad life is like.  I feel like I got burned for my money with this one.
B00005JPFH|2.0|Dedicate most of the movie to drama that would make Lifetime proud. Then give Venom (one of the greatest villains ever) very little screen time and have him played by a 90 lb weakling because thats what Sam wanted. Then have Sandman make his appearance as a third rate Mummy sequel. The effects will be looked back on in emberassment, I felt like I was watching somebody play a Spider-man game on Playstation 3. And lets not forget the \\"greasy hair nerd becomes a ladies man when he dances down the street\\" scenes. Who directed this abomination Joel Schumacker? Maybe Spidey should get nipples on his costume like ole Bats did. Heres hoping Spidey 4 gets a new cast (maybe get a pretty female lead to play MJ the Model this time) and a new director who won't make these types of mistakes. I'm so sick of the back and forth Petey and MJ \\"do you love me\\" crap.
0143038419|5.0|I liked they way the writer set up the sections on this book, but didn't care for the political references that she threw in, almost like a comedy break.  The 1st section when she was in Italy was fun & travelers who are interested in going there might check out some of her recommendations.  The 2nd was too long, interesting, but a little too self absorbed to appeal to most people.  The 3rd section was better seeing Bali from a different point of view other than a tourist.  Doriefox
B000OVLBGC|5.0|This movie is masterfully done. It was a treat to watch, even though there were significant subtitles in the movie. The story shows how lives are ruined when government becomes too invasive, and feels a need to control the lives of its citizens. Given the extension of such powers to the federal government on behalf of fighting terrorism, one must wonder if this is what the future will hold for the United States? Maybe, maybe not, but the movie still does a wonderful job of illustrating what occurs when government violates the rights of mankind. You're left with a joyless and dreary existence.

Watching this movie I was afraid of what Hollywood would do knowing how biggoted they are about homosexuals!  They truely did something remarkable where it wasn't a horrible view of a transgender!  It wasn't so focused on the stupidity behind cutting a dick off, it wasn't focussed on anything other than HUMAN BEINGS that appeared normal and there was real life to it!  I RECOMMEND THIS MORE THAN I EVER THOUGHT I COULD!
0143038419|5.0|Absolutely fantastic.  It's insightful, poignant, spiritual and very funny.  The author is painfully honest yet objective in her experiences, proud of her accomplishments of self (as she should be), yet self-depreciating enough to be extremely likable.  Highly recommended.

0525950079|5.0|Why stop now? I think Mr. Follett should begin a third work about the inhabitants of Kingsbridge. The author finds a way to make the reader identify with each and every character at so many different points in the story that one can not help but love this work. This is a book equally on par with its predecessor. I highly recommend this book.
B000TM1CL0|4.0|This is a great show and cannot wait for season 2.   It has a fast and clever dialogue and only 24 comes close to this standard.    Thanks  Ronnie Human
B000VI6T6U|4.0|As someone else has already noted there really isn't anything new here. Well, not entirely: you have some onstage chatter with some different camera angles and some interviews with locals from Monterey and performers commentary which are actually strangely short, and if you ask me not very interesting. The perfomances are cool as always but it's really nothing new, but still it's worth $10.00 if you're a fan.
B0000042H4|4.0|This is, by any standards, a phenomenal achievement. I would recommend it to anyone, both new and experienced to the ring cycle to purchase this and it is, and shall remain, a landmark in studio recording. However, as a complete ring cycle, I consider Bohm's and Barenboim's to at least be its equal. Still, Solti's Gotterdammerun, Siegfried, and Rhinegold are areguably the finest on record-but his Walkure is, despite a great Act I, pretty shoddy-due mainly to Hans Hotter shaky Wotan. Hotter comes through magnificently as the Wanderer, especially in Act III of Siegfried-but Walkure finds Hotter a shadow of his brilliant, incomparable former self. I pity those who know Hotter only through this cycle-for how could they be expected to understand why he considered \\"THE\\" Wotan for the ages. TO understand that, one must turn to his Krauss53, KNA56, and the recently released Keilberth55 cycle(of which the Krauss and Keilberth to be superior to this cycle on all accounts-with the exception of sound) A side not-Astrid varnay is the Brunnhilde in those performances and her voice is much more in line with what I believe Brunnhilde to be and her Keilberth performance is the single greatest performance of that role on recordl....period.<br />But, with the exception of the Keilberth, the krauss should be reserved till after you are familiar with Wagner and historical sound.<br />This is a page turning performance(in the manner of Krauss rather than the meditative KNA-while Keilberth falls in between the two). Its intensity is truly only rivalled and exceeded by the Krauss.<br />Its cast is a concotion of the best the opera world had to offer at the time.<br />George London is Wotan in Rhinegold, before Hotter takes over for Walkure and Siegfried. Nilsson is Brunnhilde, a marvelous performance with really no drawbacks.<br />though individually-among post Keilberth versions(which is in stereo) there is arguably no finer Ring except for possible Bohm's(though I find Theo Adam to be too weak as Wotan but I prefer Brigid Nilsson's performance to this one). Barenboim's has great sound and John Tomlinsons Wotan to support it. Tomlinson turns in one of, if the not the, greatest Wotan performance of our time(along with James Morris\Levine on DVD).

0446310786|5.0|After watching the film \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" for over 40 years, it was a real treat to finally read the book.  A very enlightening read, the colorful narration painted a truthful picture of rural and prejudiced life in the South during 30's.  It's unfortunate that Harper Lee only wrote one book, as I'm sure she could have regaled us with many such portraits of unfamiliar faces and mores from long ago.  Ms. Lee must have been thrilled to have her book come to life upon the big screen, especially with such superb acting by legendary thespian, Gregory Peck.  He breathed life into Atticus Finch and I can think of no better actor to have played his part.  If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest that you do both...preferably reading the book first.
B000296GVG|4.0|\\"Arizona dream\\" works out above all, as an admirable metaphor, an urban fable, aroused from a simple fact, when a hotshot in New York I tricked about a business in which his own uncle is involved.<br /><br />Once he arrives to Arizona he will meet a very eccentric and out of context woman: This expected romance with the admirable Arizona's landscapes as big frame will ignite of surrealistic poetry.<br /><br />Before you bet for this film, I think you should be aware about the particular aesthetics of this connoted filmmaker, whose non linearity and powerful dreamy style at the moment to tell a story will allow you to enjoy with major pleasure this emotive love story, hovered by sarcastic lines all the way through.

B000E5KUK6|5.0|I loved this movie! I have been a die-hard Godzilla fan since I was three or four. I was even Godzilla for Halloween people! Anyone who does not like this movie needs to consider what changes are needed sometimes for Hollywood even to accept this movie. This movie rocks out LOUD!!!!!!!!!!!       So what if they changed Godzilla up. Now, don't get me wrong, believe me, I LOVE the old Japanese Godzilla movies, but in the old movies Godzilla looked like Frankenstein in a lizard's body! He was fat and slow. The new Godzilla is a sleek, fast predator, and, as a matter of fact, he DOES breathe his \\"fire\\" in this American remake.       If you look closely when Nick and the others are being chased in the taxi, he actually breathes fire after them and destroys a car. Godzilla can actually climb buildings in this movie and can do what any reptile should be ABLE to do. If you really are a Godzilla fan, and don't mind change (unlike some freaks who still belive in the 50's)you will LOVE this movie.
B000089CKH|5.0|Having bought The Weight is a Gift and loving it I decided to buy Let Go and listen to it.  I found an album I totally loved and that I can listen to over and over again.  Each time I listen to it I enjoy it even more. I love all the songs, but my favorite songs have become Paper Boats and Blonde on Blonde. These songs (both the lyrics and music) are incredibly beautiful and Nada Surfs voices superb.  Let Go seems to be about the ups and downs of relationships while The Weight is a Gift is all about the ascendany of love. The only thing I might say about this album that could have been improved upon is that the song that is in French should have been translated on the CD liner.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|One man's attempt to rouse the general populace to dismember and disband the current dictatorial government structure and return the reigns of control to the people where it belongs.  He does this by setting an example of just what one individual can do by active resistance to this power group which was in control.     What is frightening and relevant is that we seem to be getting close to the type of dictatorial government portrayed in this movie.  I do wonder if there is anyone out there who can or would do as V did in being able to rouse the populace, or whether there is any populace which would do anything even if someone did very similar things in a similar circumstance.
B000NA1XSA|5.0|I purchased this book recently so I could add one more book to my list of Beatles books I have read. I must tell you I am blown away by Geoff's book. It is the definitive insiders book on the Fab Four. Since I started reading it I can't put it down- in fact, I'm sure that I'll read it again to make sure that I didn't miss something. I have always liked George Harrison, but Geoff's insight into the man behind the myth is very revealing.  If you are a Beatles fan or a student of recording techniques, buy this book. It iS the best Beatles book I have ever read.... I I have read Many over the years. Congratulations Geoff on a Phenominal Book!!!!!!!!!!
B000WC3A0S|2.0|I guess it was bound to happen with the release of Rocky Balboa at the end of '06, but that doesn't mean it's any less disappointing. I actually looked forward to a final, definitive DVD set of the films. But after buying the first two sets (the original \\"red box\\" set with the 25th Anniversary Rocky DVD, and the more recent \\"remastered\\" box set with the newer transfers), I don't think I want to jump on this again. Considering that the only extras are TRAILERS for TWO of the films (the first one and Rocky V), this is an enormous disappointment - especially considering that there was a very well done Rocky Special Edition released last year, along with a reasonably well done Rocky Balboa disc from earlier this year.    There has to be some stuff out there that they could put on discs for ALL of these films. The script for Rocky IV, for instance, was much different than what you got in the final film - even if stuff was not filmed, couldn't they give us the scripts for these films in text form as a DVD-ROM feature? There have to be at least a few deleted scenes out there for some of these films as well - someone already mentioned the original Rocky V cut, and some of the material there was pretty fascinating. Come on! Commentaries, trailers, ANYTHING. This bare-bones release is really kind of pathetic.    I guess maybe they're saving a loaded box set for an HD format (likely just Blu-Ray in this case unless an HD DVD studio has international distribution rights over the Rocky films). And then we get to pay for it again.    Avoid this one.
B000007638|5.0|Given the critical drubbings Paul McCartney often endured as a solo artist, his Wings Over America tour in 1976 was just as much a commercial enterprise as it was something to prove. Leaning heavily on material from [[ASIN:B00000I7KL Band on the Run]] and [[ASIN:B00000721C At The Speed Of Sound]], it also provided Beatles fans with something most of them had never witnessed: Paul performing Beatles songs live. As a result, the spectacular reception given to the three LP \\"Wings Over America\\" and the tour it came from both repudiated McCartney's reputation as a live artist, gave many longstanding fans a ten year old dream come true, and proved that McCartney was in a band again.<br /><br />That band happened to be Wings. Not only did McCartney want to prove he could swing it away from his old mates, but that his new mates were creative in their own light. Hence, Denny Laine sings lead not just on his Moody Blues oldie, but on two Wings songs as well. McCartney also dropped another outside song into the setlist, the Simon & Garfunkel obscurity \\"Richard Corey.\\" Indeed, the only thing pruned from this two-hour extravaganza was the stage patter, the entire setlist from the tour is represented here. Even lesser numbers (\\"Picasso's Last Words,\\" \\"Beware My Love\\") were left on the LPs.<br /><br />It's everything that was glorious about the glut of 70's live albums. Excess, exuberance and an artist at the top of his game. McCartney sings like he's unleashed from a dormancy, mixing his styles from silly love songs to ballroom (\\"You Gave Me The Answer\\") to a surprising - and welcome - dose of heavy rocking. Some of the biggest cheers erupt when \\"Live and Let Die\\" commences, same with the Madison Square Garden crowd that welcomes the opening \\"Venus and Mars/Rockshow/Jet\\" triple knockout.<br /><br />But the crowd saves the biggest welcome for that smattering of Beatles songs. When \\"Yesterday\\" comes in, you can hear the crowd cheer not in raucous stadium rock roar, but almost in emotional reverence. McCartney may have wanted \\"Wings Over America\\" to prove Wings was a band, but for all his considerable skills and charm, The Beatles are still the touchstone for all he has done in these 4 decades. As such, the joy spread throughout this - his first and the best of his many live albums - has its roots in that rich firmament.<br /><br />Now condensed to a double CD, the remastered sound is terrific. (I had the older CD, and a one on one comparison reveals a crisper sound, less muffled.) If you want to spend a couple extra bucks, the triple version contains an eight song bonus disc from San Fransisco's Cow Palace and adds \\"Let Me Roll It\\" and a differently arranged \\"Bluebird\\" as the main attractions. (Although the fade on \\"Picasso's Last Words\\" is annoying.) All together, this is one of the more important documents of Paul McCartney's recorded legacy, the moment in time where he let his past catch up with him and he doesn't turn it away.otional reverence.

B000MRAAJW|5.0|After looking at all the rave reviews, I had HIGH expectations from this disc. I figured I would be setting my expectation too high before seeing it for myself.    I was floored by this disc. Stunning shots of the earth. I was getting goosebumps watching the wolves chase down it's prey. Watching all the weird and beautiful animals on our beautiful planet makes you realize that humans  should do everything we can to protect our planet for the other inhabitants on Earth and for ourselves.

078322737X|5.0|This movie was before my time but I live with a man who grew-up in this era. For the six years that I have been with him, he has made me sit through dozens of 60's and 70's movies. Some of them good, but most of them were so bad that I had thought that perhaps he had come up with a new form of relationship torture. Now finally, he has given me a movie that I have fallen head over heels in love with. I loved the characters and the story and found myself wishing badly that I could have experienced that generation. I do not know why it took my better half six years to have me watch this, but I am extremely happy that he did.
B000H5U832|5.0|Oh my gosh, I am not certain who loves this movie more - us or our children.  My two year old smiles from ear to ear every time we put it in to play.  More astonishing, my 7 month old laughes, giggles and smiles throughout the entire DVD - he loves Mator and Lightening!  Truly a great movie.  Witty, charming and adults will LOVE it too!  We know it word for word! We will even watch it afte rthey have gone to bed!  Love it!  Children of all ages will love it!  It keeps things calm when we need to take care of household responsibilities! Enjoy!
B00004VVN9|4.0|I watched this movie when I was a child. For some reason, it was one of those films that stuck with me into adulthood. I bought it a couple weeks ago and watched it again to see if it would still affect me. It did. The whole concept of being able to put a helmet on and ride a coaster, travel the world, or to engage in certain fantasies, is amazing. The heart attack scene is one of the best that I ever seen in movies. The question of life after death finally being revealed through the helmet is what affected me the most as a child and now as an adult. This is a very intriguing film that I am proud to add to my growing collection.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|Holy cow.  What an incredible concert and a great dvd.  Some of the greatest names in guitar music and all jamming together on stage.  I was blown away by so many of the performers and the diverse genres represented that I would have a tough time picking a favorite.  I would love to see a second release that expands on some of the lesser highlighted artists.  If you've got a decent sound system, crank it up, sit back and enjoy.
B000BR2MD0|5.0|This guy is a true artist and genius with words.  His simplicity and story telling abilities are amazing.  \\"You're Beautiful\\" and \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" were my story while trying to recover from major spinal surgery. Both were the extremes of my feelings...so I listened to these ALOT! ;-) All of his songs simply bind themselves together into a ballad. It feels like he's telling someone's life story. The only artist I would put in his league would be \\"Mark Schultz\\" who is another lyrically genius that can touch someone's soul.  Just sit back and listen to this album, close your eyes, and reflect. Fantastic album and one of my favorite artists.  Can't wait for his next album! 5 STARS *****
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This has to be Michael Moore's best documentary to date. He attacks one of America's biggest problems with humor and heartfelt stories. As somebody who used to doubt universal health care, I was convinced, hands down, after seeing this documentary that America's Health Care System needs to be reformed.<br /><br />I personally could actually identify with some of these health insurance horror stories. My very own sister became very sick one day while working, and had to be ambulanced to the hospital. And just like the girl in the film, who was charged thousands of dollars because the ambulance wasn't \\"pre-approved\\" by her company, well, that's what happened to us. Yeah, so just remember, even if you are about to die, make sure your insurance company approves of you getting into an ambulance before you even think about calling 911.<br /><br />Universal Health care is in no ways perfect, but no system is. And our system here in the United States is far from perfect, further than any other country. The truth about \\"waiting lines\\" is that the only real surgeries you have to wait for are \\"elective surgeries\\". If you have a life threatening condition, you're in. I'd be thankful that this health care is free when I'm waiting.<br /><br />In every other rich, industrialized nation, people riot like crazy when they're upset. Wouldn't these systems have been overhauled from riots by now if people were dying in the streets from so-called \\"waiting lines\\"? There are many reports saying that OUR OWN Emergency Rooms are being stretched beyond the limit! If these universal health care systems are so bad, why is it that when it comes to our population's heath standards, compared to other rich countries, we're at the bottom of the list? Cuba is above us (some reports say we are tied with Cuba, but no reports put us above them, especially in life-expectancy)! Hey, I'd rather die from something because the doctor had to take care of others, than die because I simply couldn't pay for it.<br /><br />People against universal health care say that we have the best doctors, the best treatments, and the best hospitals in the world. I don't doubt that for a second. SO WHY CAN'T WE LET EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN SHARE IN THAT SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF INCOME?!?! Why should doctors have to call insurance companies to get permission to take care of a patient? And people think that universal health care red tape is bad. You have no idea how much paper work and questioning and phone calls, etc, comes with dealing with insurance companies. They say universal health care denies important treatments. Well, look at all people who have died because their insurance companies refused to pay.<br /><br />For every one universal health care horror story comes with over 1,000 health-insurance horror stories. One thing is clear: health care for profit must go, as should profiting of off denying health care. Plain and simple. We are the only industrialized nation not using this system, and as I've said before, our health standards are at the bottom of the list. Japan uses this system, and they have one of the world's highest life expectancies and economies. For crying out loud, Israelis have a higher life-expectancy.<br /><br />Do any doubters of universal health care, see the film first.sal health care say that we have the best doctors, the best treatments, and the best hospitals in the world.

B000W1V44I|4.0|The Backstreet Boys have been around for 15 years, longer than any boy band of their time, including Nsync, O-Town, Savage Garden, 98 Degrees (who may make a comeback), and LFO.  The Backstreet Boys have always said they were not a boy band, but rather a male vocal harmony group.  And I agree with their statement 100%.  Unlike other \\"boy bands\\", all of the Backstreet Boys had parts in each song on every album, even Howie and Kevin who were not the lead singers.  The new album \\"Unbreakable\\" is no different, besides not having Kevin.  The whole album has a pop song that everyone would like, ranging from beautiful ballads which are the Boy's strong points, to funky dance songs which are done nicely. Below is a rating for each song on the album; its out of 10 points:         1) INTRO- The intro is basically the group singing part of \\"Unsuspecting Sunday Afternoon\\", but its acapella.  Its only 1 minute long, but it shows the group's vocal talent- 9/10              2) EVERYTHING BUT MINE- This isn't one of my favorite songs because it sounds too \\"synthesized.\\" Its not bad, but not one of the group's best songs. I would like to see a song similar to \\"The Call\\" replace it -6/10             3)INCONSOLABLE- A wonderful power piano ballad displaying the group's vocal talent and a great first single. Unfortunately,it only made it to #86 on the Billboard Hot 100, when it deserved more- 10/10            4) SOMETHING THAT I ALREADY KNOW- I like this song, but I think it is way too similar to \\"Inconsolable.\\" It should not be released as another single, but its a solid piano ballad- 8/10            5) HELPLESS WHEN SHE SMILES- Another piano ballad that should not be released, but is as their second single.  The pre-chorus's sound great, but the chorus is too generic- 7/10            6) ANY OTHER WAY- Excellent pop rock up tempo song.  One of the best songs on the album and this should be released as a single- 10/10            7) ONE IN A MILLION- Another solid dance song, witha reggae twist to it. Something new from the Backstreet Boy's- 10/10            8) PANIC- Another good dance song, but not as good as ONE IN A MILLION or ANY OTHER WAY- 8/10            9) YOU CAN'T LET GO- A solid ballad, but it really doesn't sound like something the Backstreet Boy's would sing; more like a John Mayer song, but it sounds nice- 8/10            10) TROUBLE IS- A great ballad that portrays a country song. This song would do very well down South where country music is popular and even here- 9/10           11) TREAT ME RIGHT- Excellent pop dance song, one of the best songs on the album.  Definitely a good single- 10/10            12) LOVE WILL KEEP YOU UP ALL NIGHT- One of my favorite ballads on the album, with a classic pop sound- 10/10            13) UNMISTAKABLE- Again, too synthesized and too generic, sounds like a different version of \\"Incomplete. However, it seems to be a favorite choice by fans- 7/10            14) UNSUSPECTING SUNDAY AFTERNOON- This has to be one of the most unique songs the Backstreet Boys have ever made. It starts out similar to a Beatle's song and then the bridge turns into a different song, sounding like \\"Hotel California\\" from The Eagles.  Its an excellent ballad with excellent vocals- 10/10          15) DOWNPOUR- The first of the bonus songs on the album- I like it, but it sounds like Hilary Duff's \\"Come Clean.\\" I liked Hilary's song and I like this one too- 9/10.            16) IN PIECES- A second bonus song, this song is a good song as well.  Good vocals as well as excellent instrumentation- 9/10.           17) NOWHERE TO GO- One of the best bonus songs on the album. This song is short, but very complete. The chorus sounds like a mix of \\"More than That\\" and \\"Incomplete- 10/10.      CONCLUSION- The Backstreet Boys have made a very solid and well produced pop album that Backstreet fans will enjoy as well as new fans.  This album is equal to \\"Millennium\\" and better than both \\"Black & Blue\\" and \\"Never Gone\\".  I give it a 4.2out of 5.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I like this soundtrack. I just enjoy listening to it repeatedly. The early sections of this soundtrack are eerie and have a great mystical quality about them reaching out from the mysterious Far East. It is very good. I still wonder how much involvement Hans Zimmer had with this recording. I love the final cut which comes full circle with the Jack Sparrow theme.
B00005JMCT|4.0|American Wedding is the conclusion of the American Pie franchise. Of course direct to video American Pie released have followed but American Wedding symbolizes the end of this great trilogy. There are some unexpected and foul moments in American Wedding, the scene in the beginning is probably the most funniest but the middle lacks creativity. The second one is the best, the first one is ok, so I say American Wedding falls in between the other two. A sweet film that knows how to mix raunchy humor and a fairytale ending. Enjoy!
0060751967|5.0|I'll try to make this short and sweet.  Lots of humor in this book.  I found myself laughing a lot.  It's one of those books you can't put down and you just want to keeping turning the pages to find out what happens.  This is my 1st Sparks novel and I really really enjoyed it.  I can't wait to read the rest of the series.  The hero and heroine are very likable.  As well as all of the secondary characters.  You really don't get much sex in this book till the end but there's so much fun and excitement going on that it didn't bother me.  And when it final does happen, it's special.  I highly recommend this book.
B000031WD9|4.0|American Pie was not as funny as I thought it would be but overall this film is quite entertaining. Featuring an all-star cast including Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Tara Reid, Chris Klein, and Shannon Elizabeth. American Pie is vulgar, frank, and somewhat heartwarming. I have seen all three films and I have to admit the second one is probably the best, but the original is not a total letdown. Defintely one to watch, nothing like homemade apple pie!

B000OLGCI4|4.0|The \\"sublime\\" being Baloo the Bear, who may be Disney's finest comic cartoon character.  Superbly voiced by Phil Harris, Baloo seems to be endowed with all the characteristics that made Walt Disney himself so beloved: he's charming, funny, warm, inventive, child-like and a helluva lot of fun to be around.  How poignant that he was pretty much the master animator's final creation.  The \\"ridiculous\\" being four mop-topped Liverpudlian vultures.  This embarrasingly misguided homage to the Beatles -- who sing a hackneyed barbershop quartet yet -- lowers \\"The Jungle Book\\" to a level it never rises above.  Too bad, as the film up until then has been a near-classic.  The animation is gorgeously detailed and colorful, the scoring by George Bruns mysterious and evocative and the songs clever and memorable.  I say \\"near\\"-classic, as I find the elephants both boring and unneccesary, particularly when they set out to find the missing Mowgli and trudge themselves right out of the film, never to be seen again!  Is \\"The Jungle Book\\" worth having?  It's a Disney film, of course it is!  I just wish that Walt hadn't tried to pander to a young, '60s audience that wasn't really interested in this kind of film anyway.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Good series considering it wasn't based on a writen story, just an kids ride. good script, fun serious, entertaining
0743289412|5.0|\\"Lisey's Story\\" is like \\"Bag of Bones\\" in reverse, with a little \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden\\" thrown in (as well as a pinch of Richard Matheson's \\"What Dreams May Come\\" and King's \\"Rose Madder\\").<br /><br />But it is much more than a retread.  While I don't agree with King that it's the best novel he's ever written, it is quite compelling.<br /><br />\\"Lisey's Story\\" is another King tale about marriage, loss and grief.  And though some of it certainly gets lugubrious -- King always had a sentimental streak to go along with the gore -- it is never less than heartfelt.  With all of its ghosts and stalkers and violence and strange exotic worlds and manifestations of death itself, \\"Lisey's Story\\" is really about picking yourself up after someone you love dies and moving on with your life.<br /><br />King's story is about a woman who loses her beloved husband, and the book absolutely aches at its core.<br /><br />The book has a tried-and-true plot structure -- a treasure-hunt (sorry, bool-hunt) of clues left behind that slowly reveals to Lisey (and us) what in the world is going on.  King very effectively teases us and paws at us as he gradually lets us in on the truth.  I found the plotting in \\"Lisey's Story\\" -- which asks you to pay attention -- to be some of the best in a King book in quite a while.<br /><br />Of course, the book isn't only about love and heartbreak; it also provides some frights.  King's description of the longboy, and a close encounter someone has with it, was completely horrifying in a weirdly real way.  It is an image I can't imagine I will ever forget.<br /><br />Ironically, King said he wrote this book while suffering from pneumonia and running to the bathroom to vomit.  Despite this, he really loved the book and, like I mentioned already, considers it the best thing he's ever written.<br /><br />\\"Lisey's Story\\" is just the type of skewed, twisted love story you'd expect King to create -- haunting, a little maudlin, frightening, and ultimately grounding all the crazy disparate elements in a relationship that feels utterly believable.ship that feels utterly believable.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I personally loved the movies, and they job they did in compiling a soundtrack was surprisingly good.  They edited the aspects of the tracks to make a 3 series soundtrack that you can enjoy from start to finish. thats right, just pop it in, hit play, and let it go. A+ for me
0060594896|5.0|A fantastic book, one of the best I have read in the past couple of years with so many insights and greats sources for further reading and study.  Trevor
B000T05R8Q|5.0|The Syd Barrett years were the golden years of Pink Floyd.  This album is very whimsical and almost has that \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" sort of trippy-silly feel.  The songs are so interesting and much more playful, poetic and melodic than later Pink Floyd albums.  Many of the songs are like listening to a story being read with musical accompaniment that matches the feel of the tales.  It's a wonderful and beautiful display of musical talent and true ingenuity in sound complements.
1591841151|5.0|A disclaimer. I have known Guy Kawasaki by email for nearly 15 years, and have only met him once. But, I have immense respect for him and was delighted to even help edit this book (along with dozens of others whom he thanks :-) in the book). But, besides wanting to see my name in print in another book, or to put Guy under a debt of gratitude to me forever, my selfish reason was to get my hands on the text months prior to publication, so I could benefit from his experience and wisdom. That I do not say in jest. He really is a very smart man, and has an amazing ability to focus on the challenges any startup idea faces. And, in very easy terms, he makes it possible to make the most \\"let's just wing it\\" or \\"we'll figure it out as we go along\\" or \\"planning-shlanning, who needs it\\" person become clear in their thinking about the project/mission, enabling them (me?) to focus on what needs to be done in the correct and cogent order. It really is a book that I believe in - as I have even bought it for family members (for cash, not as gifts from Guy :-) ). Try it, you'll see the benefits.<br /><br />Imran
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Excellent movie for young and old - a must see.  The songs are addictive, sing along and enjoy the fun!!
1582701709|3.0|Reading thru this big seller, I got the impression that talking down to grown-ups, playing surreal fantasy games about success, and wish fulfillment is the way to succeed in 2007 USA publishing. The packaging here is top rate, and very attractive, but this book proves the validity of style of substance in a huge part of USA culture. Some interesting stories, coincidences, and essays about the power of positive thinking and wish fulfillment do make some lite philosophy, and self- encouragement. Like prayer, an idea hardly mentioned, it's only the good results that are mentioned. Forget the inevitable disappointments, and losses. A strong, and hardly suggested message here, is simply to stop whining and blaming everyone else for your problems.For that message alone, this small, slight, portable, and wonderfully packaged super-lite personal philosophy tome, is well worth publication, and discussion.
B000UNYK76|4.0|Great documentary about the 2006 visit to Italy, great perfomances of new songs, plus incredible images and photography.    GET IT NOW!

B000VWE5OY|5.0|I'm a big fan of the new Doctor Who series, and when I heard that a spinoff called Torchwood was coming out, I wanted to see it... but I had no idea that I would actually like it MORE than Doctor Who! I think Torchwood is a bit different (and better) than most American sci-fi shows. It has very interesting and unique storylines, awesome graphics and special effects (especially nice to watch in High Definition), and all of the characters are great! The ONLY bad thing, in my opinion, is that there are so few episodes per season. Don't intend to watch it with your family though because it is not for kids, but for adults who want to see an awesome sci-fi show that's a little on the dark side with a some sexiness mixed in, and a few funny scenes here and there, I definitely recommend watching/buying Torchwood.
0316067598|2.0|What a disappointment - I expected a Blackhawk Down riveting account of the Delta guys going in to face imminent death to save their downed brethren.  Instead, Marcus Luttrell should be ashamed of using the death of his fellow Seals for such blatant political purposes.  It is obvious he hates the Afghanis almost as much as he hates his fellow American liberals. His political agenda in the book also brings into doubt all of his uncorroborated testimony regarding the events - how many Taliban were killed and of his superman actions.  The American public has suffered from Pentagon deceptions in the exploitation of the Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch incidents.   I will wait the report from some brave reporter who will travel to the area were the incident took place and produce the other side's version of what happened.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had never head of this before. I found out about the Serinety movie and finally talked myself into buying it and fell in love with the film, the director, the actors, the characters, the music, the style... it was really a lot of fun. I dont always watch all the extras, but I did and found out it was based on this DVD box set. I fianlly got my box set and I have been really enjoying these films. I am not so mad anymore I missed them on tv (never heard of it) because now I get to watch them commerical free in order with the ability to pause and pick up when I need to or want to. this is really a special treat. I have told everyone to check this out. The only think I could conpare this to is maybe think of Cronicles of Riddick and mix it up with a bit of old western (sorta). But it better. Sci with style. Much action, great humor, great characters (Jewel Staite as Kaylee is my favorite). I think is pretty monumental what he reviews are on this. It is really something else. Wow. Thank you !! (money well spent!!)
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I absolutely love Dinsey movies and the Jungle Book was one of the best with a great story line.  This story can let children viewing this movie understand different perspectives to Mowgli's situation.  This movie will be shared with all of my neices and nephews during the upcoming holidays.
1401308201|4.0|Good book from a GREAT show.  This is a fun look at the story & made a great gift.
0684824906|5.0|A very touching view of Lincoln and a number of his cohorts. The grim nature of Lincoln's childhood, and the meager life he led in early adulthood, stood in vivid contrast with the lives of his main presidential competitors. Lincoln's ability to transend differences in education and social status and to enlist the services of his very competitors, makes for an intriguing and powerful story.     The intimate and balanced view of Mary Todd Lincoln was a revelation, as were the details of the life of the Lincoln family.    Kearns-Goodwin is a masterful writer who alows the lives of the main character in her book to touch both the mind and the heart of the reader.  Her book offers an understanding of Lincoln's incredible gifts as both a leader and communicator, while also revealing him in his complete humanity.     I would recommend this book, without reservation, to anyone with even a passing interest in history.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|What a great album.  Well crafted & well thought out...even if you aren't a Springsteen fan.  If you are a fan...you can't go wrong.  This is what I've been waiting for...thanks Bruce & well done E Street!
0143038419|5.0|It has been a long time since a book has moved me so. It took me places I know I will never go but feel I have made the journey in my soul. Thank you Liz Gilbert!
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Looks great & the additional material was fun.  I didn't know a lot of that stuff, so it was fun to see all of the creative genius behind Walt's work.
B000V6BE6C|3.0|I found myself skipping past songs on this (unfortunately short) albumn.  Though they do have an original feel, I wouldn't put a country song (slide guitar and acoustic in Dear God), then some funny circus trumpet organ song like A Little Piece of Heaven.  Original, but was one I kept skipping.  And in my opinion, I'm tired of the politics about the \\"war\\".  I listen to music to just get away from that.  Political songs about the fighting and how people are being treated don't attract me. Critical Acclaim does just this. Its fabulous to have an opinion, and even better if you can put it to music, but when a good melody is ruined by just yelling angrily (not singing) during the song. . . It lost all enjoyment.    Bravo for coming out with another albumn.  It just doesn't cut the mustard though.  I'm glad I didn't pay for it.
B000F8O35U|4.0|good fun & good quality.  I gave it to a Little Mermaid fan & they enjoyed the DVD.  They did want to see a little more :(
0525950079|2.0|\\"World Without End\\" Is just what I was expecting from Ken Follet after \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" I liked it very very much. The historical information is very accurate, I really love it.  Patricia Vega R.
