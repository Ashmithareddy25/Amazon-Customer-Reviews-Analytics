B00AREIAI8|4.0|Awesome graphic design. This game is easy for any child from the age of five to adults. It is so worth the download. I will suggest this to any one from a child to an adult. I myself love this game plus you don't have to have a real horse. Great for your pocket book.<br /> Great job  for the designer who came up with this game. But ok me thing it can cost real money, if you are not carefully.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the versatility of this app.  You can literally create hundreds of personalized sounds to relax and mediate to.
B007SGM084|5.0|So exciting. I can read this many times over. I have recommended it ALL my friends. Its HOT, fresh and intriguing. What a great series. Love the relationship story line everything. Hope there is more to come.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|As an adult, it's hard to say that I &#34;like it&#34;, but sense my kids love it we'll average out our respective reviews!  Not nearly as entertaining as the original, but good enough to hold a 7 and 1 year old's attention :)
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|&quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot; The title is correct, the entire film is an unexpected journey into Mr Jackson's distorted imagination! I have read the book at least nine times. If Mr Jackson read it once he must have been reading between the lines!
B00005JMYI|5.0|Funnier than funny.  I didn't want to like it, but I loved it.  Great stupid fun, the pinnacle of that!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is called Masterpiece Theater for a reason.  The attention to detail is amazing.  I love how the elders 'snipe' at each other.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|“Proof of Heaven” is an amazing story of a man who went to heaven while in a deep coma, long enough to have caused major brain damage, and returned to earth to live a normal life once completing rehab.<br /><br />The author, Dr. Eben Alexander III, M.D., is a neurosurgeon who before his near death experience (NDE) had a scientist’s mind that did not leave much room for spiritual faith. He especially did not believe in NDEs until he experienced his own. I first heard of the book when Eben Alexander was interviewed by Katy Couric on her afternoon show.<br /><br />The book provides the scientific explanations for NDEs that Alexander relied upon before experiencing his own. He describes his time in heaven in complete detail, including the evidence which later provided absolute proof to him that he had experienced a near death experience. This is a very moving book that will be hard to put down once you are about a third of the way into the account. This is a book you will definitely want to read.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The Crawley Family saga continues.  Twists and turns, thwarted love, devious ladies maid and first footman...  What fun!  This is just plain good writing and acting.
030746363X|5.0|This book has so much helpful information,<br />the diet and exercise portions will work for many body types!<br /><br />I always wanted nice arms, and in a matter of weeks I already feel wonderful about the way my arms look :) Thank you Tim!
B00APJLFEG|2.0|I rented Hotel Transylvania based on the sheer number of glowing reviews and ended up remembering the painful truth that not all that glitters is gold. Sometimes, it is nuclear waste.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one - good taste forbids it. My range of young children laughed maybe four times through the whole movie. I've been teaching them to be discriminating in their choices of entertainment, but I didn't realize how well they had learned the lesson. Good kids! I'll be increasing your allowance.<br /><br />The sublime The Incredibles had more laughs in its first five minutes than this did at 90 (felt like 900!) minutes long. The story line? Predictable - daddy doesn't \\"understand\\" his angst-ridden teen's angst, but eventually comes around and is now cool for capitulating. The characters? Bombastically uninteresting. Most of them are loud \\"one-liner\\" factories, belching out ear and eye pollution without remorse. And of course, the movie slouches to its close with a terribly trite \\"everybody dance now\\" scene. Madagascar's done that bit to shreds, I believe, as have other second-and-third-tier animated films.<br /><br />I'm done seething that 90 minutes of my time went to subsidizing Hollywood mediocrity. Thank you, and hope this helps.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Perfect for me and all the pictures that I take and want to edit really fast. Really easy to use.
0439023491|5.0|She loved the book!  Purchased the final book in the trilogy for her, has not advised me on how she liked the third book!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|I came in expecting only Smallville-level quality, which I'd rate 2.5-3 stars.  Arrow is way better - that's all there is to say.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Fast page turner.  Good and intense story line.  I read the complete trilogy and found all the characters in the series to be well defined.  Very enjoyable read!
B0085OELXK|5.0|Loved the suspense and enjoyed how the story twists just kept coming.  Strange how the &#34;bad guy&#34; can actually be such a likable character.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Loved Clint Eastwood in this movie full of heart! Even if you are not a fan of baseball, this movie still keeps your attention.  Great story and one that I will watch again!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Really had fun with this game. Well definitely look for others by this group. Played this game more than once.
B00BSBU4EC|1.0|This movie was creepy, and inappropriate for children.  It's as if they were trying to help kids with their nightmares, but all I saw was a potential for more nightmares and a lot of confusion! Definitely not a feel good movie!
0679805273|5.0|She loves Dr Seuss books. Arrived quickly in great shape. Can't wait to read it to her.  Nice pictures and fun book.
6304711905|5.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read any of the other 600+ reviews.  Just some thoughts on this Western classic...<br /><br />Tombstone (1993) is one of the best Westerns I've ever seen.  It has basically an all-star cast, including main stars Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell.  Every actor in this movie does a good job.  I think the best acting came from Kilmer.  In contrast to many other Westerns, this movie rarely gets boring.  It stays entertaining throughout.  This movie has a lot of good memorable lines in it, the sets are great, the scenery is great, the action is plentiful, and the movie has all the elements that make a good western movie.  I wonder how many bullets were fired in this movie, because it seems like guns are being fired endlessly.<br /><br />Tombstone and Wyatt Earp (1994) are often compared to each other.  I personally think Wyatt Earp is better, but Tombstone is great in its own right.  Tombstone comes off as more &#34;Hollywood&#34;, whereas Wyatt Earp comes off as more &#34;epic&#34;.  These two movies were released within six months of each other.  You be the judge.<br /><br />Overall, a good action-packed Western.  Highly recommended.
B0080M3OGW|5.0|Love their love story..Robert and meryl are amazing together,you really want to fall in love again..not with another person but with your own mate..of course!
B001LMAK88|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />In a nutshell, Silverado (1985) is one of the better Westerns ever made.  Filmed in New Mexico, this movie has it all - a good plot, humor, action, romance, and great New Mexico scenery.  The cast includes Kevin Costner, Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Linda Hunt, Brian Dennehy, Scott Glenn, and John Cleese.  The acting is solid.  The musical score is OK to pretty good, sort of a throwback to the classic Westerns of decades earlier.  The acting is good.  The action scenes are very well done.  This is a classic shoot 'em up Western.  Some people might lump Westerns into the \\"If you've seen one, you've seen them all\\" category, but I find that Westerns are not all the same.  Westerns have been filmed all over the West, everywhere from New Mexico to Texas to Oregon to Wyoming, etc.  The plots vary.  Sure, they all have gunfights, barroom brawls inside saloons, card playing, duels, etc., but that comes with the territory.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good movie that I recommmend.
B0054LJGWS|3.0|Started good, then lost steam.  Got silly.  OK ending.  Over all the book was just OK.  I found myself skimming most of the second half and in the end really didn't care how it ended.  Mark Twain's &#34;Letters from Earth&#34; is far superior.
B002QP145C|2.0|i fell asleep woke up rewound it watched somemore...fell asleep rewound it watched somemore.....fell asleep rewound it watched somemore....finally it ended and i was glad.... the only reason i watched all 3.5 hours was because i payed 25 bucks for it....
B0060AY85C|4.0|Uncompromisingly Toni Morrison. Stories within a story, too deep to grasp  all in one read, so it lingers on the pallet of one's mind; whispering, nudging, evoking cloudy memories of times past and conjuring evasive images of ghosts of the yet to be.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the extra detail and blessings as well. So far it has been pretty accurate. I like it. That is it.
B00070DK14|5.0|I have always been a fan and originally bought this album on vinyl.  The remastered is just as good and I enjoy it immensely!
B002BWP49C|5.0|this movie was intense and totally left us fans wanting more!!it also came in the mail a day faster then thought !thanks
B000FA675C|5.0|Dan Brown takes a familiar story and weaves a plot that will make you reconsider what you always felt was true. Whether your position changes or not, the book is entertaining, suspenseful and a good read. As is usually the case, the book is much better than the movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This season saw some refinements to the plot and the &#34;walkers&#34; that made it the best season yet.  Looking forward to season 4.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book was really good...BUT truly depressing.... The subject of suicide is so dark,,,,, but I had to finish! I would recommend reading it
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|It was nice to see where the story stems from and to understand some of the differences in the movie from the difference in spin offs like Wicked:The Lifes and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West by Gregory Maguire (which I highly enjoyed and recommend). This book is a children's story and reads that way for adults. Wicked is not for children.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|There are better Denzel movies, but this one is real. People say it's easy to quit an addiction, but this movie proves it is not.

B007DIQC90|5.0|I really enjoy this album.<br />bought it on recommendation of a friend.<br />song played on radio is actually my least favorite.<br />entire album is fantastic.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The beginning of the book was not what I assumed it to be and perhaps that's a good writer's technique but for most of the book there was an assumption on my part of something that was not true. On first reading the book quickly it seemed that some strings in the plot were never tied up, and the ending was a complete surprise--which then helped understand what had happened before.  The book would be great for book clubs because of the many moral themes involved and decisions that were made by characters in the book.  The discussion in  the club of possible alternative endings was also interesting.

B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Susan's voice is so incredible you can't help liking almost everything she sings and this CD is no exception.  What I continue to wish, though, is that she would change 'how' she sings some of the songs.  After awhile, they all start sounding alike and I long for her to sing a happier, more upbeat, faster tempo song.  I, personally, think her producers are over-producing her and making her singing be too controlled.  I really like a lot of songs on this CD, especially the duets with Donny Osmond.

B00AMBLXP8|4.0|while i find the humor strange i also found this amusing.  gotta kinda wonder about the minds that write and produce this lol but definitely worth watching
B0035Q4AFC|5.0|very entertaining, loved the photography,  I thought Robert Downey Jr. did a great portrayal.  I was recently in Veyvey Switzerland so I rented the movie and was not disappointed
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|this is a wonderful imaginative movie... I loved it fun for entire family any age (five more words are required)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I give this five stars, not because I love it, but because my son hasn't put it down since i bought it- I got the app for him. He is eight years old and has built several houses, worlds, treehouses, etc. He also said there was some survivor mode you can play, and that it is \\"pretty cool\\".
B005K17RU0|4.0|I enjoy having my weather report in my kindle notifications. There are small warning signs with links to detailed weather alerts so I know before I head out if I need to be aware of dangerous conditions each day.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|The first book was very similar to the giver. Once i started reading this book reminded me more and more of hunger games and one other I can't place. Very good and very intriguing! As soon as I finished the first  book I immediately downloaded the second and now am hurrying to get the third!!!!! Incredible series!

B00457X7XQ|4.0|I read this in another review before I read it and I agree.  I'm very interested in the cyber technology the story is built around and I agree with the message of the book so I wanted to read it, but I didn't really identify with the characters and the story wasn't surprising with twists, etc.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|This book have good perspective on relationships. Will usr some of their syggestons. Would recommend to others. Already know my love language.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Fun action game.  Good use of the motion sensor and swipping motions to control different motions.  It would be nice if it had some longer term strategies, or searching type features.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very user friendly game of Solitaire.  Most enjoyable to play.<br />Just touching a card will move it into the correct place.

B003TTH4IU|5.0|I love the behind the scenes goings on with the doctors.  The medical scenerios are interesting and not always resolved which is true to life.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|this is a sensitive and often sad portrait of authors childhood and difficult life as a child with poverty. Filled with humorous moments however and detailed description of his life in Ireland well written and beautifully crafted one of a kind memoir
0670026603|5.0|I loved this novel! The characters were exceptionally well formed and the nuances of their personalities so beautifully portrayed that I felt protective of each of them and their individual journeys. The story drew me in quite quickly and, while at work, I often found myself longing to go home and pick up where I'd left off reading the night before. \\"Me Before You\\" is one of those rare books that you utterly regret finishing because it's such an entrancing, devastating  and bittersweet story.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Got this to keep me occupied on a long flight. None of the puzzles are too difficult. Tablet died before I was able to finish so nice amount of game play

B00APUQT7I|5.0|This is sooo funny. My grandkids loved it. These movies are great for kids. It shows them about the importance of family values. And even if they are young they still get how they take care of each other, friends and family. Beautiful for the whole family and a good laugh too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is  excellent because the graphics and do think it is better then temple run cause the turns are difficult.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This is a good movie. It's kind of predictable, but still good. I loved Clint Eastwood, but who wouldn't. Amy Adams was great and Justin Timberlake did ok. It's good to have a movie that is about father -daughter relationships. Like I said it's predictable, but still nice to watch on a Sunday afternoon.

0385344228|4.0|Another first time read for me by this author...First and foremost, the narrative character Andy Barber was easy to connect with.  You believed him and in him, you knew he was a good guy who worked the entire book trying to solve the crime while keeping his family and life intact.<br /><br />Without giving too much away (and believe me to do a great review, I feel you would have to)let me say it had the makings to be a 5 star Legal thriller.  Unfortunately it fell short for me due to a few reasons.  1. Lack of character development.  In stories where there are not tons of characters, I expect and need the author to develop the ones which are on every page.  The Barber's had lots more room for character development.  No extended family (with the exception of Andy's Father) is ever mentioned.  To make the story truer, they should have at least been mentioned and been there as a source of support.  It blandly reveals that basically not one friend stood up for any of them during the Jacob's trial.  Nice friends huh? I also kept rehashing in my mind that Jacob was in eighth grade, while it just seemed due to the behaviors, privileges he should have been in high school.  I struggled this while reading, having to remind myself he was only fourteen.  2. Jacob was a strange character for me. Yes, I know teenagers can be odd-ducks, however this child you never saw breakdown, rant or fight for his life.  Why did they never request a lie detector test? So off the bat, you knoe something is not right with him? They danced around the possibility he had several serious disorders, but never talked about presenting a mental defect defense? He too had no true friends..weird.  3. Not a great job with the ending.  Let's leave it at that....<br /><br />This book is delivered to the reader in four parts.  Parts one and two were a bit long and drawn out but parts three and four did seem to fly.  Even so, I couldn't overlook the fact what I wanted in the earlier parts never came in the later.  I wanted to like the Barber's, but in truth Laurie and Jacob were hard to like and relate to.  Andy and Laurie lacked any romantic chemistry right from the start and by the end it wasn't hard to imagine that perhaps Jacob had suffered because of it.<br /><br />This would be a great Book Club read...because there is SO much to chew on...I will definitely read Landay again, at least one more go....er.

B002ZB26AO|4.0|With all that is going on in today's world with North Korea it was very informative.  The people of North Korea are so suppressed.  It was a very realistic picture of what they have to endure.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|This is a real fun movie for the whole family or for a group of kids. Try it on a big screen.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Funny and challenging. The objectives test your skills and timing and the rewards are helpful and well thought out.  Good followup to the original.
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is a very goof movie.  One that I had never heard of.  Gregory Peck is an excellent actor and one of my favorites.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragons are awesome!  I like the different kinds of dragons and learning to take care of their needs.  DragonStory fans would like this.
0061992860|5.0|Every home should have one, every vehicle should have one. At least you then have a guide to be able to survive if you are lost, broke down in a desulate area. It's great for all kinds of emergencies. Of everything I have bought on Amazon I recommend this product the most and with highest regard. It's cheap, GET SOME.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this because of the variety of play.  You also get to interact with other players' creations and see how your dragons change over time.  Great game.
B002SLNJWU|5.0|I couldn't understand why didn't you plan on season 2.  I flashforward season 1 I watched 2 day span what thought  and mindblowing ...
B0000AC8LR|5.0|My favorite movie I have watched countless times. Dark, twisted, funny, charming, intriguing, meaningful...so many words in one movie. If you've never seen it, just watch.
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect condition.<br />As for the film itself:  This remake wasn't as good as the 80s version.  The flow of the movie seemed a bit rushed.  I thought Anton Yelchin did a great job as Charley.  Colin Farrell didn't seem all that invested in his character Jerry.  Definitely not the intimidating presence of Chris Sarandon from the original.<br />The transformation of Peter Vincent from campy to show-off Criss Angel wanna-be left me conflicted.  While I adore David Tennant in anything, and omg he's so sexy with eyeliner and a goatee, there was really no background on this character, no real connection between him and Charley.  In the original, Charley watched Peter's show all the time and had a real reason to seek him out when dealing with the vampire.<br />Overall, the movie was decent light entertainment and a welcome addition to my vampire flick collection, but I probably won't re-watch it as much as the original (except to drool over David Tennant, haha).
0671027344|1.0|I was very excited to read this book. I'd heard it was a life changer... It wasn't. The book has no plot line. It centers around Charlie, a boy who has no friends, meets new friends, and becomes addicted to cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. In the end? He has a mental breakdown. That's literally it. As a teen, I thought I'd be able to relate to Charlie, but I just couldn't. This book was a waste of my time. If you want to read a book about a teen who does pot, then read this book, but if you want to read one that will change your life, then you'll be sorely disappointed.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Another...classic for me...I still never tire of this movie...and the interchange of thoughts and feelings on a variety of issues. Great dialogue...not often found in other movies! Highly recommend! (And has the BEST follow-up movies ten years later...that must be watched!)

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Even at nearly 2 & 1/2 hours the movie cannot build the aura of &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; as developed in the book.  Trying to portray the desperation of the people and their circumstances in a number of flashbacks seems to me to only work if only you have read the book (mabe 90% of the viewers?) but would likely make the story hard to follow for those who haven't. Wonderful acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson, but disappointing special effects, especially the &#34;Girl on Fire&#34; illusion costumes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down and devoured it in 3  days and the only reason it took me that long was because I had school. I highly recommend this book to anyone. I think it was very well  written and I'm pretty sure I fell in love with Dean right along with Sky.
B00BBA6FOI|4.0|I found Sheryl Sandberg's style of writing refreshing. She shares personal anecdotes, academic research, and insights from her networks in an informative and interesting manner.<br />The book has made me more conscious of situations in which I am not leaning in in my professional life and I'm aware of what I need to do to improve this.<br />The book was also a useful reminder of how much husbands and partners need to lean in in the home (childcare, household chores etc) to support their wives/partners who work. I think this would be quite an interesting area for further research in South African society where most homes are still run along traditional gender roles. I know women who are CEOs of companies who still have to go home and cook after a work day because that is seen as a wife's role. Even when they have domestic help, the wife is seen as somehow failing in her duties if she is not the one collecting kids from school, preparing meals etc. For South African women to advance professionally, men need to lean in more in the home.<br />I enjoyed this book very much.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|There are a lot of games I can do without and this is by far not one of them. Big fun and great graphics makes this game a zombie lovers dream. Highly reccomend this one.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|And I do too!! Because it&acute;s sooo easy to read and use on the kindle hd; that we don&acute;t care about other calculators.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is just awesome fun. I play it several times on a daily basis. Doesn't get much better than this I must say.
B00005V9IJ|1.0|I bought this DVD as a gift, and was EXTREMELY upset and disappointed to find out that the DVD I ordered was pirated. The menu screen looked it like it made on Windows Movie Maker and was in a completely different language.. Maybe Chinese? I was irate. However, I contacted the company and they refunded me the full amount.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best book I've read in quite a while!  Couldn't put it down.  Suzanne is a great writer.  Keeps the reader engaged at all times.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is a clever, engrossing Gothic (mock-gothic?) novel constructed from some surprisingly lovely sentences. It is well worth the read.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love plots that are unguessable.  There are more twists in this thing than a python.  It seems to instruct in the differences between accepting the empirical nature of police work and rejecting commonly accepted &#34;fact&#34; in favor of notions less travelled.  Superpragmatism.  Cool show though.  Not perfect but excellent.
0062200399|5.0|Full of elegant sentences and wry comedy. Check out the audiobook too; Neil Gainman is an excellent, articulate and funny reader.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey is the guilty pleasure of many people, myself included.  It fulfills the American interest in the complex relationship between nobility and the staff the serves them.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|I'm conflicted about Les Mis.  The story is excellent but so damned depressing that my feelings about spending my time watching a story like Les Mis are mixed.  The production was amazing with costumes, cast, story and songs.  There's no denying it was extremely well made and the cast did a fantastic job considering the footsteps they were following and even exceeding sometimes.  Russell Crow has to have big brass ones to follow Geoffrey Rush but I thought he did an excellent job though I wasn't as thrilled with the way the death scene was written, still I thought Russell did the best anyone could have done with it .  There are no spoken lines.  The entire film is done in song.  The story is excellent as ever (albeit depressing).  It's a classic story and  I'm glad I saw it, but I just can't say I enjoyed spending the time seeing the film, and I can't honestly say that I'd bother to see this version of it again.  If you enjoy musicals and enjoy the story you will probably love this film.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|Ladyhawke  is still one of my favorites after all theses years. It is a great movie, a bit dated by the 80's soundtrack but still a must see in my book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Fabulous settings - amazing architecture (hopefully they make enough money to fix up Highclere castle which is actually falling apart inside the upstairs rooms).<br />Impressively skilled cast<br />Devilish writing<br />Fantastic costumes
B00BY9GQHM|4.0|The story did not make any sense how was she talking to a dead postman. I like the hidden object part of the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|They did a fantastic job on this 3rd Season of Downton Abbey.  If you've seen the other 2 seasons you're going to love (and hate) this one!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is one of the best programs we have viewed.<br />It is on a level of Downton Abby.and Foyle's War.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Although I'm a little too old for this demographic I found this show quite charming and cute. The Sadie character steals the show but the rest of the cast is great too.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|The program is great.  The male and female leads are right for the roles a they play.  The occasional inclusion of real mystery writers adds  special interest to me since I'v read most of their novels.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is a light, involving romance. Perfect to a afternoon's reading on a lazy day. Even the drama is believable. I liked it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic writing, great acting. Wonderful production and costumes.  Complicated story line keeps me interested.  Look forward to the next season!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|easy to have downtime with this app. i really enjoy trying to get all the challenges. getting under 1000 may be hard now yhat i play so much.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app and use it all the time. So useful to have. Such a simple idea and the best of its kind.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've been waiting for this app since it came out on ipod! And it is as awesome as ever. I love this game!!!!!!!!!
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Always makes you want to read more. It continues to expand reacher's character. I only wish there were more to read.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I was a sometimes sudoku player until I got this app. Now I use it everyday.<br /><br />Doing pencil marks by hand is tedious and error prone. This app has automatic pencil marks.<br /><br />The hints provide a good way to learn how to use pencil marks.
B0064QNS62|1.0|couldn't t get anywhere  jumps are to high the idea is ok but if your not. coordinated enough it's not fun to go over and over the same thing
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Having only just started playing this lovely game last night, I'm already on level 8 and havnt needed too use the gems, this very sweet pretty game does teach you the art of patients, my tip for you all out there, go play another game, while waiting for eggs too hatch, then go back too the eggs at the given time, and the eggs will be ready too hatch :-) have also saved up 17 gems :-) it can be done! The baby dragons are adorable, the houses and plants are so beautiful, and yes very addictive :-) great game for all ages not just for young children, don't take my word for it, come and find out for yourselves :-) my rating for this cute game is a big 5 :-)
0345803485|4.0|Came in a timely fashion and was entertaining.  Ordered the next book to see what happens. This was an easy read.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|Fantastic book about the need for daily aerobic exercise.  Its amazing that only one state in the country has mandatory daily P.E.<br /><br />Everyone needs to learn about the research he discusses in this book
B008MEM24S|5.0|I downloaded the free version and i was hooked so i decided to buy the full version my fiance is also loves to play on my kindle fire hd.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|This game works well on the Fire. Don't try to use the tilt control or you will drop your device. This game requires quick manuvering and the touch control works great most of the time but can disengage when you need it. It is possible to make it to the top without spending real money. Lots of fun. Good luck. Don't buy coins or gems they need to multiply the amount per Dollar by 10 to make it reasonable. It let's you &#34;save&#34; to Facebook cloud but has no download feature so saving to the cloud is mute.
B000063UR1|4.0|Outstanding special effects for 1972 before the computer age. Bruce Dern was a perfect fit for the story line. Recommend this for all sci-fi fans.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed the 1st book so much, I stayed up all night reading it.  I had a harder time getting into Book Two but really enjoyed the 3rd one.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A SIMPLER TO DOWNLOAD MY BOOKS. SHOW PROCEDURES. SHOULD HI LITE IF NOT WORKING PROPERLY.
B0094K1K42|2.0|Draggy plot, ridiculous ending...The dog wasn't even cute.  I'm a big Charlize Theron fan.  I kept thinking any minute the plot would get better.  Wrong.
B009R8DHAQ|5.0|I like this book because the diary of a wimpy kid is awesome.<br />I just want to thank Jeff Kinney fore righting this book.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I've played it for hours and love it. Really, really, really, recommend it to kids everywhere! Play it now  - today!
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|The original is my all-time favorite movie and, since I know remakes are generally not as good as the original, I went into this with a completely open mind, no expectations, so to say this far exceeded my expectations would almost be silly!  Mostly, same basic storyline, with some updates...I was really impressed to say the least!  I can say this, in my opinion, was just as good as the first!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like to play the game. You will too!  You would like to play with the little ponies in the game. I guarantee it!
B0044IABFS|4.0|Being one of my favorite shows of all time, I would rate the first 3 seasons with 5 stars...only reason this one got 4 is because, as my kid mentioned, this particular season doesn't stay true to the title.  Otherwise, still excellent and has all of the cool twists and turns the other seasons had.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it!!!!<br />This was a great game for the kids! Hours of fun for the kids! Tons of activities and the graphics are really good.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|My favorite movie genre is comedy so giving this a fair review, I simply was not impressed.  Maybe I wasn't its target audience, being a 40something female, but this did nothing, even for the Jim Carrey fan in me!  Don't get me wrong, it had its moments and I had some laughs...just kinda fell short of what I was expecting, I guess.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Interesting look at the issues  at the time of the Iranian Revolution.  Worth getting the digital edition along with the DVD / Blue Ray Combo.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this game easily entertains me. I would high reccomend it to anyone especially any tower defends fans. or even just people who like monkeys
B008Y212PI|5.0|I enjoyed playing the puzzles and exercising my mind. I wish there was a way to replay them. The cost is fair.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It is hard to like the main characters because they are so extremely flawed, one more than the other.  You can barely wrap your head around the perverse agenda of the woman and her husband's acquiescence to a life tied to her evil.
B00AH69T22|5.0|Metallica really delivers on this album. Some of their stuff sounded a bit flat a while back but this on really rocks.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could NOT put this book down! In fact, I read through half of it and started over again because I started to &#34;get&#34; what was going on and wanted to make sure I was being a good detective.  Read it in a weekend.  Great read!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I thought it would be impossible to read a book on the Samsung Galaxy 3.6&#34; MP3 player screen. Some web page come up with microscopic print. However, the Kindle books are great. Font is a little smaller than the Kindle Fire HD, but easy to read. I'm an old grey beard that wears glasses too. The sharpness of the screen probably has a lot to do with it, but the Kindle for Android is great. Try it, it might surprise you. Now I can carry a collection of books in my shirt pocket !!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Skyfall was a marginal performer. It is obvious that Daniel Craig is getting too old to play this role. They should replace him with a new actor who can bring a new look to the 007 character.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This Movie Test Your Heart... One Of The Best History Ever ,All Actor was Perfect Good To Watch With The Family
B006TLFPKO|1.0|If I could write bad twenty times, I would do so. This movie is not worth renting or buying. It is total garbage.
B0060CX8F6|5.0|one of my all time favorite movies by Disney!! my daughter watches this movie over and over again. it wonderfful.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a great movie to watch. This movie has awesome characters and a storyline that is second to none. As a result of the violent nature and sexual explicit scenes from this movie, I would not recommend this movie for children.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Don't read the bad comments about this book. If you are a fan of this series this book won't disappoint.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|This is a very bad movie. It has a poor plot, storyline, Characters and ending. I regret watching it in the first place.
B004JN1CW4|1.0|I read this because I beganthe series and I have to finish stories, once started. This was one of those times I really wish I didn't. The worst part of this? The author's attempt at a love triangle. Worse yet, because of the author's showing, rather than telling the whole story, I felt the characters to be weak, underdeveloped,and unbelievable at best (were we ever supposed to see this level of genius they kept spouting about?). The result was that I had little feeling for any of the characters except to feel a little bad for the main character's rejected girlfriend. Wish it had been better. I think it could have been.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises in my view was the best Batman movie ever made. This movie was full of great action and adventure. Because of its violent nature, this movie should not be viewed by kids.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|This could have been really good. It was well conceived, but something is lacking in its execution... This isn't a bad read, though, and it's a rather quick one. However, if you're like me and must read the entire series once you've started, this isn't one I'd pick. The books just get more strange and worse from here.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This was a terrible movie that was a waste of film. I had poor charters, storyline and a very bad ending. I  would not see it for free.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Lots of intrigue without the blood and guts. A lot of flawed people trying to find the way. I could do with out the naked scenes.
B00637D114|5.0|Great movie, This was a splendid movie that I had the pleasure of enjoying it with my kids. I highly recommend this movie for parents who are trying to find quality and wholesome movies that they can enjoy with their kids.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Pretty cool game!! Great graphics, and a lot of cool things.you'll have lots of fun with this game... have fun!!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Awesome, this movie was great. Wreck it Ralph has a splendid plot where the bad guy wants to be good. For such realities are true about human nature. This is where we all aspire to be better than are four fathers. This is a movie that I would pay again because it is a feature which is good for children to see. In my opinion, this is a must see a movie.
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|Movie plays badly from the middle through the end and is not viewable.<br />Very unhappy with this movie after I looked so forward to receiving it. Will<br />re purchase through a local retailer.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie will become a great classic. It has an awesome plot that delivery's an impressive action movie to the audience. This is a movie I would pay to see many times over.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I like the game. The waiting on lives part stinks...but other than that its a great game. Fast paced...needs more bonuses.
B00APUQT7I|1.0|Ice Age seems to have the same theme over and over. It's like they take the old script and add a few ideas to keep production cost down in creative writing. From time and again each of these films talk on the importance of family and team work. From watching all three movies, it's hard to tell the first one from the last one.  If you want to watch this movie, wait for it to come to cable. A dollar spent on this through Amazon or DVD is a big waste of your money.
1451673442|4.0|Just as good as &#34;The Secret. A positive and inspiring read. I highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who have read The Secret.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Argo was a great movie with a good plot that could only be made in Hollywood. This movie has a awesome storyline, and I would highly recommend it to your viewers.
B009LH1Y1W|3.0|Supernatural got away from the &#34;Monster of the Week&#34; style episodes a few seasons ago. It's a shame, because those episodes were the best -- it was like watching a gritty mini-horror film each week. Those were 5-star entertainment. Ever since the brothers got involved with angels and heaven, there are subplots piled on top of subplots and the storyline has become a bit convoluted. The &#34;Monster of the Week&#34; episodes still pop up now and again -- and some are still very well-executed -- which is why it still gets 3 stars from me.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Great movie, I dislike Denzel Washington. This movie should had been played by a much younger man. With all the drugs this guy takes in the movie, he should have been dead at thirty. I would not pay to see it again.
B008393Q2O|4.0|I like the color customization. Able to set reminder associated with it , it is a plus! Best of all, it is password protected.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game very much. it is highly addictive and is quickly becoming a favorite game for me. I am going to have to check out more games from g5!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It's amazing how one can connect with such vulnerable characters. This book really does keep you on your toes. The entire time my mind tried guessing what pat was going to do.
B005NFVZZG|5.0|Great show filled with a little bit of everything from supernatural, love, loss, suspense it is a great show! I'm hooked
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Love the whole movie. I enjoyed the happy characters. This is Definately a family movie, safe for children to watch alone or with others...
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My son is four and this is the first movie he has really been interested in.  We took a chance on it and he has watched it non-stop.  Money well spent.  It arrived perfectly.  No complaints.
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|I admit that I didn't know of The Black Keys until I bought the &#34;Brothers&#34; album. That album was so good that I had to listen to every Black Keys album I could find. Magic Potion is another great album by these two.
0316056898|5.0|Great read hard to put down. Loved it and planning on buying more for friends as gifts!! Men and women will find this funny  !
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Love this game. Not happy about paying 4.99 but like the game very much. I would buy other g5 games
B00A77II0U|3.0|The story is great, but I would have liked some real puzzles.  This game is heavy into hidden objects.  It's a series of find the HOs and find where they go.  For me, it was a bit too predictable.  The game does run flawlessly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|You want help being creative, just get on Pintrest. This is a wonderful site for coming up with unique outfits, decorating ideas, cooking suggestions, and so much more. Just beware.......you can't just get on the site and off real quick. Once you're on you could be on for hours because there is so much neat things to look at!
B00B23O96A|5.0|This brought back great memories-both old and older-my music and what my parents listened to too.  I would recommend this to my generation and theirs too.
B002NFCHBA|5.0|I have always wanted to hear everything Chopin ever wrote, and this Complete Edition gave me that opportunity. I now understand why people choose the most memorable songs when they produce an album; some of the songs in this complete edition were not the most memorable. But it was worth it to hear everything Chopin ever wrote. In my opinion the Nocturnes were the most memorable. Definitely check this Complete Edition out.
0783229364|4.0|It would never be considered for an Oscar, but it's been making us laugh for many years. We gave up our last VHS player, so it was time to get it on DVD.<br /><br />One of our &#34;feel good&#34; films.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|If you like history you will enjoy this movie. Very well acted and the visuals were impressive. A must see.
0764197843|2.0|I teach Japanese students in Japan.  I have used Barron products in the past and normally like them.  However, with this particular product there were problems with one of the CDs, which would jump and skip.  This might have something to do with the way they are packaged in the book.  Also, all the test answer sheets are incorrectly numbered.  Since I actually time the student using this book, she lost concentration and time when it was realized that the answer sheet was missing an answer number (105).  The test material itself is good, but due the the problems with the CD and answer sheet, I will not recommend this product or possibly any other Barron products to my Japanese students in the future.  I will look for other alternatives first.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can I say.....I love this show. It has zombies, great characters, and delves into the frailties and shortcomings of the walking live ones.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is great as a stand-alone film, but it is even better as the final word on the Firefly story (Firefly was a TV series that was cancelled, and the uproar from the watching public caused the actors of the show to produce &#34;Serenity&#34;). Serenity is, in essence, a 2nd and final season of Firefly condensed into a movie.  The crew of the Firefly-class spaceship, the Serenity, are set in a future time, where they are are rebels to the controlling government. They haul freight and some passengers, both legal and not, and probe into the reasons for the govt doing what it does. Fear of the dreaded Reavers, a group of demented and almost zombie-like humans who attack, maul, and eat anyone they come across, is a theme throughout the show, ending with an eye-opening resolution, which I won't spoil here. The characters in this movie are fun and interesting, with a natural chemistry that is what made Firefly so popular. Touches of romance stand shoulder to shoulder with tough guys and high-action battles. The writers for the show came up with fresh and spunky dialog that is laugh-out-loud funny or quirky and sarcastic. Overall, the movie hits multiple genre...it's a drama, but sci fi-fantasy, with romance next to almost wild-west action. It's all the good stuff rolled into one movie.<br /><br />Summary: excellent entertainment for adults, with the freedom from real-life worries present in most dramas, since everything in this story is fantasy. Not for the kiddies....violence and hints of a sexual nature, and the Reavers would be scary to kids.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Has everything--drama, romance, good story lines, well-developed characters.  Haven't seen Julianna Margulies since ER.  I forgot how good she was.
B000FA675C|5.0|Da Vinci code is awesome, as long as you read it before Angels and Demons. It's technically a sequel, and it's supremely good. But Angels and Demons was so good that it in no way compares. Read them out of order.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book is an awesome read, once you get through the first half. It takes a little while until you get to anything intresting. Make sure you grab your tissues at the end!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This game is lots of fun. I like that their is two types of controls to chose from.  Really cool!
B003SI6C4O|4.0|Cool story line. Good acting by Deznel Washington as usual. Kept us on our edge most of the time. recommended.
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|This gets one star only because Amazon doesn't offer anything lower. A minus 10 stars would certainly be more appropriate for a 400 plus page book that contains absolutely no plot. None. There are a number of little vignettes, but no plot. As such, the story falls apart all over the place (and that's not even considering the numerous typos in the Kindle version). I paid over $7 for this and 7 cents would have made it grossly overpriced. I cannot believe all the people the author so generously thanked for their advice forgot to tell her she had no story, no plot and, therefore, no believable resolution.<br /><br />The disadvantage of buying Kindle books is that you cannot return them for a refund. More's the pity.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Lord of the Rings was one of my favorite movies in all times. And this one got me too. Highly recommended for fans of the genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool it is a fun a game to play if you get the app you will love it every day I play the game it just so fun to play I just to jump up and down with joy!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I haven't risen through all of the levels yet, but this game is terrific! The multiple difficulty levels and many possible variations make every level so far very different. I love games where the learning curve takes more than a few hours to master. The premise is pretty morbid, but once you get past that, it's a blast!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I  love  how this book  ended I  Would be Interested in more information about  the Christian character.<br /><br />Hopefully you will write more
055358202X|5.0|What else needs to be said about George R. R. Martin.  By now everyone knows how good he is, and it goes without saying he is one of my favorite Fantasy writers.  Each book is gripping and well written.  If you have not jumped on the bandwagon, do yourself a treat and get in there.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|At first i thought it was going to be just another temple run but it wasnt it was its own game. This game is fun and addicting! You should really get this game! I played for at least an hour and a half when i first got it and i only play it now when i know i have an hour to waste on playing just that game!
159102594X|5.0|Up there with the better books I have read since GRR Martin.  The first book takes a bit to set the stage and introduce the characters, but it ends with a bang.  Towards the end I read one of the best chapters I have read in a long time.  I had to go back and re-read it twice it was that good.  If you are looking for some good new fantasy, you will not find this disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. I don't think that there is anything wrong with it. It's Awesome Sauce no one can say otherwise.
055357342X|5.0|What else needs to be said about George R. R. Martin.  By now everyone knows how good he is, and it goes without saying he is one of my favorite Fantasy writers.  Each book is gripping and well written.  If you have not jumped on the bandwagon, do yourself a treat and get in there.
B003Z0BWR2|5.0|This is an amazing story,supposedly for teen reading,but feel adults will get as caught up in it as well,just love the story.
0553579908|5.0|What else needs to be said about George R. R. Martin.  By now everyone knows how good he is, and it goes without saying he is one of my favorite Fantasy writers.  Each book is gripping and well written.  If you have not jumped on the bandwagon, do yourself a treat and get in there.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|This was just a whim read but now can not put it down and will read all this series,a really amazing story line
0756405890|5.0|Rothfuss sets up a beautiful world and detailed story that follows some exceptional characters.  Truly a jewel to read, and I am always looking for great new fantasy books.  This tops the chart with some of the best writers out there in my opinion.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|If you were around in the 80's then you know who the Muppets are. I like the new Muppets in this movie and you cannot go wrong with Amy Adams!!
0553381687|5.0|What else needs to be said about George R. R. Martin.  By now everyone knows how good he is, and it goes without saying he is one of my favorite Fantasy writers.  Each book is gripping and well written.  If you have not jumped on the bandwagon, do yourself a treat and get in there.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Gotta love motorcycle stunts!! Watch out Matt Damon you are now replaced with a good actor. Jeremy Renner also has the Unusuals which could have been a great series.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|I used and loved Verizon VZ Navigator for years.  When I got my Android phone, someone told me about Waze.<br /><br />This software is very easy to use, provides a lot of details of road conditions, EXCELLENT maps and descriptions, etc.<br /><br />I highly recommend this app.
B001QB9H10|5.0|It is amazing how one actor can do such a myriad of movies, From Crank ( terrible ) to The Expendables, Jason Statham is a good actor.
0761171703|5.0|The combination of Jordan Matter's photographic skills and the wonderful dancers he captures looking so &#34;natural&#34; makes this the PERFECT book for anyone who likes creative photography.<br /><br />Reading this has lead to several more purchases of this book and others by this photographer as gifts.<br /><br />I still thumb it regularly for inspiration, technique ideas, and sometimes just for a smile.<br /><br />Thank you, Jordan!
B005NNV4TU|5.0|Pink Floyd, What else is there to say? The remastered albums are just wonderful but you cannot beat vinyl. Great
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Don't forget to buy the plug (sold separately.  Otherwise it's not usable for recharging. It's much bertter than the original one that came with the Kindle fire, which is now defunct.  The only problem has always been that the cord is too short.  I now have extension cords in three places so I can plug the Kindle in and charge while I continue to read.
B006P0FD4W|3.0|Paranormal Activity scared the s*** out of me and 2 was not too bad. Three has moments but overall it is a let down, I expecially do not like the ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is great to watch without commercials. You can sit down at night only to find you have easily watched three episodes! haha<br />Even my husband loves the series.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Well done Peter Jackson!  The Hobbit was great on the big screen but just as enjoyable on Blu-ray in my livingroom.  I love that this is sold as a combo pack to cover any and all methods I could possibly want to watch the movie.  I really enjoyed the extras that are included here (the access code to the live Peter Jackson preview event for the next film was a cool add-on).  Looking forward to the next two Hobbit movies and adding them to my Blu-ray collection as well!
B007MJT13E|3.0|You can certainly see the similarities between this film and The Hunger Games but the latter is a much more riveting story whereas Battle Royale focuses more on moving from one gory death to the next. It's still highly entertaining. I thought it would be more difficult to really pay attention to because of the need for subtitles but you don't even notice that you are just reading the movie as it does keep your attention.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have never been more entertained by any other TV show! Great writing, superb directing & fantastic acting. Don't miss this show!
B0053TMP24|5.0|I think the the book Is great. People who like the first book of the series and Percy Jackson series will like this book.
1476735115|5.0|It's been a while since I've read a book that I've enjoyed and found thought provoking.  I enjoy post apocalyptic novels but many aren't what I consider excellent.  Wool Omnibus is a well crafted story.  If you enjoy books like Shogun (historical fiction) or Stephen King's The Stand, I think you will enjoy Wool.  I first got hooked by the free first story that was available on the Kindle and promptly got the Omnibus.  To share it, I ordered the soft cover (which has fallen apart from all the people that have read and enjoyed it), and ordered the hardback for my own library.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Excellent lawyers business series mixed with very well managed personal life of their cast. The actors and actresses provide all their abilities and enthusiasm handled with professionalism by Director and crew . Well done! highly recommended for those who love legal and politics tricks.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Love every minute of this creative and entertaining show. I look forward to when it comes out so I can watch it.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|This book was ok. Positives were the writing style and cute story. Negatives were it was a bit drawn out and didn't quite manage to make the grade. It was a very far fetched story but I felt the writer wanted you to believe it, rather than convince you it was a fable. If you like Forest Gump you'll like the book.
B0081BU42O|5.0|Banks again brings us into the hopeful yet exciting world of the Culture. Good action, exploration of deep thoughts (life, the universe, and everything!), and a fun read. I recently hear Mr. Banks is ill, and that this may be one of his last books, dreadful if true, but catch the master while you can...
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Great book. A real page turner. I have recommended this book to family & friends & all have thoroughly enjoyed.
0060763280|5.0|My mentor recommended this book to me. At first, I was \\" put off \\" by the analogies between \\" poor people\\"  and \\"rich people \\" However, Once I read the entire book, I felt really enlightened.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|A masterpiece of storytelling and movie making, perhaps the best work of Steven Spielberg's career; enthralling, entertaining and enlightening!  This is the quintessential movie on Lincoln and the U.S. Civil War.
B0094MFITS|4.0|The character, a cold disconnected drunk that doesn't really seem to be drinking too much...but tries to work on it anyway.  Not a sympathetic object.  As is typical with movies with a good first or second story plot.  They carry it too far to believe this little out of the way town has so much trouble.  Even the characters in the film mention that he had used his gun to kill people more than he did when he was a cop in LA.  Maybe he just likes killing bad people.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Finally a movie about a Capella music!!! I've been waiting for a movie like this! And Rebel Wilson is hilarious
B00AB7HESI|1.0|wasted a dollar on this.  come on amazon and warner bros.  get your act together and test this on the fire.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is my fav Bond,sorry Sean. This story just adds to the two other films that Daniel has been in. Good story,well acting,plenty of action and new faces that add a little more to the Bond story line. Can't wait for the next one.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really loved reading this story written from a dog's prospective.  It encompassed all the emotions, happy, sad, anger, love, etc.  A fast read.
B00A2LOAKI|4.0|Great part two of the Dark Knight Returns story line. Peter Weller does a great job doing The Batman voiceover. I wish they would make a part three,cause I like we're they left off and could keep going telling the story of an older Batman.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is awesome and cool.My best friends love temple run 2! but I think Temple run should have a little kid one you now a easier one.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|got it at the best price with the blu-ray, dvd, copy, and the 3-d disc. better price than at best buy.
B009EEMMWW|4.0|Penelope Cruz is great! A sexy cooking show; who would have thought. Lots of laughs.  I wouldn't have let the hubby back in, but it worked for the show.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Bought this to get caught up on the series. Great way to be able to do that. Thanks for that opportunity
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|this is 2012/2013n's most epic movie!<br />  if you want a fun,scary,action,and any other good movie attribute buy or rent The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey. you will not be disappointed at all<br />even better then it's predecessor's (the lord of the rings trilogy)<br />  we see Bilbo bagen's (simple and unadventurous hobbit)  drawn in to a crazy dwarf adventure to fiend the lost gold of the dwarf's.<br />  also to j.r.r.Tolkien book lovers  this movie stays true to the book to the T.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Found the Season 1 of the series to have great plot lines and is and very entertaining.  Highly recommend this set.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|RATED IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE NOTHING IS \\"PERFECT\\" BUT i WOULD MOST DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS BECAUSE IT IS A LOT OF FUN!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I thought this movie would be action packed around a flight disaster.  Instead, most of the movie is about the pilot's acholol problem.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think its very good and very interesting. I enjoy it very much. I would suggest that you make it slightly easier to get coins,  or make difficult levels for those who are not to good at the game.
B00785P2QC|2.0|This is a five star game. But it loses a star for all of the Facebook tie ins. Then loses another star for all of the plugs to buy buy buy. It loses a big star by making if impossible to &quot;top out&quot; without spending big bucks. I'd rather pay a few bucks up front than be nickel and ninetynine center to death. A shame that marketing screwed up a fabulous game!
B009S33I68|5.0|One of the best books I have read!  Especially about the Viet Nam war. this book made you feel as if you were there. It is a real page turner.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This was a huge surprise for me.  I thought it was going to be merely a fantasy with some cool cge.  But the story was beautiful and powerful.  I lost myself in the story.  The narration and the visuals were breathtaking.  This is one of very few movies that I would see over and over again.<br /><br />Not a movie for young children.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I just REALLY LOVE THIS edition.  Idont play a lot of dfferent games and this one is delightful!  Many thanks
B004J0PUP2|5.0|Although this movie may not be implicitly follow documented history and, at some junctures, may create it from whole cloth, it is completely captivating. The characters are fully developed and you empathize with the situations and state of mind in which all the characters find themselves.
B00190OHD6|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS SO WONDERFUL.IF ANYONE OUT THERE HAS EVER LOSS SOMEONE VERY CLOSE TO THEM THIS MOVIE HAS MEANING. I SAW IT ON T.V.AND THE NEXT DAY I ORDERED IT FROM AMAZON.IT WAS LOVING AND FUNNIE AND SAD.BUT ALL IN ALL IT WAS WONDERFUL.EVERYONE WITH ANY KIND OF HEART OR FEELING SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE.
B000FA675C|4.0|My favorite DB novel, a fun read. Good action and narrative, but could have done without the love sub story.
B000SEI230|4.0|I felt this book was a bit draggy at the beginning, but quickly became a very sweet story. There was a true lesson for all of us in this book. This is more a female book and probably, teens would love this story.
0385344228|5.0|Definitely a thriller. I learned about the judicial system. This is the first time I have read the author's works.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cannot really relate to what happens but I can love how all of the emotional me want to read on and learn to understand.  Love can be a powerful thing no matter what age or how it comes about.  The love one has for you can never really be lost...maybe just pushed away a little or a lot
B000055Y0X|5.0|If we didn't hear anything negative, we can assume recipient was satisfied with gift.  Wish lists are great. Saves time.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Love this series......I just want more so I keep buying and reading.  He has become a familiar friend in my mysteries.  I love series because I hate to leave a character I become fond of.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|I watched this movie at least 5 times. For those who want a different perspective to the Holocaust. You never see the ending coming.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|This is set in a post-apocalyptic U.S. that is very gloomy and hopeless. Denzel Washington plays Eli, who reminds you of the ultimate warrior on a quest for a holy graile. He is unstoppable as he overcomes obtacles in his journey west across the country, the worst being a tribal gang leader (of sorts) who is in a desperate search for a copy of the Bible. His scheme is to build a religious fiefdom of survivors who will cow at his scripture-quoting silver tongued oratory. Eli has the last copy known to exist and is unshakable in pursuing his mission, seeing his rival for the huckster that he is. The plot stands up. Great irony is portrayed through the post-nuclear holocaust world. One of the better lines delivered by Eli is telling a young woman (Mila Kunis) about the world before. &#34;We had so many things. We didn't know what was valuable and what wasn't. We threw away things that people now will kill another person to get.&#34;<br /><br />It is dark and the scenery is ugly. That was intentional but hard to give it 5 stars for all of that.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|It was a great movie i went and bought it and i would recommend it to every one any day of the week
B00ALYY6ZA|1.0|I HATE IT, REPEAT THIS MESSAGE 10 MORE TIMES TO FULFILL THE STUPID WORDS REQUIRED BY AMAZON.  I HATE IT.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was definitely a page turner. Going to a lecture by the author was helpful.  Also discussing it with book club.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|The movie was good however the first 15i minutes of the movie was garbled and didn't ve through at all. Very dissatisfied with the streaming of this movie amazon!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Just difficult enough to be challenging, but easy enough to be enjoyable!  I love this type of hidden object game!
B000AP04NI|5.0|I recall seeing this in the 50's in Todd AO in NYC. It was great then and is still a classic. Even better than the stage production. Colow and sound is super! Get it for your collection
0307346617|5.0|A very fun and enjoyable read with a number of interesting plots and turns.  I need six more words.  Yes.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|This film has it all.  Great stars, great director and a witty and entertaining script.  And don't forget the Location.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I enjoyed this book, I didn't know what to expect so the graphic details were a bit much, but he did it tastefully so I got through it. I learned so much about zoo animals and the storyline itself was amazing, wow!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great game long story mode awesome graphics even when you are zoomed in all the way only thing thaat is bad is you have to be level 10 to acsess water park
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|If you like the game hill climb you will love. This game it's so fun great graphics and never ending you will be addicted to this game the best part is its FREE!!!!! You need to play it
B000UVT3OI|5.0|ALL my favorites in one package. Fun, emotional and reflective. Who could ask for more than that...keep em coming. Thanks
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just like the other G5 games I have played this one is equally as Great.  I cannot get enough of them.  These games offer everything I enjoy in a game.  Looking forward to my next one!!!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I got caught up in this without expecting to. Great stuff with Buddy Guy adding a bit of class. Tommy Lee on acid was a bonus
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love how you can like just touch right or left and it will flip the page.I just love it I recommend this for a dictionary .you don't even have to go and buy a dictionary.
B001RPIYV4|5.0|Perfection. What better word to describe such a powerful movie? This interpretation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet really does the story justice. I love that the movie keeps with the original dialogue - after all, isn't that what keeps us intrigued throughout the story? While watching this masterpiece, I felt every emotion possible. I was happy, romantic, sad, angry, shocked, scared, and everything in between. If you want an extremely powerful and emotional updated version of the classic story Romeo and Juliet, look no further than Baz's Romeo + Juliet. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B003G4W49C|3.0|The fact it was written by a homophobic man provides a weird undertone to the whole book. It was good, don't get me wrong, but the more you learn about Orson, the worse the book becomes.
B009IF82SK|5.0|This is the best show ever. A great representation of life in our country. Cannot wait for the next episode.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I've always wanted to try Scribblenauts. I wanted Scribblenauts Unlimited for Christmas, but this the perfect alternative. Thank you Amazon!
B008602KQI|5.0|I never think a movie is as goog as the book, but I'm making an exception in this case. Spot on job with casting and the story line was improved by presenting e lead character as a strong woman rather than as a wishy-washy individual portrayed in the book.  A fun rental!
B00BJ64FU0|5.0|The perfect length for a before-bedtime read. I like the intrigue and skilled methods of deduction played out in the book. I can see why these stories have remained so popular over the years.
1439153663|5.0|well written, historical as to the life of black people in the 1800's, i could not put it down.<br />american history at its best
B009VMN3RA|3.0|This book is just what it looks like. Selfish and crazy narcissistic parents and a lost daughter. This girl sure didn't win the lottery when it comes to parents. Can Shirley really be that stupid to believe her husbands story? So much disfunction! It's fun to read if you just want to get lost in a trashy true life story. Sachi, forget that wretched woman, and enjoy the rest of your life! Shirley will pay to send her off to a fancy boarding school to get rid of her, and then NOT pay for college. DISGUSTING. Where was Warren, why didn't he help this girl. What a messed up family. Now this makes me wonder what Annette Benning is really like to marry into this family.
B00AO686MY|5.0|What can I say...who doesn't love the movie who framed roger rabbit and now its out on blu ray/dvd combo pack...I had to buy it and add it to my collection...as soon as it came in the mail I put it on right away for my daughter (15 months old) and my step daughter (9 yrs old) to watch with me and they loved it which made me love the movie even more...I love when the kids love things from my childhood...makes me appreciate the classics even more and want to find more things (movies and games/toys) that the kids may enjoy...
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|okay if you knew me you would know I'm a total dinosaur freak! well I CRAVE dinosaurs! dinosaur movies, looking at dinosaur pictures, dinosaur research, and ESPECIALLY Dinosaur games! this is one of those games for people like me and is the best dinosaur game I have played, ever! 5 stars all the way! yes this game foes require a bit of patients! great for older kids because you can spend real money and some small Kids  wont understand what the game is trying to do. one small problem is it requires about 30 minutes of loading before you have access to the game after that loading is a breeze! I love this game so much! I really hope this revise helped! thanks!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is the best game EVER!!!!!! SO much fun. it is a great anamated game. just download it. if your smart you'll download this game.
B00588ZRY8|5.0|It's more less of a play but its pretty comical. It was shipped pretty fast and there was no damage to the movie. Watched it the same day I got it. Mostly &#34;slap stick&#34; comedy but its pretty funny.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We did not see The Hobbit on the big screen in the theater, but,  we pre ordered the DVD when it came available and were very happy with it.  Our grandchildren saw it in the theater and have still borrowed it to watch a couple of times.  We enjoyed reading the story years ago and it is wonderful to see it on the screen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The most fun way to watch a very fast-paced show like 'The Walking Dead' is to watch each episode back-to-back without any commercial interruptions.  I didn't think I would like this show because I have always thought the whole idea of &#34;zombies&#34; is stupid, but after watching for a little while I realized that the show was more about how the people who are ALIVE react to a horrible, stressful situation.  The real story is the interpersonal relationships between all the characters. This show has very good characters who all have very different personalities and backgrounds and are forced to live together in order to survive.<br /><br />I think that if you give 'The Walking Dead' a chance, like I did, you will find that you will like it too.  The secret is to watch the show from the start (Season 1) and go from there.
B00ARA4SLU|1.0|We only have the word of the credits to believe John J. McLaughlin  based his screenplay on Stephen Rebello's superb book \\"Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho\\"<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" plays so fast and loose with the facts that throughout a screening, viewers with some knowledge of the backstory of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece are tempted to periodically  shout out 'what the hell are they talking about?\\"<br /><br />Rebello's book, published in the early 90's has enough factual anecdotes in it for five decent screenplays...this amalgam of nonsense and fantasy does justice to none of them.<br /><br />Giving Anthony Hopkins jowls and putting him a fat suit doesn't make him convincing (though he certainly tries)...maybe the producers were so enamored of the fact they signed Helen Mirren to play Alma, they felt they had to rewrite history just to strengthen her role and give the film some kind of bizarre balance.<br /><br />Yes Hitchock valued Alma's opinion, yes he relied her on judgment, but she did not have a hand in rewriting Joseph Stefano's screenplay...she didn't rush to the set to oversee the Martin Balsam murder scene when Hitchcock fell ill, and to anyone's knowledge she didn't participate in the reediting of the original cut to make it 'showable'...<br /><br />The innacuracies are endless.....<br /><br />Alma suggesting they use Bernie Herrmann's screaming strings during the shower scene....(Hitchcock's decision once he heard Hermann's score)<br />Alma revealing Janet Leigh 'blinks' on the bathroom floor (what she DID say was \\"Hitch..you can't ship it...Janet Leigh gulps\\")<br />Alma suggesting they kill off the leading lady in the first half hour (Hitch's idea)<br />Alma suggested Tony Perkins for Norman Bates (again Hitch suggested the idea to Joe Stefano)<br /><br />Yes movies based on historical fact are always granted poetic license, but in the case of \\"Hitchcock\\" the poetic license destroys what could have been a great movie.<br /><br />By ignoringthe actual shooting of 'Pyscho' and concentrating on some kind of soap opera version of \\"Al and Alma,\\" the filmmakers suck the blood (so to speak) right out of the story.<br /><br />A really good film could be centered around Hitchcock and the making of his groundbreaking film.....\\"Hitchcock\\" misses by a few country miles.<br /><br />the DVD contains no special features which in this case is probably a blessing
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|The person I bought this for is a diehard MJ fan. It had all of MJ greatest hits. He loves it!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Tom Clancy is quite a writer. I have liked all of his books that I have read. I never get tired of them
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A very fun and challenging game!! Works great on my kindle fire. I love how they keep changing the countries.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Intense, well made. Very impressed with Mr. Affleck's portrayal. It was an intense film, I think the most was with the maid/house assistant when she started figuring things out, and then when the police came to the house and were reminding her of her duty.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|As usually, Castle season 5 is great season movies. It has a lot of humor, sarcastic one. The investigation are kind of the same and nothing very surprising, except the one with Castle's father.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|It was ok. Chingos little Lincoln speeches all throughout the movie. Was hoping for a little more fluff and action. Lincoln loved to storytell, that's for sure.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I gave this app 5 stars because we it offers so much for FREE. It gives you 3 different alarms to choose from &amp; name. They also  give you a dim feature. They can't give you everything for free, but they sure give a lot  away for free!!
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I loved Pillars of the Earth, and World Without End. I started reading the Century Trilogy hoping for more of the same, unfortunately after reading this book I feel disappointed. It was interesting reading about WW2, and I enjoyed learning things about that period of time, but the plot was predictable and the characters lacking any personality.<br />It was an okay book, just don't start reading with high expectations.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|I was a theater employee when Mary Poppins first came out. I was &#34;privileged&#34; to be able to watch it between 80 and 90 times while it was in its first run. It never ceased to make me smile and sing along with &#34;Supercalifrafilisticexpialidocius&#34; and &#34;Ster in Time&#34;. Watching it again now, brought back those memories and rekindled my enjoyment of the whole experience.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Wonderful last book. I wish it was a series though. This book left me with one question. I'm not gonna say because it would spoil a lot, find out for yourself and read this wonderful book. Totally worth the time to read. MUST READ NOVEL!!!
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Forest Gump will undoubtedly become one of the &#34;Eternal&#34; movies that generations will be able to enjoy and love. I can't get enough of it and like to watch it at least once a year if not more often. The wit and humor are second to none as they are melded into a coherent story line that makes the viewer laugh, cry at times, and scratch their head wondering &#34;How did they do that?&#34;
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|A colorful game both of my kids love to play.  I must say that I to have enjoyed playing this game with the kids.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The movie was too long in my estimation. The visuals almost made up for it, but I was pausing to see how much longer there was to the movie about 3/4 of the way through. It didn't seem to follow the book as well as the Trilogy did and as a result seemed disconnected in several key places.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The item was shipped very quickly and was not damaged at all. Exceeded my expectations. 5 stars is my rating!
B009FZFONO|3.0|Just was not exactly what I had expected overall for the third season. I feel like a whole lot was missing in this season compared to the two previous but in the end it is worth watching if you plan on continuing to watch further seasons just because some key things did happen in this season dont want to spoil it for other people who have not yet seeing it.
B0055MBQOM|2.0|I purchased the ColorMunki based in part on various reviews in photography forums.  Wanting to take my post-processing work to the next level and having just purchased an expensive color printer, I felt I should calibrate my monitors to ensure accuracy.<br /><br />The ColorMunki were very frustrating and produced results that provided no assurance as to their validity.  ON my primary workstation I have two identical mid-priced (And well reviewed) monitors.  The ColorMUnki produced noticeably different results on each.  I went so far as reseting and matching the monitor start points, swapping their cables (DVI), etc, etc.<br /><br />It also produced inconsistent results on my MacBook (when using the native laptop screens or with external monitors) and Mac-Mini.<br /><br />Maybe it was a dud unit, as others seems to have better success, or perhaps I'm being too critical / expecting too much.
076781326X|4.0|ONE OF THE BEST MOVIE / MUSICALS EVER !! LOVED IT AS A KID AND AS MUCH AS AN ADULT.<br /> BEWARE : IT WILL HAVE YOU SINGING THESE SONGS ALL THE TIME
1885167776|5.0|Gary Keller is a visionary whose focus is greater results from less effort. Reading this book encouraged me to focus on my \\"1 Thing\\" and helped me start the year on track for a 37% increase in Year over Year Production.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Fun game with lots of options. I like that you can challenge yourself or someone else and that it is changeable.
B0086213XW|2.0|This movie made no sense. The actors were disjointed and didn't seem connected to their characters or each other. I suffered through it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I still cannot stop thinking about this book and what I would do in this situation. Well written, suspenseful!  I couldn't put it down.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I enjoyed the last season of the show. I though they would do another one some years later. but i enjoy the old ones.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Amazing how this guy ended up where he is today. Great job! I wish i had the same luck. Thanks!
B009FBX5M0|4.0|I enjoyed the old sound track of James bond.but this one was good. it has bits from some of the old one.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Found this app to be the most user friendly of any for your mobile device. Quick navigation, crystal clear UI, and streaming from the cloud is fantastic. Try it, you'll love it!
B003UW6VY4|5.0|I like his hits he did back in the day. When i heard this CD i thought he sang those songs good.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great graphics and fun game play. Nicely done.  The only issue is an occasional crash.  Have to restart fun before playing.  Galaxy s2.
B001RIY49C|5.0|My father and I liked the 2nd one a lot that i had to get it for my father and watch the different ones that came out over the years again.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|The movie was breathtaking and I rated it 5 stars on Netflix. The packaging for sale is entirely a different matter. We recently bought a 3D TV and do enjoy watching 3D but also enjoy the 2D version. We own a number of Disney combo packs which include 4 discs for every need, When I first saw the items on Amazon I was sure this was a misprint or that the full combo pack would be announced. It now appears that \\"family friendly\\" Disney is acting out of pure greed and stupidity. If the 3D only disc was priced at $15 it would not be such a disaster. I saw the 3D version in theaters and wanted to see the 2D version as well. We have relatives who are unable to see 3D so in order to obtain both versions in the current packaging I would have to spend $58! This is a critical time for 3D television and if studios try to gouge the public 3D may die the death that the media already predicts. This would be a loss to viewers and movie studios alike.  3D is becoming much more professional and serious ( evidence Avatar and the Hobbit) and no longer a gimmick for cheap cartoons so it would be a great loss if it no longer became available due to pure unadulterated greed. I am holding off on purchase because of the packaging although I love the movie. I urge others outraged by Disney's \\"experiment\\" to write to the studio and the Disney DVD helplinr as I did to express your dissatisfaction at the lack of a boxed 3D 2D Blu-Ray package.
B0012GVKW8|5.0|I grew up watching this one with my father. it was a good one to see. i was little when i saw it the first time.
B000FA675C|5.0|Awesome read!!!! I love Dan Brown's novels. I am very excited for his new one Inferno to be released! I also hope that The Lost Symbol is made into a movie soon.
B00A93ENX8|5.0|I grew up with rush since 1987. This was a good album to have again. I never though they would put this one on a gold CD.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was a surprise. I wasn't too sure on what to expect and if it would even resonate with me. It has and LOUDLY.<br /><br />I recommend this book to ALL women - those who work outside the home and those who work inside the home. There are eye openers and behaviors to emulate.
B000OPOANE|5.0|I loved there snakes and arrows album. when i heard they would come out with a mvp one. I had to get it.

B007REV4T8|5.0|I enjoyed James bond since i was small and i still like him now. Daniel Craig is a good James bond.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|For years people have been telling me to read Dan Brown, and I finally got around to it with Deception Point.<br /><br />Must say I'm pleasantly surprised. OK, he's not a great writer of literature, but he doesn't try to be, and he sure has his genre down pat. It's a page turner and, at times, an eye opener. Sometimes the level of detail gets annoying but the cracking pace keeps it all moving along.<br /><br />Fine entertainment and I'm going to give Lost Symbol a go. I think that pretty much says it all.
B001CNFZEK|5.0|I enjoyed there albums. They are still great to this day. I like his new stuff and old stuff as well.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addictive and fun! Can't stop playing it! Challenging, but not too hard. Highly recommend it. Super fun and no problems.
B000255LNE|5.0|He always writes more love songs that i know of. His stuff is always good. if you like Phil Collins this is some thing you might want to have.
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I have really enjoyed being able to watch whole seasons of Star Trek. Prime streams well, and it is really easy just to pick up were you left off. This season has also been a good season. Less time travel then the others, which I did not like very much. I prefer exploration. All and all it is a great package.
B000WE660M|5.0|I enjoyed her music since 1999. I never saw her live but i enjoy her albums and her singles too.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I can't wait for the movie to come out. Page turning novel that makes you hunger for more of the series.
B001CT877Q|5.0|I enjoyed his total recall, terminator 2 and kinder garden cop. but this one is a good one to have.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is fun and addicting! I find myself playing for hours. Very good game for Boredom. Just say yes!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I enjoyed bowie old stuff. but when i heard he was coming out with some new since 2003 i had to get it.
1433502410|5.0|I studied history in college and like a well rounded (non-biased) view when it comes to topics that can be influenced by opinion. I am very critical of commentary  and Bible translations. That being said, the ESV translation is very accurate and the commentary is so thorough that you can base further research off of it. I LOVE this Bible and highly recommend it to everyone!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Very creative, very helpful in organizing, a lot of fun!! Thank you for coming up with such a great app!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! The childhood chapters were disturbing, but necessary. Overall I really recommend this book for a good read.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I loved the writing and Alicia portrayal of the hurt woman.She is a great actress and she plays this role very well.I enjoyed Kalinda's character I am sure her role will play a more important one in the next show
B0034G4OYA|5.0|We watch it again and again, it's a family favorite.  The voice cast of A list celebs makes this a great movie for all ages.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I love Quentin Tarantino's movies. You must prepare yourself for the graphic parts that you KNOW will be part of any Tarantino flick, and Django is no different. This movie is also long, and I didn't really understand why some parts need even be included, however, the music, the acting, all great; the dark humor-all great. Christophe Woltz and Jamie Foxx, fantastic. Bring your imagination and prepare for the violence, this is a great movie!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Really fantastic! nuff said, I need 16 more words to describe how really fantastic season 3 was without spoilers, that's impossible. Just watch it already.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|Wouldn't consider anything less from this fill Kung fu enthusiast will find it good also should have bought this one ?
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a fun game that reminds me of off-road or something similar.  My only dislike is the 30-second timer.  When you first start the playing, you are lucky if you get very far as the check points get farther apart and provide less time.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|The others were better but it's funny how the movies the first  installment is really  the last is really how it all begin.  Still love the series though !
B000089RVR|5.0|Awesome music. This artist is one of my new favorites; I had not heard of her until I heard about her on NPR.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|Great movie full of action keep you in you seat thriller also don't miss it ! One of Jamie Foxx best movies !
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Awesome music. This artist is one of my new favorites; I had not heard of her until I heard about her on NPR.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I can't fault this app; it's effective, accurate and has a great UI. I love that it can tell me exactly how much reading,watching or listening I have left. Highly recommended.
B009IUH1N2|5.0|it awesome and fun you must like it if you don't you have a problem and you will be weird. lol
B00ABA1OP4|5.0|the ultimate video Rammstein collection in the highest quality possible, uncensored! a a a a a a a a a
B009GFEOY8|1.0|This experiment was very disappointing. Development time is 40 minutes or more. Not so &#34;instant&#34;. I followed the mfg's suggestions about how to use/develop the film. Colors in my prints are all washed out with a decided red-orange tint. Several photos developed with streaks. Varying the exposure didn't change these results to any degree. For the money (about $4/exposure) this product is a real stinker. I'll stick with digital from now on.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie was very nice and historically accurate. As usual Steven Spielberg never disappoints: he is one of the greatest directors!
076421120X|5.0|Most people recognize the name Darlene Zschech as the worship leader from Australia who penned the song \\"Shout to the Lord\\". So I was very interested in reading the devotional book Revealing Jesus ~ after all, someone who has such a tremendous heart for the Lord (as revealed in her worship music) probably has some profound things to share in a daily devotional.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Revealing Jesus takes the reader day-by-day on a journey to greater depth and intimacy with the Lord. Each month begins with a quote taken from the lyrics of a worship song, and the devotionals build one upon another. However, you could easily pick this book up in, say, the middle of June and be challenged to grow in your faith just as much as if you began reading it on the first of January.<br /><br />Starting with a Bible verse and ending with a prayer, each day's reading spurs the reader on toward love and good works, encouraging with truth and forthrightness that leave you thinking more deeply about the things of God. With strong conviction and an understanding heart, Darlene Zschech's writes to make an impact without the sting of judgement. Revealing Jesus is a devotional that can be read year after year.<br /><br />On my \\"Page Turner Scale\\" of 1 to 5, I gave this book a 5.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is full of action and mystery. It has to be my favorite book. I love it a lot! What will happen next?
0316182060|5.0|As always a great book by Gail.  Very good read, and excelent graphics I read the book by Gail Carringer too!
B0026QC0YU|5.0|I really liked this movie! I actually watched the Ghost Protocol first, and then wanted to watch all of the MI movies with Tom Cruise. Very entertaining and intense.
B00821OX98|5.0|Very good entertainment.  Keeps you wanting to watch more.  It has a good plot line with lots of sub plots evolving.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite games to play and he loves it. Really like that I could download this one
B00BVVA138|5.0|It's old school Killswitch, but more mature and10 times better. I'm never disapointed by this band. Heavier than the last few albums, so if your not used to the original Killswitch, get ready. A definite must for any Killswitch fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|old time favorite I used to play as a kid, still love to play it and glad to have it available to play
B002VECM6S|4.0|I rented this movie when it was first available and really loved it so I promised myself I would buy it and then I could enjoy it whenever I wanted.  I really thought it was a good story and a good message.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|my son likes the angry bird game the best, hasn't really played this one a whole lot but he just likes to play games
0553801473|5.0|in a word...  exceptional....  but how does he keep all those people straight? I look forward to the Winter coming books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|both of my sons love to play this game, glad we have this one also, I am not very good at it but it is fun
034580404X|2.0|Besides the repetitive dialogue, no real conversation between characters, lengthy irrelevant chatter, and very low based depth of theme, the actual &#34;erotic&#34; scenes were relatively prudish, and no previous Christian exploits were ever detailed. The constant bickering/ make up fiasco was absurd; the fact that they stay together shows they deserve each other.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|ok so I am addicted to this game....it is so much fun, I play this game a  lot, it is so realistic too
B008TMA1LY|5.0|THIS IS FAST HARD BUT IF YOU PAY ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATE YOU CAN DO IT!!!! I JUST GOT GAME I IT ALREADY!! GET IT GET IT GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the story line. it was interesting and kept my attention. the graphics were good with lots of Color.  I would have liked it to be longer.  you can play it for free to see if you will enjoy it. then can pay to continue it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app even have it on my phone, as I can quickly access the bible and have daily devotions, I am so happy this is available!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read for anyone who likes suspense and drama. The series of books keeps you on the edge wondering whats next.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|easy access on my kindle when i'm out. can check out what people post and if i want to post something
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Too much like Bourn identity and not even as good. People can only do so many jumps and dives without killing them selves.. And this guy has like a hundred lives already. I like action but when bullets do not run out and you do not pull a muscule after numerous fights... I turn you off.
B008393Q2O|4.0|it is all right but could be a better tool to use. i don't understand how i posted something and then when to look for it and the search said it was not found
B00BI73CVI|1.0|This belongs on the stage not the screen.... Musicals do require some talking!!!! This was a theatrical performance on my tv and I couldn't handle it. Couldn't get past five minutes without turning it off... I love musicals and plays and Hugh Jackman.. Especially Hugh Jackman.. But this was too much!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so so so awesome I could play it all day! here is a song about it... ohhhh subway surfers I could play u all day in the morning in the afternoon and in the eavning oh I love u so so much!:)
B001UTW7QU|5.0|very good show , great charters.  Walter is the best.  can't wait until the next show. This is for the sci-fi people.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Best game ever though like one review said it is lagy after a while but otherwise it's awesome so you should by this game it's worth its freeness. So buy it and tell me how it is so by now.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Excellent acting and writing make this one of the best TV series available. It has a good ongoing story line overlaid by interesting legal problems.
B001IF252M|4.0|Sometimes you will see that the monitor you connect it to will flicker for an instance when you move your mouse. I don't know whether this is related to this adapter or to my MacBook pro.
B00AW28HF6|4.0|Tsunami Connection is an action-packed, political thriller.<br /><br />Kefira, a sleeper agent in Mossad, loses half of her team when an RPG hits their helicopter and explodes into a fiery mess. Determined to find those responsible for the bomber, she tracks down the likely suspects with the assistance of a charismatic team of agents. But, what she learns may be more than she can handle.<br /><br />What I like most about this book are the richly described locations. The author has obviously drawn from extensive research and possibly personal experience to bring them to life. The people, the culture, the details, all work perfectly. The locations I enjoy from the book the most are Canada, Argentina, and Egypt.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this book: terminology, exotic animals, and cultural information. The author defined some of them in the narration, sometimes a few times, but others I had to Google (a lot). Perhaps I'm just not all that well traveled, but in the first several chapters I had to Google every few pages to look up terms like \\"Weaver Stance,\\" which was used to describe how a character was holding a gun. Having to drop out of the book to figure out what the author was talking about, distracted for the story at times, which is probably one of the reasons it seemed choppy and hard to follow in places.<br /><br />The temporal jumps also distracted from the story at times. Sometimes you would flash back to Kefira or Zak's youth or childhood; sometimes, you'd flash back a year, a week, etc. True, the author indicates the date for each chapter as part of the chapter heading, but as I typically disregard chapter headings I'd usually get a few pages in before realizing something was up. Then, I'd have to flip back to see what I missed. It got easier near the end of the story because I learned to pay attention to the cues.<br /><br />The story features several erotic scenes, most of which are way more mechanically detailed than I feel they need to be. I prefer romantic scenes to be just that, romantic. These weren't. It was all about what was going on, very little emotion or feeling. However, that isn't to say there isn't romance. I love the interactions between Kefira and the older Argentinian dancer, very sexy and heartfelt even though the two don't actually get together. I also felt a deep connection between Kefira and Michael. Strangely, the romance between Kefira and Zak felt flat to me. I just didn't emotionally connect with the two of them as a couple, though I liked each as an individual.<br /><br />As for the link to the title, Tsunami Connection, there is mention of a submarine with the capability to produce tsunami's, but I felt the story failed to make a connection between Kefira's activities and the rogue submarine. I believe, and this is a pure guess, that this first book introduces the idea of the submarine, but focuses mostly on background and character development. I expect the next installment in the series to focus on the submarine and stopping it from wreaking havoc in the world.<br /><br />Overall, Tsunami Connection is a meticulously researched political thriller. People who enjoy exotic locations, spy thrillers, or political intrigue might also enjoy this book.<br /><br />I received a complimentary copy of this book in return for an honest, non-reciprocal review.
B0067R0APK|5.0|A great weather app. Easy to read. Great layout and graphics. I tossed all the others away. Most fallout it is accurate.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|I don't believe all the profanity is necessary in order to be entertaining. We didn't get through half of the first episode.
B0030DIP7O|4.0|I've seen some negative views on these Original Album Classics series wherein, some folks think the audio quality on these comp's is less than stellar and the packaging is inferior and cheap. Well this may be true on one hand, but I spent 14 dollars on this collection and it completes my Uli Jon Roth-era Scorpions sets just fine. I'm not a die-hard Scorps fan and I used to own all of these titles on cassette way back when(Fly to the Rainbow and In Trance are my fav's next to Tokyo Tapes), so to upgrade efficiently and also reminisce, I've found these sets to come in handy. I also have Ian Hunter's series(self-titled thru Overnight Angels), of which the two of 3 are ridiculously overpriced as they've yet to be reissued and its much more economically feasable to use these sets if one wants to consolidate their artists' catalogue.<br /><br />In Trance is easily the best out of the 3 discs offered here as the sound of the Scorpions is in a certain 70's hard rock genre that pays homage to the late 60's explosion from artists like Jimi Hendrix, Cream, Mountain and Deep Purple. Uli Jon has always been somewhat of a Hendrix clone but his playing on the title track, Dark Lady, Evening Wind and Longing for Fire proves that he was a great asset and key member to the strength of the Scorpions musical core, along with Rudolf Schenker's in tandem rhythm melodies, Klaus Meine's vocal presence and a solid rhythm section to round out the unified sound. Virgin Killer and Taken by Force are also solid releases and contain great material in the forms of Killer's Catch Your Train and In Your Park or Force's We'll Burn the Sky and the Sails of Charon, for example. But In Trance(along with Fly to the Rainbow) are the best of Uli Jon Scorps to me personally.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie. It was so good in the movie theater and I loving having it on my Kindle so I can watch it whenever and where ever I am.
B000I04044|5.0|Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are delightful in this madcap romantic comedy. Classic Cary. It naturally includes lots of physical humor (though not the Three Stooges variety), mistaken identities, memorable characters and a happy ending.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|What's to say. The show is basically a younger version of friends. And it's AWESOME...5 more words required. lol. balls
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Not as powerful, touching and emotionally granular as past albums, but nevertheless pleasing and a solid addition to the music library!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Happy with the purchase and would definitely buy another in the future. Honestly, I would change the design on the Kindle Fire before I would change the case
1476733953|1.0|It's as if the author started with a great concept, and tried to build a story around it. The idea of the book is cool, but the story just DID NOT keep me interested.<br /><br />The first segment of the book about Holston was fascinating, and it drew me in, but the book goes downhill fast. 3/4 of the book was really boring, and I only got through it because I have a persistence to finish anything I start.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on Doctor Who recently. It is a brilliant show, a great way to get lost in fantasy for a little while.
0307887448|5.0|This book will hurl you into different worlds, make you feel things you haven't felt since being a teenager, give you the drive and mystery only found in adventure, and leave you panting, begging for more.<br /><br />Reading this book is like diving into nostalgia that you didn't know was there. It gives a timeless feeling, that only comes around once every decade or so. Well into the later part of my life, I'm sure I will look back on Ready Player One as one of the best and most exciting books I've read.
0385349947|5.0|This book has been criticized because it's author, a woman of wealth, power, and position, could not possibly know what goes on with \\"real\\" women in the workplace.<br /><br />But only a woman in her position could write this book. Because she has the power to promote, she has a bird's eye view on how men and women act differently when promotions are up for grabs. Because of her powerful position, she is privy to decisions young women make to lean out of their careers, by foregoing plum projects and passing up opportunities, because they might have kids someday. In this insightful book, Sheryl Sandberg writes that these patterns of behavior cause women to step out of the workplace entirely once they do have kids, because by hanging back in all the years before they have families, they do not rise to positions where they can structure reasonable accommodations for themselves as working mothers.<br /><br />God bless Sheryl Sandberg for having the courage to say these things. It can't have been easy. As she notes in her book, studies show, again and again, that women who rise to positions of power are not well-liked, by men or women. I suspect this phenomena is decidedly at work in the criticism of this terrific book.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Horrible picture. Interrupted every couple of minutes. Just gave up. So frustrating. I didn't even finish the movie. I was looking forward to this all week.
B000I0GGSW|2.0|The only part/thing I didn't like was Michael Douglas. I felt he over acted way too much and wasn't natural in his character.<br />His acting was very fake with little true emotional delivery of the character. It wasn't a good role for him.
B002PJL85K|5.0|This is one of the best movies about King Arthur and his Knights you'll ever watch. Although a lot was left out for the sake of keeping this movie short, this is the only movie I've found that kept true to the original story written by Sir Thomas Mallory -- Le Morte D'Arthur. It is not so much an interpretation of Le Morte D'Arthur as it is a depiction. And they couldn't have done a better job. Some of the best movies were made in the eighties. Don't let the release date stop you. It still feels like you are watching a movie which is a good thing. Movies these days are supposed to be HD but really they just feel like raw home video sometimes. The score for this movie will be very familiar. O Fortuna sets the theme quite nicely.
B00136JS12|5.0|I have the LP from the 70's and turned it into an MP3 album but the quality was very poor since I had played it over and over in the 70's, so decided to purchase the MP3 from amazon.  The sound quality is incredible.  It is great to hear it the way it was meant to be heard!
B007C7UZIG|1.0|steam logged me out on my co.pouter and I forgot my password.it also logged me out here no steam for me.

B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Yet again, another excellent record for Blake.  I have to agree with critics...it is some of his best stuff yet.  You can tell he really pushed his own boundries on this one.  Team Blake!
B00933JF74|5.0|I wish my kid had as much interest in his homework as he does this game.  It is fun building a city and designing the layout.  Also watching the towns people interacting is fun too.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The best of the series. A masterwork! Mr. Martin has been called the American Tolkein; I agree. I think that other authors will be compared to him, now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green has truly outdone himself this time. I laughed, I cried~ This book - living in it's own kind of infinity - has indisputably stolen a much larger piece of infinity in not only my heart, but the hearts of countless others. I can not wait to read it again···
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Hey guys this cd is amazing with both songs that are on the radio and ones that I have not heard before and it is just awesome

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I read this book in three days as I couldn't put it down once I had read the first few chapters.  The characters are vivid and come to life as do their feelings. The history of mental illness, slavery, white and black, foods, medical treatment, homes...all jump out to the reader with amazing clarity.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This is the third or forth Dan Brown book I've read and it's another triumph for him. Just the right mix of action and esoterica to keep your interest up.
B009EELBIS|5.0|What more can I say? I sing these songs for days after watching. Nobody does it better than Julie Andrews.
B009GX6600|5.0|Great episode!  This is the Season 10 opener and we finally find out what happened to all the characters after the cliff hanger final episode of Season 9.
1423389387|4.0|Creating a world that is totally within the book, within the realms of fantasy, is something few writers do, and even less achieve with the consumate skill that this writer does. This story is definitely unique and developed like no other. The audio book makes the best of the unique story told here , and is performed  extremely well. With the stated aims of the story, the writer achieves what he goes about achieving, so I have to give full marks for that. As for how I feel about the book, it is not my cup of tea.<br />Well performed, well written, but for me I unfortunately found it deadly dull. Epic in all respects, the book, and so the author, sustains a story in a world of his own, and it shows how much he cares. I , however, do not care for this type of story, even though I tried very hard to get into the flow of the Characters, plots and sub-plots carefully woven together. If you like this author, I suspect that you will enjoy his new-er epic.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As. Always, Vince Flynn comes thru with a great story.  I eagerly await his next book as I have read all that he has written.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I saw the movie at the theater and loved it.  The DVD was just great too.  It's nice to relive the movie whenever I want and to watch it with friends as well.
1844137872|5.0|Easy read, obviously, it's mostly pictures. Banksy is the best artist ever. This book intrigues everyone that visits my living room.
B00338QENI|3.0|After reading the reviews of this book and having been involved in healthcare for over 30 years, I thought I would find this book very interesting.  However, I must rate it a 3.  Perhaps it is because I am not too surprised at anything that happens in the area of research that could be considered unethical both now and in the era before there was required informed consent.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|the game was  good I think that ever one shod get it all dragons are reply cool all the islands and good

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As I said before that Downton Abbey is the best show to come out of the UK since Upstairs Downstairs.  It keeps you wanting more episodes. Would be good if it could be broadcasted on BBC America.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|If you want to get inspired and energized, this book will help you. But it also left me awake at night as I wondered why women keep sabotaging their careers. Your personal ambition level should guide you while you are working right up until the day you stop to raise a family. For me, that is part of the enjoyment of working.  But many women are not even trying to climb the career ladder because they expect to have a family one day. Also, reading that most men are hired for their potential, while many women are hired because they have done the same type of work in the past, made me angry! I cannot tell you how many times I have heard interviewers ask if I have ever done that exact work before, and if I had, I am asked if I have done it in that same industry. I would not be interested in a job exactly like one I have had in the past. I would be bored to tears. Currently, I am having difficulty finding a position that holds a challenge. We have not come as far on the equality scale as many think. Rise up women! Don't be afraid of failure!
1416550534|2.0|First of all, this slog, I mean saga, fails in comparison to Downton Abbey, which others have compared it to. I always stick with a book because eventually it may grab my interest. This one, sadly, never did. I tried however, going back three times, wishing it to come alive for me. But I just couldn't stay with it, boredom would set in, my mind would start to wander, the words would begin to blur, and the next thing I knew I wouldn't know what she was talking about again, nor did I care.  I found myself reading the same passages over and over, grasping at something, anything, to hold my interest.  I know, this is harsh, but I read all of the time and this never, ever, happens. This book is certainly not for everyone.
B003G4W4CY|5.0|Major spoilers in the introduction, wait till after you finish the book to read it. The story itself is awsome.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good puzzles, fun game. Great spooky atmosphere, especially if you play it late at night with the lights off. $5, but I considered it worth it.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Was great read, if you loved or liked her other books,  have read them all and would recommend this<br /> Wendy
B0067AC5KA|4.0|The setting and meticulous descriptions make this a worthy read.  Love the faulted characters and the intricate story.  Definitely held my interest!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show! I had never seen this show before and when I saw it I figured I'd watch an episode or two and that would be it. I figured wrong! I just started watching it about four days ago and I'm almost through the second season! I love it!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This season was full of twists and turns that keeps wanting more. The actors are better than ever. A must see for every Fringe fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love whoever came up with this game! I would rate it 5,000,000 stars if I could. It's really cool how the location that you play in changes every month. I was really addicted this month because I was trying to get the new girl, Kim.<br /><br />I suggest this game to everyone including hobos!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|There are over 750 Amazon reviews already written on this book and the vast majority found Harold Frye very enjoyable. I'm solidly in that camp. I found the book to be unique, thought provoking, and what an interesting journey!!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love this show. Travis Fimmel is doing a great job playing Ragnar Lothbrok. Thank you History Channel for another great series.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Absolutely amazing book, brilliantly written. One of my favorite novels, along with a few of his other books. Definitely recommend
B000P0J0D8|5.0|Besides Mobsters this is one of my favorite Christian Slater movies. I thought he did a great job with this movie. I definitely would recommend it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|But then I realized that I did odd things while reading the book. As in, Waking up at 5 and 6 am just to get an early start of my day Reading this book! and Reading it every chance I got. I thought it was only a 4 star book at first. Then after a week , and then some months I really missed the book and wished it hadn't ended. I was completely hooked and didn't even know it! This book is Amazing! I still think about how awesome this book is.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|One of the best mob movies I have seen other than the Godfather. Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci and Ray Liotta were great together. I definitely would recommend this movie to anyone who has not seen it you will not be disappointed.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was doing a lot of Homework for the last month of the College Semester, and I needed a quick short fantasy break. This book was really Great for that. I really enjoyed it and the Magic was cool too. This is my first Sanderson book but definetely not my last. Speaking of which, should I start the Wheel of Time series? or should I avoid it?
B001QD5OSS|5.0|I love this movie and  it is one of Johnny Depp's best movies. I thought he was fantastic in this movie and I definitely give it a thumbs up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome.  Ready to begin the third one. Loved the the first one and can't wait for the second movie to be out in November!!
B005FITIDC|3.0|I admire director Marc Forster a lot, especially after the brilliant \\"Finding Neverland\\". He seems to long for the appreciation of misunderstood persons, and is usually successful. His James Bond effort left me a little baffled, but \\"Machine Gun Preacher\\", despite its crazy title, just didn't work for me. I'm thinking the main problem was Gerard Butler, who was either hot or sweet, and there wasn't much grey area. Michelle Monaghan and Michael Shannon were reliable in their respective roles, but our protagonist was never really convincing as a good person.<br /><br />The plight of the poor kids was the most interesting element, but everything else about the film left me wanting more. Mr Childers may be a fine man, but standing beside a church doesn't make you a Christian any more than standing in a field makes you a farmer. Childers' transformation was superficial, at best, and needed more explanation to make this viable to a thinking person.<br /><br />I saw a film about a confused, misdirected guy who was looking for his next rush. He didn't seem to know how to be his own man.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is the finest show on TV and GRRM's books should be required reading in schools. I only buy the complete seasons and watch the first two at least three times a month..thats how good it is.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Breathe taking I'm absolute in awe with this trilogy I can't put it down. I've even got my fiancee hooked...
1405020458|5.0|My son adores this book and once I am done reading he is &#34;I want to read it again&#34; Just a great book Also we bought the movie.  In the movie they did an awesome job to keep the story almost side b side of the book.  By far one of the best stories, that has a moral for the kids.I will strongly recommend this!
B006LSZECO|5.0|GONE GIRL: A great read! I really enjoyed it. The type of book one can't put down. Definitely recommend it.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Again, Mr Jackson brings a wonderful adaptation to the screen.  Rich in character and true enough to the original book to be enjoyed by bookworm and moviegoer alike.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0063IH60K|2.0|Very easy to play.  and the game works as it is supposed to.  Would recommend it to anyone who likes soltaire.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What can I say, A love story for the gal's and weapons for the guy's. I will probably buy this one on DVD because my boy's loved it.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|I bought this app from my computer for my kindle. Couldn't find it to install it. Since I couldn't find it, I don't know if it's any good or not. I'd love to use it if I could find it and install it.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw this movie with my girl and i enjoyed it as much as i do. Its a great movie and the condition and prompt delivery was excellent.
0439023513|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I would recommend it to ANYONE who has read The Hunger Games, and Catching Fire. Even if you have seen the movie, go back and read the books! It is so worth it. Reading the way these people live is interesting but horrible all at the same time. Seeing how they progress with the way they are treated, and how they work to change it is makes you not able to put the book down. Don't hesitate to plunge in!
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Omg! i was so happy to be able to review what happened during this season.  I am happy i recieved it so quickly and in good condition.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who saw the X-Men movies. The explanation of how Wolverine got to be how he was was interesting and creative!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|use it for journaling but not much else yet. Don't like the audio aspects, however and can't find how to cut it off
0439023491|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I would recommend it to ANYONE who has read The Hunger Games. Even if you have seen the movie, go back and read the books! It is so worth it.

B004SDEP38|3.0|Have not become familiar enough with it yet to see how it can be useful to me-too much time to rate
1592402690|5.0|in short, this is an tremendously enjoyable book. Personally, I find the true quality of books that comprise the genre 'historical music biography', depend on an inscrutable component that I define as 'texture'. A simple, linear recitation of historical facts/events do not cut the evocative mustard: one must feel like one was 'there' . Geoff Emerick has written a book of wonderful texture. Reading his recollections, I felt I was there at the Abbey Road studio where, from  1962 to 1970, four lads from Liverpool held court, recording absolutely seminal albums of an era.  The vicissitude of the social change occurring in that time, the impact of these on the four band members -as individuals and interactively-make for an immensely enjoyable read. Five stars.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|This is a great story about how we struggle with love and love finally wins....I love romantic stories they help me to stay postive in a world that somes seems glim when it comes to love.  It is also a powerful story about how important it is for a woman to love herself first....
B000FA675C|5.0|I love this book and have almost finished reading it for the third time. Very well written and gives quite a bit of history on the Holy Grail. Dan Brown is a great author and I can't wait for his next book to come out in May.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Fun to have this shopping and search app right at my finger tips. Now I can just look up any item I am tempted to pay retail for and see if I can buy it on eBay
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|One of the best books ever. Other than warriors, gotta read those.<br />Must read great awesome book .I've gotta read cabin fever next
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those you can't put down and when it ends your're disappoointed that the end has come.
B00003CX9W|5.0|Thank you so very much. It was all I hoped it would be. It was in perfect condition and it was a &#34;fantasmic&#34; way for me to introduce classical music to my students. They loved it and have lesrned to listen to music & place pictures or a story to it. Thanks again for not letting me or my students down.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|If you're a fan of Jeff Lynne from his days as the lead singer of and creative force behind 1970s super-group Electric Light Orchestra (ELO), or from his work as a producer on the solo albums of his fellow Traveling Wilburys George Harrison, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty in the late 1980s/early 1990s (this is how I first learned of Lynne), then this album is an absolute must-have.<br /><br />This CD is a collection of covers of 11 early rock and pre-rock standards that influenced Lynne over long-wave radio when he was growing up in Birmingham, England, from artists as diverse as The Everly Brothers, Chuck Berry, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.<br /><br />The disc is a testament to Lynne's formidable studio production prowess, as evidenced by the fact that Lynne performs lead and background vocals and plays electric and acoustic guitars, bass, keyboards, and drums (as he also does on Mr. Blue Sky: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra, his recently released rerecording of ELO's greatest hits). Additional musicians contribute strings and shakers and percussion.<br /><br />Every track is brilliant, but Lynne's renditions of Charles Aznavour's \\"She,\\" \\"Smile\\" (co-written by Charlie Chaplin), \\"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,\\" and \\"Beyond the Sea\\" are simply stunning. My favorite is \\"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,\\" which is truly a revelation. Lynne's vocals are as sprightly as ever (especially amazing considering that Lynne was 63 to 64 years old when he recorded the CD two to three years ago) and the guitar work is superb. Overall, the album proves how underrated Lynne is as a passionate, earnest vocalist and sensitive, thoughtful guitarist.<br /><br />Even if you're not a fan of or are not acquainted with Jeff Lynne, you should strongly consider adding this CD to your playlist. It is captivating, enthralling, and mesmerizing. It is one of the best albums of all time.
0385349947|2.0|I ordered the new version of this book and this is my first time buying a new book form amazon and it turned out to be not clean. The binding of the pages were not neat and clean, some of the pages has more width and some of them shorter. So I didn't like the book's condition but since I wanted to read the book ASAP I didn't return it.

B000FA675C|5.0|This book is a must read for everyone, if you have only seen the movie then you are missing out. As great a film as it was you get so much more insight and interesting details from the book, no matter how many times I read it I'm always finding somethong new and 'on the edge of my seat'.

B002X3V4P2|5.0|I've been an Enya fan for quite some time but with the switch to CD's (or even tape cassettes) to MP3, I haven't got to transfer all my music. But for the price ($3) I didn't hesitate to get the Best of Enya. It's a lovely album with a nice mix of her work.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|my son plays this and loves it. its another great game for the kindle and great for traveling time and fun
B008YUNDJS|3.0|Has not aged well. Know a lot of people read it but honestly, better books out there. Get some other negotiation books

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Follett manages to give us a little history, a little romance, a little sex, and a very good read!  My husband and I both are enjoying this series.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|was down loaded on accident and never played it i think my son did it sure its a great game
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Sometimes when you hear a lot of hype about a book, your expectations are very high.  I enjoyed reading this book, but it didn't blow me away in the least.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|i use this every day the only down fall is if you have your volume low, you wont hear it
1476733953|3.0|first half A.  second half C.  overall rating C+.  when the mechanics went to &#34;war&#34; against IT - it just seemed to fall apart to me.<br />they were very passive people.  you would think they would negotiate over this as they had control of the power down below.<br />so many different ways he could have gone with this story.  seemed to fall part to me.  i will say it is addictive and I could not stop reading it and had to finish it but overall was a little disappointed.  I am sure he will revisit this and there will be more.  the girl heroine Jules -  in the beginning she seemed like a hard ass but seemed passive and knuckled under to the IT head.  I would have expected her to take a strong stand.  so that disappointed me too.  i slowly cam to find myself agreeing with head of IT and could understand his blind obedience to the manuals.  doubt the rebels could govern themselves with a leader like him.  I wish they would have expanded on what happened to cause the silo's to be built.  what transpired in the past.  sort of like the time machine when the morlocks went underground and the eloi stayed above ground

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Hard to stop watching. After you finish one episode you want to move right on to the next. Downton Abbey is like a book you can't put down.
098555780X|5.0|Very well illustrated and easy to follow  I enjoyed the book & would reorder again.  I would recommend the book.
0307476073|3.0|This was the first of Cheryl Strayed's pieces I've read. I found it riveting yet difficult to read (I completely skipped over the part about the family horse...I knew that wasn't going to end well). I found it difficult because of the tragic mistakes she kept making over and over again. I found it riveting because it was exciting to observe someone sorting things out in their life. The metaphor of \\"Monster\\" the backpack wasn't lost on me either.<br /><br />I was bothered a little about how she was so 'boy crazy' and wrote about how so many men were lusting after her. It was as if she was using men to validate herself which unfortunately so many young women do. I was disappointed that she hadn't worked through that or had even seen that part of her personality at the conclusion of the book. Instead of bonding with the other women she met along the PCT, she focused on the men on the trail and her attraction to them and other non-hiker men she met along the way. I found this a little disturbing.<br /><br />Instead of feeling happy her trip was over at the end of the book, I was relieved and genuinely hoping that she'd start making better decisions in the future. Apparently she has. With age comes wisdom.<br /><br />I do admire her courage (or was it youthful ignorance?) in her quest to hike the PCT. It was a good book that I looked forward to reading!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I absolutely loved it, there's so much going on but yet not enough! Can't wait till the next season comes out it's going to be AWESOME!!
B0057UA4FY|5.0|My family and I love Star Wars the Clone Wars.  We've seen all 5 seasons and own all of them.  We can't wait until season 5 come out on DVD.  It's a series that both adults and children can watch together and enjoy!!!!

B001GQSY5K|5.0|I love Star Wars: The Clone Wars. I watched the complete seasons before I discovered the movie.  It really connected some things together between Episode II and the cartoon series.  The whole series is something that adults and children can enjoy together.  I know that we lived for Saturday mornings during season 5!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Nice clarity, ease to use interface..Glad to have the original series in Remastered HD.<br />We should have more of these for the Movie series as well..

B008602KQI|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie and FINALLY had a chance to see it. Read the book so it was fun to see how the movie conveyed scenes though I was a bit disappointed -- they could have easily covered just a little more and made the movie easier to follow for those who haven't read the books. For example, they could have developed the relationship between Cat and Cinna. In all, I really liked it but was glad I read the series!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I enjoy this show when I need something a little more slow paced.  That's not a bad thing.  Some days you just don't want a lot of fast moving and shooting in your t.v. show.  I love the banter between the characters.  The Post Mistress is my favorite character.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is one of the reasons I love the BBC! The Brittish are the absolute masters of how a period drama should be written! Plenty of emotion, feeling, and great story lines! Not like the filth they put out here
B005DJREJS|1.0|Apply named.  Awkward to watch. Typical, sad fantasy of high school.  While the idea may seem entertainment, the delivery and content was tacky.
B008N1LL42|1.0|This will be my first and perhaps only movie review and I'll tell you exactly why below. When you're 5 minutes into a flick and you're saying to yourself..this better improve quickly, you know that it's just going to get worse.<br /><br />I was infuriated after wasting my time watching this flick. I thought to myself...Hey, Liam Neeson is in this movie. It can't be too bad, right? WRONG! I honestly think he just showed up for the paycheck here. And considering that he is well off and not hard up for the dough, he should be ashamed of himself. I saw John Carradine in some major stinkers but I can forgive him because he actually needed the money. Now that we've come to the conclusion that this is by far THE worst film Liam Neeson has been in, we shall continue.. This film is everything that is wrong with modern, mainstream American films! They insult our intelligence on so many levels it's ridiculous. Heck, I've had more enjoyment watching bad 80's slashers than this dreck! I can usually turn my brain off with crap like this but not with this particular film. This was like watching one of those \\"made for the SyFy channel flicks\\" with a huge budget and better special effects. All the worst labels apply to this film basically. Formulaic, generic, manufactured sappiness, bad rock music(they could have at least had Bon Scott era AC/DC!), Overacting, mindless action with no point, overblown special effects and explosions that try to divert you from the lack of any cohesive story, etc..etc.. I can usually forgive one or two of these aspects being attributed to said film in question but this stinker has practically no redeeming value. Unless you're the primitive type that likes to watch rednecks light fireworks for hours on end.<br /><br />And what was up with the cheesy patriotism where we are always the good guys? I felt like I was watching another Conservative propaganda flick like \\"Red Dawn\\". What is this? A recruitment vehicle for the military? Macho indoctrination forthe naive and easily led? And this movie so disrespects WW11 veterans by making them robots that won't question any of the orders they are being given. How about a bit more humanity and intelligence from these characters. My grandfathers who DID fight in WW11 would have been offended by how the veterans are portrayed in this flick. As mere canon fodder for all the awful aspects that films like this represent. If movies like this and bad reality shows continue to grow in popularity, there is absolutely no hope for the future of America. We will become a mindless, consumer society where very few have individual thought, perception, and intellect. And that is exactly what the corrupt among us want. \\"1984\\". It's an excellent book and a warning to us. Should be required reading in high schools all across this Nation.<br /><br />And now my parting words. Peter Berg should never be allowed to direct again(or at least he should take his name off this flick and apply the Alan Smithee tag) and who ever wrote this script should be prohibited from ever writing ANYTHING! They say a flick like \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" is one of the worst movies ever. I so disagree with this assessment. It's movies like \\"Battleship\\" which are the worst films. At least \\"Plan 9\\" was amusing, funny, and didn't take itself seriously. I at least can get SOME entertainment value out of that. Not with \\"Battleship\\" however. This movie was so bad, it was just BAD!!! If you haven't seen this flick, the best advice I can give you is to avoid it at all costs. You can do so much better when it comes to \\"Alien invasion\\" films. And no, I'm not talking about \\"Independence Day\\" either. Start with one of the best that has a great message and intelligent story. A flick that doesn't glorify the military/industrial complex. That being the original \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\"(1951). Hollywood today could learn alot from classic films like this. Stop dumbing us down, so you can make more profit! Thanks for reading.If I saved one person from seeing \\"Battleship\\", I will consider this review a job well done! Plus, check rottentomatoes.com and imdb.com for more well deserved, negative reviews of this atrocious waste of money.
B004DM1ZQY|1.0|a poor advanced game.  ok for beginners and intermediate level players but the programs logic for accepting doubles_, its end game logic and bearing off logistic is poor.  Easy to beat in a 5 or 7 point match.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|After seeing the movie, I was inspired to read the Book. I found the movie,while fair to the book, did not capture its depth and intensity. The book's ending was most provocative and challenging. I found the book held my interest throughout.

B003Y5H5FG|2.0|***Warning spoiler alert***<br /><br />Wow!  There are so many things I disliked about this movie I don't really know where to begin.<br /><br />The movie just jumps in with little story, or character development.  The diologue is lame with ridiculous, unnecessary, sexual references every other line.  The neighborhood setting is boring, with cookie cutter houses.  The plot has holes big enough to drive a fleet of trucks through.  Young kids are missing and the cops only show up briefly in one scene.  Come on!  Evil Ed, Peter Vincent, and even Charlie Brewster are horribly written characters.  Jerry Dandridge never met a neck he didn't like.  I mean, he could have just brutally killed some of his enemies, not sucked every single one.  Stupid!  I only liked two things about this movie: Colin Farrell, and the cameo with Chris Sarandon.  Farrell plays the villan well, even with his lousy diologue, and really projects menace and evil.  It was also good to see Chris Sarandon again, even if his scene was mediocre.<br /><br />Both the original Fright Night, and the sequel Fright Night 2, are much better movies.  I don't know what is happening to Hollywood these days.  What ever happened to quality writing, and telling an interesting story?  I know that the horror genre is not exactly Shakespeare, but there is a suck limit for me.  No pun intended.  This movie pretty much reached it, and I'm sorry I bought it.
B006MNTT74|4.0|If you can't go to the stage show, this this great.  A gift for our granddaughter's birthday instead of the live show she couldn't attend.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|If you like Philippa Gregory books and love British history, you will enjoy The Kingmaker's Daughter. As usual, the characters come to life so vividly. The family intrigue spellbinding. I look forward to the next book in this genre by Gregory.
B000SEJHRA|3.0|After reading all the reviews on Amazon. I was very excited to read the book. The first few chapters was genius and outstandingly comical. But when Sedaris entered into his years of drug addiction, college, and art, he completely lost me. I tried to pick up the book a couple of days later to give it another chance, but I could not digest anymore of it. Engulfed in Flames was one of those books I could not put down, I thought I would of had the same reaction with this book. I just wanted to give you the heads up.
1935597760|5.0|I guess it seems, after reading many of the reviews, that I would be redundant if I said that this was one of \\"the best books I have ever read!\\", however, it most certainly was. My wish for people who have not read this book, is that they will press \\"buy it\\" and just give it a go. You will not be sorry. I was taken to a place that I have never been, yet felt that I wanted to get to know it better and better. The introduction to the main character, Jamie, will draw you in, not because he is an accident on the road that you cannot look away from, but because you need to know more about him, his life, why he continues to get out of bed and why we want to know how he is going to become a human being...a human being that is fulfilled in his own way. What a beautifully written, sometimes horrible story of a man and his friends and his life. I have heard that a film may or may not be coming...please, please let this be true! Enjoy.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book is yet another intricately woven story that adds more suspense to the series. Unsurpassed character development and detail.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it. Would read it again. In fact I do 're read some parts because I liked it so much.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Its a clean play style and its easy to see whats going on like torchlight buts its a fun hack and slash with quick fealing that you are better then the opponent, feels a bit unbalanced but fun
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This remake seems like a cross between the mentalist and house but adds some of its own quirkiness that makes you come back for more
6300182193|4.0|I saw this movie at the movie theater back in 1979. I liked Frank Langella because I felt that he had an air of sensuality about him. And he does.  ( I was almost 9 months pregnant when I went to see this movie in 1979) He was a handsome man. It is a good Dracula movie....but has a few yukkie parts where they show a little blood and stuff...but Frank is suave and sophisticated and handsome.  Good Dracula movie. I had to own it. He is sexy. :)

0802473156|5.0|My husband and I found this book to be very informative and helpful.  The price was reasonable, and the book was easy to understand and didn't take a long time to read.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I especially liked the book because Dr. Alexander used medical information to prove that what he experienced was not caused by hallucination or misfiring neurons.  He confirms that God's love is unconditional and that the universe is beyond human understanding.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|A GREAT ALBUM, I LISTENED TO THREE TIMES THROUGH. IF YOUR NOT AN ASIA FAN TRY THIS ONE. LOTS OF DIFFERENT TEMPOS AND WIDE VAROETY OF INSTRUMENTS MAKES THE MUSIC VERY ENTERTAINING. BUY IT....
B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I love Torchwood! I love it even more when I can watch it for free!!! Definitely not a show for children, but adults will love it.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I like this game even if it is like most of the solitaire game I play.  I just like a change in the cards.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantabulous, fantabulous, fantabulous, there is no other way to describe this book.  I loved this story can't wait to read 2 and 3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was happy to be able to receive the Bible on my kinkle because it makes it easy to hop to the bible any time I choose to take time to read it before or after I read or play games on it.  This is an easy way for people to read the bible instead of taking time to go to where you have the Bible laying in your home.  The Kindle Bible is fast to bring up and you can choose different ways of studying it too.  Enjoy as I will enjoy reading the Bible.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Heavy foreshadowing. Predictable ending based on family history, and limited character development...read it through to see if plot developed as expected..
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wow, what an amazing, twisted, edge if your seat attention getter!! Well done E L JAMES!!! Please give me more!!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Not much to say other than these movies are awesome! The package was beautiful and fits nice in my Blu-ray cabinet.
B005JU5JEI|5.0|Love, love this movie! Cameron Diaz does such a good job playing a teacher who doesn't care and does everything wrong.
B0096A9QXC|5.0|these games are just too fun and addicting. I think the frog is so cute and the sounds they make are funny.Great for for kids and adults.
B0007MWZEK|4.0|It is very light, but strong enough to do the job on my laminate floor in my mid-size family room.  I do prefer this original model over the recent model for its sturdiness.  Do not charge over 8 hours.  Charger does not have indicator light on nor automatically shut off.  This is a very good product that we use daily for our family room.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|i thought this would be fun, but i could not get him to do what the description said he would do, and it was just dumb.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Used to watch the original as a kid. Found the new one, and it is just as good. My 11 years old daughter is delighted by it, good TV and educational.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|The authenticity was amazing.  Daniel Day-Lewis gave an outstanding performance.  He definitely deserved the Oscar.  He is one of my favorite actors.
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|Was able to get this disc for almost $2 less than Walmart. My 3 year old niece loved it!  Plus it had the appearance of Cinderella!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is the second time to see Hunger Games.  Jennifer Lawrence is truly an amazing talent for someone so young!
B000LGOPW2|5.0|I just love this adaptation and enjoy the portrayal of the characters very much.  Visually it is just fantastic and moody as well!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Very cute but no skill required. I got bored after a few minutes. Probably better for younger crowd. I wouldn't buy it again.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|God knows why Amazon/Sirus have not ported the Sirius application I run on my Android Phone to the Kindle Fire - negligence on both their parts - I used this application to help me install the app directly on my Kindle and it's been working fine - A good utlility
B000FA675C|5.0|I have always wanted to read &#34;Da Vinci Code&#34; and was excited to be able to get it on my Kindle.  Great BOok
B008XO7X4G|5.0|I have seen this many times - all I think about how there is no way this movie could be made today - Though this is a classic, it's a little slow in the beginning but the last 20-30 minutes make up for it.,...
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a fun summer romance for reading on the beach or while waiting for time to pass or anytime.
B0041VT6HW|3.0|While Jonah Hex could have potentially been a wonderful series Franchise for DC Comics, whoever makes the script/directing decisions on most of their films needs to be replaced.  There is an entire mind set about DC films that Marvel has managed to get past (true, their Hulk franchises have been weak at best and while I enjoyed their Fantastic Four movies for the characters, they suffered from some of DC's scripting/directing weaknesses which is why that series died despite wonderful actors).<br /><br />Westerns aren't that popular in the first place, but creepy, metaphysical stuff was hot about the time this movie came out.  But the producers/studio focused on the least interesting aspects of a magical western that they could.  Also, I think casting the lead that they did for Jonah Hex was a mistake because he didn't make a very exciting or dynamic Jonah!  It was like a made-for-TV movie in terms of actors and acting (that's usually where I see our lead at and he's Syfy Channel quality).<br /><br />As a fan of the comics and weird westerns more particularly, this missed the mark.  We pick a B grade actor and expect an A grade quality film?  Come on DC, wake up and learn from the successes of your competitors with Iron Man and the Avengers (okay, so Captain America and Thor were successful even if they weren't my favorites in the recent films).  Jonah Hex should have been another Wolverine, but he was gruff but without any pizzazz.  If you're on the borderline about renting/buying this, make sure you won't regret the cost because it wasn't that great.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Red Tails tells the story of the first all black fighter squadron in WWII. The movie will touch your heart and make you see that color makes no difference at all. We are all one people - Americans. All of the action scenes are really good too.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|I don't know why comedians and other funny people like pushing humor to the point of NOT FUNNY. I am glad I watched it but wouldn't watch it again.
B009R659L8|1.0|This was not one of her best works. Characters you don't care about. Bland writing. A big disappointment.<br />Disjointed story
B0091REZMW|3.0|good game but locked up my cell phone and freezes up my kindle. still needs some issues fixed on it.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is not my favorite Tegan & Sara album -- it is my favorite album, period. I have listened to it 35+ times and I'm not tired of it. I'll listen to one song, and think, \\"yep, that's definitely my favorite.\\" Then the next song comes on, and I say, \\"no, wait, that's my favorite.\\" Because they're all so good! Out of 12 tracks (including the two deluxe tracks), there's one song I'd rate short of five stars (\\"Shock to Your System\\"). There's simply no other album I have come across that is this consistently amazing. There's a lushness to the sound; it surrounds you as you listen. More pop than their old stuff? More mainstream? I can't say I care; if I like it, I like it, and man do I like it.
B0086700CM|4.0|it is a great game with long periods of time taken out of your hands. great game. it just needs amazon circle :/
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this is better than the normal soap opera. Loved to see the growth of the characters, took an unexpected twist
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I've been wanting to submit a review of this \\"product\\" for some time, but I'm on kind of a hiatus at Amazon because of continuing health problems. Besides, I've thought, the over 100 one star reviews have said it all better than I could, perhaps. The \\"majority\\" of reviews and reviewers give this drek a high rating, but I'm only left to wonder, how many of these \\"positive\\" reviews (or 2-4 sentences thumbs way up) are even \\"real.\\" I have written reviews on movies I've loved and movies I've hated, and I know there are usually very few \\"helpful\\" votes for bad reviews of a supposed \\"fan favorite.\\" Or is it \\"fan-boy?\\"  So, i write this, knowing full well, that the folks who actually like this film, will dismiss my dismissal of this cinematic garbage, I write on.  At the very least, try to see this and fully digest it, before wasting money on it.<br /><br />I watched the very first Star Trek at 11 years old with my 14 year old brother and my dad of 43. We watched it on some big ugly Dumont black and white screen, and all three of us agreed it was first rate and \\"too good for television.\\" Dad died a year later. And the show, the year after that.  Me and my brother were always \\"space\\" or \\"sci-fi\\" fans growing up. We used to talk out loud to each other before going to sleep about \\"what if\\" and such.  This night time banter was heavily influenced by the actual times we were living in.  Apollo, MaN ON THE MOON, 2001 the movie, the cultural and social turmoil of the late 60's-early70's.  The hopelessness of the Vietnam war times and struggling somehow to be enlightened and enlightening.  I miss Jimmy Carter!  Times, hoping to lead to a more hopeful time and awakening, and spirit.  To boldly go where no one has gone before.  Everything Star Trek up until this time and this BAD movie, it seems has always had a positive, hopeful root, but not with this CRAP.  This film is true Devo...<br /><br />There were/was a few minor and major fan movements back in the day to get something close to the original show on the air again, but TV had gone \\"All in the Family\\" type stuff, cheap, video B4 a live audience, sensationalism for its sake, and horrible original sci-fi, cheap, unimaginative shows trying to replace the likes of Twilight Zone, Outer Limits, and the original STAR TREK (during the Lost in Space Dayz).  The original series end, me and my brother and millions of fans planet-wise, we hated. It wouldn't die however. Years after the original, an animated series, featuring the voices of the original crew.  Then Star Wars hit (and to a less extent, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), and there was a rush of big budget sci fi aimed at the studios.  It is indeed ironic that Star Wars and Star Trek are linked in this way.  The first studio big bux release of \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" made a lot of money, but was a critical failure (although I still think of it as the best ST movie ever, and my brother will attest to this, in writing if necessary).  But it was just successful enough to engender sequels.<br /><br />There were many good Star Trek movies after this, some a lot better than others, but it WAS \\"Star Trek.\\" There were many good Star Trek TV series later (my fave is Voyager), some a lot better than others, but it WAS \\"Star Trek.\\" What then is this Star Trek 2009 or Star Trek 11 or the JJ Abrams version (funny how they even co-opted the whole brand name of Star Trek, without a subtitle or mention, let alone praise or due honor to Roddenbarry's original vision)?  JJ Abrams' \\"Star Trek\\" is garbage.  The people who made and promote this and the upcoming sequel (\\"Star Blechh 2013: More schleck from the schmuck JJ\\") , have nothing to do with Star Trek.  JJ Abrams was the totally WRONG choice for this or a sequel as director (which he generally sux at), and this really has nothing to do in even a remotely way, IMHO related to the words \\"Star Trek.<br /><br />This movie is total garbage from beginning to end.  Constantly shaking cameras, unfocused and/or jiggily character head/shoulder shots, lens flares everywhere, totally unappealing and phony \\"camera reaction\\" shots, aka, unwarranted \\"zoom\\" and oh why go on?  This film is totally illogical and awful from first frame to last.  It looks like it was shot in a Bed Bath n Beyond, or IKEA.  Did I mention the former \\"look up to\\" characters of Kirk, Spock, McCoy, and the rest are all reduced to unpleasant peeps?  Like, just, in general?  Getting drunk on future Budweiser, accidental female breast grabs, species sexual interractions between earthlings and Vulcans.  The old Spock and the new Spock.  Total Screenwriting 101 ERROR, the young Kirk and his apple, and all the rest of the stereotypes supposedly based upon the original ideas and characters.  It's a crime.  Is this really a comedy?<br /><br />Bottom line is, this really should not be called Star Trek because it is an alternate universe Star Trek, which is also known as LACK OF IMAGINATION.  This is an insult to everything Star Trek!  And the SFX?  Totally forgettable because most last a few frames and it's apparent this was a cost-saving measure.  When I first saw this, I couldn't believe any movie could come close to this close in being, so bad, based upon an established and successful movie/tv franchise. Unless it was a movie TRYING to be bad (camp, parody, satire, etc.).  But this one's not.  JJ and crew are serious?  Paramount, this is serious?  So this is what it's all basically come down to?  For the love of...  For so many reasons,  this is just such an insult to anything, EVER even remotely associated with anything previously to do with the words, \\"Star Trek.\\"<br /><br />It saddens me to think anyone really likes this at all, let alone can pretend to care enough to pretend to rationally explain why. This is so anti-Star Trek.  This is so illogical and so corporate.  And mark my words, go ahead, mark 'em, JJ will do to Star Wars what he did with Star Trek.  Jeez.  This movie is a total mess, and a total waste of time. What saddens me most however is that a sequel from JJ is about to be released, and no doubt it will be more will pull in the bucks from impressionable, albeit misguided youth (with an expendable income). And then go on to make big profits for all involved in this with more money-grubbing that's really all the sequel of this, or others, will ever engender.This is the end of the franchise alright, beyond it there was only Kurtz...used and/or jiggily character head/shoulder shots, lens flares everywhere, totally unappealing and phony \\"camera reaction\\" shots, aka, unwarranted \\"zoom\\" and oh why go on?

B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love lucy in anything I've seen her in. This character has a lot of depth and I like the process of peeling the onions back on these two.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love all tycoon like games, and this is by far my favorite.  It is a fast pace game, and I believe it would be fun for all ages, especially if you like games where you build towns and get new creatures.  Also, awesome graphics and games that you can play through out the game.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|started out better than the finish but it was fun and entertaining. liked the strong female influencing characters. i would get another season
B0076794IO|5.0|I really liked this book.  I am an expat and I can relate to a lot of the humdrum stuff the heroine went through moving from country to country, though, thankfully, I did not have exactly the same problems.<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable book.
0525478817|5.0|Wonderfully written and eloquently expressed.  The style was... humorous and yet morose and almost cynical at times.  I enjoyed it immensely and look forward to Mr. Green's next publication.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|How does one even begin to write a review for a book like this? Being that Slammed and Point of Retreat are two of my all-time favorite books ever, I went into Hopeless with incredibly high expectations. I was in no way what so ever disappointed. I devoured this book in one sitting and nothing and no one could keep me from reading. I'm pretty sure I angered the majority of my family because I snapped at them every time they tried to get my attention while I was reading this book.<br /><br />At this point I don't even know what I can say about this book that hasn't already been said. It is incredible. It broke my heart over and over again, but I still loved every single minute of it. This is one of the most emotional books I have ever read. I laughed, I cried, I smiled, I ugly sobbed, I sighed, and then I cried some more. I just wanted to make everything better for these characters and it broke my heart because I couldn't fix them.<br /><br />Sky and her circumstances just broke me down. I absolutely loved this girl and her strength and her determination. Not everyone could have survived what she did. She is the definition of resilient and I don't think there is anything else I can say.<br /><br />Then we have Holder who really gave Will Cooper a run for his money and I love Will Cooper. I am going to cross book references here and say that Holder is butterflying amazing. He is so incredibly passionate and just wonderful. The way he loves Sky is so beautiful. Also he is witty and I love a witty character.<br /><br />This book has so many twists and turns that I never knew what to expect. So many different things happen that it is hard to believe that all of these terrible things could occur to these two people. Just when one twist is dropped on you another one pops up a few chapters later. The hurt just kept piling up until it was almost too much.<br /><br />With that being said, the story was also beautiful. Watching these two fall in love was so heartwarming. To see these two broken people come together and begin to heal one another... I just don't have words to fully express how much I enjoyed experiencing their story. It was the beauty in a world full of crap.<br /><br />Hopeless is an emotional journey that I am so incredibly glad I experienced. There is no way I will ever shake Holder and Sky and I do not want to. This book dug its way under my skin and it is so clear why so many people love it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp helps to rid the world of another set of miserable people. It is great light reading. White hat/ black hat depictions are a little too perfect, but the story and the twists keep things moving.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|Bon jovi still rocks! U won't be disappointed esp if you have always even a fan. New but still going strong
B000I0QL82|5.0|Must have this DVD for Christmas atmosphere. Bing sings White Christmas way before the movie White Christmas was made. Love it, love the Holiday Inn farm and the storyline.
0811879542|5.0|I sent it straight to my nieces across the country so I only saw the video of them with it. They looked completely captivated by it. So clever, so imaginative! Who knew paper medium could be this interactive!
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Jimmy Stewart deserves to win a ton of Oscars for this tear-jerker &#34;Christmas time&#34; movie. Some think that it is depressing watching him being erased from existence, but he soon learns how important he was, as he touched the lives of everyone in town.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I loved this game; finished it.  It makes you think strategically but is packaged as a cute kid's game.  Adults will be hooked for sure,
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A world so familiar yet so foreign. The strength of the heroine. The horror of the big lie. The question - how did it all happen? You will never look at an IT department the same way again!!
B008PUXMP2|3.0|Only one album was any good to me.  Amy has done so many great songs, they could have<br />picked better ones to be included in this package.  I love her voice.  Such a terrible loss to the music world.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The main character evolved from a cynical, emotionally blocked girl, to a woman who began to have hope, trust and<br />confidence. That evolution was a tough journey, but so interesting and involving.
B00BLGDFH2|5.0|A mix of performers you never thought you would hear together. It starts off with a bang in track 1 & 2 for some heavier alternative songs. Than Stevie Nicks enters for the 3rd track. She provides an erie tale of flirting with disaster. However, I dare you to count how many times she says the word, &#34;Devil.&#34; Rick Springfield enters on track 4. The track captures all the elements that Rick captured in his hay day minus the soap opera. Following it is track 5 with Lee Ving. This track is a crazy mix of that 1,2,3,4, 1,2,3,4, signature punk sound the Lee Ving offers but the driving musicality makes it a great mix. Throw in the harmonica and it BLOWS YOUR MIND! Next up is track 6 with Corey Tayor. This song is a great testament to the musicians playing and Corey. A great combo that combines some of the more melodic powers of Stone Sour with some stellar musicians. Track 7 Centipede is an incredible track! It has a slower part that sounds like &#34;Black Country Woman&#34; was put in a blender with &#34;Razor&#34; and than Josh Home added some extra energy powder. Than at the end it gets a little more powerful. Track 8 is just a fun track to bring the mood of the album to a &#34;happy place.&#34; Track 9 has gotten Nirvana fans in an uproar. Everybody whines that Kurt Cobain would have rather had John Lennon play on the track. Unfortunately they are  both together somewhere else making music with Hendrix ,Bonham, and Keith Moon. Paul McCartney wrote Helter Skelter. This track reminds me of a modern day Helter Skelter with the sound of Nirvana backing. A great mix of generational icons. The song itself lacks depth but if Nirvana and Paul McCartney sit down for a few hours and just make is song, its cool no matter what. Track 10 reminds me of everything that is great about Echos, Silence, Patience, and Grace. A great track with that really lets Rami shine. Last but not least is Mantra a track including Rezner, Homme, and Grohl. Three front men, three musical geniuses. You would think with these three together their heads would get too big but nope. The take it down and blend with one another on an equal level. You can feel this song and it is a great way to end a great soundtrack. Overall, the album was one of the best so far in 2013. Too bad Dirk Diggler didn't make a presence.
B00BF123WG|3.0|Started out disgusting and got boring.  I almost ended up rooting for Bin Laden.  I hope this is not a true depiction of how our CIA really acts, but I'm afraid it might be.  Hitler could have taken lessons.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|A fun movie and clever interpretation of a fictional world that exists when the arcade closes for the night. My 3 year old son and I watched this movie at the theater, and now we have a copy to watch at home. We've viewed it several times and we are still not tired of it. If you grew up gaming in the eighties and still like to game, then you might like the references made in this animation flick.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fun to play almost addictive.  Sometimes when back pain is bad, it keeps me a bit busy as to not focus on the pain but focus on the game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game very addicting and a lot of fun  I  recommended this game to anyone around the world hello help hello
B009S33I68|5.0|I am an avid reader of military history and this is the best book I have read. It is detailed, informative and I highly recommend it
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a very fun and frustrating game.  However, once you're out of coins, it takes a long time to replenish.  It's a good game, but not great enough to purchase coins.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Typical Clancy novel. Makes you wonder just what is possible...<br />Would recommend this book for anyone that wants to get some picture of what is possible these days.
B005HSL626|5.0|Funny, I knew my daughter would love this game. But when I tried to get her to try it she didn't want to. Now that has, she wants to know why I didn't tell her about this sooner. Go figure...
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I stopped reading after four chapters, and I was angry with myself for not stopping sooner. The reviews are misleading. Do not buy this book. This book is stupid.
1455523550|5.0|Kept me turning pages and my interest was continuous.  Love his books.  Have recommended to several people and loaned my book to a couple.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|I thought the plot was very weak, and the dialog totally ruined whatever redeeming qualities the movies was going for on in the first place.<br />The frequent use of the word _ uck was misused and did absolutely nothing for the movie.
B002NZK5QY|1.0|All we can hear is the music.  No dialogue plays on our DVD player.  We have never had this experience with another movie.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Story line was entertaining and I enjoyed the searches and clue puzzles along the way. I would recommend this app for anyone that likes search puzzles.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|If you like Hitchcock, this is a good one.  Lots of twists and turns.  Of course there are surprises and suspense.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|If you're a big-name director who can command millions of dollars for sets, costumes, makeup, and special effects you should probably consider a suitable script.  This one is laughably cartoonish and the movie is a total waste.  Too bad.  Mr. Scott really needs to get his medication adjusted before he attempts another film.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I cannot wait to see This Show In Novemeber. Love him Acousitc So Much Talent, Took a while to find him, So worth the wait
B0051YKUYG|5.0|This is a great collection of Celine Dion's many hits and is very entertaining for anyone who has followed this great singer's career. Some of the videos were done early in her musical journey and show why she has become a megastar performer loved by millions of fans. This dvd in my opinion, is a must for any fan to have in their collection.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I love every thing By Him, I have ticket's for his new show. Cant wait to see him Live. Check out the C.D With Beth Hart and Joe.
B008GJV4F2|4.0|This isn't exactly what I expected, but it turned out to be worth the time and money in my opinion. A story of rising against adversity and living how one wants, no matter how others treat you when you do. It's going on my shelf and I recommend to anyone who likes a good movie.
0767836324|5.0|They did such a good job of Hook and his disguise that I had a hard time recognizing Dustin Hoffman.  He was brilliant, as was Robin Williams, et. al.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|A long time fan<br /> of Mr Charles (R.I.P.) and the songs on this selection in particular. Great singer, great songs!
B003B02O14|5.0|An excellent read, for the second time.  Having read it years ago in paperback, I was happy to find it in digital and gave it another look.  Fast paced and page turning I found it even more enjoyable.  Grisham is the master storyteller and keeps me hungry for his next book.  Keep them coming!
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Interesting twist on parallel universes.<br />The duplicates seem to have their own lives through complex story-telling.<br />A fun series :)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a perfect game to sharpen your memory skills. It definitely makes you think about your next<br />move. The puzzles were so much fun as well. GREAT JOB G5!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Great flick.<br />Good adaptation of book.<br />Get your kids to read the latter before watching the former.<br />Fun discussions ensue.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Great value for the whole set. Doesn't have a lot of extras, obviously, but you can't beat this price if you just want to rewatch the series.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Enjoyed every episode. Takes some acting to be the -- &#34;student counseler/vice principal&#34;. Sadie, what a character. ++++ I'll be there for next season!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I cried so much, as all moms will who read this. I couldn't put it down! The surprise ending will throw you for a loop.
B00BFHZOCG|4.0|Anthrax delivers another good album. I was looking forward to hearing new material, however this is not it. I think they had fun when this album was produced. The music is good and is worth the listen.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|The Hobbit was awesome in theaters and while TV screens are smaller the experience along with the bonus features are still great.
0061537934|5.0|I bought the book for my sister for her birthday-she let me read it but I don't remember what it was about.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|We watched this movie as a family (kids are 11, 8, 8). We were all completely captivated by both the humanity and spirituality of the story and the stunning visuals. Though some violence is implied, the entire movie is appropriate for children. Mine were touched, and even shed a few tears.
B008JFUO36|4.0|Being one of my highly anticipated movies of 2013, I was fortunate enough to get to see this movie early. And it very much  exceeded my expectations. Tom Cruise while, he is a good actor, really disappointed me with the 2012 movie Jack Reacher. But in this particular review, I am here to tell you that Oblivion is a re vamp for Tom Cruise.  This is a great science fiction movie. I will not spoil anything. Supporting cast includes Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko (She is beautiful) and Andrea Riseborough; and they all did a outstanding job. I was mainly impressed how fast paced Oblivion was, and how i was still able to enjoy the movie. The visuals/effects were very well done in the movie as well. The storyline is predictable at some points but its nothing MAJOR to worry about. Other than the somewhat predictable parts of the storyline, I can find really nothing else to complain about. Oblivion is one of the best Sci Fi films of 2013. More importantly, it is a movie that i think anyone can enjoy.<br /><br />4.5 stars
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A truly heart-warming relationship that brings humor and humanity to a sensitive subject. Acting and soundtrack are superb. Simply beautiful.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The graphics are good and it worked fine on my kindle fire hd.<br />I look forward to more games like this.
B00260GLBO|5.0|Bruder toys ROCK!  Never buy an Ertl again.  A quality, functional toy that my grandchildren can actually have fun playing with.  We have plenty of Broken Ertl toys.  We're now building our collection of Bruder toys.  They cost less than Ertl, work better than Ertl, stay hooked up to each other, don't break easily.  Worth every penny
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It did not follow the book very well.  There should have been more explanation on smoe of the subject matter.
B000OE4NWS|5.0|Bruder toys beat anything Ertl makes hands down.  I spend less money on Bruder toys now and get a better quality toy.  Bruder is functional, a quality product, easy to play with, stays hooked up. I love this toy company and I now buy only their products.  Wake up Ertl.  Wish I could let everyone know about Bruder toys!
B001ET081W|5.0|The Ramones......always a good time. While not as iconic as their early stuff, this is still rockin good music. Buy it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My daughter recommended I get this app for my grandson.  He really enjoys the game it is just entertaining enough to keep his attention.
B005DJREJS|5.0|It's great fun to watch - just over the top enough to make you laugh while hitting that spot that reminds you what high school felt like. Gives you a great chance to be grateful for growing up!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I'll make this a short review... if you have the Nexus 10, you must get this cable!  As you probably already know, the Nexus 10 is a beast... during intensive use (watching movies through the HDMI output) the battery charge drops like a rock, even when connected to USB power source.  The only way to maintain charge is with this pogo cable.  That's all there is to it... you need it... buy it now.
B003GAMOIW|1.0|well first of all I luv this movie, but I had to send it back to u, because it didn't state the region type nor format...and it didn't play on my player..so I sent it back to you...it cost me $1.79 for the envelope.....$2.79 for the postage....was not happy because the movie only cost $6.00 and change...so really not worth sending it back to u....but I did...and reordered another one from u just yesterday...this one had the description of region 1 and format ok....so I re ordered from u and hope it is the right dvd,format,and reigion....I really like ordering form u guys...and plan to keep buying from u.....hope this time I have ordered the right movie.. thank u and wait to hear from u.

B005NFJAT4|5.0|Gettysburg deserves as much acclaim as Patton, The Longest Day, Saving Private Ryan, etc.<br />Blue ray transfer is very good. The uniforms look noticeably different from past viewings on DVD...that's how detailed and rich the picture. Sound is crisp. Explosions are booming.<br />If you're a fan of Gettysburg, this blueray purchase is a no brainer.<br />If you've never seen Gettysburg and are about to, I envy you.
B000022TSY|5.0|Easy Rider attempts to demonstrate the realities of Americans living in America during a very trying time, the Vietnam War.<br />Fair to say Denis Hopper gets it relatively close!<br />Thanks to the seller for providing us the product we paid for.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I lobe using pinterest!!! I literally live on this app, but there could be some changes, like maybe making searching for things a bit easier, and moving pins from board to board, and maybe some more secret boards. but it is an amazing app, and if you are questioning whether to get it or not, just get it. its free afterall!!:)
B005IQ39AY|2.0|Just don't care for this game. Boring not worth your money or time playing it. Ping pong or pool or even bowling is better
B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games is best understood as a metaphor for the problems of adolescence.  It certainly isn't meant to be taken literally, as very little of the plot or character's actions make sense, even in-universe.<br /><br />The movie tries hard to have the styling of the Fifth Element meets the Running Man meets Truman show, but it takes itself too seriously and little original is added.  The actors do a good job, with the lead girl performing well in numerous scenes that have little dialogue for her to work with.<br /><br />The movie is two disjoint halves shoved together.  The first half, creative in style but single-dimensional in character development and plot, covers the selection and training for the games.  Everyone shows up with expert ninja skills, without even a montage to make it believable that teenagers are deadly with a variety of weapons.  Important motivating factors like why the games are even held are glossed over or given poor explanation.  The games supposedly keep the districts in line as if the omnipresent white clad troops aren't enough.  Much of the detail here is irrelevant as the characters introduced in the first half spend most of the second gaping at TV screens.<br /><br />The second half of the movie watches the \\"tributes\\" fighting in the woods of North Carolina (or a computer simulation, or a giant studio, or something where they can throw well-aimed fireballs from thin air, change from day to night, and conjure packs of giant were-pitbulls wherever convenient).  The kids had almost no character development or background up to this point and only enough is given to make it clear what type of cliched good-guy or bad-guy they are.  It doesn't really matter anyway as they all die in a variety of ways that allow the two relevant characters to avoid appearing murderous (a difficult feat in a to-the-death arena battle).<br /><br />The love story, if it is one, is the weakest point of the movie.  The insecure, cowardly beta-male starts off byannouncing that he loves the heroine at hackneyed moments, though I suspect that was insincere and intended to play the system of sponsors for support.  Despite multiple discussions of the importance of this, it is never clear what this means or if the magic medicine deliveries are from them or the show's director.  Later, Mr. Whiney caves to peer pressure to hunt down his girlfriend with the pack of evil bad-guys.  Despite this, all is soon forgiven and they share some dull moments together, staring at each other chastely, while the music picks up to let us know they are indeed having a moment.  I haven't read the book and so it is not obvious whether their romance is an act for the tv cameras (and thus their lack of chemistry is intended) or this is all supposed to be sincere.<br /><br />The movie was both too long and lacked motivation and character development.  In adapting this to the screen, perhaps they should have edited down the numerous sequences that added nothing to the overall plot and instead focused on the basics.  These problems do not bode well for the next three films in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first when  I heard about this book I didn't think it would be good or that I would enjoy it. it But I I bought it and read it in less than two days. It is one of the best books I have ever read.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|As far as what the Bourne trilogy offers, it's nothing more than what you can get buying each movie separately. As far as the movies themselves, they are a pathetic ripoff and a desperate attempt at being an alternative to the James Bond series. Matt Damon as an actor is no match to the Bond actors (Daniel Craig in particular) in terms of excitement and acting ability. When compared to Jason Statham action movies , Damon is no match in terms of on screen toughness and acting skills.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is great. The graphics are great for a free game and the in game play is fun. The only thing that is disappointing is that it is so hard to get coins and the bundles are a bit expensive.
B000FCJZ3G|5.0|I like how Harv explains and encourages you to become a better person. I enjoyed reading it and recommended it to several friends now.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon story is fun. I like how you can raise different dragons. I look forward playing the game on my kindle and phone.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Recieved the first three movies as a gift and wanted to make my collection complete. Very action packed and great story line. Hope another movie is in the works.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book from the very beginning.  Moyes hooked me during the prologue and kept me reading every spare moment I had until the very end.  The book description doesn't really go into what this book is about and I think that's best, just know it's a wonderful story and well written.  Great for Marian Keyes fans as it's funny but way more serious subject matter than you might expect from a \\"chick-lit\\"  AWESOME book that I am recommending to all my friends
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather downloaded for an android device and it works great.  Have only used for a few days but the forecasts have been reliable for the period.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|i am an addict for this game i played it on my friends kindle and now im getting it i love it
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Having seen the musical and preparing to see the movie, I decided to read the book. I found the story enjoyable. However, I did not like Victor Hugo's tendency to go off onto tangents whenever reaching an exciting point. For example, he gave a complete geographic and military history of the Battle of Waterloo just to show a brief interaction between 2 people after the battle ended. It was pointless! And that is only one example of such instances. I wish I would have read the abridged version so that I could have enjoyed the story without all the filler. It is a fantastic story, and there is a fair amount left out of the musical and movie. It is worth reading!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love doing the challenges. I also love to compete with my friends.I think it is so easy kids can play I gave it to my baby sister and she loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have watched this show about 4 times thru...love it better each time. It is very graphic and not for kids but it leaves you waiting for the next episode.
B004SCN2F6|4.0|Star Traders is a heap of fun. Although it can get frusterating at times. It is well worth the price.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I got this ontime and I love it. It works more than what i expected. Two of my friends looked at my watch and they also bought similer seiko watch. good one.

B009R659L8|5.0|Kept me guessing! Hated to put the story down! I wanted to keep reading and sat up late a couple of nights.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This Bond is one of the best, if not THE best, and the well-written script propels it to upper level entertainment.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This is a scary story of a writer who moves into a house where horrific deaths have transpired.  What he finds and what he loses in the course of the movie are many and disastrous.  I wouldn't watch it alone if you are the least faint hearted because things will jump out at you and scare your socks off.  A lot happens in the dark so have your good eyes on.
B00498YZH8|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence portrays an unassuming young girl who is challenged to become a heroine.  She succeeds beautifully, in the process demonstrating grace and skill-- and giving us an early affirmation that &#34;Best Actress&#34; could not be too far down the road.
B001FA0NZ6|5.0|A must have for begginers to Pro, i am not a makeup artist at all I just happen to love the free expression of art through make-up. 5 years ago my make-up knowledge was very limited and this book provided me the tools to get better at it. Bobbi goes in detail from skin to make-up. She also talks about make-up for mix races, which is a plus for me because im am latina. I still go back to this book and relearn new things because when i bought it I knew nothing, now that I have play around with makeup and read other makeup book. I still review this book and learn to improve my basic techniques. Thanks bobbi!
B008602KQI|5.0|This type of movie, one that shows how despicable human behavior can become, is at its best when the plot and acting are at their best.  That's how it is for this movie.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Have seen this in the movie theater and really enjoyed  it and am looking forward to viewing it at home.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Love this movie ever since I was a kid. It never gets old. Danny DeVito is so fun. I will always love it.

B0000DGDOJ|3.0|I've recently \\"rediscovered\\" Silver Convention. I was in the prime record buying demographic, 18-19 years old, back in 1975-76 when Silver Convention first appeared on what was then the burgeoning disco music scene. \\"Fly Robin Fly\\" was all over the radio, and then \\"Get Up And Boogie\\" shortly afterward. Back then, without internet and instant information, you never really knew much of anything about these anonymous \\"producer's projects\\". It was just all about \\"The Sound\\" without any real group identity. Now, you can find just about anything you wanted to know about Silver Convention including some very entertaining, if not slightly campy and bizarre video clips, from their appearances on '70's TV shows.<br /><br />This \\"Best Of\\" compilation stands out for several reasons. It's quite comprehensive in that within it's 36 tracks it covers all the big and minor hits. It also contains a lot of the \\"filler\\" that appeared on their handful of albums, some good stuff and some not so good. (Which was usually the case with most disco albums of the day). With this set you get the complete mixed bag of tricks Silver Convention put out in their brief popularity span including various music styles and some rare lead vocals. This set also includes a nice little booklet that details the Silver Convention story mostly on the producer's side. Most cuts are around 5 minutes or less. The reason I'm not giving this a higher rating is because several of the songs seem to be digitized from a pour quality source. It seems to be consistent with the songs from their later albums. The key songs I wanted this set for are not nearly as clear, sharp and crisp as the songs from their earlier albums. So songs like \\"Everybody's Talking About Love\\", \\"Fancy Party\\" and \\"Telegram\\" don't nearly measure up, sound quality wise, to \\"Save Me\\", Fly Robin Fly\\" and \\"Always Another Girl\\". Could it be a deteriorated or damaged tape source? The differences are quite apparent when listening though headphones.<br /><br />I also own a previous Silver Convention CD, the \\"Greatest Hits\\" that was a Canadian release on Unidisc. That CD is truly \\"the best of the best\\" CD as far as the musical output of this group, and on that CD the sound quality is top notch. I purchased this 2 CD set to fill in the songs that were not included on the single disc Canadian Greatest Hits release. So for that purpose, this \\"Best Of\\"  2 CD set is ok as a supplement, but the better value for all around song selection and sound quality remains with the Unidisc release.
B0059XTUVI|5.0|It was a really great movie, a bunch of my friends have watched it and highly recommend the movie to watch, Meryl  Streep was first class in the this movie. The perfect Margaret Thatcher.

B001UG56ES|5.0|This is a wonderful story and very well acted.  If you want a nice evening at home watch this one.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|We saw this in the theater while on an island vacation, but although our setting definitely added a visceral context to our experience of the movie, the direction and action will thrill and move any viewer no matter where or how they see this movie. This story could've become a melodramatic shallow made for cable movie, but this truly is deserving of its Oscar nominations. Definitely worth a rental and not a bad addition to any movie library. It's an action thriller family film that will leave you gasping, and crying.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|OMG this game is very addicting!!  Even though it is a little violent for younger muggles, it is very fun.  I would very much recommend!!
B00B52F278|1.0|Spartacus is a tale of two shows. Blood and Sand and Gods of the Arena were masterpieces. Both seasons were amazing dramas with excellent action scenes, writing, characterization and acting. If Blood and Sand ended with that one season, it would have been enough for many fans. Sadly, Vengeance turned out to be an utter disaster. You can see my other review for that. I watched the first episode of War of the Damned to see if the season was worth watching. I believe Spartacus, Naevia and company ambushed some Romans in that episode. Ludicrous. Spartacus, Crixus and the others were commanders of the slave armies. They would not personally carry out ambushes like that. This nonsense and the reliance on unnecessary violence to substitute for proper storytelling destroyed the show for me. I had believed the show would accurately depict Spartacus's transition from slave warrior to commander of the slave armies. These men became rich from looting Italy. Yet, they were enemies of the Roman Republic, which eventually was their doom. The show never transitioned these characters. Their mentality remained the same as it was from Blood and Sand. For the lowbrow crowd that is ignorant of history, perhaps this is fine. But for anyone else, it's unacceptable. The show became trash. Is it any surprise that Starz gave up on it?<br /><br />One more thing, whose bright idea was it to make a violent male oriented action TV show combined with overbearing homosexual overtones? I have nothing against homosexuality, but Agron and Nasir's relationship went ridiculously overboard. It's really not surprising why the show got cancelled.<br /><br />The funny thing was, the homosexual relationship in Blood and Sand was much better depicted than in War of the Damned. Which really just shows how terrible the writing did get on Spartacus in the end.
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|3D BLU RAY OF THIS DANCING MOVIE IS AN EXCELLENT QUALITY AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED OF THE 3D HOW THEY MAKE THE FILM.<br />THE MOVIE IS REALLY FACINATING.

B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I read the series and wondered how true it would be to the first book which I enjoyed.  It is about as close to the book as you can get.  It captures the some of the ambiguity but also the moral mess that the &#34;hunger games&#34; were based on.  Definitely recommend this movie.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack is incredible. The wide straps and back padding make this the most comfortable backpack I have EVER owned. Period. The interior space organization is very well done. There are compartments for pretty much anything you might want to carry with you. My primary concern was being able to put my 17.3 inch laptop in it. It is a very good fit. They are not kidding when it comes to protection either. The entire laptop compartment is padded. The anchor strap fits very well, holding my laptop immobile in it's section. I keep my power cords and mouse in the next largest compartment, with room for things like water bottles (4 - 16 oz), or extra clothing (if I need to carry a t-shirt and jeans with me). The other compartments I keep everything from snacks to meds to sunglasses, or whatever else I need to keep handy. Swiss Gear makes a very good backpack and is well worth the money.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Well done. If you love shows that are close to reality, then you will love this series. Drama and law with a blend of romance will keep you glued to your screen.

I enjoyed this version the most.<br /><br />I have been waiting for the restored version because I have been skeptic.  I have the digital iTunes that has all the mini series episodes.  Now that I see that people are happy with the restored version I will purchase this.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I've tried downloading this like 6 times and it won't install!!!!!!!  I payed a whole dollar to watch this app fail to install.  I've always wanted this game, and now that I have it, It won't work.  I'm really angry!!!!!!!!!!!
B0097AQEOK|5.0|I was in college when Joni Mitchell floated out of the radio and said truths about life I'd experienced but never knew I shared with others.  Here it is, all this wonderful soul's revelations of love, pain, and the joy of human connections.  A feast of feelings.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|This book is spectacular BUT city of glass and city of lost souls beat this by a million!!!! Ps Jace is MINE:)
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|This flick is darker than Baraka, but still lighter than Koyanasqatsi.  The opening sequence with the young girls is both delightful and disturbing.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This might be the first time I am rethinking twilight as my favorite!!!!! Beautiful world I'm obsessed!!!! Thank u cassie clare!!!!! Now hurry up on sixth book!!!!!
B002CSC5EC|5.0|Y'all know what this film's about, you know the bands, the chants, the stage voices, the mud, and the death knell to an era.  What does escape memory is just how great the people in the audience were; no fights, nothing of the Altimont  mentality, no sign of the political jerks some of these folks would become.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE horses, and when I found this game I freaked! It's really fun, a lot of horses just let you stare at a picture of a horse but not let you actually enter it in competitions. But this one does!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book has some historical content which makes it so believable and interesting. It really helped me get into the story and attached to the characters. It's about a white girl that is raised by black slaves. It's a little sad, but very well written.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I just love this game because it lets you do whatever you want! Recommended for kindle fire! Me and my friend just have a blast when we play this.
B004M8AL6E|5.0|Hello Gorgeous.<br /><br />This miniseries was recommended to me by my mom after mentioning that Robert Duvall was sexy for an &#34;old guy&#34;.  Not only did I fall in love with Robert Duvall all over again, but TLJ, Diane Lane, and Danny Glover were a pleasant surprise as well,<br /><br />Is it just me, or is there a striking similarity between Robert Duvall and Matthew McConaughey?
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I would recommend it to kindle fire users.  LOVE the detail in the game. Like the controls and how many upgrades it has.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|This movie sparked a metaphysical conversation between my husband and I that lasted an hour! The symbolism goes so deep that I'm sure we missed a few points and will be talking about it again today.<br />Having read the book when it was published, it was a nice to revisit Pi, Richard Parker, and all of the other characters so many years later.  Perhaps it is time to dust off my copy and delve deeper into the Life of Pi.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|LOVE it! Several more hazards but also several more power-ups. Having a lot of fun with<br />it. Great app for free but truthfully, I wouldn't have a problem paying for it either.
B0087EACJK|4.0|Another game that causes you to think, but then again thats not all bad, just try to get this guy from the starting point to the door, (don't forget the key)
B009AJD5E0|5.0|Watch it!! This movie is based on the book \\"Chariots of the Gods\\". If you like a good science fiction film you will love this movie.<br /><br />If you have questions after you've watched the movie.<br />Watch a good review of the movie on youtube. [...]
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is an awesome beginning to great series of books!your hooked after the first one! Hope the movie is just as good
B007GCY8FS|1.0|It is a treat to read book  that can take a Midwestern setting and fill it with action. I would even recommend this for teens .
B006LSZECO|3.0|Simply, much ado about another murder. Interesting plot but the machinations to get to the who-done-it had me abandoning the book for days at a time.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|you have to pay extra for it do do anything and have the adds removed.  I played for five minutes, removing app.
B009AMAM9S|2.0|Despite the positive reviews here, I have to say I found this WAY overlong, very much in need of some tighter editing, and ultimately completely disengaging.<br />I very soon lost interest in what happened to anyone. Always a fatal occurrence to any movie enjoyment.<br /><br />At least three of the only tenuously linked \\"stories\\" could have been eliminated, allowing the slightly more interesting ones to be expanded.<br />There's just so much that's derivative here. Parts are Lord of the Rings revisited, Bladerunner gets a working over, along with some additions reminiscent of the chase sequences in The Phantom Menace. Avatar is plundered for much of the imagery, and there are a few other \\"borrowings\\" you too will no doubt recognise.<br /><br />It has such pretensions to originality, but on observation it just isn't.<br />It's really like some out takes from various unrelated movies left on the cutting room floor in the editing booth have been scooped up and pasted together, and shown in the hopes that some in the audience will make something profound out of it.<br />It's self-reverently within that indie-genre that is designed to have the New Agers seeing all sorts of imagined meanings and connections, but really it's only just confusing and in the end, SO DAMNED LONG!<br />The last scene where we have an ageing Tom Hanks telling the story to a colony of some sort of hippy-feral macram&eacute; wearing kids clustered around his wind-chime infested commune seems interminable, and I was literally shouting for the credits to roll.<br />Many will try to \\"understand\\" this movie, and initially I too looked for meaning, or something tangible that would eventually tie the stories together, but after a while you just lose the incentive when you realise it is being so deliberately obtuse.<br />I know so many have liked it, but this one ended up by boring me to distraction
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I've never bought a JT album until this one! He and Timbaland did a GREAT JOB!! I love the fact that the songs are really long because midway through the songs the tempos change and they become two separate songs basically! I love everything about it from the beats to the lyrics! I preordered it and I love it!!!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I think that all the new characters, enemies, challenges, and weaponry are simply awesome. And yes even the Ronin. I can't wait to see the end.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Great characters .  Can not wait for the next season.  Surprises around every corner. I want more.  I want more.
1446249182|5.0|I bought this book because I kept borrowing my colleagues. As a PhD student, this guide has been so helpful in providing me with a concrete and practical understanding of statistics.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is, without question,one of the most satisfying period dramas I've ever seen. The characters are expertly portrayed and you grow to care about them. The tone is gentle and draws you in, the scenery is gorgeous and you're given insight into a time and place that would otherwise be foreign.<br />The family dynamics are realistic and you're left with a warm,peaceful feeling after each and every episode.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I read the books. They did a decent job of sticking close to the author's writing. No matter how many times I watch it, I still get emotional on certain scenes. Geeze!
1580176941|3.0|Books has a lot of good information and pictures to help you design interesting cookies.  As new new cookie decorator I appreciated the designs and tips.
B00A5052YE|5.0|There are some up tempo songs and some slower ballots.  Something for all ages.  This one is going to stay in my player for a while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its fun and passes time  loved it...the only bad thing is u cant change its name from beauty and u cant change ur username
B005EVVESM|5.0|What can I say, Maroon 5 is a great group; and I might add, I am a senior citizen who still keeps up with good groups/music.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Easy and fun!  keep you thinking and improves your drawing !  Fast and easy to play. Hope more friends will play with me.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|Great book!!! It really filled in a lot of the holes of the movies and gave the backgrounds of the characters and the story. I wish I had read it before seeing the movies. I was especially shocked when reading about Luca Brasi. The movie portrayed him in a completely different light.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I can't get enough of this show...fine TV acting and writing.<br />Im Glad there are three seasons because I'm hooked!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app to have. It is great to have a handy Bible on your kindled fire! Great
B0085KGHI6|5.0|This is a must see for Stones lovers and Muddy lovers alike.  It's raw, personal and fantastic music.  Just a bit of humor thrown in for good measure.  The blues at its best.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the only game on my kindle fire and I am not bored...so fin and definitely my favorite game.
B0092YO8C6|5.0|I totally love this album. I bought it for my 9 year old son. He loves watching the show and he trys to copy to copy \\"Austin's\\" moves. He listens to the album on his kindle while playing video games. I'm so thrilled with his music I have it on my cell too. :-)
B002HR1W1K|5.0|This is a hilarious send up of the quiet English village, populated by &#34;normal&#34; characters, however, the village council are murderers.  The wonderful cast is lead by Simon Pegg, as the London-born over achieving police officer relegated to the boonies for his dedication.  The rest of the cast were familar faces from Masterpiece Theater, BBC and movies.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|At this point, I know it's early, but I don't see how anything will top this album for 2013.  Every song is filled with feeling, emotion and great songwriting.  Incredible musicians on every instrument. I'm glad Steven Wilson decided to add Guthrie Govan to play on this thing, his solos are top notch. Buy this!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great app! I downloaded it, and I play it every single day! Already got 1000000 points! Very easy to very hard.
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|Lets your mind work in a relaxing manor w/o worrying about running out of time.  Can play while watching TV and talking w/others due to this.  Still attempting to get badge for glass section to unlock other level.  Could be a bit longer w/more sections to complete.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If this was all that was on television I'd be a happy viewer. The visuals are gorgeous, the characters engaging & the storyline keeps you coming back for more.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Best band I've heard in years.  Refreshing simplistic harmonies do not mean weak musical content.  Very strong w/progressively impressive chord and tempo changes.  Heartfelt music!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game was better than torture.. I guess.  Game functioned fine, but it was just SLOW and tedious.  BORING!  Deleted!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|While this is simplistic it manages to keep you entertained for a while.  Wish there were more options as far as tokens, etc.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I am used to the Microsoft version with the bells and whistles, so this is a little flat for my taste.
B000IKM8UM|5.0|Classic!!!! Spike Lee at his best... This movie was a reason to go to the theater back in the day...
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I travel for business and pleasure, use it whenever I travel for good ideas.  In Hawaii and Key West the reader comments were spot on!
B004AGI2L4|2.0|I can agree with mishaps in 'Gladiator' movie - it's a heroic adventure.<br />'Centurion' is just another 'stranded marines' movie, albeit in a pseudo-historical setting.<br />The team is the hero... that cliche is not going to work unless you do a really good job portraying characters.<br /><br />If you really want something good and genuinely medieval, watch 'Flesh and Blood' instead.
B004NELBPC|4.0|Like the longer articles and the fact that progressives are represented, unlike some other sources.  Good for some inside information at times.
B000683VI4|3.0|I had to return it as the individual who I bought it for already had it.  Sorry for the inconvenience.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fast, easy and I love the sharpness of the cards and the neat ending when you win. Fun game.
B0058VW36U|1.0|season 1, the easiest doesn't work, only season 2 & 3. Disapointed, put it on tablet for my 5 year old to play.
0345803493|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book! It was insightful and inspiring to read right before I went to sleep at night.
1616614609|5.0|Can on time and already playing the game! It will take some time to understand the verbiage on the cards itself.. But overall I love the game concept.
1452101248|5.0|I have tried 3 recipes so far & loved them. The parsnip, red onion, sweet potato caper dish is heaven. Superb.
B006G2124E|5.0|This film is a wonderful analysis of race relations during the period, and subsequently translates to much of the social stratification that still exist in society on the basis of race.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is an amazing. really fun city game if you like any of the story games or if you like Sims you should get this it is so fun yea
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was a very wonderful read.  So many things going on with so many people.  It was very human.  I am waiting for the release of the DVD and want to compare.  Amazing novel.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I am addicted to Fringe.  My partner and I watch one epidose a day.  We started with Season 1 and we are now midway into session 4.  During the day I often cheer myself up thinking about catching up on Peter and Oliva.  I also like the other characters, Walter, Astrid, Broyles, etc. Actually I am enjoying this part of the series less as one of the main characters is missing, and the others are a little out of sorts.  The series is so well produced and acted that it pulls you into their world, or should I say both of their universes??  I like intrigue series but I am not usually into SciFi.  I love the Fringe Division and I will be sad when I watch the last episode!!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was a very interesting book.  It worked in the legal system, the parent feeling, how other people react.  It was very well written and I thoroughly enjoyed. I do not want to give away anything so read the book.
B00BF123WG|3.0|The film was good, just not truthful about the actual events.  If you keep in mind its fictionalized, you'll enjoy it.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This is a great movie! I was not disappointed by any of it. Richard Armitage is awesome as Thorin. I would recommend this to any Tolkien or Armitage fan. Peter Jackson did a wonderful job in casting all of the characters.
B00846REIS|3.0|This book will keep you reading but it is so not 50 shades of gray. The main characters are more than frustrating and have their issues. Any time you think they have passed a hurdle,you're back to square one. Eva needs to seriously grow up and Gideon needs to grow a pair<br /> What a whimpering hero! Christian gray would have birch slapped him!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I first read this book back in the mid 40's....I was an avid reader and it was such a joy to find this treasure at the library.  And to read it once again after so many years was still a joy:-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As soon as I read Wool I just had to know what else was happening.  Wonderful writing accompanied by an absolutely amazing and believable plot.  I spent my Spring Break catching up.  A must read for everyone, so stop reading this and get it.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I love just about everything in this series, except that it's not long enough and they need more episodes!!  The characters, the plot, the sub-plots, the sub-sub-plots, the landscape.....Winter.....it's all wonderful!  AND DRAGONS!!  Who doesn't love Dragons?  Well, maybe warlocks...but that's another story.<br /><br />Great Acting, Great Action, Great Scenery, Great Story, Great Dragons....this series is Great!
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I thought it was too sad.  Too many unhappy people throughout the whole story.  Also, it just didn't make sense for a man Harold's age to take it into his head to walk to a distant destination.
B0090SI3ZW|4.0|I watched this film fearing the worst, but came away thankful that I'd spent the money to purchase this.  It definately a different &#34;take&#34; on the Asian Film Genre, but very entertaining....with tons of action, decent acting, and a good plot.  Although cast in the &#34;Tarantino Model&#34;, this film can stand on it's own.<br /><br />If you enjoy the Asian Film Genre, Martial Arts films, or Tarantino Films....then definately give this one a try!
B005LAIHR2|1.0|nor vastness of the universe and all of its mysteries could have save this heap! \\"I WANT TO ROCK\\" THIS MOVIE OFF THE EARTH AND INTO OBLIVION, WITH A PERFECTLY AIMED SUPER NOVA!!! I wish it wasn't taking up 'space' on some of the premium channels I get on HBO. Really if you are actually thinking of buying this, DON'T. Rent a documentary about Motley Crue, or maybe read a book about the great 80's glam rock movement. Much more interesting.
B00A2H9L2E|3.0|I was so excited when I first heard about this, hoping it would deliver in the same way the original did.....I must admit that I was a little disappointed.  Although it's not bad, & if you are a Silent Hill fan (like myself), you can deal with any letdown in a feature film....it just didn't live up to expectations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The best that I have found for the tablets.easy to use and works just fine.Everone will enjoy this app.<br />Thanks
B002RTMXIY|4.0|Always liked this one.. some of the acting was a little corny but overall ok. Give it a thumbs up !
B00BF11STU|5.0|Saw it twice, wow the stuff that goes on behind government doors.  Thank goodness for our brave men and women serving.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I helps me control my kids and is great game for when I want to relax. I think it would be great if you needs a game that you can play in the car or in the doctors office. It is a really good game.  I LOVE.SUBWAY SUBWAY SURFERS!!!!!
B006RXQ800|5.0|Great movie, great cast. have seen it twice now and would see it again. Daniel Day Lewis and Leonardo CiCaprio are phenomenal
B003L77FYS|5.0|As they used to say way back when: The Plot Thickens~!  The cases that Castle and Beckett go on are more complex, as their relationship also gets more complex.  The energy never slows down, gets boring, or any other negative.  It is all high energy and snappy dialog, and lots of FUN!  I have reviewed Season One and Two, and this Season just keeps improving on the ideas that Andrew W. Marlowe originated.  You will note that I mentioned FUN on more than one occasion.  Humor is one of the main ingredients, and all the characters get in the act.  From the Captain congratulating the crew on a case well solved, and then adding &#34;You too, Beckett!&#34; to a startled Kate, and then saying &#34;Just pullin' your chain...&#34;  The characters continue to reveal things that tie more and more events together, making for a wonderful guessing game of what will happen next.  I'm sorry that you might find this series increasingly addictive, but that's what makes it FUN!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Read! A wonderful and touching story. I highly recommend this book. Please read it and share it. Thank you Andrea!
B0053O89KG|5.0|After the shocking close of Season Three, the Fourth has to let us gather our wits about us and prepare for the consequences of that terrible action.  Not only is the opening of that season dealt with extremely well, but things go along with increasingly demanding cases that almost appear that Castle might have written them himself!  There are a wealth of good episodes, but the standoout for me was &#34;The Blue Butterfly&#34; — a nod to the film noir of the 1930's and 1940's.  We get to see Castle and Beckett and Alexis in period costumes as they play multiple characters retelling a story revolving around love, deception and priceless jewelry.<br />This may be my favorite story played out so far, as it takes clever manipulation to make it work effectively — which it does very well inbdeed!  There are several times in the Four Seasons that certain plot lines interweave with surprising results.  It comes down to writing and firm direction, never leaving the path that the series started on.  I do not believe in &#34;spoiler alerts&#34;, or the spoiling of anything so cleverly put together, so you'll have to do what I did: Rush out and buy some!  Season Five is coming along soon, so you'd better hurry and get caught up!  And remember: along the way through this series you WILL have LOTS OF FUN!
B008CJ0JTI|3.0|This is the first Criterion film we've watched which left us very puzzled why it was included in the collection. The movie is o  k.  Just.  Like most films, the first half is much stronger. Michael Douglas is excellent-and very funny- at this type of character (see Disclosure). But the director throws it all away-slowly and tacks on an appalling ending. The 'extras' are the real mystery. A real snooze. No insighful commentary about Douglas quoting his father's lines from one of his old movies, or much of anything else for that matter.  Love Criterion but this is the first clue we got that they are human and they can make dreadful mistakes.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|This tool kit is good but it is not great.<br /><br />The interconnects are not as solid as I as expected.  The joining parts for the extender and the bits are slightly loose.  The extender does not fit solid and tight and nor do the bits.<br /><br />Therefore, this kit is not as good as having one solid long shaft screwdriver.  You have to be careful when applying initial torque because of this looseness.<br /><br />You are better off buying any one of these sets:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000F9CS1U Anytime Tools 32 pc MICRO PRECISION SCREWDRIVER SET w/ T4 T5 T6 Mini Torx, Hex, Flat, Pozi]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000FGQ1G6 Boxer 30 Pcs 4mm Precision Screwdriver Set]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000MF754W Maxtech 16521MX 32-Piece Precision Bit Set]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A740VQM 45 in 1 Precision Screwdriver Tools Set for Rc Pc Mobile Car]]<br /><br />This one has 18 Philips and flat head tips that you most likely don't need.  So, 54 - 18 = 36 useful bit pieces.
0307389839|1.0|We have the misfortune of being trapped in the era of the 'memoir'. And apparently, tragically everyone's got one in them. It's pretty amazing this writer deemed his musings worthy of publication. This book isn't painful. But it becomes dreadfully dull, like being forced to read someone's diary. Holy god. The 'process' he describes is what you do- what anybody does- to clear your head and move on to the next thing. Obviously this is helpful to many readers of this book. But its usefullness is something of a head scratcher. What I got out of it is a huge ego stroke for the author. If they're lining up to hear his most basic thoughts there's no way he can get his head through a doorway anymore. And that's actually going to interfere with his real work.
1400067820|5.0|I imagine that if I were ever to write a book, I would lurk on Amazon or any other site where people could post a review of my book. What people thought of my work would matter to me. Taleb is not lurking on this site in hopes of getting an ego boost by reading positive reviews. He has some ideas that he likes to think on and write about. He thinks what he thinks and could care less whether people think he's a oracle of truth or a self-important windbag.<br /><br />That absence of artifice and manipulation is the greatest quality of this book. Taleb's writing is authentic. There is nothing fake here. He's expressing his thoughts and opinions. That's it. He's not trying to win favor with a particular group or get people to follow him on Twitter. He's not looking for access to the talking head circuit or angling to get an invite to speak at a TED conference. He's a welcome departure from the media savvy, self-promoting, marketing machines that churn out the best-sellers that we're all supposed to read. The hot topics of the moment that become cliche almost as soon as they're uttered never make an appearance in this book.<br /><br />I found his anachronism a welcome departure from the standard management/business fare. So much advice and conventional wisdom focuses on helping us become what other people want. I struggle when I'm expected to become more like everybody else rather than doing what makes me stand out. To use Taleb's language, fitting in is fragile. Finding your own way is anti-fragile. Taleb has followed his own thinking. This book is a great place to start if you want to stop being a sucker and start finding your own path through life.
B002SKZBQS|5.0|King at his very best. Well constructed and played out. Has all the requirements that a fantastic novel should possess.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one show that needs to be resurrected from the studio boss abyss.  Some shows come and go and are easily forgotten, but few leave such an impact in such a short amount of time.  Watch and you'll understand.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I really love this show.  It surprised me.  If a show makes me relate to or attach to its characters, then I know it is a good one.  This show did that for me.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|They really make it hard to rate something now. Can't just pick  a star and move along. eighteen nineteen twenty.
B00518HBD0|5.0|I like 3 Doors Down and I wasn't disappointed in their album.  If you like them, too, then you need to add this one to your collection.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I've been a Dr. Who fan since the originals and the new seasons are just as campy and fun. Twenty
B004WOS3P4|5.0|I liked David Cook when I saw him on TV, and wanted to buy his album to support him.  I wasn't disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|I already have each of these on Kindle, but wanted to hold the books in my hand. Best price, brilliant pages( important at my age), and the set looks great in my library.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just absolutely LOVE this show.  Someone really missed the boat when they didn't make more series of this great entertainment entity!  Shame on them, and it is our loss.  I'm just glad that we can at least enjoy what we have.
B000067J1Q|3.0|Bought movie as it is a classic for grand daughters. Entire movie plays fine until last sequence of events where there are several interruptions to it. It does continue to its conclusion without too much delay.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I just love this show!  It is a great mixture of mystery, great acting, humor and drama.  The actors were chosen so well and it just makes the show one you will want to watch over and over.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|From the late 70s' to the mid 80s' the Arcade Game Room was a place to go to have fun and socialize, before Home Gaming Systems became mainstream. This movie takes from that and implements the &#34;Toy Story&#34; aspect of, that when the humans aren't around the games characters are real. Great messages in the movie about things like ... acceptance of who you are, friendship, judging a book by it's cover and of coarse good vs bad. I watched it with my Daughter ... 3 times. I think I enjoyed it just as much as she did because of the familiarity of the characters. I reminisced of when I frequented the Arcade Game Room and all the characters from the games I played during that era :)
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I really like the characters in the show and find it entertaining.  There is enough mystery and comedy in it to help with that entertainment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so fun I play it every day. I love the game on there called um..... the one that is where u have to copy what's on top
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I like Adam Lambert and this album is certainly not a disappointment!  If you like Adam, then you will want this album for your collection.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|The season that started it all. Enough said. However, if you look deeper you'll see that the writing addresses many social issues of the period - many of which are still relevant today. There's still a lot to be learned from viewing the original Star Trek series and much enjoyment to be had, too.
B005QBKXOQ|5.0|I like Daughtry and was glad to buy his album to support his career.  He is easy to listen to.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book and just as great the second time around.  Looking forward to INFERNO coming out in May.
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Scotty is such a cutie.  I'm not really crazy about country western music, but could't help but buy his album.
B008602KQI|1.0|Poor plot. It was no sign of humanity. It is like America is a barbaric country. How pathetic it is.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this show, but have been hooked on it since I started watching it.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I had seen this before and it was so great that I wanted to own the DVD!!  Exact reproduction of original.
B003UD7JEE|4.0|I liked the show, but found it a bit depressing.  If you are looking for entertainment, it is that, but if you are looking to be cheered up, this is not the show I would pick.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Good spin on legal storyline, fun group of supporting cast. Has had some great episodes this season. I could sit down and watch the whole season in a weekend.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I loved Nathan Fillion in Firefly and would have wanted this show just because he was in it.  The fact that it is a great show was only a bonus!
B0081336FO|4.0|Great show. Too few episodes to be called a season. Hungry for more !<br />Good British dry wit, intriguing mysteries.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I LOVED the first season of this and couldn't wait until the second season came out.  I told my son I thought he would like it, too, but he didn't watch it at first.  Now he won't miss an episode!  It is addictive and a GREAT watch.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|the game is very good can't take my mind off of it. love sending live to family and friends. love getting lives.
B003FSTN52|5.0|It would have saved me money had I never watched this first season!  I really got hooked and have had to buy the other seasons as them came out!
B001EN71CW|5.0|I had already owned Firefly on DVD.  If you already have the series on DVD there is no reason to upgrade it to Blu-ray.  The Blu-ray edition is the exact replica of the DVD edition.
B003L77G10|5.0|I'm hooked on the show, so I had to buy the series seasons.  The acting is incredible and the characters are believable.
B00AN0KBJC|1.0|I love this series,  but if you don't order the hd version, you will be disappointed.  I won't that mistake again!
B003L77G8I|5.0|I am a Bones fan--what can I say?  If you like Bones, then you have to get the season, right?
0316212261|5.0|I bought the first book, Soulless, a while back, and was so delighted I knew I wanted to continue the series, so I decided to spring for the boxed set.  Overall you save money, rather than buying each book separately, and not only that, I was now able to give the individual copy of Soulless to my daughter, so she could enjoy it as well and get hooked on the series.  I just finished reading the second book, Changless, and this whole crazy universe only gets better!  Can't wait to see what else Ms. Carriger has in store for us!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What a captivating series.  It's easy to get hooked on this great show.  You will want to get the next series!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I was only sorry the story ended. It had rich vibrant characters in a very dynamic story.
B008Q09K2U|2.0|If you are a fan of the John Corey character you will love this book. It sparkles with his wit, cynicism and warped view of the world.  Corey makes you laugh out loud in places and I like that in a book.  However the story line is poor and it drags on.  There's lots of scene setting about what a cesspit Yemen is, and you read on in the hope is that the book is taking you somewhere that's worth the wait.  Unfortunately not. The ending was predictable from about page 20 and deeply unsatisfying, especially after such a long read.  Overall I found the book to be a very poor cousin to The Lion's Game.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Good plot and character development. I'm ex-military and I enjoyed that part of the lead character's life.  I will read more of this author's work.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I just love this series and can't wait for the next thing from jj abrams. The characters pull you in completely.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting and story line continue flawlessly in season 3. The period costumes and troubles of the times transport you back. You are left desperate for season 4 to start.
B00569LSUG|5.0|This is my first Tame Impala album but will definitely be buying more. Great sounds and riffs. Dope Album for sure. Highly Recommended.
B008D36INE|2.0|I actually watched this twice, trying to figure out exactly what was going on here.  Between the screeching violin musical score and the morose topic, I was lost.  These characters are neither endearing or memorable.  All of them are just pathetic.  Depressing and without substance.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|The cast and the premise seemed so promising. We kept watching expecting the comedy , romance, drama, something entertaining to come out of the 2hrs 18 mins of wasted time, but it never materialized.  Okay...that was my husband's review. Here's mine...This movie sucked a$$. Simple as that. Don't waste your time or your money. Life's too short.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, then I watched the movie, which I did not think was as good.  So then I read the series again and realized using my imagination is what made the series better than the movie.
B004I744AS|5.0|I really like the pronunciation feature and the multiple sources. It is much better than other dictoonary apps I have used.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book has been my favorite book I have ever read it is full of ups and downs. Great book.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It made me laugh and I can relate to it because my husband is a theoretical physicist. The characterization is taken to an extreme but that is what makes it funny.
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|Excellent as usual by Backstreet.<br /><br />They are timeless. Their music will live on long past the usual time of popularity.
B007SUW24W|5.0|this CD is absolutely beautiful. when i first heard of ed sheeran and listened to his song 'the a team' i really didnt like it. then after i listened to his other songs, i started to fall in love with all of it. this has many beautiful tracks on it. ed is an amazing person and i love him for what he has accomplished. if you aren't sure about buying this, you can listen to some tracks on youtube or spotify. i highly recommend this!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and is always exciting. There is really never any getting tired of it. Constant new challenges and items!!!! 5 stars definitely!
098478280X|4.0|Questions are great, I will recommend this book.<br /><br />However, I would to see more questions and less of theory.<br />Need more graph problems.
0345803507|5.0|The books was above 5 star.  I didn't want them to end.  They made you feel her emotions as she was feeling them.  Hope to see 3 more books
B0012TWRAO|5.0|Holds my Garmin GPS Map76csx securely and allows for easy removal/mounting and positioning. Highly recommended, does the job as advertised.
B00881VLCE|3.0|If I turn my kindle off or something it won't work and I have to un install it and re install it and get my puzzle back.  Other wise I love it.
B002NT3B52|4.0|A very impressive study of dog psychology; well documented.  I particularly like the anecdotes about the author's dog.  It helps me understand the behavior of my own dog better.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Love to play jigsaw puzzles and this one is so easy to play and has so many puzzles to choose from...even the free ones.I can't help but play every chance I get.<br />[[ASIN:B00881VLCE Magic Puzzles]]

B005MLOKXA|4.0|The challenges might be great but the good guys win in the end... usually... and with a few complications here and there. So many twists and turns each episode that it's like a soap opera but a high quality one.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|liked the movie very much. was somewhat upset when i found out was a trilogy, i was expecting to see the whole thing.
B00005JKBC|4.0|Robert Redford plays a CIA staffer on his last day on the job before retiring.  He learns about Brad Pitt, a former operative, being held in a Chinese prison certain to be executed.  When Redford's bosses are keen to disavow him and let Chinese justice take its course, Redford tries to arrange for Pitt's escape.  It is an interesting, but very unrealistic story line.  Nonetheless the acting is good and there is both suspense and humor.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Well written and very entertaining- with just the right amount of navel gazing.  Backpackers are a special breed and Ms. Strayed portrays the ultimate backpacking trip for the rest of us to enjoy, but not necessarily envy.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|I have owned this in VHS and DVD editions and lent it to friends.  Finally I broke down to buy the Blu-ray edition.  There is no special reason to get the Blu-ray edition as the film benefits only marginally from extra clarity, but there are many reasons to enjoy this classic comedy.  Bill Murray, in perhaps his best role, plays a self centered TV weatherman, assigned with crew to cover Groundhog Day in Punkwsutènay, PA.  He in anxious to get this gig over with, but is stranded with his crew in a snowstorm.  He awakes the next day to find himself stuck in time as well as place--it's still Groundhog Day and he has the same series of encounters--day-after-day-after-day.  How he copes with this set of circumstances makes the film worth watching.  Take it as a parable or just a good comedy, it is clearly worthwhile.
B0063HC7EQ|5.0|I have it forever now thankyou Kindle 13 more words to go your a joke Amazon you email me to add some stars...then you don't allow me to get out of here untill a title and all these words enough idiots
0805091742|5.0|This is a remarkable book and ought to be required reading for anyone who works in s afety critical field.  The central theme is the development and use of checklists in the operating room.  The author worked with a team to develop applicable and usef friendly checklists for use in hospitals.  These efforts were successful and the benefits--proven in actual operations--were spectacular.  The book traces the history of checklist development in aviation and other fields and offers a nice discussion of how to create a checklist.  If you are interested in the design of checklists--which is much more difficult than you imagine--this is the first source you should read.  But it provides a starting point for a systematic search of the literature.  I have actually purchased several copies of this book to give to others.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm so glad at how things turned out. Still makes me wish that there was more. Loved all the books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|What an amazing fantasy this one is.  I have looked my entire life for a Gideon Cross.  It is wonderful to be able to read about your own dreams.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|my kindle works and charges faster it fits betterI had to play with the cord before to make it work. this works great thanks
B00846REIS|5.0|Here is a wonderful love story that is amazingly easy to read.  The author has the ability to capture you immediately and leave you wanting to read more at the end.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|great movie, definitely thinking outside the box love Samuel L. Jackson played an outstanding role really enjoy the movie GREAT!!!
B008393Q2O|4.0|Color coding makes this easy to break out appointments, notes for the day, etc.  Great for keeping ideas and appointments organized.
0743518144|3.0|Where is the chapter listing? I see the track time but how am I suppose to know - for example, where chapter 2 starts?
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|A fabulous story.  Great casting and dialogue s. how baseball, a sport obsessed with keeping statistics, finally learned to use them and changed the recruiting/management processes forever
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It was a good app but it stopped working and said I have to download it again but it was really fun
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I bought this solely to support the series.  Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season (2008) was the best TV to come along in years.  It is much, much better when you can watch multiple episodes at a sitting.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Its a great multiplayer game. You have fun with your friends. You can battle online and visit your friends creations.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Story content made me forget about the grammatical errors. I recommend it for a good quick read. End of review.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good gameplay but cost too much to be good.same repeated sceens if you found them once you can find them again
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Initially got it to keep my granddaughters entertained but have found myself sitting on the sofa at night playing for hours!
B004UPANGM|2.0|A diversion at best, this movie is basically a mixture of absurd comedy and a weak attempt at horror.  I don't quite understand what everyone is making such a fuss over.  For free, it is passable but certainly not for everyone...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game super addicting and it always has new things for you to do whether its competing wig friends or beating you own high score its all around good as we'll as the sound and graphics a little glitchy on my kindle fire thouht
B004JK61K0|1.0|I never could get this to work for me.  You can remove this from my clouds.  I would appreciate it very much.
B009LDD22U|2.0|I'm sure the Blu-Ray release will be as crisp and gorgeous as ever.<br /><br />But, and while all shows develop over the years, TBBT is:<br /><br />* relying more on a laugh track<br />* jokes, as are entire episodes are nowhere as consistent regarding quality/comedy<br />* characters like Stuart are moved to the foreground in the credits but the underlying story arc is quietly dropped<br />* seeing Howard's mother in one scene now renders a lot of jokes made in earlier seasons less funny because the visage we'd seen doesn't really match up<br />* Sheldon, early on in the season, defended Leonard when Penny or someone was whining (very atypical but interesting) and this was dropped as well<br />* Amy is more of a jerk<br />* the couples seem more like \\"Friends\\" as opposed to the nuances of the first three or so seasons<br />* no more cool bits like the \\"corn starch and water that makes it solid in response to the percussive response of a speaker\\"... not even cool games (just the dancing Star Wars game with the big OTT caricature heads that no nerd, much less anyone else, would ever play because it's so outrageously bad...)<br />* we're laughing more at the characters than with them - true, the show has always had a mix of this, but as ideas have been getting thing, finding ways to laugh AT them has taken prominence<br />* even in some episodes, the cast appear to be phoning in their performances - the spark of the earlier seasons is not there<br /><br />It's been a fun show, and I expect it to last to season 8 or 9, but it is going the way of other shows Lorre has helmed in the past - total and utter burnout.<br /><br />Someone once said \\"Always leave them wanting for more\\".  That was decades ago.  These days it's the M.O. to dilute the show and drag it out into the lions' den to be chewed to microscopic shreds.<br /><br />Seasons 1-3 are the glory days.<br /><br />4-5 are cruising.<br /><br />6 seems schizophrenic and all over the place and the proverbial sharks were spotted.<br /><br />Despite high ratings (which only mean that many people watched and arguably enjoyed the show), the show is heading downward.  Populism was never my thing; if millions of people tuned into a 'reality' show that got its kicks from hurting people in real life, it is still not necessarily a good or right thing.  But centuries before there was television there was slavery, and millions loved having slaves too.  Phew, glad times changed on that...  and that didn't come about due to a popularity populist voting contest...<br /><br />Never mind 10 or 11 minutes of really aggravating commercials during the episodes; how do modern viewers sit through being treated like an imbecile so constantly? (Seriously; how commercials are made to lure can be an indication of what the company thinks of the customers in the target market...  like the one company that has to tell you what your thumbs are for when touching the screen complete with circus clown music blaring in the background, for example...)
B004UID2LC|5.0|This one is not hard for me to use.  I am new to using this kind of ape, once my grandchild explained it. I have been  enjoying every minute of it.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Finding Nemo..as well as many other Pixar films, is why Pixar is the King of CGi.. Nemo, is such a sweet movie, great for the whole family, and as usual, with a nice moral..My family has seen this movie many times before, but we just felt like viewing it again. :)
B007XNAQL0|5.0|From the first song that I was not familiar with I was intranced, excellent!!! This is without a doubt a &#34;feel good&#34; recording.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I normally don't care much for musicals, but my wife suggested we see this one because she knows that I like the Beatles.<br />Movie was excellent.  And the fact that all of the actors are singing the songs themselves makes it even more pleasurable.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is very expensive to play.fake money wise and real money wise. And neither fake Montreal money goes very far.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is awesome I like it because temple run is boring and this is just like it great app
B0042RJWTC|1.0|I bought the Tudors on my brother's recommendation. He knows how much I love European history. Well, the story started out well enough unitl it began skipping through part II and III of the first disc. I tried disc 2 and 3 and they did the same. I tried cleaner for the DVD's, a microcleaner for the DVD player and finally I bought another DVD player. I really wanted to watch it because the first viewable part was excellent! No luck!  I hope Hastings-to-go honors an exchange.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|The terminology was way too technical which combined with the Hawaiian names made reading difficult. Not the best Crichton book by far.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the storyline,hidden object games, puzzles, and graphics. Hard to put down. I can hardly wait for next one.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|There was so much to love about this movie! It was great for the kids and entertaining for the parents as well. I love how it was animated- with bright colors of birds and flowers.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|It is refreshing to hear music like this. Glad JT collaborated again with Timbaland. &#34;Pusher Love Girl&#34; is the jam!!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This movie was so we'll done that I enjoyed every minute. I never got into the series, so I wasn't familiar with all the characters, but that didn't matter.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|does not work with windows 8 so recommend not wasting you time, but it is this part of having to tpe something long to submit is a waste of my time too
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It`s a really fun game and it gives you goals to achieve and when you complete all of this there are some really cool things that you want to unlock.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|It gets better and better with every page. Anastasia Steele you are my hero! And Christian Grey you are my fantasy.
B0081336FO|5.0|We love this edgy mini series that delves into Sherlock's current existence as if he were alive today and solving mysteries with Dr. Watson in London.  Wonderfully cynical and quite enticing!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Because I need help with my homework and this is what helps me the most I love it it helps you a lot
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching this series during the first season was on.  I am not surprised it has become so popular.  Season 3 is really about the people and survival in general more than the zombies.  Sometimes you want to bop Rick on the head, but he always comes back.  Daryl has become my favorite character throughout the seasons.  I just do not want anyone else to die especially Daryl and Rick, and Hershall, and oh shoot nobody else, except the governor of course!  I wont give anything away but you have to watch all three seasons, it has been pretty intense so far.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I realy like this game I recomend it to people who like a challange but something thats not too hard to beat I've had it for about  a month, and I beat all of the normal plague types on casuel and normal but I having a hard time with brutal, but I guese thats the point
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again....<br />It has the perfect cast! It is one of my favorite Jane Austen movies!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A cool game for horse lovers like me and that's fine so what is with no way to trade coins for them
1616550414|5.0|This book was for our twelve year old son. He has spent hours going over the detailed art and learning more about the world of Zelda.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, but a real \\"tear jurker\\". I would not recommend it for anyone under the age of 18 because of its content, but I would recommend it to everyone else.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This is the fourth Harry Bosch novel I've read.  I'm glad at started at the beginning and have been reading them in sequence.  Each one gets better and better than the previous one.  There gets to be a comfort when you start a novel when you already have a mental relationship with the main character.  You're anxious to see what befalls them next, or what twists and turns their lives will take.  With Michael Connellys Bosch series I'm never disappointed.  I plan to keep reading this series until I catch up!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|So far the best game I played on my Kindle Fire! Just install it and have tones of fun! Piggies rulezzzz
B0052UYJDC|5.0|A very practical and motivational book, excellent value. It has definitely helped me make the mind shift to wanting to have less but only the best ... which I think will become my philosophy for how I want to live my life.
B0086900TI|3.0|Look, Adrien Brody is going to give you a great acting performance no matter what he's in. That's a given. Playing a character like this--lonely and intelligent is right in his wheelhouse. The problem given that is the filmmaking is way too artsy here. The flashback scenes look like bad Kodak film and are only hinting at what happened in Brody's character's past. We really don't get a clear picture of what exactly made him the way his character is in the movie.<br /><br />Given that, though, there are enough poignant scenes and with a cast that includes James Caan, Lucy Liu, Christina Hendricks, Marcia Gay Harden, Blythe Danner and William Peterson, there are plenty of underused heavy hitters in here. Yet the true star of the story is Sami Gayle who plays the very troubled young prostitute. She is a talent that is worth watching over the coming years.<br /><br />The extras are short on sweet on the DVD. A less than five-minute interview with both the director and Brody plus some Red Carpet interviews at one of the premieres.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Very intriguing premise.  Loved seeing Chris Noth in a non-Law and Order role.  Have always loved legal dramas and wish there were more available.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good book overall. Only complaint is the story dragged on longer than it had to in parts. Ending was good and fitting.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This model was not the one I wanted. I wanted the one with the brushes that can be removed for easy cleaning &#34;as shown on TV&#34;.<br />The adds do not say that there is a &#34;Swivel Sweeper&#34; and a new &#34;Swivel Sweeper&#34; with the removable brushes. Don't be conned by the adds that leave out this important fact.
B000FC13E0|1.0|I am so tired of authors thinking they need to fill these things with profanity.  To me, the need to use profanity is a sign of an unintelligent mind.  Stopped reading about page 10.
B000FA675C|5.0|I love Dan Brown.  Have read this book at least twice and look forward to reading it again.  Enjoy it.
B006ON41FC|2.0|This game was fun. WAS! If I try to play it it turns upside down and if I try to turn it the other way it just flips right back around. PLEASE FIX IT!!!!
0385349947|5.0|O read the introduction and thought, &#34;OMG!  This is exactly how I felt at the beginning of my career!&#34;  The book is a very good read about how women approach their careers differently than men and how we sometimes sabotage our own move up the career ladder.  I highly recommend it for young women who have ambition for reaching the &#34;C-Suite&#34; level in business.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Friendly is great it interfaces with my computer, galaxy and Kindle. It also imported all of my favorite blogs from Google's feed burner.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|We enjoyed Lincoln because we are Civil War buffs - it explained some things that I think all of us wonder about at<br />times.  We felt that it was very well done -<br /><br />I feel that anyone that is interested in Civil War history would benefit from this movie.
B009GJBEF6|5.0|This one has it all, from the opening sequence to the cool car, this is Pierce at his best as bond.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very good and challenging exercise, nice and calming music. Love to spend my time with it. Could be done again and again to practice your learning and memory abilities.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Great novel<br />Couldn't put it down<br />All the different characters were great for conveying so many stories that created the world
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome and  is the best game ever! Easy and fun! I couldn't ask for much more! Your mistake is that you do not have this awesome game!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I loved season 1, I really liked season 2 and this one was just ok.  I liked it because they were basically moral, when one stumbled we saw consequences, but overall they had values ( the good ones did).  There were the good guys and the bad ones.  I didn’t like the whole homosexual relationship they had to put into it.  I just don't want to see that, politically correct as it may be.  I don't believe everyone during that time period would have been so tolerant of it ether.  I probably won't watch the next season.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I really liked this movie. I like just about everything about Resident Evil except for the actual movies themselves not the animation ones. All the film movies sucks bad because it does not show off really what Resident Evil was about or the characters.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It is so good to see what is happening with the other character who we had little news of.  I was anxious to know about Tyrion and Jon Snow.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Very addictive! It could however be easier ton&quot;steer&quot; the shark, other than that no complaints.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|you should get this game it is so awesome you battle peopl make your troops tell when to battle get it
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Caught my attention on the first page. Simply amazing. Made for all ages. You will never want to put it down!
B0017P7MOO|5.0|One of the best records I've listened to in a long time.  I'm sad that it was out so long before I discovered it.
157421327X|5.0|This was very helpful in my new hobby.....Zentangle is the best! Very details, illustrations are great, will buy more soon.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|As a big time Beatle fan I will watch anything with any of the Beatles in it. This film covers the life of the &#34;quiet beatle&#34; from beginning to end. Not too many surprises but very enjoyable with his music and personal insights from family, friends and colleagues.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Although I have not read a great deal of history of this time period, I think it follows the history of the time period although I am not sure how  much  fiction is included, but it is very interesting, beautiful and educational.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trio of books is so beyond anything I have ever read before.  I had heard so much buzz about it that I had to see what all the fuss was about.  Amazing writing.  I was swept up from the beginning and caught up until the end.  I fell in love with the characters and ate my heart out through the ups and downs until the &#34;happily ever after&#34;.  I admit, some parts were too tough for me to read.  I had to do some skimming, but this is still one of the best things I have ever read.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Excelente producto cumple con las expectativas que buscaba y todo de excelente calidad, 100 % recomendado y compraría en otras ocasiones
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Didn't think I was going to like it by previews but it turned out pretty good movie after watching it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I was looking for a simple calculator for my kindle and this app exceeded my expectations.  I use it all the time and would highly recommend it.
B000I9WW4U|5.0|Great movie, great message, great ending .not a chick flick. Husband loved it too. Watched with 18 year old daughter who also loved it.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Love the writer's language. Great imagination, and twists in story. One of the best sic-fi series I've ever read, and Homeland is the best among the series, in my opinion.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game it's like having Diablo in your pocket with the feel of a Epic game it's hard to put down and keep from playing... My battery don't last anymore now... Lol....
B0042RJWTC|5.0|It is one of my favorite mini-series.  I loved the casting of the character and if there was anything wrong, it was not enought mini-series.
B000GWE44U|2.0|I have been reading all of Stephen King's books and wanted to see how this one converted to film.  The book was outstanding and I thought would have been hard to bring to film and I was correct.  While the book was painfully detailed of the adventures and trials while at the Overlook Hotel, the film just muddeled along hitting some high points and not explaining what they were.  If I had not read the book, I would have never understood the movie.  I thought the movie was a pathetic rendention of the book.  Not worth the $1.99 I paid to see it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|As usual, the book is better, but I thought the movie was well done. I will probably watch it again!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Just bought a Kindle Fire.  This sleeve is very nice.  Even has the word &#34;Kindle&#34; embossed on the cover. This is not a hard cover, just to carry it around.
B008X8QCTO|1.0|This game has taken forever to download. I wish I would have read through all the reviews before I bought this game. Would not recommend!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I wish it were longer. The storyline and graphics were wonderful. It definitely makes me want to try more of these types of apps.
B00873GRU4|4.0|I don't think I've ever read anything like this before, although it slightly reminded me of George Orwell's &#34;1984&#34; early on, however, this soon disappears from your head and you are consumed into this apocalyptic world.<br /><br />It is gripping, intriguing, exciting, and I can't wait to read the other two parts of this exciting trilogy
B003EY62II|1.0|I loved to the old Scooby doo but this was scary, and bad.  I am sorry they remade the old one.
0385349947|5.0|Sandberg has expressed what I have felt about being a professional woman in a traditionally male discipline.  She has validated what I couldn't put into words.  She has made many suggestions that women can adopt to stop holding themselves back, that men can do to support their partners, and that employers can pursue now to further rather than hinder half of their valuable employees.  Thank you Sheryl!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Always good!!  It keeps getting better and better.  Ease of downloads.  Would watch all of them again and again, Great!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love walking dead it is so good I would recommended it to anyone if they love a good zombie show
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This is a great movie for the whole family. I can watch it over and over again. My kids love it.
B003D0E3FM|3.0|I love watching old scifi movies because they did so much with so little technology.  Definitely had to have a good story; not like today when all people depend on is big technology which so often fails.
B0085LMFAE|1.0|Please read the better informed reviews of the audiophiles who rate this download 1 star for good reason.<br /><br />I do not have especially well-cultivated ears, but this is not the Graceland we know and love. It is a lot of flat noise. Save your money; this is not a bargain.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|Been searching for this movie for awhile.  DeNiro is great as the evil colonialist; and, Jeremy Irons is great also as the Jesuit priest.  The battle for land, treasure and God at the mercy of native peoples; disturbing but part of global history.  Will we ever learn?
B006IDG2T6|4.0|Enjoyable read, but ironic that the inside flap asserts that it \\"should\\" change the way that we think about certain things. Perhaps \\"probably will\\" or \\"may\\" as an alternative?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|On the whole it keeps my interest.  I wonder if the husband will ever get out of jail.  Can she continue to be good?
B00004TWSX|5.0|This is the least digital sounding A Night at the Opera I have heard (by the way, that's a good thing).  The Hollywood version is miserable.  The DCC's presentation is analogue & warm; the soundstage is beautifully wide yet distinctly whole without too much separation.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|A friend of my granddaughter (both age 8) found this gem and soon the two of them were having a ball.  Then my grandson (age 6) asked to have it downloaded to my Kindle. This game has replaced the bike and skateboard games as a favorite. There are many levels and although the kids get frustrated sometimes they keep on trying. This tells me they are approptiately challenged. There is shooting, which some parents may object to. But no blood. The graphics are appealing and the layout is interesting. The kids like that they don't always have to start over but can choose other spots to continue. Its definirely worth a looksee
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|the movie is good for an adventure, but the end was less than expected.  This based on the beginning of the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just love this tv series and the third season did not disappoint! Still a great show even after three seasons.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Fabulous~! Superior animation like non other.  The story line is fresh too.  I would recommend it to anyone who is a kid at heart.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I personally think that this book is very educational and  I think it's also very well written. I really enjoyed reading it.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I love this movie.  I don't just love it; I LOVE IT~!  Heart warming, funny, fresh story line.  Great animation and voice over actors are perfect for the characters.  Great casting.  I got this for my grandson age 5.  I watched this over and over before he even saw it.  He loves it too~!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so freaking awesome and I  play this game all the Time and never stop and I play it before I go to sleep to and in the morning I am blessed wit this game omg awesome
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have read all 3 of the books, and enjoyed each. & every one.  I am 76 years old, and still enjoy a good read, no matter the age group they were created for!  I loved all three of them!  Sure hope that never happens in real life!  Joan B.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app so much! I literally play it all the time and so does all of my friends.
1451627289|5.0|Very good price and it was fast to ship to me.  Very nice to deal with.  I will be buying from again.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|updated 08 july: the new update on the weather channel is horrible; updated and ruined ...i've used this app since i received my kindle in 2012 and have totally loved it (see old review at end here) but now i would not even give it one star .... an update tonight completely changed the the interface and added a background that overrides the weather, making it a piece of crap .... i have uninstalled it and will not be adding it back ... what a waste of a great app .... why wreck something that works so well ... i cannot understand that ... bring back the old app or give us a choice of whether we want to update/upgrade ..........<br /><br />(my first review from april 2013: the weather channel ... the  cities you want all in one place, with lots of info ... love it ...)
B0087YZBMS|2.0|Very disappointing compared to the previous album. All songs sound the same and cookie cutter.  The lyrics are all about love and relationship, which is ok but there is no heart, no pain or happiness.  It just kind of blends together.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|am removing it from my kindle today ... it is the most time-wasting app ... it is confused and confusing, too .... do better!
B007Y5IAV0|3.0|There´s some great songs on HARAKIRI like OCCUPIED TEARS, FIGURE IT OUT and WEAVE ON....but there´s A LOT of slow tunes, and while Serj still reminds the singer of SYSTEM OF A DOWN, he really change his style here....HARAKIRI is way way better than the previous IMPERFECT HARMONIES, but sucks if compared to the SYSTEM OF A DOWN albums or even Serj´s first good album ELECT THE DEAD....
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I loved [[ASIN:B008CLI4N4 Game of Thrones: The Complete First Season]]. I was hooked from the first show of the series. I think I am one of the few people that has not read the book series but I want to. So many books, so little time.<br /><br />I sat down and had a \\"Game of Thrones Season 2\\" watching marathon last night and loved season 2 also.<br /><br />Special effects especially the battle scenes and the frozen north are fabulous. The costuming is gorgeous. I loved Peter Dinklage in season 1 and love his character and superb acting in season 2 just as much.<br /><br />I love the battles, the strong women, the wildings, the frozen landscapes, the dragons (and can hardly wait until we see more of the dragons).<br /><br />I don't get HBO so I'll need to wait for Season 3 on DVD. Time passes too slowly sometimes.<br /><br />Oh, there's tons of female nudity in this season. Let's be equal opportunity and get some nice male specimens for the future seasons.
B000005KQT|5.0|I bought this cd after seeing and listening to the movie, \\"Cadillac Records.\\"  I know the movie plays fast and loose with the historical record, character development, Chicago blues, Chess Records...however, I am grateful for hearing about Walter Jacobs.  What a tremendous talent!  I bought the cd, ripped it, burned it for the am and pm drive, downloaded it on the mp3 player.  Time is short. If you love to hear rocking, Chicago Blues, the real deal genesis of Paul Butterfield and subsequent players, then this is for you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Writing was excellent, kept me interested. I would definitely seek out this author again.<br />Would recommend this book to anyone raising a teenager!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It took me a little while to figure out all the tricks of the game, but once I did I loved it! It doesn't take up too much time and is great for my kids!
B00881PPTO|2.0|Check out any of other travel sites in the world and you will find several hotels. One and done? Yeah right...
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love the format of pages.  User friendly +.  The extra information offered by way of video and interactive games and language knowledge quizzes is great.  I appreciate the etymological references the most.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love it! Highly recommend for the Kindle Fire HD. It is nice to be able to keep track of your battery life with a visual picture. Also love the warnings when the battery gets to 15% or lower.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I had bought the FGL EP with Cruise and a couple of other songs on it, and that was great.  This adds a few extra songs to make it a full length album, which is very good.  I pretty much like every song on it.
B000FA675C|5.0|This was the first of Dan Brown's books that I read and thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you saw the movie and didn't read the book you are missing a lot.  The book goes into more detail and brings out a lot more of Langdon's character and knowledge. If you didn't see the movie and want to I suggest that you read the book first.  It's a great &#34;solve the mystery&#34; type of book, with a course the woman co-star and the bad guy.  Everything you need for a good mystery.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great great book!!!  Think I will read this book twenty more times or more!!!  Could read every day for more on
B00AB7HESI|5.0|i really want this game so.plz lower this game under $.82 cents please i really want this game please lower price please!!!!
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|are you kidding this movie was unwatchable what a waste of film please stop making this c#*p. and put the money into the tv series
B004SBS8LA|4.0|As fun as I expected. A little more challenging than previous Angry Birds I have tried. Great for the true Angry Birds fan.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|She's in the other room watching them right now. She's happy, I'm happy. She said they're good & the set was complete.
B004P8A7J2|3.0|Interesting and very artistic; subject matter difficult and not appropriate for teens<br />unless used as a teaching tool with parental supervision
B005FDXT32|5.0|Been waiting for Scarface on Blu-ray for a long time and now its here. Horray!! I would like to give a great review on the movie, but dang, who hasn't seen Scarface yet. Its a masterpiece. And in all of its Blu-ray glory.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This adaptation of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; is very good.  I feel it could have been done in two films instead of three, but there are three definite parts of the book.  I have watched it twice to date and find that I saw things i missed the first atime around.  I have read all of the books more than once and I guess I was looking for the changes instead of just watching the movie.  There were seveal and I caught them all I think.  I don't see the reason for some of the changes but except them.  If you are a fan of the books I reccommend you see this movie and of course the next two to finish the story.  I look forward to the next installment.
B006H5120E|5.0|I'm not a 3D watcher yet, but when the time comes and I have that new 3D T.V. in my house, Titanic 3D will be there. For now I'm enjoying the Blu-ray copy with is exceptional.
B00947N6D8|4.0|I was surprised that this movie was good for adults as well as children.  The characters were well fleshed out and the concept put all our favorite characters in a completely new light.  I reccommend this movie for anyone.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great workout.  Jillian gives simple, clear instructions & encourages you through the workout.  The segments are tough, but short enough where you know you can get through it.  It is discouraging to see her abs (since she wears her pants so low) and then look at my own flabbiness!
B001DHXT20|5.0|I did not buy this version until after I had watched &#34;The Avengers&#34;.  This is my favorite version of &#34;The Hulk&#34; movies.  If you like the series of films about the Avengers then you need to watch this one also.  Even though the actor is different you still get a feel for whey Banner feels the way he does.  It is an integrel part of the story.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|Whereas many artists get redundant and obviously bored with their craft, Bonobo only seems to get better every time. I can't stop playing it. If it were vinyl it would be worn out already. I don't have any specific favorites but Cirrus is good and the video for it is one of the best videos ever. I have all his albums and and this one is going to be my favorite unless he out does himself again. This one has the same chilled out jazzy sound as his previous work but the sounds are quite new and they are brighter and sharper than his previous work. If I had to sum it up I would say this is one is more vibrant. There are no tracks that I feel compelled to skip over which is quite unusual for me.
B000FA675C|5.0|I enjoy this book because it was realistic. I am in such organization and I am proud that Dan Brown didn't not speak negatively but instead in truth for the most part on the organization.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|It had a great story line and kept me on my toes.  Good mixture of different scenes. It was good.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Ok, this game can not any better than it is.  The game is similar to something that my mom plays on Facebook.  This game is also addictive.  I've played it non-stop.  Get the game; it's FREE!!  It is very challenging and quick.  You have to be very quick 'cause you're timed.  That's why I love this game.
B001AQT11M|5.0|Disney animated movies are always good gifts for the grandkids. They are getting older now, so i probably will wait to see what they like these days.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is great especially when going out for a few hours. Just check the app for battery life a while before you go. This app means you'll always know how much time there is for reading, listening to music, watching movies, etc. It is as easy as it sounds and does exactly as it says.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read a large number of John Grisham's books. I enjoy his style of writing and until the end, I did not realize what the 'racketeer' was trying to accomplish.
B004X1U7DM|5.0|Beautiful modern instrumentation; soulful chants.  I listen to it often.  I enjoy Sacred Spirit 2 also. I highly recommend it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read most of Ken Follett's books. It was interesting to be able to view the WWII conflict from other sides of the war. The families made it more real and it amazes me how strong humans are for existing. I am eagerly awaiting the third book of the trilogy.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is the touching story of a family that is torn apart by death and the attempts of the father/husband to put the family back together again in the afterlife. I'm not known for crying during movies, but I can't watch this movie without at least tearing up. It's so sad, and yet, so uplifting at the end. It deals with life and death, true love, the afterlife, and the true power that a loving family has. I've never read the book that this movie is based on, but I've read a synopis of it and they are WAY different. If you've read the book but haven't seen the movie, expect MAJOR changes in the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone with a loving family, anyone who has lost someone close to them, and anyone who loves sappy movies. I usually don't watch movies like this (I'm more of an action junkie), but this movie touched my heart in a way that no other movie ever has. This movie especially moved me because I lost my mother years ago and the pain is still fresh. I like to think that she is in her own version of Heaven and is happy. So buy the movie, and have lots of Kleenex at hand when you watch it. You'll need them....
B000FA675C|5.0|Great book. Love to read it. Thanks Amazon and Dan Brown for the offer. I look forward to the next offer.
B002RZZIXU|3.0|This book had the potential to be very good but ultimately didn't live up to it.  Both female leads - mother & daughter - were affected and cold - it was hard to like/empathise with them.  Too many pointless characters in the daughter's story.  Liked the style of writing and the ending - which gave a good sense of the life of a spy
1401322786|5.0|I am only 18, and don't quiet fit the demographic age group for this novel. But I really enjoy Alboms novels. This has to be my favorite by far. It's very meaningful and deep. I read it in 3 days with a busy schedule as well. I recommend that EVERYONE READ IT!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fun 2 play against ur friends & u get money 4 each run u do I like this game
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think the app is fun! The objectives can challenge you and its fun to know how you compare with your friends! I only gave it four stars because it can be glitchy and I have died many times due to the glitches.
B000FA675C|5.0|I would surely recommend this book; it kept me interested, could not put the book (kindle) down. I loved it.
B003U4ZQRK|4.0|Another Great Season.  The cast that keeps you coming back for more.  Very impressive.  I like how the story takes you in different directions.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|I ordered this movie beacuse my nieces and nephew were visiting. They, as well as I, really enjoyed this movie. It is worth renting.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really fun game I have more than a million coins in three days I don't know y but it's addictive lol
6305327041|5.0|This is one funny movie and every time you watch it you are guaranteed to laugh your A@@ off. Favorite skit is the bellhop babysitting scene
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I had know idea what this show was about.  I came across it as a fluke and I am hooked!  I love attorney or crime related shows.  The Good Wife is a great mixture of both.  Great twist with the husband...
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I bought it and it doesn't download. I have tried a lot and it kept failing to download. Please fix
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the most memorable series I've ever read, period. Simply superb work by Orson Scott Card on this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can't put it down when I get a chance to read. I want to just keep reading to see what Ana and Christian are going to do next.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Now this is a good read! I can see this as a movie but the life lessons and interesting characters Harold meets along his journey are so rich and colorful I'm not sure I'd like to have people fill in the visions I have in my mind.  The author really pulled all of this together keeping the reader interested and wanting to know what happens next and why.  When our book club picked this for our monthly read I was skeptical at best but from the very first few pages I was hooked.
