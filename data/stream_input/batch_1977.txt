B008220DGE|1.0|Safe for Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance, this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  I want my money back.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|Jane Eyre is a wonderful story about love, tragedy, and faith. It invokes both tears of joy and tears of sorrow, and is inspirational in its religious messages. It is suspenseful, mysterious, and will keep you wondering and hoping until the very end.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|It was a cute movie. Those who like Glee or were choir groups will get a kick out of it.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|My family really enjoys this movie, good story, good acting, lots of entertainment.  Glad I finally purchased it.  Denzel...need I say more?
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire was a good read. This series is interesting. I will say that the first book thus far has been my favorite. Looking forward to book three and hoping for an unforgettable ending.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Defending Jacob...It kept my interest,was a fast read,a definite page-turner.  However, I skip over objectionable language.<br />Overall I would recommend it.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|\\"Waking up married\\" was funny,heart felt, and suspenseful. I loved the character's & the story of how one night could change your world! Sometimes when your not looking for love, that's when love finds you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book .  Living only a few miles from North Carolina, the little touches Nicholas adds about our area to his writing really helps me lose myself completely in his stories, as if I'm actually there observing all that is taking place. Another great love story coupled with trust, faith, and loyalty.  I was pleasantly satisfied with the surprise revelation that took place for the ending, with closure that left me feeling happy that I had read this book. I hope the movie ending is the same. Safe Haven contained enough suspense to keep the reader engaged.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|Wonderfully done movie with catchy tunes, characters and animation. Halloween and Christmas lovers will enjoy. Great family movie and not scary for the little ones. Good message.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Great series and easy to download. A little pricey in my opinion but we are enjoying it. Picture quality is very good.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The movie was pretty good. It still wasnt as good as the second one though. I liked Bane as a villian but he didnt come close to heath leather's Joker. This movie had probably the best Catwoman/Batman interaction of all the big screen movies. I hate when batman gets too sci-fi. The flying Batmobile ruined it for me. All in all, good movie. But not as good as the 2nd one.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|A friend recommended  the Jack Reacher series and after the first book (Killing Floor) I'm not sold. I don't read much fiction and much of the book is unbelievable. Mr. Child's writing style, to me, is very choppy, lots of short two and three word sentences. Some of the issues may stem from the fact that Mr. Child is British and his character is an American in the United Sates. Some of the words and phrases used just aren't part of the American lexicon.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyed the Harry Bosch novels as always. Michael Connelly seems to be much better at writing the detective stories than the lawyer stories to me. I will continue to read anything and everything &#34;Bosch&#34; that he writes.
B0048FQ0HU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD set. It shows you how things come to you by your thoughts, and how you can draw things to you.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|This is my secon time through the trilogy. First time it seemed to be 3 different stories as I read each novel individually in separate hard cover volumes. this time it seemed  Ipicked up a lot more connections and with the flow seemed to be eager to continue readingtill I got to the end even though I knew what was happening. Truly a great loss  to the world of literature when Mr. Larsson passed on.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This movie, along with the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, shows how being old (as we all will be) is not such a bad thing.  I'd love to spend my golden years in a house like that, with people of such calibre. Not just the actors - I know that's not real - but to be in a place where everyone shares a common heritage.  Bliss.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was the best season yet.  I did not start watching this show until a few months ago so I had a lot of catching up to do.
B008HK3XYK|4.0|This case was just what was needed to protect the new Kindle Fire HD and the Orange color makes it easy to find.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is another great read by author,Stephen King.  It is one that \\"I couldn't put down but didn't want to end.\\"  Having been 7 years old when JFK was assassinated, the subject was compelling to me. I think so many of us remember the days of Camelot (even through a child's experience) and wonder longingly \\"what could have been\\" if he had lived.  The story carries the reader on the journeys through time and we are there. I loved the exploration of the ramifications of what may happen if time and history are messed with, even with the best intentions. although Stephen King is a favorite author of mine, 11/22/63 shows his ongoing evolution in writing. When I suggest this book to those who may have a pre-conceived idea of how SK may tackle any subject, I appeal to them to pick it up and start reading. The story's journey will carry them away willingly.

B000SP3DE2|5.0|I just held a &#34;Dracula&#34; marathon.  I watched everything from Nesferatu to this one.  The original Dracula was great with Bela Lugosi; Frank Langella's was hot, but Gary Oldman absolutely nailed it in this film.  Great story, great visuals, great special effects.  Winona Ryder was just OK.  Why they cast Keanu Reaves is beyond me.  Sir Anthony's Dr. von Helsing was a bit over the top.  But, I still just loved it!

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|the idea behind the movie was great, but it was very poorly executed. I didn't care a fig for any of the characters.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|My son programed this into my Kindle.  I know I will use it a lot to check the weather not only in our area, but other parts of the country.
B005LAJ16I|1.0|The dvd;s that were sent to me were for a different region so it would not play in the region that I live in
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game has wonderful graphics and the soundtrack isn't bad either. However, this app does require a &#34;powerful&#34; device to run it properly. Sadly my Droid X was not fit for the task.<br /><br />When the game was first started, the sound was stuttering and I was having trouble just trying to access the options to make changes to the graphics settings. After making the necessary changes, I was able to start the game. However, within minutes I found myself a dozen blocks beneath the surface and I was trying to get out! Sometimes the sensitivity of the touch screen comes back to bite me and other times the size of the in-game joystick and button were hard to interact with.<br /><br />In conclusion, this app does work and it has potential for owners of tablets and cellphones more powerful than the Droid X. If you have a Droid X, you may encounter some problems.
0525952926|5.0|Loved every page. I read this book in just under 4 days, and could hardly put it down. Ken Follett has done it again!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Clear characterization. I enjoyed learning each character, and am happy she ended with Peeta. Never a dull moment! So happy to read this trilogy.
1589795474|5.0|This book was a masterpiece at it's time. When I re-read it now, could relate to so many things that was missing back then in my life ; kids, schools, own home, stock market crisis and so on. You too might find it the same way - a kid going to college,buying a home, your parents very old and need your support and so on..<br /><br />An average first generation millionaire is high net worth , low esteem guy who has his own small business. He drives three year old used car and buys car by the pound ( ford pickup is 30k and 600 pounds.. so it is cheaper vs BMW which is 45k for 500 lbs) ,He shops at Sears, has a master/visa card from Sears and JCPenney. Wife's are much more prudent savers than husbands ( I can't get my wife to spend money)<br /><br />And snippets of words of wisdom:<br /><br /> > Never tell children that  you are wealthy;<br />>  If you are not yet wealthy and want to be someday never purchase a home that requires a mortgage that is more than twice the your households, total net income.<br />> Spend plenty on education. Most millionaires consider private schools as investments<br />> Teach your children frugality<br />> Never give cash gifts to kids until they are 45. Authors call it the EOC; Economic outpatient care that destroys kids.<br />> If the kids grew well, they would be high esteem respectable professions like doctors,and money would be third or fourth in their list of priorities.<br /><br />Plenty of pages can be skipped as they drill deeper and deeper on every area...<br /><br />It was Great book back then, now it is just greater...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great graphics and really fun to play. Animals are reasonable to get even in free game play which is a nice change from other apps.

B0078XGEK2|3.0|I liked the way we should not necessarily subscribe to a set of rules and how sometimes intuition and the way we care for others is more important than following a conventional approach to healing and relationships.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Every book of James Rollins is fascinating to me. The pace keeps me hooked. The twists make me groan. The tidbits of romance are a great addition.  I can't wait until the next book to read.
1452101248|5.0|A gorgeous cookbook to look at, and the recipes are wonderful--you won't miss having meat on your table with these. The chickpea/tomato/bread soup is a winter staple in our house--even my two children love it. The author's ability to combine flavors of herbs and vegetables and grains or legumes is amazing--they are deeply satisfying, and never leave you wishing for more, unlike some other vegetarian recipes.<br /><br />My only quibble with this book is that sometimes the proportions are off--way off: one dish provided at least double if not triple the amount of dressing needed, leaving the dish swimming, but I drained some of it out, made a note for next time.<br /><br />Look forward to testing out his newer book, Jerusalem.
B004UJ81IA|5.0|This is one of the classic &#34;travelogue&#34; writings from the 1870's.  Unlike Mark Twain, Stevenson chose to make his travels with Modestine, a female donkey.  Highly entertaining.
030758836X|5.0|What an amazing story. The twists and turns and surprises from the past that pop up keep you always wondering if you really know what's going on and who's who. How the author managed to develop this plot and then drop in all the surprise elements still has me amazed.

0307346617|3.0|I had no idea what to expect from this book.  It is well written and very imaginative in places.  At first I enjoyed the novel approach of the book, but later found myself wishing it would become more story-like.  As a series of interviews, it works well, but I guess I wanted something different.  For me, it fell flat in the end.  But,  hey!  Don't be afraid to give it a try, your mileage may vary.
0446554995|5.0|In this, the third and final installment in the \\"Fever Dream\\" triolgy, if you will, Preston and Child once again deliver up a \\"thrill-a-minute\\" fast paced suspenser that will hold you and entertain you as always. (How DO these guys keep this up?)<br /><br />I never cease to be amazed at the complexity, yet clear logicality (as they unravel their plots), of these two author's collaborations on these fascinating stories conjured up for FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast! As usual, a large and (though almost-impossible-to-believe) varied masterpiece of story-telling, \\"Two Graves\\" is the final chapter on \\"what happened to Helen\\", Pendergast's wife, whom he has believed was killed in an accident 12 years before. This story began with \\"Fever Dream\\" in 2010, and continued in 2011 with \\"Cold Vengeance\\", and now concludes after 1,270 pages of unbelievably interesting plot-twists, murders, tortures, explosions, etc., etc., in a \\"smashing finale\\" that is sure to please all fans of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child, and once again delight lovers of Agent Pendergast and his dark and dangerous, strange, exploits.<br /><br />You will finally get to learn just where to, and why, Helen disappeared years ago, learn that she is alive, and yet if this is so, then just who's was the body identified as Helen's. There are many many dark and strange, and frankly horriffic incidents and happenings in this book (or, in truth, the whole trilogy, as those who have read the prior two installments will already know), which, for me, point back sharply to another great suspenser from years ago, Ira Levin's \\"Boys From Brazil\\". Also, amazingly, I drew a very strong connection to \\"Das Rheingold\\", Richard Wagner's \\"introductory\\" opera in his great Ring Tetrology....perhaps you may also gather a thread as a connect to the little Niebelungs, after their separation from Alberich once he has fashioned the formidable ring from the gold that he has stolen from the rheinmaidens.<br /><br />Always aware that you, the prospective reader, can only experience the full effect of a story once (like, also, with viewing a movie), I make a conscious effort not to deliver up anything that remotely would become a \\"spoiler\\" to your total enjoyment of this fantastic thriller.<br /><br />There are 374 reviews here ahead of mine, and thus I trust you will take my word, this is an awesome book for your \\"consumption\\" with your reading time. HOWEVER, Please Be Aware that this is the third and final installment of a very large story and you REALLY MUST start with \\"Fever Dream\\", progress through \\"Cold Vengeance\\" first, before cracking the cover of this highly entertaining edge of your seat suspenser.<br /><br />Enjoy,<br /><br />~operabruinat you, the prospective reader, can only experience the full effect of a story once (like, also, with viewing a movie), I make a conscious effort not to deliver up anything that remotely would become a \\"spoiler\\" to your total enjoyment of this fantastic thriller.<br /><br />There are 374 reviews here ahead of mine, and thus I trust you will take my word, this is an awesome book for your \\"consumption\\" with your reading time.

B005NPCUC8|5.0|One of the 10 best rock albums ever recorded.  Every song is well-written and performed.  The entire album hangs together beautifully.  If you haven't heard this (and it's hard to imagine that's the case) you definitely need to buy it.
0765325950|5.0|The book was pretty much full of battles the entire book. As I read I kept feeling the climax should be in the next scene, on the next page, or perhaps the next chapter. I was painfully aware of how Tolkien's Return of the King ended well before the end, and gave us plenty of resolution. But in this book, certain story lines kept getting dragged out like a Shubert sonata. So often when I expected a resolution to a story instead I read of more adversity. So these bad events kept happening to characters which sometimes seemed to serve no purpose, but pad the story-line. As I read the book, it was with apprehension that I would observe how much of the book was left. As the remainder shrunk and shrunk and the story was still not resolved my disappointment grew. The end finally came with about four or five pages left. It kind of felt like listening to a complete symphony composed in G Minor only to have the last 4 measure written in the key of A sharp major. In other words a satisfying but jarring ending. After more than four million words it seems kind of miserly to delay the climax in such a manner.<br />Now I have read that Jordan had already written the last chapter of the book, and that it was essentially copied and pasted into this book. Perhaps that posed as a constraint to any literary freedoms for Sanderson in crafting the ending.<br /><br />Having said that, I thought the ending was quite brilliant. It was smart, clever and we finally learn the true secrets of Callandor. The narrative was split up I suppose so as to build suspense. It prevented the eye from wandering onto the next page and perhaps spoiling the ending. Therefore a moment of utter defeat is turned into a scene of triumph a few pages later. But between those points you have to read about some other supporting character.<br /><br />The core of the book was battles. Battles in many different places. A high-level view of the battles was always minimized to maximize a personal story instead. It made for reading about the same thing over and over again. So, I read about trollocs, trollocs and more trollocs. I finally got tired of reading about one more charge into the trollocs and skipped some scenes dealing one particular character. Some of the battles suffered from a lack of maps. The book does supply a single map of one battle-field but other major areas had no map and so the story suffered.<br /><br />The book contains all the major characters and gives them ample coverage. Most of the powers given or implied to the characters is finally played out. Therefore the story lines concerning them feels like fun and games. Mat is more Mat that in a lot of other books. Perrin was also fun to read about - finally. Previously Perrin was always the most boring character doing the most boring stuff. But even he played a super important role in the end. Having said that, there was also a lot of book dedicated to utterly minor characters. It may have been nice to show how even an unknown, inconsequential person can also achieve great things. And something like that can work when their story is told by a narrator. But when there is no narrator (One of the reasons there is 14 books and not 7)and their story is shown, and not told, it becomes wearisome.<br /><br />There were a few moments of humor in the book. I found myself laughing here and there, especially in the scene where Rand and Mat finally reunite. That was one of the best chapters in the book. After buying the first book when I was in high school 22~23 years ago I was anxious to find out how it ended. So I read this at night for 3 nights straight while my family slept. I was totally immersed and when I had to put the book down I felt like I was waking from a dream.<br /><br />I bought an autographed copy of the book that contained both Brandon and Harriet's signature. There was someone else's signature named 'Maria'. I am not a big fan of e-books, since I refuse to allow someone else to dictate when what I can do with my property. So I happily paid the full price for the autographed copy of the book. Plus I can now keep this book for the next 5 decades when all those kindle's e-readers will be rotting in a garbage pit.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book starts out very slow. At times I wanted to put it down, but figure that since I had it I would try to read it. About  1/3 into the book the story line picks up. After that I could not put it down as I wanted to find out what happens next.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|my kids enjoy it a ton... my 6 yr old plays it all the time and my 2 yr old love to just watch him

B009X01ELC|5.0|It's easy on the hands, has a flap to tuck my hand in, is soft, and best of all, you can use the revolving feature to have landscape or portrait standing up in one of three positions.  Very convenient and just what I wanted.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Movie was OK, but not worth $3.99. Not as much action as I would like and outdated time travel concepts
0765325950|4.0|Note: This review is free of spoilers.<br /><br />I have been reading the Wheel of Time since discovering it more than 15 years ago. This book has been a long time coming. Overall I was pleased with the ending, but it had a bit of a melancholy feel to it. Not the book itself, but just the fact that the book was the end. It was satisfactory, and it created closure, but it was like saying goodbye to an old friend.<br /><br />I think Brandon Sanderson handled himself well, but the book did have a different feel to it. I should note that I love Brandon Sanderson and I've ready nearly every book he's written, so this is not at all a criticism of Sanderson. With that said, one of the things Robert Jordan excelled at was creating grandiose settings. People accused him of writing a story that plodded along. That is a valid complaint, but it plodded along because of the richness and detail that he painstakingly put into his writing. Sanderson, on the other hand, excels at creating compelling characters, exciting action, and brilliant pacing.<br /><br />This entire book felt frantic. Everything moved quickly and there was a great sense of momentum. It was as if a freight train was barreling down the tracks and couldn't be stopped. Some of that comes from the fact that the book essentially covers The Last Battle. Naturally the climax of a 14 book series will be somewhat frantic. However the book does seem to lose some of the grandiosity and depth. The characters were treated well, and the different plot lines were merged elegantly, but sometimes it felt like something was missing. It didn't distract from the book, which was enjoyable, but it was a nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right. Part of it comes from the fact that this book has been built up in my mind for quite some time.<br /><br />My one big criticism, which is the real reason I didn't rate this as 5 stars, is the fact that the very ending (the last 20-30 pages) seemed very rushed. It was as if everythingsuddenly fell together and just ended. Despite the length, I Really would have liked to see 50-100 more pages that gave a bit more closure. I would have liked to see something like the ending of Return of the King where the ring is destroyed, but the denouement was satisfying and not abrupt. I think perhaps the intention was for the reader to simply imagine how the Pattern would weave, and there's certainly some argument to be made for that. However, it just felt as if there was some external pressure to keep the book to a certain length so some scenes were cut.<br /><br />Overall the book was well written and thoroughly enjoyable. It was a very satisfactory ending to the series, and I applaud Sanderson for his work. I just wish there had been a little bit more. Still, I'm not sad or disappointed. For those that haven't read the series I highly recommend it. Now that it's over you don't have the excuse of \\"I don't want to start an unfinished series.\\"
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love it so much, great<br />I love this series it brings me back home, I love everything about it.  It has all the elements you would want to keep you so involved with all their lives.  I can't wait to see it and don't want it to end.
B001C08RHA|5.0|What a great movie from begining to end!  Great Story Line, Great Cast, So Much Action!!!!  This was a the perfect choice to start off the entire super hero Avengers saga.  It gets a little slow between the half way to the third quarter of the movie but makes up for it in the end.  After watching this movie you will want an Iron Man suit for yourself!
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I reviewed several turntables expressly for the purpose of converting from vinyl to digital before settling on this one as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is very happy with the ease of use and quality of the digital files. Excellent value.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|Great movie, plenty of action and a must see before you see Marvels The Avengers.  It has a good story line following the first Iron Man movie but I have one problem with this movie.... Lt. Rhodes is a different actor who is nothing like the one from the first movie.  This new guy  is more scrawney and looks so weird once he puts on the War Machine suit, it makes him like 3 feet taller then he is without the suit.  Other than that it's a good movie and Robert Downey Jr. is awsome as Iron Man.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was fantastic from start to finish, story plot was great and the ending couldn't have been any better!

B00005JKWJ|4.0|For those Vampire movie buffs, check out this movie.  Plenty of action, blood, fighting, it's got it all!  Great Special effects... also check out Blade the first in the series whick is a little darker and Blade 3 which has a little more questionablity about the story line but is still good.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I received this in the mail today. I've already cut about 10 wine/liquor bottles. This is by far the best 20 bucks I ever spent! Almost perfect cuts. I watched a youtube video (greenscience.com)on how to do this flawlessly and it's very much working for me. You only need to score the bottle ONCE. After that I used boiling hot water. I just gently poured it on the score line and immediately afterwards placed it under cold running tap water and back again to the boiling water. As soon as I did that it broke apart perfectly every single time. I did have one bad break. I was using a vodka bottle. Other than that this product is actually pretty amazing and I would highly recommend it. I used a sandpaper cloth to smooth out the edges and it took me all of 30 seconds.<br />I don't understand the negative reviews. For me it worked exactly the way I wanted and needed it to work. All I can suggest is not over scoring. It may seem like the product isn't doing anything, but it is. I read the manual and it states that while scoring you will hear only a slight sound or no sound at all.<br />You will see the scoring line but it's very faint. I only wish I could upload some photos and show you all, but I'm unsure how to do that.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Great movie, best of the best as far as Star Trek movies.  Everything was awsome from the cast to the special effects!
1451695187|5.0|Very good book and an easy read. I read the entire book over 2 days.  I couldn't put it down.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Great Movie, much better than the first movie that came out before this one.  The mad that playes Dr.Banner is great, I wished he was the Hulk in The Avengers Movie!  Liv Tyler is awsome.  Great effects, fights, action... A must see.  I don't think there's anything bad about this movie!
034580404X|5.0|My wife wanted the set, so I got it for her.  This is like a chick's version of Penthouse forum.  My wife made it halfway through the first book and hasn't picked it back up.  Maybe though should include pictures like penthouse....
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Even though I haven't finished reading it. I like it. I recommend it to anyone who likes the halo series
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|I can remember trying to explain the lyrics to my mom when I was a teenager...she never got it!  Awesome to have this on DVD.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This life proof case is great. Not to big like some of the other type of case out. well worth the money. Shipping was fast.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|Just happened to find this cd because I thought it was not available. I love it and am totaling satisfied
B0096BIENY|5.0|Il Divo  greatest hits is great, they are all great songs but some are better and there are a few that I think are great that didn't make this C-D but then you would have to include all that they have recorded so far, I have their DVD'S and watch them a lot, these guys are very good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. But you have to have an a count to highlight and take notes. Great size text and different verses
B006KX3GXO|4.0|Fix upside down issue and it's my favorite!!! When I turn on the camera through the app I'm Always upside down, all the other features are fun and easy to use.
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|I really enjoyed this game, but it only took about an hour to beat with three stars on all levels. Update: You can earn a crown on each level by finishing it up to four different ways (earning 0, 1, 2, and 3 stars).  Some of levels are quite challenging to finish with zero stars, and earning all of the crowns added several more hours of play time.
1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed reading this Neurosurgeons true experience, and how his experience opened his eyes to our Creator.  I actually read this book in one sitting, it was really good.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Purchased this for kids and they really enjoy playing it! The only gripe I have, like others, is that I had to pay again to open another level--not cool.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|a veritable cornucopia of jewel matching and treasure winning fun! Beautiful to look at and a delight to play with very good audio rewards as well! Fast to download to the Kindle and runs like water. Good work Alawar!!!
B002ZG97EC|4.0|I just love this movie and so do all my family.  A lot of the humor is more geared towards the adult, but my grandaughter who is 2 likes the funny moments.  I have watched it over and over.  Love the stuffed unicorn scene &#34;It's just so fluffy!&#34;  LOL.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's insights have served only to bolster my own thoughts about our lives here  -- and hereafter.  I'm recommending this book to all my friends.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I like the game but you need gems to buy certain ponies that are necessary, and gems need to bo bought with actual $$. Also, it is impossible to visit friends using a different OS, so it's impossible to earn hearts as well, in addition, you can't even buy hearts. Plus, their customer service is awfully slow in getting back to you with solutions to issues.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book started out a little too teenager-ish for me. About 25 pages in I was about to call it quits because as a 36-year-old married mom, the tone of it was extremely young for me.  Also, the fact that the best friend is named \\"Six\\", like the best friend on the 90's sitcom Blossom, just kept bugging me. I agree with the reviewers who said that it should be in the Young Adult category.<br /><br />But....I kept going and it got much better.  The romance between Sky and Holder is very romantic, intense, and passionate.  I kept turning the pages, wanting more, and becoming deeply engrossed in them. The plot twists are a bit dark and somewhat predictable, but still emotional and gripping.<br /><br />I don't think this book is perfect enough for all the 5 star ratings it has gotten, and it definitely wasn't the life changing experience some people are reviewing it as, but it was very good.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's fun figuring out how to get from one point to the next.  But, after you use your 3 &#34;hints&#34;, you can only get more hints by purchasing them.  I am considering uninstalling this app.
0988262592|5.0|If you're in the insides of IT, of development, of operations or in between and you start reading this novel and @realgenekim and his fellow co-authors seem to have been watching and recording your own company's DevOps for months and months just to wring it into the novel, this simply hurts. You're discovered and presented the public, you feel. Keep on reading. The revelation after some 100+ pages is even more worth it the deeper the valley feels they dig for and with you.<br /><br />Your approach to how things have to be handled when wanting to be successful - not only in IT but in your entire company - will never be the same after having read this!<br /><br />Thanx for getting me in touch with this marvellous piece of IT literature!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I think until they can figure a way to show adds on a phone or tablet we won't be able to make the same type changes onf facebook as can be done on a home computer. I don't like that the option to delete posts, unless they are your own, doesn't exist.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|Could be a little larger. The house is smaller than Steve. Hopefully, more scenes will be released...maybe a Netherworld. Great for a Minecraft fan, but bad for a toy.
B004NELBPC|4.0|My number two news app. My complaint is:  there is more celebrity coverage than I care for and a tendency to go too soft on the left. Still........it's a good app.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love this app!  It gives you the latest news in a magazine format on your device.  It lets you choose what sources you want from a variety of categories.  A must-have for anyone who wants to stay up to date on news, sports, travel, etc.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Flipping thru the news makes perfect sense and you can streamline the variety of news you receive. E.G. I don't care what celebs are up to, so I can choose not to select off that particular feed. I wish more apps used this type format.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Having just been exposed to Mahjong my my grandkids, I got this to practice the game.  There are a variety of patterns and it runs times so you can see the improvement if you play the pattern again even though the tiles change.  One thing I haven't figured out is how to choose which &#34;cat&#34; matches which, as they all look alike.  There is probably a trick to it but I don't read the directions much, just fool around.  It is one game I keep going back to.
B001NN4162|5.0|This is a great movie!  The Blu-ray makes watching it like you are seeing it at a theater.  My daughter loves this movie.  It is one of Disney-Pixars best!
B00632HWOG|5.0|that way i can read my mail where ever i go. I love it so easy to use and load
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This Facebook app works very well. I have not a single complaint about this app.  I purchased the Kindle Fire HD for reading books, and it has been a wonderful surprise.  The apps such as Facebook have been an added bonus for me.
B000J103PC|4.0|I got this for my daughter.  She saw it on TV and wanted to have the movie.  She likes the lessons she found in the movie.
B0093OGBL6|4.0|I like this book.  It is well-written, and has facts and information that I had not read before.  It is refreshing, and I recommend it.  I would have given it five stars, but it does not have photos of the king, which I feel would have added to the book.
B00005JPCF|4.0|She loves the cartoon movies.  She really loved this one.  The liked the singing and dancing and how they worked together.
B00003XACV|5.0|My husband has been trying to find this soundtrack for years.  They do not carry it on I-Tunes.  Amazon was the only place he found it.  He loves it.  Thomas Newman has created the scores for numerous cinema notables.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Got this for my daughter.  She was a fan of the story and we have all the books.  Now we need to have all the movies.  She just loves watching each of them and how the kids change over the years of filming.
B0018LMKIK|5.0|What can I say.  There is only one CCR.  Great songs....great musicianship....memories recaptured.  I was amazed at how many hits were done by CCR that I had forgotten.  Swamp Rock at it's best!
B005LAIHR2|2.0|The movie was enjoyable so I sent a copy to my sister and it didn't play on her DVD player. So it had to be returned for another which also didn't play on her DVD, but did play on her son's X-Box. Can't recall, but didn't notice in the description what Ultraviolet (think that's it) really was. It was a bummer.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great love story! Has it all! Keeps your attention from the first word til the last. No wonder it's rated #1.
0385535147|5.0|You will not want to put it down once you start reading.  Once again John Grisham keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|The movie came in quicker than I expected. I have been looking everywhere for this movie everywhere and for some reason they were all gone or way to expensive. I am glad I found this movie for a better price. The movie came just in time for my nephews birthday and he loves the movie so much. THANK YOU!!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Quick, fast paced read. Reels you in quickly & keeps your attention for the whole story while leaving you wanting more.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|absoultely awesome!! This game has just the perfect amount of intrigue &amp; mini puzzles. Not to mention an unbeatable price. Gotta go start on 2nd &amp; 3rd now-can't wait to get started
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Sums it up nicely! I see parallels with this world in my life today.  Very intense story, yet an easy read.
B005LAIHCW|5.0|Now we are talking about real family secrets with severe consequences!!!<br /><br />This is a very good movie with an outstanding cast and great direction. And a twist at the very end...<br /><br />It is a story that could happen in any street, in any neighborhood, in any country. Accidents happen every day. But when you have hippie parents who smoke dope, well that's another story.<br /><br />Sarah (Elisabeth Shue) and her teen daughter Elyssa (Jennifer Lawrence) arrive in a small town because Sarah just got a new job. She works long hours at the hospital and her daughter has the time and the freedom to do whatever she wants. Sarah is recently divorced and didn't take care of her daughter in the past. Elyssa reminds her of this fact constantly and appears that she misses her father. Now Sarah is overplaying her mother responsibilities which promote a lot of tension between her and Elyssa. They move next to a house where a terrific murder happened few years ago. A girl killed her parents and then disappeared. Most people think that she drowned in the near lake, but they never found her body. Her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) came back from college to take care of the house. He lives there now quietly. Everybody in town (with few exceptions) thinks that the boy is a weirdo and ...of course a high school adolescent (Elyssa) will fall for him since everybody else is beating on him (...classic).<br /><br />From the beginning of the movie, the moment they get in their house we have the feeling that something horrible happens in front of us but we are not getting an answer until the very end of the movie. And then, when we think we got the plot straight, the very last scene (...seriously, the last 10 seconds) throws a wrench in everything we thought we knew. And while the titles are rolling we say: Well, I have to watch it again to understand better...Really well done, and Jennifer Lawrence and Elisabeth Shue are superb.<br /><br />Five stars all around for the excellent acting, the script and the direction. All great!ting, the script and the direction. All great!
B006WQLH7G|4.0|I can only hope it works as well on the Kindle as it does on my Lap Top.  It is difficult to assess prevention!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I needed a calculator on my Kindle Fire, and this one provided exactly what I needed.  If you turn the Kindle sideways the calculator changes into a more powerful calculator.  They even give you a few styles to chose from!  Highly recommend!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game, just takes awhile to level up if you don't want to pay for<br />coins. Still a great game to play.
B00AQMSJI2|5.0|A easy game to learn with the in-game help start. Best part for me is the sailing and shooting sea monsters and ships. The building and placement is a bit tricky but then again carefully planning can solve that easy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I literally could not put this down! I read it in just about a day. When all the pieces of Sky's puzzle was coming together I just couldn't believe it! I felt like I was going through the emotions just like her.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|the picture quality is not good and it only takes pictures upside down.  It does turn them around after they have been taken but who really wants to take a picture upside down.  some major updates need to be done to make this better.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This is not just for children at all. I really enjoyed it.  I have read the Wicked series so I wanted understand where it came from.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire!  this is a good app and I have hours of fun with it.  I would recommend it.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Fun and beautiful game that is a joy to play. It take a while to become a real challenge.  Most of the difficulty lies in the puzzles
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I am addicted to facebook.  This app is good but I would recommend making it easier to navigate.  My iphone and computer are really easy to navigate.  The app on kindle is different.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I was looking for something new to read when I ran across this book. I read the first couple pages and decided to give it a try. The more I read the more the story pulled me in. The main character is so easy to relate to with his struggles and spurts of bad luck. The story is fantastic and I recommend it to anyone who wants a new book to add to their favorites.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I thought this book was just as interesting as the first. I couldn't put it down and read all three the same week!
B00511ONPG|5.0|I'm the pastor of a small church, and wanted to figure out how we could use Facebook to make ourselves known locally. Mr. Kerpen's book lays out easy-to-understand ideas that translate regardless of the size of staff (and frankly, don't impact the budget much). Kudos to him for taking something he's an expert in and making it easily relatable to a much less nuanced but interested party.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I love this version. It is the best Pride and Prejudice version I have seen in the last ten years and would recommend to all my Pride and Prejudice friends!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinning on the move, this app is perfect!! I love pinning from Facebook to my Pinterest page!! It is worth downloading this app!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I can't wait until the third series comes out. I have been on the edge of my seat watching Downtown Abbey. I recommend it to all my friends!
B0095R64AO|3.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie, but I read some negative reviews.  I decided to watch it anyway.  Well, it was a little bit depressing!  I was looking forward to a humorous, light movie.  If this is what you are looking for, do not watch this movie.  Don't get me wrong, there are a few funny parts in the movie, but overall it had more of a gloomy tone to it throughout the majority of the movie.  It was also way too long.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Ok so this is a very interesting game. The graphics are nice and I have had no problems so far. I enjoy the puzzles after I played ten minutes I knew I would buy it. I did and I am glad!!
B0038AUY96|5.0|Jo Nesbo has the knack of running several great plots at once, all keeping your interest, fascinating sometimes very complex characters,  aside from Harry of course!  Books are hard to put down! I love them!
B00ARAO0WM|2.0|I wanted some mindless entertainment one evening. I found it -- with a bonus lame &#34;love&#34; story.<br /><br />Some of the cycling scenes were good, but hardly good enough to support this turkey.<br /><br />Jason Gordon-Levitt was compelling in Batman: The Dark Knight Rises. He shows a few glimmers of depth in this movie but given the script, I wouldn't expect much more from Brando.<br /><br />If you need something on during a party, have the flu, or just like &#34;super bad cool kids versus mean old white bad cops&#34; flicks, rent this.
0765325950|5.0|There was quite a few years I was despairing. The books was coming slowly, and the plot began to stretch out more and more. The big turnaround began with \\"Knife of Dreams\\", and Brandon Sanderson have been keeping up the pace.<br /><br />Relistened to all the books on audio before this one was released, and the whole series works a lot better when you don't have to wait two years between each book. And this book is the crowning achievement of a legacy that began 1990 (or 1994 for me, which was when I began reading it).<br /><br />And I have to thank Harriet for making me discover Brandon Sanderson. Had no idea who he was before \\"The Gathering Storm\\" and now he is one of my favourite (now living) fantasy-writers.
B002Q7JYPC|4.0|I enjoyed most of the many songs on the CD. A few were new to me. Good background music to share with the family. My favorite was No More Cloudy Days. Good price and fast shipping, thank you !
B000IOM1Z0|5.0|I remember this album when I was younger and it still does not dissappoint.<br />The music is epic sounding, Great.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|Rather boring. Nothing like the old shows that use to be on t.v. I bought this because of Johnny Depp being in it.
0061719544|5.0|Way too funny!  I couldn't put the book down. I hope he writes many more books. I need four words.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Riveting....couldn't put it down!!!  An excellent read, I felt like I was right there with the characters in the story.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I picked this book because I was having trouble following all the characters and story lines in the TV show and I'm so glad I did.  This very well written and researched book does a great job explaining the different characters and describing the different kingdoms.  The tales are so engrossing that an hour goes by on the treadmill and I hardly notice.  Now I can't wait to watch the TV series and see what I was missing!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my iPhone and my Kindle Fire and thoroughly enjoy it!  It has wonderful plans for daily devotions for a year or month!  You can choose the version of the Bible you want to study from. Excellent tool for staying in tune with God's Word!!
B000002VMD|5.0|I had a tape of this particular CD, which was far better than the CD itself.  Still it is OK.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am not a book reader, I usually start books  but never finish them but since I have heard so much of this book I decided to read it and find out for my self what the fuzz was about. I found myself wanting to know what happens next and now I finished the book and I loved it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Outstanding *****  Reflects on values developed  by a society that had not be influenced by our modern society of no values dealing with reality.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I'll admit, I thought this book was going to be rather dry. I read it when I was small and couldn't remember it, so I decided to reread it. It's a wonderfully woven tale about the joys of the kingdom of youth. It was rather enchanting. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B00884GR0W|1.0|This is the most difficult game I have ever had.  I can not figure out how it works at all and I hate it
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I'm a hello Kitty fan and this game made it better . you should totally get this game. I also love the picture of Hello Kitty cause its cute.&lt;3
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game..very entertaining..well worth the money. Got tired of Angry Birds;looking for a new game and came upon this read the reviews and thought give it a try..man best money spent so far.I have played this game for 4 days in a row..will be on the look out for more from this group of people....
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|For years I've been trying to get my hands on a copy of the 1989 made-for-TV version of The Woman in Black, which is both very expensive and very difficult to find on DVD, so when I heard that they were making another film version, I was initially excited to finally have the opportunity to see a version of The Woman in Black on film.  I was, however, also concerned that there would be changes to the plot and deviations from the original novel that would serve to \\"Hollywoodify\\" the story.  After watching this new version with Daniel Radcliffe, I can say that my fears were confirmed.  There were numerous changes to the story that took it in some wildly different directions than what the author Susan Hill probably intended, and these changes did not improve the story.  One of the best things about the novel is its restraint.  It is heavy on atmosphere and psychological tension and light on the stuff of typical horror stories, i.e. dead bodies, blood and guts, psycho behavior, possessed people, etc.  While this film does retain the spooky and ominous atmosphere present in the novel, there were so many changes to story that I often thought I was seeing a completely different story.    The novel begins with Arthur Kipps as an older, remarried man recounting the story of his dealings with the Woman in Black and how they led to the deaths of his first wife and young son when he was a young man working at a law firm.  His first encounter with the Woman in Black occurs at Alice Drablow's funeral.  He is sent there as a representative of the law firm and initially thinks the Woman in Black is a mourner.  I was really hoping to see this scene dramatized, but the film completely changes the sequence of events in the novel and adds a bunch of stuff that didn't need to be there.  The two biggest changes that I absolutely could not get past were the scenes where Arthur Kipps and Samuel Daily (Ciarán Hinds) manage to pull the sunken carriage containing the body of Jennet Humfrye's(The Woman in Black's) son out of the marshes (like they would really be able to do this), then take the child's corpse back to Eel Marsh house in an attempt to reunite Jennet Humfrye and her son (this never happens in the book and is completely unbelievable), and of course the corny ending where Arthur Kipps and his son are killed by an oncoming train after the son is lured onto the tracks by the Woman in Black, then they are both reunited with Arthur Kipps' dead wife at the very end in the afterlife as they walk away together into the mists.  This was the Hollywood shocker ending that I was afraid this film would receive.  In the novel, Arthur Kipps' wife and son are killed by the Woman in Black, but Arthur remains alive (because somebody has to tell the story!), and their deaths do not involve a train.  The ending of the novel is shocking, but there is no reuniting with anybody in the afterlife.  My mother and I both watched this film together and when it was over, my mother said to me, \\"It could have been so much more than it was.\\"  And I agreed.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I do like this game...there's a lot of &quot;helping people clean up their messes&quot; before they give you information related to the plot, but the scenes are nice and items to find aren't totally obscure. Others complain that the pinch to zoom and scroll around feature results in an incorrect click, and it does, but I've yet to get a penalty from doing this. Overall, it's an entertaining game.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I bought  this just for the reason that it has to be one of the best movies ever. One of the first Holiday movies that keeps it real in many ways .
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner is one of the best books for any reader to enjoy. It's well worth the money. Must buy!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Wonderful. Wonderful. The photos gave more meaning to story.<br />Great imagination. But makes you wonder about what may be out there in our world.
B0098XY5VK|4.0|I really enjoy time management games so this was icing on the cake,  if u are looking for a game to help time pass or something to keep you busy this is definitely the game for you, download and enjoy.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My girls are big Taylor Swift fans. They knew some of these songs from the radio and requested this CD for Christmas. They listen to it all the time.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Had me on the edge of my seat till the day I finished it. IT  was truly amazing  the book... Amazing there is no other words.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|It is good to keep my little son busy when needed like in line at doctor office etc. However, not really educational
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My seven year old son loves these games. He is always checking for new angry birds games and updates to all of them.
B0086700CM|5.0|An amazing game!  It has everything you need to intertain! It needs a HD version,  but it's. still very fun for any age. (Unless you are 2.)
B005LAIHSG|2.0|Brand new DVD, never been opened, has a scratch on the DVD.  The DVD skipped parts of the movie.  Tried to clean DVD, still skips.  Very disappointed!!!!
0399157565|5.0|My lovely bride really REALLY liked this one! She has read all the other books by Ms. Cornwell. Thanks it worked out great
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I love this game but I only wish I could play, my screen keeps going black and I keep having to go back to the home screen=(
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I don't love it but my niece does. I think she has watched it everyday since I bought if for her for Christmas.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the series. All three books are very good, and I am sad this is the last book. I love Christian Grey
B0066W1AZK|1.0|this game made me really mad because the computer cheats. it wont let my king attack any of his pawns and his king can attack any of my pawns. it also switched 2 of its peices around.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|The game itself is loads of fun, however, the game keeps freezing and closing. When it freezes up and closes I loose all the progress I just made, including anything I just prchased. Very frustrating when you can't earn the \\"peanuts\\" and you can only purchase them.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Seems that this version is a bit more user friendly and the entertanment/humor factor is ramped up. It is great way to spend some time and laugh. No problems at all on my Kindle, downloaded and gamed within a minute. Golden Eggs are funny and creative.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br />It keep me wondering what the outcome was going to be.<br />I have recommeded this to a co-worker, she read the book and liked it as well.
B0097UO87U|5.0|Jeff Lynne has done it again!, a follow up to Armchair Theater, Lynne's remakes of classics is fun! A definite must!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Very inspirational and comforting. She had an interesting early life as well. Shows the wisdom of living without fear, a difficult but important effort.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is so cool I love it can't stop playing!!!! fun:)<br />its really interesting and fun I hope lots of people play it!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I loved this movie.  Action, suspense and a little romance thrown into the mix as well. Bruce Willis was wonderful.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Very convenient and comprehensive sharpener, but this sharpener only can let the knife general sharp: can't let knife is very sharp.
B007ZXQNGA|5.0|Really great advice in this book to really do what you love and actually get paid well for doing so
B003O86FMW|5.0|There's a sad truth to reading a good book. It's more tragic yet much more passionate than real life. I hate to have to put it down.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I really enjoyed reading how John actually did it. More ideas in this book than anyone would ever need to get our work out to the world
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My daughter wanted this cd for xmas. She loves it! Her & her sister dance & sing with it all the time. If you have a Taylor Swift fan I would recommend this product.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I have now read this book six times. It inspires me to welcome and overcome resistance which I think is the great challenge in bringing our best to the world
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book wasn't what I expected,it was way better than I expected, I thought the first book was good but this book was awesome I wish it wouldn't end but now I get to read the 3rd one. Can't wait!!!!!(:  usually I do not read I actually dont  like it  but I read this everyday for almost a month and finished it. I would recommend this book to anyone I love it!!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|I got exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted!  The service was fast and got my video faster than anticipated.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|I loved all of it. Weird and very little bits of it had been a way good book but I love love love love love the book!<br /><br />I love love love the book but it had more bad news for the main character than you think. I like:<br /><br />A. Avoiding dance  B. Getting the comic strip job
B000VIPJKM|1.0|I tried to purchase this to comply with my Amazon Instant Video app, but the movie refused to download for my daughter and Amazon charged me for it. Within 24 hours of purchasing, the video didn't show up in my app, and it never did after that. I then bought the second movie, which downloaded, and showed up in my app. I attempted to watch it, and the app crashed every two minutes during the movie. The downloading problem might have been unique to me, but the fact that I got charged for it was not pleasing. Although, besides the downloading issue, Amazon's great, but they need to fix the app to make it more enjoyable for everyone.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|thisthis does not get you a flash player on your kindle so don't bother getting.  I tried it twice and each time it fails to do anything.
1400067820|5.0|Taleb is an original whose ideas may shock you.  It's a triumph of wisdom and perception that exposes the claptrap in our conventional thinking.
B0096DZKZC|5.0|very easy game to play that delivers on challenge and skill enhancement. fun for all ages. this game is a great way to pass the time waiting.
B0067CB072|5.0|Best Bond movie IMO. Daniel Craig bring something different, more aggresive and lethal than ever. This is how a Bond character should be.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|He is just a perfect man okay and like my mom said, because she said it best, I want to write this book. I also want to have written this book, but since that's no longer possible, I'll settle for wanting to get inside Mr. Green 's head. Ughhhh this is a book I'll read again and again.
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I have always loved Paul Simon - his lyrics, his voice, etc. Paul Simon touches my soul with everything he writes.
B007TVANDM|5.0|I liked the pictures and the song and Pete the cat because he was cute.<br />I liked the words because they told a good story.
B0002OERI0|5.0|It is great through song 7 but a scratch prevents listening to the complete cd unfortunately.  The sound quality up to this point is wonderful.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I had never read Les Miserables before but now that is a movie that I'll likely see, I decided to download the book on Kindle and experience its 1000 pages for myself.  All I can say is \\"Wow!.  Clearly it is the finest book I have ever read and I'm delighted that I have spent the last few weeks reading it.  It was an experience I will long remember.<br /><br />The writing is extremely detailed and the author paints a complex mosaic of France, the French revolution and the worldview of Paris at this time.  There is adventure and love and detailed depiction of human emotion with unforgettable characters that will long live in my imagination.  They are all larger than life and depicted with thousands of details that display their humanity, their courage and their constant hard choices.<br /><br />I will never forget the heroism of the convict who rehabilitates himself, the child who grows up to be a woman, the descriptions of war and bravery and the history of France and the French revolution.<br /><br />But most of all I will never forget my own feeling as I read the book and how I was transformed by the beauty of the literature and the sweep of history that is a legacy for all.<br /><br />My advice is \\"don't miss this book\\".  It is clearly a masterpiece.
B001VZY4M8|5.0|This is one of my favorite Neil Young recordings - I even have many of the song on an old VHS tape that I practically wore out!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Daughter loved this game. Had gotten almost 30 ponies. She even gave me her allowance money so she could buy gems to get Rarity and Rainbow Dash. Spent money on this weekend's sale and used a gift card only to have the game start from the beginning. No warning. No force close.  Lost everything. Sad lesson for a 6 year old to learn that her ponies are gone and so is her money.
B0002E5O9G|4.0|Love the songs of this musical! I have the 25th anniversary DVD, and really wanted it on CD since Alfie sings on it; but apparently it is not available.  But, this is very nice. Because it is older, the acoustics are not quite up to par with current digital recordings, but it's not bad. I tend to forget all that when I get swept away in the music.<br /><br />As for which version is best, guess it depends on how you were introduced to Les Miserables. I was introduced during the 25th anniversary at the O2, so for me,no one can compare to Alfie Boe for the lead. Some of the other characters sing better on this 10th anniversary version. But they are all great talents, so It's all beautiful.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|For most of us, The Big Bang Theory needs no introduction, so this is a review about the product rather than the actual show. I am extremely happy with these blu-rays. First of all, it is much cheaper if you head over to Amazon's UK website and order directly from there. I payed about $68, which is much cheaper than the U.S. sets. Keep in mind, however, that the price fluctuates daily and shipping will take a lot longer. Also, I used to have the DVDs, but despite the fact that each season is only on two blu-ray discs, the quality of the video is far and away better than the DVDs. I noticed it immediately. The special features are exactly the same, so all you aren't getting if you buy the British set, is the DVDs and the digital copies. But let's face it, when you have the blu-rays, all that extra junk is worthless anyway!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Bonus track Castle is awesome, I have been to his concert and listened to the music for a while but hadn't heard some of the bonus content.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It was okay.  I am still learning how to use it.  It seems fine I have trouble stopping when I haven't won.
B0016J81B4|4.0|my only tip for non-slip shoes is too scuff the bottoms on pavement before you use them in a slippery environment, that way you get the best traction. other than that great shoe, keeps my feet cool in the kitchen and protects them from hot food and other kitchen hazards.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I love it, but I'm trying to buy Dr. Doofinshmirtz Inc. but it keeps saying &quot;an error occoured while processing your purchase&quot; so can you please fix it? :(
B00122KW0I|5.0|I LOVE THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!  I originally had the version that was released when the movie came out (the more commercialized version)...I had no idea this one even existed!!!  I am glad that I was able to buy it and get it into my music collection. Like the title implies, it's the COMPLETE soundtrack, full of music from the movie, plus exclusive songs and extended versions of some songs.  It's a shame that 'Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Two Towers' don't have similar recordings.  :(  Highly recommended to anyone interested in music from the Lord of the Rings movies.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this is a easy game I got all of them right by the way /the child lock I 1007 plus 7 equals 1017

B008G59IBI|5.0|¡TRÉ! goes back to Green Day's roots. Excellent album, and by far the best of the entire trilogy. Green Day, you've done it again! Five stars!
B00785P2QC|4.0|this game tends to be addicting although bribingsomeone to leaves a review is not so fun and a waste of time in my opinion
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in one day. I couldn't put it down for more than ten minutes. One of the best books I've read in a long time.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Another excellent book by Tom Clancy. I would highly recommend this or any Tom Clancy novel to anybody who likes this style of writing.
B005CRQ4OW|1.0|I loved that book I not have to read it again so I get to tell my friends&family thanks Jeff Kinney:)
0061537969|5.0|This book deserves ten stars. Not five. Going to rank this with the best animal novels ever written. Watership down, Marley and me, black beauty, War horse, the black stallion, ect. It is very well written. Everyone else has pretty much described what I felt about this book. I laughed, and I cried. It was much better then what I expected it would be. For those who have not read this book, be sure to keep a box of kleenex handy.
B000065KH2|5.0|About a child music prodigy growing up on a ship.  Best scenes are the Magic Waltz rolling piano scene and 'the duel'.
B007KTA9PU|5.0|I can listen to Ten New Songs anytime, many times. I love the understatesd sound, Leonard Cohen's raspy vocals and the layered meanings.  I am a new convert to Cohen, having been introduced to him through a quote from Anthem that one of my favorite authors Louise Penny included in her January newsletter.  Since then, I have bought his music, his biography, and followed him on a website that follows him exclusively. Love to see and hear him perform!  Would I go to Paris for his next tour date?  If only I had the money!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Why would anyone think this movie is funny? A man with a pot smoking foul mouth talking teddy bear; they are both 5 year olds but at least the teddy bear looks like he might be five. I can't believe the cast actually thought this was a good idea, at least I hope they got paid well. And MacFarlane what was he smoking when he wrote this?
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is a really cute and easy game for kids and adults alike. You have the option to purchase items with real money, but it's not really necessary to enjoy the game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's easy to learn.<br />I don't like the ads that pop up.<br />I don't know anyone to recommend this to.<br />That's all I have to say
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I couldn't find a way to put this book down . The details made me feel like I was in the story as I read this well worded book

1451627297|5.0|I was born three months after JFK was assassinated so although I heard alot about him and the assassination, I don't actually \\"recall\\" where I was when he was murdered.  Having said that and being a HUGE King fan, I wasn't really interested in the book...at first.  Then one day while shopping I picked it up and read the cover.  Well...maybe...just maybe.  I purchased it.  I am sooooo glad that I did.  This book is full of so much history (and I am NOT a history buff), nostalgia and the most beautiful love story that you will be happy you picked it up too.  It is a huge read, but a fast read.  I could not put the book down and spent a few evenings reading into the early morning.  Except towards the end when I didn't want to finish because I didn't want the book to end.  The ending was beautiful and did not disappoint, moving me to tears.  Though not your typical SK horror novel, I believe one of his best works ever. If you've never read a Stephen King before, at least do yourself the favor and read this one.  You will not be disappointed.
B00973902K|4.0|This song showed up recently in the repertoire of several of the spin instructors in the classes I attend. At first hearing it sounded like most of the other innocuous tunes they play, but after several hearings I noticed a hint of serendipity in the lyrics, and I've grown to like it, so I added it to my collection (very brief) of favorite spin songs. If you're looking for something a bit out of the ordinary in today's pop music, you  might find this one interesting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a great book but the burning desire to read on and know what will happen next is incredibly annoying in a good way.
B004I744AS|5.0|I'm  glad this can be downloaded without the use of wifi which most apps do. It is much faster in search!
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The Phoenix Project belongs to that rare category of books: a business novel. It's written as fiction but it teaches us something serious. The most well known book in this category is [[ASIN:0884270610 The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement]] by Dr. Eliyahu M. Goldratt. The Goal is a long-term best selling business book and required reading for nearly every MBA student for the last twenty-five years.<br /><br />What The Goal did for lean manufacturing, The Phoenix Project will do for managing IT.<br /><br />Bill Palmer is the reluctant protagonist who is thrust into managing IT Operations. He inherits a world of hurt: new business innovation projects are so far behind that the corporation's ability to remain competitive is threatened; standard business functions like payroll, data storage, and point of sale systems suffer from recurrent outages like lights flickering during a storm; and the whole IT organization is so buried firefighting that critical maintenance is neglected.<br /><br />I immediately resonated with the situation. In fact, if you work in a business of any size, in IT or not, you'll quickly find similarities.<br /><br />In my day job, over the years I've found myself wondering why small startups can outcompete two hundred person strong development teams, why certain deployments are multi-day affairs that nearly always fail, why we must wait months for to release software, why the releases that do get to the light of day are nearly always missing key features, and why we seem incapable of fixing bugs so awful that we drive our customers away.<br /><br />In The Phoenix Project, the protagonist Bill Palmer encounters all of this and more. It's written as a fast-paced business thriller (I couldn't put it down and spent much of Christmas day hiding from my kids to read -- in fact, once I hit the halfway point, I literally did not stop reading it except for bathroom breaks.) But it's also a serious business book about managing IT.<br /><br />Through an enigmatic board member, Bill is forced to question his assumptions about IT. What is the role of IT Operations, and even all of IT? What are the four kinds of work that IT must do? What's the silent killer of all planned work? What does the business need?<br /><br />Through comparisons with how work is managed in a factory and examples from The Goal, authors Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford show how the time tested techniques of lean manufacturing (also the Toyota Production System) apply to IT work. By applying these principles, Bill Palmer is able to:<br />- Speed up the time it takes from implementation to deployment by reducing work in progress<br />- Increase the amount of useful work completed by reducing dependencies on key resource bottlenecks, whether those are people, hardware, or systems<br />- Reduce outages by addressing technical debt on fragile IT systems (such as old databases, tricky routers, etc.)<br />- Increase the IT contribution to the business by gaining a better understand of the business requirements, and focusing effort on those features that make the largest beneficial impact to the business.<br /><br />One of the authors, Gene Kim, is the original creator of Tripwire, a widely used tool for managing IT changes; cofounder of the company by the same name; and author of [[ASIN:0975568612 The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps]]. I've seen him give talks on these concepts to a packed audience and receive a standing ovation.<br /><br />For years, I've wanted to be able to bring these types of ideas back to my company because I'm convinced we could be ten or a hundred times more effective and  delight our customers if only we could overcome our IT dysfunctions.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to see them now in written form. If there was one book I'd want every employee of my company to read, it would be this one.enigmatic board member, Bill is forced to question his assumptions about IT.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Good action, characters, comic relief, it delivers.  I give it my stamp of you should watch this movie.  More words are required even though I have said all that matters.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I love Nora Roberts books. Her books are always interesting never the same story twice. I now have my Daughter reading her books.
B0043JDUNS|1.0|A superhero is supposed to be inspiring. Presumably they are heroic and impressive. Neither applied to any element of  this film.  Why take a character that was a hero and written as such and turn him into some obnoxious glib jerk you cannot stand to watch?  In the Avengers movie you did not get too much of this character. Here it was just pure indulgence. No restraint. It was embarrassing. The dialogue was fast and empty. It was like everyone was on helium. I liked parts of the first film. I liked the fact that this one came to an end.  I write this to save someone else their money.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Free is always good.<br /><br />if i buy tablet-pc, I will read e-book.<br /><br />everybody good luck.<br />and thx amazon.<br />I love it.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I write this some time after seeing the film and still recall its impact. Crow's performance carried emotion through the film and he looked good and tough in it. The acting was excellent. The plot very good. Offhand, I loved the line the emperor screamed \\"....AM I NOT MERCIFUL!\\" amid the terrible situation he put them all in. And, I love that fact it had a good ending....in its way. Cool. Tough. Sad.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Free is always good.<br /><br />if i buy tablet-pc, I will read e-book.<br /><br />everybody good luck.<br />and thx amazon.<br />I love it.

B00030ERII|1.0|Tried to watch it on both my xbox360 and dvd player to find that its some cheap copy that wont even work. Very disappointed.
0743270754|5.0|This book is just a fabulous, incredible work of research and great writing!  I feel like I'm finally getting the history lesson I neve got when I was in school, and loving it.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|My favorite of the Bourne series. Jeremy Renner takes the torch as Aaron Cross and flies with it. He's great! Good plot, great flow and characterization. It's fun and cerebral without going overboard. I think newcomers will enjoy this, and, if I may, I also believe the filmmakers paid respectable homage to the Jason Bourne storyline in a way that does not alienate fans of the first three films. I enjoyed it!<br /><br />I rented this with Amazon Prime and had no problems. HD was beautiful.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As with every book in the Lincoln Layer series, this one was great!  Love the twists, turns and suspense!  Really worth reading - when you start, you can't put it down!
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Fantasy, but almost believable.  Shows that one very dedicated person can truly make a difference in this world.  A real fun read.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Its angry birds. Runs great looks good on my kindle hd. I just found it repetitive after about 50 levels.  I don't really get it I guess. Still it plays and looks great.  At least it does not have any x- wing vs. tie fighter escort mission levels. Those who know remember that pain.  And for those reviews who say it only has three levels on pay version, not true.  You simply have to get three stars on third level to move on.  I am angry bird rookie and I managed it.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|We lived in Nigeria at Nsukka at approximately the same time the story takes place.  It is a true picture of the people from many different tribes and countries that were together at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and the conflicts in the nation at this time.

B00A80SHFM|1.0|I only bought the one song since it's my favorite (Lea Salonga got me hooked and Samantha Banks sings it beautifully as well).<br /><br />I was excited until I found out that it cuts off at the end and it bothers me.<br /><br />If there is a way to get my money back for the song then I will surely try and find it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|To be honest, I cried a couple of times. This book was beyond good, and I will definitely be referring this book to everyone I know. The Lucky One had a lot of \\"Oh my gosh\\" moments. I have it 5 stars, because I couldn't put it down. It was just an incredible story all in all. This is a total must read.
B007SGM084|3.0|I read the reviews, but wanted to check for myself. Sadly, they were true. The trilogy could have been fit into one book.  It wasn't as racy as I was led to believe.  It was ok, but I feel like I wasted time reading the second and third book.
B004DM0UII|5.0|It's great. I loved it! I gave it to someone as a xmas present.  they seemed to love it also.
B006GLLXXK|1.0|I have been waiting to watch this show for months now.  I watched this first episode and could barely get through it.  Just not what I thought it would be.  I am however satisfied with purchasing it through Amazon.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is the best in the series. Getting pulled into this universe, getting to know the characters. Believable and hard to put down
B002VKB0M4|5.0|This movie is as much about every day life in Paris as it is a beautiful story. I am passionate about the study French and have a strong interest in French culture. If you have the same interest as me, yo will like it. The acting is also good.<br /><br />French culture is unique in so many subtle ways. This movie brings it out in beautiful ways with outstanding acting.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Great way to past the time and not get things done!<br />I love the Angry Birds so much that I have all of them<br />on my IPhone 4s!<br /><br />You'll Love it!
B00095NX9G|5.0|To be honest, I love everything that she does. Rachel Brice is a Goddess. Be Sure to check out her new teaching website...good stuff
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|This movie was AWFUL!  There was no real story line, the actors were unconvincing.  However the special effects were interesting but not enough to carry the move.  Nothing else worthwhile about this movie.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Although this book was much different from the movie The Wizard of Oz, I enjoyed reading it very much.  It has a very extensive plot that takes you through the entire land of Oz with Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, the Cowardly Lion, and Toto. It was a great book that I am glad I took the time to read!
B007ZYK3CE|5.0|I didn't know how this movie was going to end. It's a very gritty movie showing the sadder side of life.<br />The acting was superb, the lead actor had a part in Braveheart. I spent half the movie trying to figure out where I knew him from. Excellent movie.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Could not put \\"The Last Man\\" down. Well written and explosive, exactly what I was expecting of a Vince Flynn book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the few books to ever genuinely surprise me. I've read many horror, mystery, thriller books, and while the author had \\"twists\\" in it, nothing comes close to this book. I laughed out loud at many parts, but more importantly to me, I gasped out loud. I don't want to give anything away, but I'm disturbed by the fact that I actually liked Amy and Nick together, and after I finished the book, my brain was still processing what I had just read, and all I could do was laugh. The author does a great job of giving both sides (Amy and Nick 's) without leaning in favor of one character over the other. I would recommend this book to anyone in a healthy marriage, I would advise caution to everyone else...just kidding. Well, sort of. (Haha). If you like mystery and/or thrillers, this is a great read. Nothing gory, just mentally disturbing. Well written. Enjoyable despite its controversial topics.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Very well written.  Character development is so in depth that I really feel as if I know him.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00973DDN2|5.0|My music tastes are very eclectic, with favorite bands ranging from Pink Floyd, Tony Carey (& Planet P) to Split Enz/Tim Finn et al. and a number of other alternative Australian acts from the mid 80's to the 90's.  I bought this for my daughter that is in High School when it was on sale over the Christmas Break.  I'd heard one or two songs on the radio and liked them, but not any more or less than any of the other alternative rock bands that I hear on the radio but no longer pursue in terms of buying albums.  This album has really grown on me and is lyrically rich.  The songs have depth and personal meaning on a variety of levels that I appreciate more and more with each listening--enough so that I've looked up the lyrics to read which is something I only do for things I really like.  I can't place or rate the album versus other Killer Albums since this is my introduction to the band, but as someone who pays attention to lyrics, this album speaks to me and has made its way to my permanent play list.
0765325950|1.0|I am very disappointed about the delayed release of the e-book.  I have been a loyal TOR supporter for years and the fact that they want to exploit the series popularity to make even more money and rip fans off is very upsetting.  I guess I will be getting my copies from the library, since I don't want to wait.  TOR and Amazon just lost a sale because of the delayed release.
B001ILFUNW|4.0|It is a fun romantic comedy. Predictable overall but with a few surprises. My wife and I both love this movie. Kevin Kline is great in this role. Meg Ryan is ...Meg Ryan, always lovable.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Typical Reacher fashion, he stumbles into trouble and gets into business he doesn't belong in. I would have preferred a little more action and to have gotten into his head more but I may have read it too fast too?!<br /><br />Immediately jumped into the story, immediately had you asking questions and I still couldn't put it all together before the end of the book.

B000002OZY|5.0|This and the movie, can not go wrong.  A must have for any serious classic rock n roll music lover.
B00899DR40|5.0|Keep in mind, I'm a 19 year-old male college student<br /><br />Justin deserves 5 stars for his latest album, Believe. For the past couple years JB has been a little bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. I had about 4 or 5 songs of his, mostly some singles. But a couple weeks ago, I listened to his new album, and I really liked it, so I bought it. I really like all of the songs, except two, Catching Feelings and Right Here. They are good, but to me they aren't as catchy as the others.<br /><br />This album shows a mature and serious Justin. Have an open mind, give it a listen, you might be surprised. And most importantly, don't hate on Justin for no reason.

1426308477|5.0|I have a two-and-a-half year old who is really into dinosaurs, and he loves this book!  The book is colorful, the illustrations are beautiful, and the text is large and easy-to-read.  It's perfect as a read aloud (we read about 7-8 different dinos a night before going to bed), and it will serve my son well once he's in school and learning how to read independently.  Also contains suggested activities for parents to do with their kids.  I'm glad we bought it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved the books I loved all the books I love how the book ended and how they  grow back together<br />I loved the song it was a song I sing to my sister before she goes to bed she tells me that makes her feel and how she thinks that there is a meadow and a willow and grass and a soft green pillow I sing it to her and I hope one day I'll be able to sing it to my children and my sister
0439023483|4.0|I enjoyed this book (although I hate saying I enjoyed it due to the subject matter).  It was an easy, quick read.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I liked this book because it showed fighting cancer and young love.(Random words so I can submit this review to the world)
0689865384|3.0|I liked this book okay.  It's another series about a dystopian society, but not nearly as clever as the Hunger Games.  The characters started to annoy me after a while.  I finished the first 2 or 3 books of the series, but wasn't interested enough to finish.  Although to be honest, I don't read alot of fiction anymore.  If you really like books like Hunger Games, Matched, etc. then you'll probably enjoy these books, otherwise it might be a waste of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is cool because you don't. have to move the tablet. and you get high coins and it has a rocket

0385493622|4.0|I never realized how complex, consuming, and fascinating the effort could be for a mathematician to prove something so seemingly simple about a tiny equation (x^n + y^n = z^n has no whole number solutions for n > 2). I have studied math through engineering, but the proof was well outside my ability to understand. However, the real-life human drama of the hero's drive to work through adversity, fail in early attempts, and try new routes to solve the problem was inspiring without having to understand the math. But the profundity of math's truth stuck with me. Once proven, a mathematical truth is true forever and cannot be challenged. That's a beautiful and striking concept versus the philosophical and scientific theories that run our lives but which are subject to being overturned at the next discovery. This story, in essence, is a man's zealous and triumphant quest for an absolute truth, and that's inspiring.
1419705849|3.0|My kids (9 and 11 years old) had high expectation.  So when they were let down after reading this, it may have been inevitable.  Nevertheless, it was a bit of let down.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A great story about human relationships and now we often look at people who are not like us.  How a family tries to deal with it.
B009NRO5XE|5.0|I've always thought that Bryan Ferry was born decades too late.  His silky baritone would have been perfectly suited for the golden age of crooners in the 1930s and 1940s and it's clear his singing style was influenced by Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, and others.  His 1970s era solo records however would put an odd camp spin on songs from the Great American Songbook and so at times you were never certain if this embrace of earlier music was sincere or not.  Throughout his career Ferry has dipped into other songwriters catalogues and served up some truly memorable discs including [[ASIN:B00001ZSTJ As Time Goes By]]  and [[ASIN:B000LPR0SE Dylanesque]].  With \\"The Jazz Age\\" Ferry opts for this approach with his own back catalogue of Roxy Music and his solo work, but gives it a couple novel twists.  First off, it's done as if performed by a 1920s or 1930s era jazz band, complete with the orchestrations of that earlier era, and secondly, it's only instrumentals, no vocals, hence the moniker of the Bryan Ferry Orchestra.  At first the idea of taking well known Roxy Music/Bryan Ferry songs and reworking them as 1920s jazz sounds a bit unusual but it works quite well.  The entire Roxy Music catalog evoked the sort of careworn decadence of Weimar Germany anyhow; why not take it to its ultimate expression?  An odd turn for Ferry is hardly unheard of as his solo career has been full of diversions and trying on new genres like a wardrobe change.  I can't say I'm surprised at this endeavor as he certainly hinted at it with the DVD [[ASIN:B000059WSA Bryan Ferry in Concert (Live in Paris at Le Grand Rex, March 2000)]] back in 2000.  Recorded on his [[ASIN:B00001ZSTJ As Time Goes By]] tour he recorded perhaps the most evocative and gorgeous reworking of 1972's \\"Chance Meeting\\" off the eponymously titled [[ASIN:B0000256KG Roxy Music]].  Performed in the manner of a pop classic it showed the timelessness of Roxy Music's output.  And while [[ASIN:B00001ZSTJ As Time Goes By]]  was comprised of others' songs from the Great American Songbook this performance showed that Ferry could apply that same approach to any of his songs over the past four decades.  It's likely that only now, after so many years of performing these songs, that Ferry feels the confidence and desire to make this attempt and the results are very interesting to say the least.<br /><br />Ferry casts wide a far throughout his songbook from the earliest days of Roxy Music up to his latest studio release [[ASIN:B003VIW8DK Olympia]].  If anything it must have been difficult deciding which songs to pick for the makeover and a part of me hopes that there will be a sequel although Ferry is notorious for one-offs such as this.  Probably the major quibble here will be why Ferry isn't singing on any tracks, as clearly his voice would be well suited for it.  My hunch is there are two reasons.  The first is that these songs are so closely associated with him that there's no reason he HAS to sing.  In fact, by not singing it allows the songs to breathe on their own.  Heck, sing along if you like, you probably already know the words!  Ferry likely wants the songs to speak for themselves and to show that they defy and transcend time and place.  Singing would likely detract from what Ferry is attempting here anyhow, and besides that, what approach should he take?  If it's reverent and respectful critics would call him out for being self-serving.  Adopting the camp approach would similarly detract from an otherwise serious yet flirtatious recording.  Having others sing his songs would just be wrong.  This isn't a covers album where newer artists pay respect to another musician; it isn't that at all.  Ferry's approach here is spot on the money.  What results is a fun, funky, flirtatious, and ultimately ambitious album that works well.  I don't know that this is intended to win over new fans, but it almost certainly will appeal to his existing fans.  Amazon hasn't bothered to provide a track listing, but here it is:<br /><br />1. Do The Strand<br />2. Love Is The Drug<br />3. Don't Stop The Dance<br />4. Just Like You<br />5. Avalon<br />6. The Bogus Man<br />7. Slave to Love<br />8. This is Tomorrow<br />9.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read the Wool Omnibus because of reviews from Amazon and GoodReads.com, and it's as good as all the reviews claim. Hugh Howey really kept me on the edge of my seat, not wanting to put the book(s) down, needing to know what's next.<br /><br />He weaves a very well put together world with characters that have depth and are very interesting.  He writes a good story, and has a very artistic writing style. I look forward to reading the rest of his books. I'm glad to have found him, as I've already read all of Jim Butcher's and Brandon Sanderson's books, and am happy to find another author I like just as much.
B003H4RDZQ|5.0|...and no, that's not a typo. David Sedaris' uncanny wit, insight and odd family history combine in a potent cocktail (sorry, could not resist that) that never fails to entertain. I can't say enough about Sedaris, other than to note that I bought four copies of this book this year as gifts for people who have everything. Always funny, bizarrely honest, and somehow both graceful and crude, Holidays on Ice is a classic.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is a really good vacation book. I read the whole thing on my cruis and while sitting on the beach.its the Perfect book for that
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It was a fun game with good graphics. It was little short but it was only 2.99. There was a lot of going back and forth between rooms, but there is a map that helps keep you going in the right direction. Overall, good game for the $.
B00AQ4U6P4|1.0|i cannot believe anyone liked this movie and it makes me feel like the entire amazon review process is flawed. This movie was basically a bland teen drama with about 45 seconds of surprise and excitement. Everything else was boring and predictable. The acting was great, as well as the casting and cinematography. But that doesn't make up for a crappy story. Such a waste of time.
B00005QAPH|5.0|This film is not for everyone which is obvious from the polarized reviews on this page. You will either love it or hate it but it will evoke a strong response either way. Fellini combines dreamlike fantasy sequences and distorted childhood memories with a real contemporary story line in a way that brilliantly blends them and blurs the line between the main character's fantasies and reality. The result is a dissection of  a man's total experience , both external and internal, as he plans to direct a film and struggles inwardly with mid life crises concerning his career and his complex relationship to women both past and present. Watching this I can't help but wonder how Fellini ever convinced others who participated in this artistically and financially of what his vision for this film was. It's hard to imagine anyone making a film like this today. Woody Allen has obviously been heavily influenced by Fellini's work but he only uses some elements while for Fellini the entire 2 1/2 hours is a mesmerizing blend of surreal elements. I think Fellini was a true artist as a director and he gets a tremendous performance out of Mastrianni in 8 1/2.  I watched this again recently and was swept away by it even though I've seen it several times. Check it out- if it's not your cup of tea you'll know after the first 30 minutes.
0525478817|5.0|I approach heavily hyped books (particularly in the YA genre) with not just great caution, but nearly an expectation that it could never live up to it. That being said, I do keep an open mind and like to judge things for myself, which is how I was happily proven wrong about the most talked-about book of 2012, \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" by John Green. \\"Really, Time Magazine?\\" I thought. \\"#1 book of the year?\\" Well, I wouldn't go that far but this really is a case where you should believe the hype. It certainly would have made my Top Ten list had I read it in time.<br /><br />The book is done a disservice by its generic plot summary about two cancer-ridden kids who fall in love and examine their lives, come to terms with dying, etc. Yes, that's been done a million times, and I too was afraid this book would just be another rehash of that so-called emotional journey. Green surprised me by taking Hazel and Augustus on a quite literal journey to track down the elusive author of her favorite book instead. It's part dying-wish, part youthful-curiosity, and the globe-trotting result is unexpected, exciting, romantic, tragic and meaingful.<br /><br />\\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is set in what I like to refer to as hyper-reality. Its characters - especially for being teenagers - are just a little too charismatic, a little too confident, wise, quick-witted and funny to remind the reader of the imperfect humans we encounter in real life, but they do fit perfectly into their own reality, which Green still manages to use to great effect to illustrate truths about our own. And yes, there will be tears. Buckets of them. This is still a book about two kids with cancer, after all.

B007V65R54|5.0|I very much enjoyed this. I'm fascniated by his premise that we have more access to more information than ever before in history but our prediction powers don't reflect that. Nate has tons of credibility given his track record in recent elections of predicting winners but he's still pretty humble about it. Instead of puffing up his chest and drawing a ton of attendtion to himself he points out that all he did was follow the right patterns. I'm a student that has taken research and statistics courses (and struggle mightily with the sheer boring narratives that go along with them.) This was easy to read without talking down to me, and covered several really intersting topical areas to apply his theories.
B002ZFQD0E|4.0|A favorite of the family.<br />Some songs are destined to be played for longer than the modern day pop culture age.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Had this in vinyl and wanted a cd to rip. One of my favorite classics. Too bad Bloomfield died so young. Shared this with my son (24) who heard this for the first time and he is now a big fan. Highly recommend.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone, but especially anyone who has ever felt awkward or confused about growing up. I read this in one day, it was that good!
B008476HBM|5.0|I have read this book five or six times!  It is almost lyrical, or musical in the cadence of delivery.  I do love it.  I will read it again and again.  It is like Jane Austen crystalized a period for us and polished it into a gem to enjoy for lifetimes to come!
B008I43DYU|4.0|This is a decent calculator.  I mostly like the simplicity.  I dont have high expectations for a calculator. skin choices are good.  Would prefer having choice for split screen or type of calculator.

1451695195|5.0|I have purchased several copies of this book for friends and family.  We just lost our mom in December and this book was a great comfort to me.  I almost look at it as a text book because of his approach in presenting what happened in a very logical and methodical way.  He explains why he knows that his experience was real from a clinical standpoint --- he knows how the brain works.  Overall, I trusted what he said and feel that his experience happened to him for a very important reason.<br /><br />It was a great book for me to read and I intend reading it again.<br /><br />And again.<br /><br />I recommend it highly.
B006H5120E|1.0|It has two disc in 3D.  The movie was very well done. We had a problem with the 2nd disc. It stopped just before the ship went down. Had to restart and some of the movie was not there. Will have to send back.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love it. I use it to get kids to sleep at home and to keep me asleep in hotel rooms. Very withing. I really like the pink noise.
0374214913|5.0|I'm starting with a comment about the dust jacket--the top glows in the dark! It was eerie to turn off my bed lamp and see a book glowing on my bedside table.<br /><br />I enjoyed this tale--full of technology, gadgets, mysterious happenings, unusual books, strange customers--a literary adventure tale. The story unravels slowly, and keeps your mind guessing, as there is nothing predictable in this novel. I equate it to a fairy tale for adults.<br /><br />If you are looking for a title that let's you escape into a medieval mystery with modern technology, (and ends with a thoughtful message) this is the book for you. It's a delightful read!
B008QE9XD2|5.0|Arrived quickly and is a fan favorite.  This was a gift for my youngest daughter of 3 girls in my home.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|I received this book for my Kindle as a Christmas gift from my brother and sister and law. I really want to see the movie version of \\"Life of Pi\\" but wanted to read the book first. I thought the book dragged just a little the first couple of chapters. But there are numerous facts about animals and their way of life sprinkled throughout this book. I would classify myself as an animal lover, so I found that enjoyable. Also, this book is beautifully written. The story is engaging. One thing I wasn't prepared for in this novel was the amount of gore and violence. At times, it felt like it went overboard.<br /><br />Pi finds himself stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean when the freighter he is sailing on sinks. None of humans, except Pi survive. He finds himself in a lifeboat (and a rather small one at that) with a hyena, a zebra, a orangatan named Orange Juice, and a massive, 450 pound male adult Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. The other animals don't make it very far into the journey. The zebra and orangatan are killed by the hyena and the tiger kills the hyena. All that remains is Pi and the most dangerous of his animal passengers, Richard Parker. Both are willing to do almost anything to survive. Pi knows that he must be ever viligant around Richard Parker. He knows all too well that showing any type of weakness or letting his guard down would mean death. There are many twists and turns in this book. The reader is kept guessing what is going to happen next. You can almost feel the wind in your face. You can sense Pi's growing desperation, hunger, and thirst. You feel his despair when it seems there is no hope of being rescued.<br /><br />The main reason why I didn't give this novel 5 stars is because of the religious aspect. Pi practices Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. Not one after the other, all at the same time. He juggles the lifestyles and beliefs of all 3 religions at one time. He resists being told that he has to pick only one. There is definitelythe underlying belief that all religions are valid and as long as you are sincere, it doesn't matter what you believe. It is a common theme in our politically correct society.  It does matter what you believe and sincerity is simply not enough. It is possible to be sincerely wrong. But even though I don't agree with the religious underpinnings of this story, it didn't keep me from loving this book. The rest of the story was so engaging and enjoyable, that I was able to overlook the religious ambiguity.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is a quick, enjoyable read that is very well written.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Interesting with quite a twist at the end. Definitely worth the time. Enjoyed it very much and recommend it , especially to Kate Morton fans

B008CLI4N4|5.0|My wife has read all the books and she says she was amazed at how well the TV series followed the books. These are long books I personally don't have the time to read so I am glad I can share in the story with my wife. Great story; great cast; and great film production. Have pre-ordered season two and can't wait to get it.
B001VLBDD0|5.0|Fast action like the first movie.Great acting by all the stars.Well produce and well wtitten story.The secondary cast players were great.

0307887448|5.0|I read this book in one night!  So much fun, I really would recommend this book to anyone with any sort of nerd/geek bent.  Read this book, it's tons of fun.
B000TGJ80S|5.0|There are likely more Dracula and vampire movies than there are James Bond movies, yet only one that I know of which actually follows the intent of the original author, Braham Stoker.<br /><br />This story, though somewhat morbid at times, is actually a love story.  This is a Francis Ford Coppola movie, among the best in the history of the industry.  Blended with the cast of Gary Oldman, Winona Rider, Anthony Hopkins and (believe it or not, he gets fourth billing) Keanu Reeves, the original story takes a life of its own.<br /><br />The story begins around the devoted Christian Prince of Transylvania, a fearless warrior who follows the footsteps of his father leading brutally victorious battles.  He leaves his precious love behind for one lengthy campaign, but she gets an incorrect message of his death.  Heart-broken she leaps to her suicide.  Upon discovery, the prince feels betrayed and disavows his Christianity.  He makes a pact to live forever until he finds the soul of his lost love.<br /><br />Four hundred years of drinking in the souls of others, gives him uncommon strength and unbounded self-transformational powers.  Trust me, becoming a vampire bat is a cliché, and is only a tiny second in the movie where he becomes so very many other things, including his 400 y/o self.  Ultimately, the two meet in prim and proper 17th century London, shortly after her engagement to a wealthy legal apprentice.  The rest of the story follows the battle for her heart and soul.<br /><br />Above all this movie is riveting in special effects.  The film is filled with mesmerizing cinematography and graphics that keeps one constantly enraptured to every scene.  It is thoroughly visual and exciting.<br /><br />For those who think this a horror movie, think again.  Do not deny yourself the privilege of enjoying a spectacular visual hypnosis and period-piece costuming.  I believe to be one of the best films ever made.
B002ZG997C|5.0|This movie i can not stop watching cause this movie so intence that i bought a copy for a friend of mine, and Denzel Washington's character is blind in the movie
B007O4XX9K|3.0|I heard about this cd after seeing Joe Walsh on Guitar Center Sessions. He talked about this album being for his fans. The jam session on the program was rock solid , pure , and Joe Walsh at his best. This album should have been named ELO featuring Joe Walsh , it's that obvious. If he wanted to make an album for his fans they should have recorded the whole Guitar Center Session package it then sell it. The songs are well written and have good content but the added effects just doesn't make the cut in this case. In the interview Joe talks about his guitar sound , that all he does is plug the guitar in the amp then turn the amp on. He should have stuck with that concept. For those who disagree with my review please listen to the session on you tube and if your a true Joe Walsh fan I'm sure you'll see what I mean. Worth having because the lyrics tell a great story.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game was easy to load onto my  kindle and very entertaing. My grandkids ask to play this game before other games.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Just like the first one.A lot of action.The actors was great as well as the secondary cast.Well written story and produce.
1926778537|5.0|I love it!  It's perfect, full of awesome process work and tons of great color pieces as well.  I'd recommend to anyone interested in game preproduction work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|flow is a great and addicting game for children and audlts.flow chaleges you to usevthe extent of your logic to connect the dots and fill up every square.
B0009UC810|5.0|I love the Blues Brothers car with the microphone on top of the car. What's funny is that they crash thru the mall that was recently demolished.
B00846REIS|4.0|Although this book was a bit much like 50 shades it still had me hanging on to every word. The unconditional love and rAw emotions in this book will have every hopeless romantic melting.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Every once in a while, Hollywood gives us a breath of fresh air. A well written, well directed, and well acted picture, that keeps us in suspense, while thoroughly entertaining us. That is exactly what we get in the recent bluray release of Looper. While 2012 saw its fair share of good films, Looper was no exception, and should go down as one of the years best. The story is engaging and interesting, and is the best time travel movies I have seen since 12 Monkeys. I did not find this film confusing, yet the writing remained complex enough to add a suspenseful ending that gave me a big \\"WOW\\" when the credits rolled. Both Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were perfect in their roles as the lead characters. However, I thought Joseph Gordon-Levitt stole the show, with arguably one of his best performances to date. Rian Johnson who wrote and directed this film, shined on both ends. The action scenes were fun, the shooting scenes were realistic, and the Kansas farm backdrop added a beautiful palette of colors that looked good on bluray. I highly recommend this movie, and I am glad it is apart of my collection.
B002ZG999U|5.0|A great fast action movie.All the stars in this one are great.You will not be dissapointed.Well put together story.And it was produce well.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Its a good read and the strength of JG is to make the readers believe the characters with fast paced way of story telling .
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I'm always looking for a different band and don't listen to radio other than NPR.  I bought this CD after seeing Fun on SNL.  Something different to listen to and lighter than much of my usual fare.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Had a good time reading this book. Wasn't sure I'd like the way the author told the story in a first hand accounts by others, but was pleasantly surprised and couldn't put it down.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I'm so glad they have tho on the kindle fire! ive been playing on my friends ipad for the past while and she was getting mad at me. yay! now she wont kill me! not literally, shes not a serial killer. that wouldn't be good. This is a great app reccomenneded
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Easy to play don't have to pay could be slightly improved. Could use better edit controls but otherwise great game fun to play
B005LAIGLE|3.0|An ok movie.Alot of action in it.Wahlberg should have past this one up.The story could been better written better.You will have to decide on this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a marvelous, clever page turner until it became preposterous. It suggested Scott Turow's &#34;Presumed Innocent&#34; in so many ways which was equally a clever page turner (until it became preposterous). But who cares? I will gladly rush to read her next.
B004SBULWE|5.0|I looked for this app for my Kindle Fire HD because I use it all the time on my phone and couldn't imagine not having it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Late to the Walking Dead trend and happy that I could catch up with the 3rd season on Amazon since it's not on Netfix yet.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Typical Nicholas Sparks.........very good read...very good love story....However I did see where the story was heading in the middle of the book.  Very Good surprise ending..
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app allows one to move files from PC to Kindle Fire easily and without those wires! I can easily manage all the files on my Kindle Fire HD. I used to spend a lot of frustrating time just trying to find my downloads much less use them. Highly recommend.
B0062P3392|3.0|The story was good. It  was more a foreign movie.Alot of action in it. Very fast paste.A few big name stars in it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So I saw all the 5 star reviews and decided I need a quick light hearted read.  It was not even close to that.  This book was amazing!  This was such a passionate story.  Love the characters and how the story evolves into much, much, much more than a teen romance.  Read it.
B002RI9L76|4.0|Asking for good books and this was suggested. It is a very dear book and would be well suited for an adult to read to children around 6-7-8.  Beautifully written book
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Haven't watched all of this season yet, but we're working on it. The DVD came in a timely fashion and the series is just so completely addicting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show! Can't wait to see season 4! Great plot, great acting! Best show ever filmed! Full of suspense!
034580404X|5.0|I ordered the English version in addition to my German one and I love it! Will accompany on a vacation.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It keep me engrossed and enthralled, and very hard to put down. I can not wait to read another of his books.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Extremely informational movie on the financial crisis; entertainingly narrated by Matt Damon.  Watch and learn about what exactly happened in 2008 as this documentary asks the hardball questions others wouldn't.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I've read the slammed series and I liked that as well. There were a lot of twists and turns to this book... so much so that I found my self saying &#34;really?&#34; outloud but overall I did like it. I didn't neccesarily feel a connection to the charactors but the story had a good pace and it did keep my attention. I would recommend it.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This product came quickly, was of good quality, and SOA is a seriously addicting show! I'd recommend this product. :)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this game is really fun and addictive I can hardly put this game down once I started it I just want to be able to do more side games or mini-games
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Amazing. Couldn't put it down. It's just a perfect story. So real so true. Love the Smith's references in here. Missing mix tapes!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book starts out great however stumbles a little in the middle but counters that by leaving you awwing and waiting to find out what happens. In the end the book is great and I nearly fell off the balcony after reading the last sentence.
B0000041Q3|5.0|This is the best recording of this opera so far- the only one that comes close is the 1937 recording with Gina Cigna and Francesco Merli. There are only a couple complaints I could make: the conducting does not respect Puccini's tempo markings, consistently taking parts faster or slower according to performance tradition. Examples are the concertato at the end of Act I, where the tempo of Non Piangere Liu should be kept until the reprise of the theme from the end of that aria, after which the speedup occurs. Also Tu che di gel sei cinta is a cabaletta, though you'd hardly know it from the tempo taken here. Also, the ending used is Alfano II, which is vastly inferior to Alfano I. in addition, the essay by William Weaver at the beginning of the booklet is very poor: it's all over the map and seems to have little to say other than that the opera has never been as popular as Puccini's others. There is no attempt at saying anything original or meaningful about the opera, which many say, and i would wholeheartedly agree, is Puccini's best! These, however, are minor and pale issues when they are contrasted with the outstanding singing and  playing on this record.  The sound, the cast (which needs to be top notch as this is one of the most challenging operas ever written), the orchestra are all as good as can be hoped for, and despite his occasional transgressions with respect to tempo Mehta's conducting is fiery and attentive to detail- he holds the thing together. Absolutely recommended.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Its vibrant characters filled a heartfelt love story. I couldn't put it down and for the last few chapters I couldn't stop crying. A story so beautifully written that even days later after it was done it stayed with me. The only thing that could have made it a little better would have been if there were a chapter written in Wills voice... I also learned a lot about the difficulties that quad patients face.... a wonderful book and I would highly recommend it. I only wish there were a follow up book to see how the characters faired several years later.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|just gives battery info. nothing special. I do like the temperature function showing how hot the baterry is. now I try to keep it below 90 degrees for good battery health.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is an excellent book and I love John Corey.  I have read about everything Nelson Demille has written and only once in a while does he not get a high rating.  I have the hard cover and the Kindle so it has been read a number of times.  Everyone liked the book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book! The characters and story are captivating. Once you start reading it's impossible to stop. Can't wait for the final book!
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Great book could not put it down. My first time reading Michael Connelly love it. Will certainly be reading more of his books.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very good book! With such a surprising twist that warms your heart. Different from the other books I've read by Nicholas Sparks
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this!  I can get daily devotions on my email, I can read the Bible at my convenience, and it has different translations, which i really like.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Much better than I had anticipated, visually a great movie with mediocre acting.  Fast paced movie that is very entertaining.
1250000971|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great Author. I have loved every book that he has written and this one didn't disappoint me in the least . can't wait to read the next in this series.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|This movie was not what it was all hyped up about. It lacked a plot and was really boring. Not worth renting..
B009AY04A8|3.0|if you like simple ho games this is for you. long enough for the price but after awhile becomes a little boring. objects are not very well hidden and the story line does not add much to the game. already bought part 2 they were on sale at the same time so hoping its a little more interesting. but all in all did keep me entertained for a few days.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Its compact but performs well, and it is so easy to carry it around I am very happy with it and it is always a pleasure for me to do business with Amazon though my spouse is tight fisted and not happy about my ordering things from Amazon all the time but I somehow have my way.
030759565X|5.0|The recipes are great and easy to follow. The pictures are worth the book. You will learn a lot of new and exciting recipes.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|This is the first time I read a book of this kind (female oriented romantic?).<br />Being a male, I'm usually interested to learn about women's views, feelings, and descriptions of different aspects of life so it was instructive to discover a woman's perspective and telling of a plot designed by her.<br />For me, the added value was to be  a little acquainted with 19th century England.<br />In conclusion, the book is quite readable and enjoyable, probably more suitable for the fairer sex.<br />P.S.  Absolutely no intention to damn with faint praise.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|My mom really loves John Williams music and seen this cd on amazon and got it for my mom for Christmas and loves to listen to it after now and then.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|It might seem corny, but it was very entertaining! The acting was great and I liked the plot. The filming was very good and so were the sets & costumes.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|These movies are a few of my favourites. I was hoping to be able to receive the movie Gross Anatomy but apparently it cannot be delivered to my area in Nova Scotia, Canada?  I also love reading good western novels and these were very good.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great read.  I would highly recommend it. I think anyone who reads it will gain a new perspective on life.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Well written and well done! Great thing about this app is it's a great follow up(?) or addon to the original.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Love the movie and the many unanswered questions that I had after watching in theater. The extras help answered some of the. Movie quality and audio is excellent as well
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is funny because Greg is a little bit awkward and when he is in love it is more awkward.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|I bought the movie with an open mind and really enjoyed the movie.  I watched it a couple of more times.
0547391005|1.0|I bought this book for my 5 year old grandson.  We've already enjoyed some reading times with it.  He's a big fan of Curious George.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I really like the sleep feature and there's a wide variety of channels to choose from. I set it to the 70's station, turn on the sleep feature and it's like I'm 14 again. :D
1847879071|5.0|This book is not just a book for using SPSS-- it wraps both the \\"why\\" and the \\"how\\" in one book.  The writing is fabulous and accessible.  It takes a dry and tedious topic and makes for a joyful reading experience.  There are also web materials through Professor Field's website, which is a plus.  This book is the only book you need if you simply want to DO stuff, rather than think about it.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Author had definitely done his homework! Made this true story very interesting, and put it all together to hold my interest. A great read- highly recommend.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love all of his books. They all convey such a beautiful message. This one was so hard to put down .
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is an entertaining movie for young and old.  The story was cute and the three little bears were adorable.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|This was a good moving story that anyone could read and enjoy.  I enjoyed this book and would recommend it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was hilarious I read it on audiobook and I had to read it again. Go diary of a wimpy kid
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love my new Kindle Fire and my ability to read books at night in the car.  Loved reading this book on it!  Didn't stop except for meals and potty breaks.
B009VB998I|5.0|we loved it the color is great and the 48 hours of play back is a great deal for this movie
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I've read in the past 2+ years! Ms. Flynn unfolds the story and the background of the characters in a very unique way going back and forth in time, educating us on how Nick and Amy met, the issues they had (and there were plenty!) and how they got to be where they are today.  I have recommended this book to at least 10 friends and family members....enjoy!
0761169431|5.0|My son really gets into making paper airplanes and I was looking for something different for Christmas.<br /><br />He really has no origami experience and I was worried about it being to complicated, but that was not the case.<br />He had a great time following the EASY illustrated instructions.<br /><br />Loved this book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|A must read! I never wanted to put it down. I really liked the characters and how descriptive the book was. Made you feel like you were really there.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I guess the book was okay I have always been a fan of diary of a wimpy kid but the ending was kind of dumb it just sort of stopped.
B00881PPTO|4.0|Provides a very useful alternative to most of the other travel search sites. Easy to use and reliable information is presented from a variety of sources.
0143143492|5.0|I followed Eckhart Tolle during Oprah's &#34;A New Web Class&#34; years ago. That was a gift from God through Eckhart & Oprah. Without those &#34;ah ha&#34; moments heard & found then, I would not be in the spiritual place I am today and I would not have survived cancer as well. It has taken me to a healthier life style, one that is more true to the real soul I am. Eckhart’s latest interviews with Oprah on Sirius radio have been wonderful fun listening to. Now, I remember this, Oprah quotes, &#34;when I know better I do better”.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|One of the best British series I have seen. It is addicting.Anyone who loves lots of story lines will enjoy. Love it.
0307277887|5.0|This is a poster book for the depraved. If you are attracted to this, know that you are depraved.<br />When I look at my life, I am sometimes critical. But when I look at the deluded people who like this,<br />their souls like hungry animals with bloody mouths, I realize things could be much worse.
B0095R6OBS|5.0|I saw this version of Frankenweenie years ago, when it was aired on Sci-Fi as part of a series paying tribute to various directors by showing their early shorts. I loved it then. Seeing it again, it proves that Burton was foreshadowing his own style even in 1984 (and before, if you count Vincent in 1982). Anyone who loves Burton's work should see this early version. It demonstrates that he can use the short format to as great an effect as the the full-length movie. It was directed by Burton, and while he didn't write it, it was based on his idea as well.<br />*If you're curious about Vincent, it was a 6-minute, black and white, animated tribute to Vincent Price, which was voiced, eerily enough, by Vincent Price! The only place I have found it available for sale is on &#34;Cinema 16 - American Short Films,&#34; which is a collection of American shorts put together in Britain. It is the first film that Disney gave him free reign on, and it's also well worth seeing.*<br />Whether or not you see the new, feature-lenght version, you should definately see this one!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Read this book if you want to understand what a politician and president should be. A great book about a great man in extraordinary times.
B006UUK612|5.0|I watched this movie back in the 80s when I was a kid, it is one of my most favorite childhood movies. Sad that it didn't make it to be very famous, but if you like the typical \\"little inventor/smart kid/outsider\\" movies, this is definitely a must-watch!
0451232852|5.0|I've read all Ken Follett's books and enjoyed them (mostly) a lot. Consequently I began \\"Fall of Giants\\" with quite high expectations and was ultimately just a little disappointed by it. Even though this is a very long book, covering a seminal period of world history, there is nothing in-depth about it. The warp and weft of it's fabric depends on a series of quite extraordinary and unbelievably coincidental meetings and relationships between the main protagonists. Get ready to suspend all disbelief!! I also found the personal stories of the characters quite overshadow the historical content, but I imagine that was the author's intent.<br /><br />Then I found I kept thinking of the Reader's Digest. \\"Fall of Giants\\" is set between 1911 and 1924 and facts of the period's historical cataclysm are treated in a similar fashion to that of the Digest's material; pre-digested and presented in orderly, easily comprehensible bite sized chunks, easily swallowed but a trifle bland. However \\"Fall of Giants\\" is, for all that, an entertaining read. The reader is swept along apace with scarcely a dull moment. I think I could honestly say I quite enjoyed it, (hence the five star rating) although I was frequently really irritated by the one dimensional characters and the author's somewhat condescending and simplistic tone.<br /><br />Mr Follett has done a masterful job of pulling together the threads of his huge tapestry. I think \\"Fall of Giants\\" will most appeal to readers who have not yet done much reading about WW1, it's causes and the fallout from it. \\"Fall of Giants\\" is a really easy and pleasant way to acquire some (albeit basic) knowledge of the history of the period. For further reading perhaps try \\"The Guns of August\\" by Tuchmann and \\"Dreadnought\\" by Massie.....they are not pre-digested.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is much more enjoyable than plain hidden object games. There are interesting cut scenes, and more to do than just finding items. You have puzzles to solve, plus you need to figure out what to do in order to make certain things work. Like a note high up in a tree for instance. You will need to determine what you can use to retrieve it. You also keep track of notes and evidence, eventually making deductions as well. The artwork is really quite good, and the music is fitting, too. Can't wait to play the next one.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you need to ween yourself off of Shades, this is the methadone for you. Just what I needed; not as intense, but definitely engrossing and sexy.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Incredibly over the top spoof updating the Mad Doctor genre as a musical for the 21st Century. It would be easy to pass this by because of the title. That would be a mistake. Neil Patrick Harris and Nathon Fillion find themselves pitted against one another over both the Dr's intention to rule the world, and the girl (Felicia Day) who has stolen both of their hearts.<br />As is usual under Joss Whedon's direction, all of the performers fulfill their roles to perfection... while repeatedly breaking into song. Joss' younger brothers, Jed and Zack, even got into the act on this one, being involved with the writing, while Jed and Joss wrote the music. (See, it's not just his actors he does it to over, and over, and over, and over...)<br />If you're a fan of anyone in the film, or of Joss Whedon himself, this is a must-have.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|While a bit cheap looking and the light is dim, it otherwise looks great and is fun to mess around with. The uv pen and light work to make secret messages.  In all, cute for play and fun.
B00004TS0E|3.0|I don't know how well the product performed, as I gave it away as a present, but I heard no complaints and assume it was okay.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It was anti climatic.  I thought there would be a lot more into Christian's background that would give some insight as to why he was prone to his BDSM behavior, but I was wrong.  More sex, poor writing, and a really sappy &#34;they lived happily ever after&#34; ending.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Starts off with bang, then slows down, but you know because it's a Clancy novel it's only going to get better and it does.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Every once and a while you hear an album which really takes your breath away. From the outset it sends shivers down your spine and you cant wait to see if it will last throughout the album. This album did it for me. I found myself wondering how did the original sound. It doesn't matter, these songs may have the same words but they stand as great songs in their own right. Fabulous production. Love it so much its almost worn out! It feels like Andrew Lloyd Webber must of had a hand in some of these songs now.........I thinks there's a musical in there somewhere. You heard it here first!!<br />Thank you Kylie Minogue<br />XOXOXO
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love this book.... the story is great and so real...  Hopeless Is an outstanding story....  Loved it...  I recommended  ... thanks Colleen Hoover for such a great romance story
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another great read from Preston & Child..I always enjoy the Pendergast novels, and this one is fine by me..Many twists and turns in the plot that I couldn't easily predict..you should enjoy this one even if you haven't read any of the series previously..
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I picked this book up by chance, and became immediately engrossed in it. The story is wonderfully told, incorporating details of the Soviet society. While it was definitely a great murder mystery, if touched on multiple aspects of fear and relations in a crucial time period of the Soviet Union. I would definitely recommend this book, and can't wait to start on book two.
B009CG96QM|4.0|So no, this is not your average flick from Quinton Tarintino.  I went into this move with low exectations due to the myriad bad critic reviews and movie goers did not receive the film particularly well either.  I decided to give it a go on a recommendation from a friend and I was pleasantly surprised.  The movie is surprisingly emotional and yes it does have much humor to be enjoyed.  I was suprised (and happy) to see that Tarinino has range that I would never have guessed.  From the opening scene until the end I was riveted.  I do enjoy his other films very much, but I really enjoyed this one more I think because I didn't have many expectations going in.  The low of the movie to me was Brad Pitt's performance which I found to be somewhat stale and very unrealistic.  Overall I highly recommend this film.  I believe that one of that main reasons it was panned was because it does not sport the quick wit and ultraviolence that goes along with so many of Tarintino's films (which I also enjoy very much).
B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesome u should download this app I love it don't waist your diamonds because they come in handy latter in the game it gets tougher as u go on
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I understand that this is a VERY budget mic.  I put it next to my Shure SM58 and it sounded VERY close to that mic.  For the price difference it is difficult to justify the Shure, but there are gear snobs everywhere....I should know...I am one of them.  I rent out gear and instead of using my Shure mics I use this in case it gets dropped or whatever.  Sounds very clear, minimal feedback, and seems very well made.  I have bought Behringer products before and been happy with most of them and this one is one of their hidden gems.  If you need some good mics and don't have a lot of money I suggest trying a few of these out.  I think you will be very surprised.

B0030Y11XS|5.0|Very educational and even if you think Michael Moore is bias, the history speaks for itself with which there is such income disparity.
0062127241|5.0|I was raised on The Who--my earliest memory, in fact, includes playing on the floor of my parents' living room while Who's Next played (admittedly, this was in the early 90's, well beyond the band's high tide). I've known their music like the back of my hand for as long as I can remember. I was in love with Roger like every girl had been late 60's when I saw their Woodstock performance for the first time. I wondered what it had been like to hear them as something other than \\"classic rock\\", in their original years. But I never really cared until I read this book.<br /><br />If you're searching for the bible of The Who, an in-depth telling of every minute of the band's existence, by all means look elsewhere. There are plenty of biographers that have covered that story. This is not a story--this is the foundation of a man, and the construction of his life that created something larger than anyone could understand. It's not a rock band and the shenanigans they get into (though those are aplenty and endearing to read as well), it's an attempt to explain a lifetime that everyone thinks they already know. Townshend's writing is urgent and generous--he gives you so much that you wonder if he's kept any emotion for himself. He hides nothing. On the contrary, he seems to want it all to be out of him. It's both an exorcism and the final record set straight. He wants everyone to know everything.<br /><br />Beyond the scale of his incredible personal writing, Who I Am is without doubt the most comprehensive look into making music that I've ever read. If you think you know The Who's discography, look again. From the obtusely obvious (Woke up in a Soho doorway, you say? Which time?) to Townshend's own little-known nostalgia (It's a boy, Mrs. Walker!) to the regularly misinterpreted and confused (I can see for miles...), you will think you're hearing brand new songs. And that's only the lyrics. More often than not, Townshend chronicles each album's journey for years, from its conception as one thought all the way through creating demos on his own, to finally creating it fully with the band. His records precede the evolution of music industry.<br /><br />Who I Am is being advertised as a foray into \\"the life of a legendary rockstar\\" (insert ooooh's and ahhhh's). They want you to buy this book because he talks about his friendship with Eric Clapton! And he jumps off a balcony with Keith Moon! And he does drugs and has sex!! Do not buy it if that's what you want. You will be disappointed. Buy this book if you want to understand one of the most conflicted yet brilliant minds in the history of music, who just happens to be a rockstar. It will blow your mind.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music is technically an album.  It is a record (or CD or MP3) comprised of multiple tracks of recordings that were released publicly.  So, in that respect, yes, it's an album.  But it's an album in the same way that Andy Warhol's Empire is a movie.  It's technically a movie, but it's an eight hour long static shot of the Empire State Building.  Why would anyone watch it other than to boast that they did?  The art is that it exists.<br /><br />And so it is with Metal Machine Music.  There's no real reason to sit with your headphones and listen to all 64 minutes (and 4 seconds) of this album other than to tell other alternative music fans that you're one of the very few who did.  The art of it is that it exists.  Reed recorded countless hours of feedback, electronic noise and guitar shredding then distorted them, reversed them and mixed it all together into the bizarre din that he unleashed onto the unsuspecting public.<br /><br />On one hand the album is an experiment in electronic music.  It's also a challenging statement about what is music, what is art and how much can an artist get away with.  And in another way the album is simply a goof; a way for Reed to grudgingly fulfill a contractual obligation while simultaneously delivering a \\"screw you\\" to the record company (his contract stated that while he was obliged to provide them with an album by a certain date, they were obliged to release whatever he gave them).<br /><br />Reed got his start with Warhol, but other than the minimalist sound of early Velvet Underground, there's not much in common with the late great pop artist.  But in the same way that Warhol challenged the art world as to what is art (Brillo boxes, tomato soup cans, urinated-on canvases) Reed challenged the music world as to what was music.<br /><br />I want to buy the vinyl reissue at some point.  I plan on never opening it and placing it on the shelf sealed.  I think Reed would want it that way.
B007RTAR64|5.0|I bought this for my daughter, who won't be able to play with it b/c of her age for a few more years.  What can I say....I love Katniss!  Maybe I kind of bought the doll for myself or maybe I bought it for my daughter.  I mean, I haven't opened it up and pretended to fight to survive or anything, but the thought has crossed my mind.<br /><br />The doll looks great and maybe it will be worth thousands one day....who knows.<br /><br />A must buy for a Hunger Games fan.
B002M9WW30|5.0|The movies arrived a few thay ago and today i saw Rocky, Rocky II and the first 20 min of Rocky IV.<br />I diden't buy any of Rocky before, and i very happy that i bought this one, but i can see that in a few parts of the movie the quality is not BR, for example, in Rocky, at the first time that Rocky get out on TV (he is at home with Adrian) when you see Rocky it's like the VHS version, and when you see Adrian it's like the BR quality.<br />But it's a very good buy i think :-)
B000QCQ9O8|4.0|I had a really hard time getting into this book. I decided to read a couple of the reviews and thought the premise was compelling so I continued on and I was glad I did. I always judge my books on what they make me reflect on. There are two quotes that really made me think.<br /><br />1. “Was everyone else really as alive as she was?...If the answer was yes, then the world, the social world, was unbearably complicated, with two billion voices, and everyone's thoughts striving in equal importance and everyone's claim on life as intense, and everyone thinking they were unique, when no one was.”<br />2.“There did not have to be a moral. She need only show separate minds, as alive as her own, struggling with the idea that other minds were equally alive. It wasn't only wickedness and scheming that made people unhappy, it was confusion and misunderstanding, above all, it was the failure to grasp the simple truth that other people are as real as you.&#34;<br /><br />I also found the whole thing of believing &#34;what you think you saw&#34; because of preconceived notions very fascinating. In the book, the author blames such shortcomings on the young age of the character. But don't we all sometimes do this? See what we want to see, believe what we want to believe. I saw this book as a warning to keep our minds open and to not fall into such a trap. Beautifully written, I wished it had been longer, filling in the time gaps that we did not see.<br /><br />I listened to the audio version and thought it was great. As soon as I was finished, I started back to the beginning and listened to the first few chapters which I had had such a hard time &#34;getting into &#34; the first time around. They were much more enjoyable the second time around!

B0085Y4JF0|4.0|Arrived early and initial thoughts as to fit, form, layout and quality are positive.  Lots of room for adjustment.  I am 6'2\\"' 265 lbs and this rig could be worn by a much larger person.<br /><br />The open areas on each side of the mag holders have 4x4  PALS webbing.  I mounted a spec ops X6 pouch for eyes/ears, mag loaders, a sandwich, whatever, on one side and a Maxpedition mini rolly-polly for a 32 oz Nalgene bottle on the other.  I loaded 8 full AR15 pmags and was surprised how well they fit and how easy the retention straps were to operate.  For added measure I loaded 4 handgun mags into their holders as well.<br /><br />Lots of weight on the front and I bet I will feel it in my lower back after a long day leaning into the rifle.  Will update after class.

Endless timer is great too. Overall with all the combos of sounds it great for the money. Get the cable to have the kindle hook up to the tv and you can have the relaxing tens throughout the house.

Suicide, drugs, physical abuse, sexual abuse, depression, teen pregnancy. You name...it's in there. I found the entire novel sad with no real resolution.

0385341008|5.0|I'll admit that, if this book had not made such a splash when it was first released, I would never have picked it up. However, once I opened it, I was enthralled. There are some best-sellers that are definitely sub-par, but \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is not one of those. It's vivid, delicious, and mesmerizing.<br /><br />The book is written in epistolary form as a series of letters initially between Juliet Ashton, a London-based writer who gained fame during World War II for her satirical column-turned-book featuring unlikely heroine Izzy Biggerstaff, and her publisher, Simon Stark. While on a book tour for her Izzy series, Juliet is stuck on the topic of her next book. She wants to tell an actual story now that the war is over but is having a difficult time settling on what specifically she wishes to write about. Around the same time, she receives a letter from a man named Dawsey Adams, a pig farmer who lives on the Channel Island of Guernsey. Dawsey has come across a book once belonging to Juliet, and as he has enjoyed it so much, he has questions about its author. Through a series of exchanges, the two form a quick friendship, and the story of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society emerges.<br /><br />During World War II, Guernsey was occupied by Nazi forces for approximately five years. The islanders had no communication with the outside world, and their lives changed with the presence of the occupying forces. There were curfews, food shortages, and neighbor turned against neighbor in an attempt to survive. One night, after attending an illegal pig roast, Dawsey and some fellow islanders were caught out after curfew. To escape some type of punishment, a woman in the group, Elizabeth, concocted a story that they had been attending a meeting of the (then fictional) Guernsey Literary Society. To make the scheme believable (for when the Commandant checked it out), the following day several women rushed to the book shop to buy its contents and literary meetings were subsequently held. This innocuous start led to friendship, survival, and something to cling to as the war dragged on.<br /><br />Juliet, for her part, is captivated not only by Dawsey's account but by the subsequent accounts of the islanders she befriends through letters as she begins to research the Guernsey Occupation. The more she delves into the story - not one of statistics, but one of the people who lived through it - the more she falls in love with the little island and the people on it. Determined to find out more, she travels to Guernsey and is immediately welcomed into the Literary Society. She manages not only to find her story, but also find a missing part of her life - all because of a book that ended up on the island.<br /><br />\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a gorgeous work. It is at once vivid, poignant, and captivating. While it's a quick read, I found myself longing for more as I turned the last page. Though we only meet the characters through letters, they are so brilliantly sketched that I could picture them, and I felt their heartache and hope as they tried to rebuild their lives after World War II. It's been some years since this book was atop the bestseller lists, but it's definitely worth a read.contents and literary meetings were subsequently held.

0316228532|5.0|If you are looking for an uplifting novel, then this really isn't it. The characters are mostly all insecure or unlikeable or hypocrites or just plain sad, but that's what makes this novel so great. It doesn't present any one perfect character but instead a bevy of very real people who are quite imperfect. They have the faults that many of us can recognize within ourselves or acknowledge in people we know (even if we turn a blind eye to it most of the time). I felt as though I knew all of the characters so very well by the end of the book, and yes, I hated some of them, felt nothing for a few, but had a good deal of sympathy or at least understanding for the rest. You know that something bad is going to happen, but you are kept guessing who it might happen to because so many of the lives in the small village of Pagford are so messed up and teetering on the edge of disaster. What does occur by the end of the novel forces certain veils to be lifted and certain truths to be exposed, causing some of the characters to change for the better while others go on being their same (if not more) unlikeable selves. I'm quite glad I didn't let all the negative reviews keep me from this book and this amazing author.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I was traveling when season 2 started so I missed out on several episodes that I was unable to watch<br />on the ABC site.  I was happy that I could catch up from the beginning before the second part of season<br />2 began in January.

1423140605|5.0|The Mark of Athena is a great book that has a balance of adventure, action, and relationship between people. In some books, there is only action that does not have stories. But, 'The mark of Athena' has mysteries that the seven demigods have to solve. It makes us think about the problem and want to read more and more. Another reason why this book is so fantastic is because it has points of view of many people. It makes us know about people's feeling not only one which is different from the 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians' series. This book also has heartbeating moments that made me feel like watching a movie.<br /><br />Some problems that I had when I read this book is when points of views of different people made me distracting. Like I said in the first paragraph, this skill is helpful in some ways. But, when the seven characters are separated and one character's story is the most interesting, it makes me skip another character's story or read it roughly.<br /><br />The author, Rick Riordan made the book end that made me want to read the next book. I wish fall will come soon so I could read the next book, 'House of Hades'. You should really read the series 'Heroes of Olympus'.

1878424319|5.0|Of all the books I've read on spirituality, psychology, and philosophy, this one ranks right among the very top.<br /><br />When I was taking a New Testament course at Missouri State University, a Jewish student suggested this book to me as a &#34;religion-agnostic&#34; text that he'd found very helpful. Some time went by, and one day I remembered his suggestion, bought the book, and found it exactly as he'd say: deep and practical, written in a style that should not offend/benefit anyone with an open mind, regardless of their spiritual tradition or particular beliefs about God.<br /><br />I also had a chance to check out Ruiz's later book &#34;The Mastery of Love: A Practical Guide to the Art of Relationship,&#34; which focuses primarily on the relationships of lovers. It too was a good book, though there is quite a bit of overlap with this one, and on the whole &#34;The Mastery of Love&#34; is a bit more limited: I'd give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />Of the two, &#34;The Four Agreements&#34; is the better book, reaching a wider audience, and definitely worth picking up, reading, living, and loving.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed this novel so thoroughly and really admire the writer for creating a story and characters that have so much depth and in turn, as the reader, found myself feeling so much compassion for each of them.  There were subtle details that I enjoyed- like how each chapter went from the present to going back in time with Elizabeth and it's not til close to the end when things make more sense and relationships are reconciled that this back and forth stops.  Also the meaning behind each flower was a totally new thing to me and found it very compelling.  But what I loved most about this novel was that the story takes many surprising turns and the characters are so totally lovable throughout, a very difficult thing to do for the writer.  Some of the other reviewers mentioned how frustrating it was that Victoria sabotages each relationship and that's true but her story has a happy ending which felt good to have been given seeing as her story takes so many painful turns.  Thanks to the writer for giving me a very memorable novel that comforted me on cold winter days when there was nothing in bloom.

B0092ZEIN4|1.0|I bought this controller about three months ago intending to use it with my various emulators on my Nexus 7 and Droid Razr. It's well constructed, has a great feel, and stand that comes in the case is super convenient. Out of the box, it connected right away and mostly worked (no right analog stick or triggers). GTAIII was pretty good with it too.<br /><br />After playing around with and enjoying it for a few hours I installed the Playground app. In addition to being entirely useless and broken in almost every way (you can't even quit without restarting your device), the app actually reduced the functionality of the controller. Fewer apps were compatible with it, and once I'd paired it with the app it wouldn't work in normal non-app mode, not good. I wrote the problems off as part of the beta and set the controller aside for a while, returning to my WII over bluetooth controller.<br /><br />Fast-forward to today, I remembered the device and tried to sync it up again to my devices. Once again, it worked well enough without the app, but I was really wanting to see what had changed with Playground. Lo and behold, absolutely nothing. No update, no changes. Not a peep. Ever the optimist I went ahead and tried it anyway. This time, instead of just disabling the controller for some apps, it actually broke the controller entirely. It now will not pair with anything, not even my bluetooth enabled laptop or my girlfriend's iPhone. It just keeps blinking even after the host thinks it's paired.<br /><br />At first I attributed the problems with this controller to it's in-development state. Now I realize that it isn't in development, it was just released by an immoral company looking to make a quick buck on a new market with the minimum effort possible.

B008WOUK0G|4.0|Great album. The production is great  with Sean Rowe's majestic deep vocals. I give 4/5 because sometimes I think he loses control of his vocals, and also the album could be more &#34;cohesive.&#34; All around a great listen though.

B0055S348W|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps. I like to do research while I watch TV at night, and sometimes I find an article I'd like to keep. In a matter of seconds I can send the article to one of my wireless printers (the HP color inkjet or the Brother black & white laser), and in the morning it's there waiting for me. I've been using this app for several months on my Samsung Fascinate, and it always works flawlessly.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazingly real  expression of the reality that is molestation . It is a hard topic to deal with but also one that needs to be discussed more freely so the millions of young children dealing with it can know they are not alone. Reality at its best.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I'm glad to hear that Barack Obama (a.k.a. The Man) has turned down the petition to build the Death Star. It seems the current administration doesn't believe in blowing up entire planets (in sharp contradistinction to Ronald Ray Gun). Of course, nobody does. I mean, who wants to *blow up* a planet when you can destroy it by climate change? As Grand Moff Tarkin so pointedly put it: \\"This bickering is pointless\\".

B005S9EKCW|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It was so emotionally overpowering and all around beautiful. There were some downsides such as Russell Crowe not being the best of singers but it was made up for with Anne Hathaway's breath taking performance. I haven't had a movie or musical have such a great impact on me since \\"phantom of the opera.\\" In all honesty this movie might become my new favorite musical. So if you haven't seen this movie yet I advise you to see it at once and you won't regret it. If you have already seen it then you will most likely be as impatient as me for its release on DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love it and it helps me with work when I do long problems and I love how it saves the problems I have already worked

B0058Z4NR8|3.0|Lots of analysis- exhaustive histories.  The scope of the history and geography he used.  Did get a little tedious at the end.
B006LSZECO|4.0|You will like, dislike, and hate the 2 main characters. This story will take you on a crazy ride. Family and relationships play an interesting role in the characters lives. Worth reading!
B006QS0PF0|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend who has been out for about ten years. So far she loves it! It is really heartfelt and vivid and full of emotion. When she is through its my turn to read it.
B002H3EUA4|5.0|This is epic. Anyone who's ever seen this movie knows there really isn't anything that needs to be said other than...awesome!! Watch this every year, sometimes more than once. Though I thought I was ordering just the movie, I was pleasantly surprised to receive a tin with the movie and other things like coasters and reusable snow! Amazing!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's beautiful! It's beautiful. I was assigned this book for a college class and, not being particularly excited to do homework, I begrudgingly started it this morning. It was perfect. I smiled and sobbed at various places throughout the story, and though it was sad and tragic and I could tell from the very start, I loved it. John Green is my new favorite author. He writes beautifully, and I will definitely be purchasing more of his books.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. Well written. Seamless integration of his story with delicious tasty healthy recipes, all easy to make. This book would inspire you to run. As someone who is contemplating moving from marathon running to Ultra running, this book makes it seem v possible!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it. I even thought about it when I wasn't reading it, like it was my world!!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|This film having eschewed cheesy dialogue and Rob Schneider, made it instantly superior. The &#34;Day in the life of&#34; script, and choice of villains, kept the movie well grounded IMO. It felt like contemporary police dramas we have all seen before. But the &#34;futuristic&#34; elements. enhance the action, instead of distracting you from it. The violence is brutal and graphic at times, so not for the little ones.<br /><br /> On the downside: It inspires some of the same frustrations I have with many other films. I will not include spoilers; you will likely understand what I am referring to, once you have watched it . They are the garden variety frustrations along the lines of &#34;Why didn't you....?&#34;  &#34;You could have just....&#34;  stuff. The other thing that I did not like, was the way he portrayed Dredd, seemed like an impression of Stallone, more than his own interpretation of the character.
B009X2CVXA|5.0|this is a great book<br />keeps you engaged right to the end<br />i love the way kate morton writes<br />mk
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I have been an internet radio listener and occasional broadcaster since the late 90's and have purchased and used tune in radio on iPhone, Windows (which is the worst version), and fire.<br /><br />It's the best app for internet radio. They update it often, it's pretty stable, can record, and has a lot of stations. When I was looking for an radio app I tried several, and this is the one that was worth my money.<br /><br />My only complaints (or rather feature requests) are:<br />1. On the kindle fire hd the screen size is not well utilized. It would be nice if the ui was made to fit the larger sizes better.<br />2. I would like some method to control having it automatically turn off and fade out after playing for set amount of time so when I listen in bed it will shut off after I fall asleep.<br />3. Visualizations - it would be awesome if in addition to flashing the album cover had some winamp style visuals(they don't need to be super high end processor intensive either). Just something where I can put tune in on and put it in the stand on my nightstand and transform my fire hd into a cool radio.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing read! The author captures you from the beginning. I could not put it down. I highly recommend this series.
B001VNB54A|5.0|Bought this for Christmas. Was a great price and the bargain and shipping was to good to pass up. Shipping was fast and the Blu-Ray version of this title was very enjoyable.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down and was so sad when it was over. It is now one of my favorite books I've ever read. Thank you.
B009ME47H2|1.0|I used this app to record a very important lecture. I started the recording then left my tablet there.<br /><br />On the half time break, I checked it and to my surprise, the app stopped recording by itself after 10 minutes. So I lost the lecture recording.<br />On the second half, I used smart recorder app and it did the job well.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am pinning off &amp; on all day.  I've found so much amazing info.  There are a few things I would change or add, but nothing to quit over.  Forbid!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Fantastic Movie and actors! The music is also tremendous! Machio's performance and mastery of the guitar in such a short time is awe inspiring.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|This a great entertaining movie! There is a lot of action action sequences. Cool car chase scenes. Beautiful locales. I like action movies and was glad I got this movie in bluray.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My 4 almost 5 yr old loves MLP; but was very frustrated by this game given the overabundance of in game choices.  I don't recall seeing an age recommendation; but I could be in error here.  At any rate, this game is for older kids; whom i suspect have probably grown away from MLP.  Tired of Gameloft injecting money making gimics at every turn....like walking thru checkout at grocery store with your kids amidst all the candy...
0062060562|5.0|This book is different than the usual fictions that I read. It keeps you wanting to turn the page with lots of twists and turns. I couldn't put it down it was so good!  Have passed it on to two other friends and they both agree it is GREAT!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I'm a big fan. I've read all their books.<br />  Murder, Nazis,Cloak and dagger, secrete hideouts.<br />  How can you go wrong with all these aspects.
B007EECSFA|5.0|In 1961, 16-year-old Laurel Nicolson witnessed her beautiful and loving mother, Dorothy, murder a man. It is written off as an accident but Laurel is never able to reconcile her image of her almost perfect mother with that of murderess. Now, fifty years later, Laurel is a famous actress, with England's 'second most trusted face' and her mother is dying. Laurel is determined that, before Dorothy dies, she will discover what was behind that horrible event in 1961.<br /><br />Switching between England during the blitz of 1941 and the present, author Kate Morton lays out what led to the murder and how Laurel slowly uncovers Dorothy's past. Morton has created some wonderful characters and a fascinating mystery in this novel about love, betrayal, and family secrets. She also does a pitch-perfect job of evoking the sights and sounds of London during the blitz: the periods of normalcy, the attempts to live every minute to its fullest, the ability to work selflessly to help others while, at the same time, suspending pre-war morality, and, of course, the bombings themselves which seem to explode off the pages. Her eye and ear for detail bring a feel of reality to this time period which is often lacking in historical fiction.<br /><br />The journey from the murder to the final solution is a long and twisty one and the road is littered with the debris of family secrets, of plots and betrayal and lives lived in war time. Ultimately, though, it is a very satisfactory journey and one well worth taking.
0765325950|5.0|People will debate the merits of \\"The Wheel of Time\\" for a long, long time to come. I don't think I'm going to participate in that debate. The final book was everything I had hoped it would be. (And a minor form of compulsion in and of itself.) Thank you to everyone involved for allowing this series to find a satisfying conclusion. There are so many surprises in this story, and so many smack your forehead \\"How could I have missed that?\\" moments in this book that it's hard not to be awestruck by it as a whole work.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Last book of three, all are great to read, entertaining, you will like. Great book. You will enjoy reading. five stars
B0076DELIG|4.0|Story is fast paced and each chapter makes you want to keep on reading.  I have read other books by Michael Connelly and his character Dective Bosch.
0385366752|4.0|This book was good and twisted...I didnt care for the ending but then I dont think it would of been a good book if predictable.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If there were anything I would change, it would be the ability to toggle to a variety of more complex calculators. I use it to balance my checkbook mostly so I'm happy with it.
0345529057|5.0|These books are extremely hard to put down, but once you finish them you'll want to pick them right back up and marvel at the elaborate and complex family trees and masterful character development.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Screw that guy who said this wasn't better than harry potter he hasnt even read the book so just screw that guy
B007N8RULO|5.0|Braibiun developed games are the best. the layout is clear, it only takes 1click (2clicks really irritate me). I will ALWAYS get Brainiums.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Great game! I have played this on my computer and loved it. I was very glad to see it on Amazon apps. Fun on the kindle as well!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great finish. I still want to know what happened to Linc. However, it was very entertaining. Wonderful!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to read the Bible, no matter where I am.  It's so encouraging and edifying.<br />Thank you.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|This is the first book by Oscar Wilde that I have read and I am glad that I chose it.  It is also the first book that I have read using my new Kindle.  It was a good experience both with the Kindle and the book.  I highly recommend it.  I now understand why Oscar Wilde is considered a great writer.  Kelly Robinson
B006P96PAO|5.0|Great movie.  Depicts the reality oif raising a family and the courage it takes to be a good father.  Watch it.
B005EGXNLS|3.0|If you love vivid battle descriptions, blood and Gore, you will find this a good read. I LOVE HISTORY, enjoyed that aspect but got bored with the battlefield details.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Its easy reading, very little concentration required very predictable, don't think i would be looking for any other books my this author
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book has to many details of sexual experiences in it for me ! I was told it was a good book by another reader much younger than myself !! I will finish it but I will not order any more Shades of Grey !
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This is facebook is okay on Kindle, only thing everytine you read comments it goes back to beginning instead to where you  were.
0345528581|5.0|There are enough exercises in this book for your lifetime routine. It is amazing what you can do with just your body weight; no machines, no free weights, no fuss no muss.
B00887490Y|4.0|Arrived promptly, in good shape and was an intriguing movie.  A good recommendation for anyone who wants to watch a movie that makes one think.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I seen Karol on TV after Bl. John Paul II passed to his eternal reward, I loved it so I bought it!! I also collect JP2 memorabilia.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Watched this with my wife because she loves to sing. Didn't think it would be my kind of movie. Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />Have watched it 15 times in the past couple of weeks! Has pretty much been on at least one of our TVs since we got the BluRay package and activated this, the digital copy.<br /><br />What a fun movie with impressive acting/singing.<br /><br />Added to my all time favorites...even if it does cost me my &#34;man card!&#34;
B008HK3XU4|1.0|I purchased this case so that I would be able to take my kindle to the gym.  It doesn't fit the supposed 7&#34; kindle fire that I recently purchased and continues to slide out of case unless I remain extremely still on my desk....so disappointed and so mad I thru out the box so that I can't return it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The switching back and forth from time line really didn't distract from the story. Great Read! I ordered the next book by Kate Morton.
1579129129|5.0|A quality book with Dudley and Winchester....  The reader is transported into the fascinating world of evolution with a new twist
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Just as described. I love the adjustable brightness feature, &amp; white noise option as you fall asleep. The weather is an added bonus.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Love playing Mahjong on computer, so tried it on my Kindle Fire.  Same fun, but you never lose.  The tiles are reset until you clear all of them.  That's OK--I'm not keeping score anyway.  Loads quickly and has no snags so far.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful writing. Can not say enough about this book. I stayed up all night because I could not put it down. Heartwarming and sad...Loved Sky and Holder so much!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is one of his best!! Amazing and compelling. Will definitely keep you guessing and wanting more, it's a sure page turner! So glad I read it. Smartest kindle purchase yet.
B00A77II0U|3.0|I have done all different puzzles and mystery type programs, I have to say this one was a little weird and freaky.... It was o.k. to play...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This program is set up in such a way that it's so very easy to use.Everything at a glance. GREAT
B007712XAU|5.0|Very entertaining and leaves you wanting to see more. Great cliff hangers! I want more! Can't wait for season 3.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Starts out deceptively easy, then gets more challenging.  Fun to play and probably helpful in learning problem solving techniques.  Good for passing time.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|Not really looking for a deep reflection on the state of the worlds economy and financial markets and its Barons. I was warned yet I still didn't enjoy it. The actors and actresses did a fine job, each one of them I have a lot of respect for. Wish I had a PhD to deconstruct the layers of this movie. To add perspective.. I loved inception...and that was a multi-tiered movie also...
B000ZOW96Y|2.0|The first two were elaborate but semi-believable, the third was just too much.  The obsessive request to get revenge was just exhausting.  The best part was the poor hotel diamond reviewer and good ending.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I ordered one for myself and one as a gift. I am a musician and I love the quality and pieces on this cd.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is fully action packed and has a bunch of romance and love for your family. I chose this rating for this blog because the book was actually that good. And I would recommend this book to someone who loves action and romance.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Bought this to watch for date night. This movie is hilarious and appeals to all ages, highly recommend watching if you have never seen it.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was ok I liked it but to me it was not the best book I ever read. I wish it had a little more detail.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've tried at least 7 other clock apps...nothing else comes close.  This  clock sits on my nightstand and does its job PERFECTLY.  It offers a plethora of options, it is RELIABLE and very easy to adjust.  Excellent app.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. I like the look of the interface. I would definitely recommend it. The best part is it's free.
B008745B32|3.0|I had a hard time with Waugh's tone. Dialogue throughout the novel can be described as pretentious, and after reading Waugh's letters to friends and editors while he was writing, I think it's because Waugh himself was pretentious, snooty, and very self satisfied with his writing and newfound Catholicism.
6305508550|5.0|Finally added this gem of a movie to our collection, don't know why we didn't do it sooner. the end
B006TVQU6C|4.0|I bought and shipped this to Nairobi, East Africa, and its an awesome case. Good ventilation, plenty of room! Took out one star for a bent Mobo stand.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome is all I have to say. This book is nothing more than a amazing movie being played in your head with great visuals and I can't wait to read the second book!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was a fun read. Reminds you of that first love and the roller coaster ride that goes along with it. Made me feel 10 years younger.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|This is a compehensive study of the man who is most likely the greatest political figure in our nation's history.  The book is compelling and was thoroughly researched.  It doesn't read like a novel but neither does it read like a dry book of history.  This is a &#34;must read&#34; for someone who is seriously interested in understanding Abraham Lincoln's legacy.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|While I did enjoy finishing the last book in the trilogy, I did not enjoy this one as much as the first two. It was very all over the place and far fetched, so I felt the story lacked the captivating qualities that The Hunger Games and Catching Fire did.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a very long time.  Couldn't put it down. Loved all of the books!
B005K2Z2O2|5.0|LOOKS GOOD, EASY TO USE:  WHAT'S NOT TO LIKE? LOOKS NICE, TOO, WITH TRICOLOR COVER IN RED, GRAY AND BLACK!
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a very well-thought and digestible style of writing that's addictive. I've used quotes from this book in both academic papers and fund-raising speeches. I liked his writing so much that I went on to purchase his other two novels, BLINK and THE TIPPING POINT, as well.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I enjoy this game very much.  I appreciate that a free app has this much quality. I highly recommend Mystery Manor.
B00846REIS|4.0|The story moved quickly but I enjoyed it. I like the darkness in it. Very new and a different angle.
0765325950|5.0|Forget all the one star reviews, those are just people whining because there is no e-book yet and has nothing to do with the quality of the book.<br /><br />Memory is very satisifying and epic finish to the series and readers have no reason to complain except that its over.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Although it felt a little predictable, I couldn't put this book down. The romance aspect is kinda lame, but the major points of the story are interesting.
B0098460O4|5.0|Came promptly and in very good condition. It was a gift for my daughter, so I have no idea what shape the CD was in. But I got no complaints from her.
B001F12J0C|4.0|Bought this as a Christmas present. Three in One  Bourne what's not to like.<br />My Brother in law loved it
B0084IHVGG|5.0|When my daughter told me this was her favorite movie I just had to get it for her. And of course this is the only place I could find it!
0316228532|4.0|Very different read from an author I enjoy. Small town politics and small town gossip from a British point of view. I enjoyed the characters and the character development. An enjoyable read.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Pretty disappointing conclusion. At some points, I felt like I was forcing myself to continue reading, but wasn't really that invested in the story anymore.
030758836X|3.0|The book came in quite quickly. It was for a book club forum, so it wasn't something I would have probably ordered myself. If you don't like a lot of vulgar language it will be fine. Not a book I would recommend to my friends.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Can't really rate it. Bought it for my sister who got a Kindle last year for Christmas. She was very pleased with it.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Did the water test --- make sure you do this to insure that the warranty will apply if needed.  Feel more secure with 14 year old having this fragile expensive piece of equipment with the LifeProof case!
0307887448|5.0|Future storyline looking back on the impact of the 80's technology, music and television was very different and very enjoyable, Now I have to hope the author writes a second book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|LOVE it could not put the BOOK down great READ<br />It keep me on my toes want to read the mockingjay
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham . Need I say more? His books you don't want to put down. He draws you in with the first page of this book. I read this cover to cover in 2 days. Yes I have read better books of his, but this one is great!
B001YYQ9SS|3.0|cool movie and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Nothing else to say, read it. You won't regret it! I was pulled in right away, and it doesn't let you go til the end. I will be reading more of Colleen Hoover!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|If you are looking for a fun adventure story this is the book for you. It is a little kiddish but its a kids book so oh well. Still a great book to introduce your kids to Greek and Roman mythology. Rick Riordan does a great job at storytelling.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|i would like a free cheeseburger.with some french fries.extra.oh and some soda.am i going to become famous if someone famous reads this? oh and i haven't read this so too bad. :[
B005ISQ7JM|1.0|It's not describing anything in detail only writes broadly about HTML5.<br /><br />If you are a technical person or a developer it's totally waste of time.<br /><br />I'm very disappointed about this \\"book\\"...
B00006G8G4|5.0|cool set and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
B008ELUEQC|3.0|I bought this hoping Rod would sing more upbeat and newer Christmas songs. His music is always good, so it wasn't a total  waste, but he sang a lot of slow, traditional old Christmas songs. Not a lot of lively ones typical of his normal music.<br /><br />It's good, but not great. I don't know if I would have bougt it or not if I had hear all of the songs all of the way through first.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Loved every bit of it!!! Felt the emotions taking me away as they did to the characters. Definitely something worth reading!!
0767817664|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and Chirs Sarandon made a delicious vampire.  Although it wasn't as scary as I would have liked, it was a fun movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|While it can drag on a bit, the love story is one of the best I've ever read. While I liked Under the Dome, this is by far the best Stephen King book in my eyes. Don't pass this up, especially at 4$ which is a complete steal.
B004KKX814|5.0|cool toy and nice to have dont really have much else to say but you know you should really pick it up
B0041D843M|5.0|For someone who is not a dietician or scientist I thought this would be a heavy read.<br />Authors have writ tent this for the lay person and deserve congratulations.<br />One of the most important books ever IMHO.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I love the TV series on USA. I had to get my hands on the first season as unlike other shows I love watching these over and over. Arrived in perfect condition. Looking forward to owning season 2
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I guess I gave it four stars for the ending. It was a great book but could have had a better ending.
B0074V3712|5.0|Wilson draws from a knowledge base wider and deeper than almost anyone.  Some will definitely not 'like' some of what he says, but that's likely because they are the ones who most need to process what he's saying.
034580404X|3.0|I guess it is good reading, my sister took it when it was delivered, and I have not had a chance to read it.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|i at first didnt give this cd a chance but after listening to it i really liked it i guess you could say i had contempt  prior to investiagation
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun app.  different games to play and pretty easy to get the points to unlock other games
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This was the first game i got on my new kindle that i got for xmas from my awesome mom!
B000W93CXQ|5.0|Having lost someone very close to me to suicide there are some things I wish I could of said. I felt and connected with Clay on a deep level. this is a really good book and think anyone should read this to get an insight into the life of Hannah. Truly beautiful story.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Just like the title says.  15 more words required to submit this review of this Intel GT PCI Netowrk Adapter.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|My 12 year old daughter, who has spent the last 6 months repeatedly listening to a specific hip-hop album is a convert.  This soundtrack is now her go to music selection.  I particularly like Russell Crowe, though Eddie Redmayne is strong as well.
0765325950|1.0|my review has nothing to do with the quality of the book, but the delay in releasing it in eBook format. Gone are the days of hauling around a 10 pound bulky book. If you haven't heard nowadays the preferred medium for reading is on an E-reader. Very disappointing, looks like I will be waiting till April or longer to read the final installation of The Wheel of time:(
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I got this app for my 7 year old = he loves angry birds.  we have gotten a few more apps of angry birds as well.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Challenging,color is great .it's just awesome great job guys a must for everyone.it is very helpful in teaching my grandson to learn his numbers in order
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I haven't read the first two books yet, but now that I have read this one I am downloading them tonight.  I couldn't put it down. I loved it.
B000UNYJV8|4.0|A good introduction to this England 86 and 88 looking forward to the next one a true picture of England at that time.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This would have to be one of the nest books that I have ever read in a long time. It's got everything love, mystery it's got it all. So if you like love and mystery books you should read the Search by Nora Roberts.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case did a fantastic job protecting my phone after I left it on the hood of my SUV and drove away!  I found my phone in the middle of an intersection about a mile away from my house with only a minor nick on the corner where I presume it struck the pavement.  The plastic has turned a bit brown and dingy over the past 15 months, but it's protected my phone well!
0984183523|5.0|For me this book has so far has been the best read I've tried. It's certainly a great way to start your case interview prep, and chance are that you will not need any other such resources (I mean, I found it difficult to spare intuitive, common sense \\"frameworks\\" for more standardized ones).<br />It could be marginally improved by including a little more extensive discussions of market sizing problems and of the fit interview.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you like the pc version GET THIS:?<br />It is worth tour money. On the kindle fire it is not updated though.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have a 4 month old son and he just figured out how to fight his sleep. So he whines himself to sleep and he has a mobile but I don't want to have to keep walking in the're winding it . up so I got this FREE! app and it's amazing my son likes piano n rain so I played the piano and waterfall button n it's awesome.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Heard everybody talking about homeland so I thought I would check it out.  Wonderful.  We are hooked on the series
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Love the series and the commentry that are provided on the blue ray. Also love the picture quality that the show has.
0553381407|4.0|I have to admit that this is emotionally difficult to read. It's hard to admit that one's parents didn't care for you the way they should have. This book helps you to see if you are one of the many who could have had parents that did a much better job. I feel that acceptance of the truth is an essential part of the healing process. I'm not at a point were I am dwelling on the past anymore, but to a place where I can openly and honestly look at what I lived through and accept the facts. I think you have to be at that place to read this book. I recommend it to those who are serious about healing and are at the right place to read it.

B005ZUR724|5.0|It's awesome if you have internet and have have local players to do it with epic titties! Oh btw it's boring alone and there's additional downloading and updates.
B002361MLA|5.0|Impeccable book! This book has a lot of insight on how to find love, compassion and joy. No more fear, anxiety, frustration,  or depression. It's a simple concept; Utilize the power of now , realize your divine nature.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a brilliant book I can't wait to read the next one that's in the series. I love it.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Implies it will sync but cannot find where to specify the Google calendar name. Will raise rating if this is solved.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I liked this book so much I read it twice.  Very entertaining Grisham read.  Would recommend it for a light read
0061537969|5.0|Dynamite book, makes you want to bond with your dog and be way more thoughtful of them as a best friend
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I just watched Django and it was amazing and so I had to backtrack because every interview I read about Django this movie was brought up in discussion about how awesome it and they were right, I was very entertained two thumbs up!
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Get a glass of  scotch, turn the lights down low, start a fire in the fireplace and relax!  Great voice, Terrific background for reading or relaxing with eyes closed or just enjoying with your significant other.  Will definitely get more of her music.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|If you have a large memory on your internal memory it is worth keeping.<br />Otherwise you will be dumping it.<br />Works great!  Impossible for me to figure how to put on simcard.  Good Luck.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book is ludicrous.  A couple of 17 year old KIDS running around acting like adults, unsupervised by any responsible parents, making out.  They both use lines during the \\"romantic\\" scenes like \\"I've been waiting for you all my life\\".  Really.  At 17.  So, who are these people writing these 5 star reviews.  Beats me.  Maybe teenagers stepping up from Harlequin romances?  The child abuse angle just made the whole thing sicker.  I'm no prude, I just didn't find this to be a very good book and more importantly, I think 17 year olds reading this will find \\"support\\" for acting out in all kinds of inappropriate ways.
B00A757EFW|1.0|It is very hard to play on the Kindle.  The Pac-Man does not move when you want him to.  I would not recommend it for Kindle.
1599290634|5.0|I own most of the Spectrum books...beginning with Spectrum 1.  Each year the artwork just becomes more spectacular.<br /><br />As the title suggests Spectrum 19 focuses on \\"Fantastic\\" Art.  And I would further define that by saying most of it falls loosely in the following categories:  Fantasy (ala Lord of the Rings - goblins, fairies, elves and so on); Science-Fiction (including space scenes, robots, aliens etc); \\"Dark\\" subjects like skeletons, witches, demons and the like; cartoony / comic pieces; Knights and faire maidens, castles and lotz and lotz of dragons in all shapes and sizes and temperaments.  :)<br /><br />The artists represented work in all kinds of mediums including traditional (like oil and acrylic painting) and lots of digital painting (Photoshop, Painter etc).  As with past issues...there is a section with photographs of sculptures too.<br /><br />I'd read at least one review that almost dissuaded me from buying this year's Spectrum but after I looked through Spectrum 18 again...I decided to get it.<br /><br />It is certainly has not been a disappointment!  Spectrum 19 is over 300 pages with some of the most inspiring, exciting, art I've seen.  I've already been sitting with a magnifying glass going through the images and am stunned by the creativity, color, concepts, \\"story\\" etc in many, many of the images.<br /><br />I've studied art history and believe that this era WILL be remembered for its amazing art.<br /><br />If you are an artist yourself...especially one working in Fantastic art...you will be inspired by this book.<br /><br />[/Fan-Boy OFF]<br /><br />;)<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />A note about the claim that Spectrum is filled with art that is photo-referenced:  First I'll say that generally I do not have a problem with this technique.  I read once that artists are not supposed to be good \\"memorizers\\".  So why not use photography as a tool.<br /><br />On the other hand...unless there is a secret world where people photograph robots of all shapes and sizes, huge trolls and four armed giants, elephant-type beasts with six tusks, space-ships and cities, dinosaurs, demons, and bizarre creatures beyond what most of us can imagine...to say that the majority of this art is from a photo reference is far from the truth.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few amazing examples of this type...but they are vastly outweighed by all the other artwork...obviously created primarily from the artist's imagination.bots of all shapes and sizes, huge trolls and four armed giants, elephant-type beasts with six tusks, space-ships and cities, dinosaurs, demons, and bizarre creatures beyond what most of us can imagine...to say that the majority of this art is from a photo reference is far from the truth.<br /><br />Yes, there are a few amazing examples of this type...but they are vastly outweighed by all the other artwork...obviously created primarily from the artist's imagination.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Couldn't pass up buying this movie when it was dirt cheap at $10!<br />Iron man is one of my sons favorite action stars and he watches the first two movies over and over.<br /><br />I like the overall story, think it was a great follow up to first movie, and cant wait for the next one due out 2013.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I guess the word has started to really get out on Hugh Howey. Up and coming for good reason. These books were a good read. They seemed to get better with each one and you can almost see him getting better as a writer as you go along. No small feat for a self-published author (now with a publishing deal). I look forward to reading more!
1451613512|1.0|I should have known not to be an Oliver Stone book. Pure propaganda. The author needs to find another country to hate.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|For a fan this is just the best - looks great and sounds great. A gift from the 24th century.
098357670X|5.0|This book really delivers!<br /><br />There is a wealth of information covered...all written in a clear, easy to understand way...with lots of excellent images to underscore lessons.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to become better at caricature!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Downloaded this for my Rezound with no issues.  Kids use it mostly and its very handy when i need to entertain the kids during meetings or appointments.<br /><br />We are big fans of the whole series!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so much fun! I can't stop  playing.  I've gotten my entire family hooked.  My 3 yr old especially likes it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I read the conflicting reviews for Looper but decided to watch for the star power alone.  I was astonished at the bad reviews for this flick.  It was imaginative, well scripted, directed and acted.  What more could you want for a good sic-fi flick.  When you choose to watch a movie of this caliber it is to your advantage to turn out the lights and sit back without distractions, otherwise you might miss nuances that clarify events and actions.<br />No disappointments here.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Très bon jeu de gestion  à la Simcity !! Je suis adepte au concept de construire sa propre ville, la faire évoluer, etc..
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book. It kept me guessing all the way through, a rare treat in a story these days. Hard to believe she wrote this book in a month. I can't wait to read what Ms. Morgenstern might do if she had two or three months or longer to conjure a story.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie hit expectations and has my family excited for all the spin offs that may come!<br /><br />We enjoyed all the characters, Iron man seems to be the house favorite.
0374214913|4.0|I just finished reading Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore and thought it was truly charming. This novel about life at the intersection of books and technology and the importance of friendship was the perfect post-holiday read.  One minor complaint, though... I want to know who Grumble is!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I rate this book six stars!  IMO, Colleen Hoover sets the benchmark for brilliant story writing in this genre.  I love a writer who can make me &#34;feel&#34; the words on the page.  I found myself rereading paragraphs because they were so beautifully written and pausing to reflect on the many emotions this story called forth in me.  Well done!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|BORING game know one likes it do not buy this it will wast your money and know one likes that.
B005ZUR724|1.0|this game sucks.its a waste of money 7 dollar make it 4.the control are hard to use and people spam on the trade chat.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Fun and a bit silly, we all laugh and enjoy sitting together and watching Brave.<br />Well written, keeps you entertained and worthy of constant watching!<br /><br />When i look to get a movie for the kids, i want it to be something that everyone will enjoy and will want to be watched over and over, Brave definitely fell in that category.  With the multiple disc we can take it in the car also!<br /><br />We love this movie!
B00ARAO1LC|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen. 10 million $ budget. Enough said. The story sucked. The acting sucked.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book makes you feel all warm and fuzzy about life, the universe, god, everything. Amazing read. I loved it!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|We found this Thor Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy combo set for daughter and bought for her Christmas, along with 3 other DVD sets. they arrived in prefect shape and prefect timing.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|...but the interface is not as efficient as I'd prefer.  Seems like you have to wade thru some superfluous screens to get through your turn.  In irritant, but the game is still fun.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Have been a big batman fan since i was little, the previous movies have unfortunately let me down.  The last three by Nolan have all been great.  I love the dark knight concept of batman, its guttier and darker (dark knight, i know).  To me this movie was well done, well put together, Bane is a great character and the movie clicks right along keeping you engaged.  I also enjoy how they don't incorporate a lot of profanity into the movies, to many movies these days are loaded with profanity, I don't mind it, but sometimes it can be overwhelming.<br /><br />Action packed from start to finish, but yet maintains the main story.  I am saddened that they are ending the series, but excited for the possible catwoman series with the gorgeous Anne Hathaway.<br /><br />Recommended for sure!
B000002KKD|4.0|I bought this when it first came out on vinyl and then recently I watched their DVD &#34;...With the Wild Crowd&#34; and got nostalgic.  I saw them live once in the early 80's in Portland and it was just like that.  Here though I had forgotten how terrible their cover of &#34;Downtown&#34; is.  But that's forgivable considering everything else on here is great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't have been more pleased with the purchase of these books. It was a fully engaging, wonderful story from start to finish. I've read First Shift and Second Shift too and I can't wait for more silo stories!!! Keep 'em coming!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Bought this for Kids to watch. but we enjoied it as much as they did. Cute movie, fun to watch. great for all ages.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was not sure I wanted to read a Stephen King book,  however, I'm glad that I did,  11/22 will make you think.  I have discussed this book with friends and co-workers.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I am a huge fan of Indiana Jones, so it was certain i was going to enjoy this set.  Once the price became unbeatable i jumped all over it.  Family loves to watch them, have made them big fans also.  Highly recommended to anyone that wants to be able to watch these masterpieces anytime they want.<br /><br />Also, on a side note, big Kudos to Amazon!  I purchased this product and did not open it until Christmas, one of the discs had a small crack that made it unplayable in my PS3, I was past the return date, but a quick email to amazon resolved that.  They sent me a replacement set and I returned the previous, all is great now!  Excellent work Amazon, that is why I will always recommend them!
B00867GHS8|5.0|Good purchase for the money spent.  We gave it as a Christmas gift to our grandson.  Very quick shipment and well packed
B0016CVN0W|5.0|Some lost gems. Jiving Sister Fanny, I Don't Know Why and I'm Going Down  are outstanding in their genre'. And the Stones fan will be amused by some of the questionable decisions (Much Rather Be With The Boys) .and the alternate versions.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Bought for Daughter Christmas along with Thor and IM 1 & 2.  She Loves them all and the all arrived together and in great shape. Fast shipping made Christmas present possible
0810996596|5.0|A must for any Metallica fan. Beautiful book put together really well. Beautiful pics and great stories from the master.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is a great blue ray box set. If you are a batman fan you diffidently want this box set and the price was great too.
0307887960|5.0|When I decided to give a try to this diet I wasn't too confident but the book guides you through all the process and really after a while I really feel that this way of life can help me from here.  I recommend the book and the diet.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I would recommend this book. It was a great follow up to his other book and if you enjoy historical novels this is a good one to read.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|We found this DVD combo set for daughter and bought for her Christmas, along with 3 other DVD sets. they arrived in prefect shape and prefect timing.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Works well with my Office products. However have not a lot of respect for the printer function could be better. But the functionally works well on my Kindle and Bu-tooth keyboard.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Hard to believe that this game was free because it plays so well without any bugs! I play it on my kindle fire and it operates smoothly and quickly. Great color and display graphics. I would definitely recommend this game.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|don't know if its my wifi or there servers, jus n case better have a broadband connection. almost unplayable... so much lag. other than that, good game
B0076DELIG|3.0|I really like Michael Connelly as an author.<br />This got a little too complicated and the ending reminded me of something out of a comic book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't put into words how utterly fabulous this book is. I became a fan of Hoover with Slammed and the Point of Return, but nothing prepared me for Hopeless. I can honestly say that I can't compare it to anything else I've ever read. I highly recommend this book. By far one of the best I've ever read. Kudos to Hoover for such amazing writing.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Sound like a commercial?  Well, I write and voice commercials.  Either way, you want this and need this for your Kindle Fire.  Perfect for charging with the power adapter (can even charge your Droid X phone).  Even more perfect  for data exchange from your computer to your Kindle.  And really, really inexpensive.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Just got this charger today. Was hard to plug into the car, and wouldn't stay plugged into the phone (kept falling out). Sending it back right away. Disappointing!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case does exactly what you need it to do.  It protects the Kindle Fire and provides a great stand if you are reading at a table or even in bed.  Good value for the money and comparable to similar, higher priced products.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|The first (and last) two stories are verrrry slow. I almost gave up on the book in the beginning. The middle stories are much better--I especially liked Sonmi and Zachry. But then when I came around to Frobisher and Ewing again, it was slow going. The stakes in those two stories are so low, especially when compared with the other sections. Parts of the book are worth it, but unless you want to slog through 200 pages of tedium to get to them I'd skip Cloud Atlas.

1609611543|5.0|As a narrative, this book is just about readable.  It compliments cited scientific data with bantering conservative humor, all while demonizing wheat on every single page.  The claims in this book are so bold, though, that you won't want to put it down.  The point it tries to hammer home again and again is that wheat, the dietary substance that we all know and love, is the number one cause of obesity and other health problems in the first world.  This is a byproduct of years of under-tested genetic modification on a plant that wasn't entirely stable to begin with.<br /><br />These claims hard to believe, and yet make sense at the same time.  Wheat is in nearly everything, so nearly all Americans consume it in abundance unless they are taking painstaking precautions to avoid it.  Currently, the majority of Americans are obese.  Could wheat be the common link in the obese chain?<br /><br />David goes on further to claim that not only does wheat cause obesity, it also causes joint pain, high cholesterol, diabetes, and even mental disease.  This among a variety of other common ailments.<br /><br />From my personal experience with eating wheat free, I would say that at least some of these claims hold merit.  While I wasn't overweight when I started eating gluten free, I did sport a small amount of midsection fat that stubbornly stayed in place despite my frequent trips to the gym.  I am a male in my early 20s who was generally healthy otherwise while eating wheat... or so I thought.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed after giving up wheat for New Years (a resolution to try the diet on a two week trial,) was that my sleep had vastly improved.  Quickly.  I used to wake up a few times in the night, but Now I sleep all the way through until morning.  Instead of shouting curses at the alarm clock from under the covers, I shoot wide awake minutes before it buzzes, like clockwork.  I can easily opt out of caffeine, too.  This was never an option before.<br /><br />I alsonoticed that joint pain had vastly decreased at the gym.  It used to be that when I'd lift a considerably heavy weight, I would get minor pains in my wrists.  I would also get pains in my ankles at the beginning of a run.  Those phenomena are entirely gone with the elimination of wheat.<br /><br />Finally, I have noticed that I feel much sharper and more focused.  I used to verge on dozing off at work, even though I love my job. This sleepiness has ceased entirely.<br /><br />I can't say that my bit of stomach fat has gone away yet, but I have only been wheat free for 13 days now.  I'll give it another few weeks and see.  Even without losing that bit of belly, the other health effects were astonishing.  Dr. Davis has done his research on this, and is not exaggerating about the widespread issues that wheat causes.<br /><br />Should you buy this book?  If you want to try eliminating wheat and need incentive, then yes.  Davis also cites his sources, so you can do more research on this wide spread issue if you want to.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|great series of books. I loved them all. I was sad they came to an end. the authour has a great imagination
B001EN71CW|3.0|I give the show five stars, but the BD version has no episode guide, so I give it three.  I have to put in each disc to find out what's on it and then I can only see one episode at a time, as well.  I'm a bit disappointed, as that's AT LEAST what any DVD or BD set should have is an episode guide, hopefully one with a short summary, but at least one with titles.  That's why I'm giving it 3 stars.  Apparently, whoever set this up assumed that the viewers would only throw the discs in one by one and push \\"play all\\".  Not good.  I'm very ticked off right now, because I'm having trouble finding episodes for my wife and me to watch, and I'm throwing in one disc after another to find them.  I'm sure I'll cool off, but you really should be able to have an episode guide.
B004NSULHM|5.0|I only just realized that besides being Radiohead!, this album had been released on my birthday! No Wonder it's soo Awesome! HA!* I really don't get the average reviews..., (never loved a critic, anyways). First, sounds like Radiohead to me! Not like they are ever the same old, same old, You Know! Second, well, I've already expressed the Awesomeness.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Well written and easy to read. The plot was very clever and the characters were portrayed so well. Definitely recommend.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Not at all like the movie but we'll worth the read. Fantastic!!!! I loved the detail and all the new characters that were left out of the movie.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Was going to buy a cd but decided to buy it in vinyl. So glad I did.  Barbra didn't fail me and the sound coming from a record.  Really special.  Glad I went in this direction.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This has always been a fun game and it is a nice to be able fo play when you are traveling.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game was horrible! I love Angry birds games but this one was just not fun at all!! So sad!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This story was a surprisingly good read.  I look forward to getting started on the next book.  Truly very enjoyable!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I started out no wanting to watch this but it is a very funny movie.  Fat Amy is very good and I laugh very hard through most of the movie.
0763655465|5.0|My 2 and 5 year old love this book!  It reminds them of our dog and it teaches the important lesson that you need to do what's right even when no one's around.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|So many arcade games to enjoy in one app. I love itttttt!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Best game ever.The best thing is, is that its free.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This little app makes the time pass with hours of fun and enjoyment. My niece really thought this game was fun at Christmas.
B000H5U832|5.0|The item looks great and without any defects and there was no issue of shipment or anything else. thats great
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is fun it's not as easy as you might think. Most find hidden items games are boring. This one is not.
B00899DR40|2.0|There is such a stir over this singer that I thought I would try the album.  Very surprised - when I listened the first time, all I could think of was how bad the arrangements were.  I have never thought about the arrangement of an album - before it was if I liked it or not, or if it was my style of music.  I thought it was juvenile all the way around - not just in the singing, but in the production.  Very sloppy in all ways.  I just don't get what all the fuss is about.  I would suggest you borrow this album first before you decide to purchase, so you don't end up getting stuck with music that is second rate at best.  Waste of money.  If you like Pop music, try The Wanted, or One Direction Up All Night - both are very good.  If you are into Country Pop music, give Hunter Hayes a listen.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Was able to preorder it online & get it the day it came out.  My son & I love this movie
B008JGSM6G|3.0|its not a bad game - it is just a little to simplistic for my taste.  The game was diverting for awhile but I doubt I will go back to it.
888370536X|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my sister.  Of course, it is great quality as moleskine makes awesome stuff.  I really recommend this.
B001AXU1CS|4.0|Movie was just as advertised. Shipped pretty quick. Good present. The jacket over the movie is a great touch. Good quality
B006OITIQE|5.0|This is great up-beat music - I am a fan now.  It is fun and some of the songs have a great dance feel.  Very nice.
B00196YNWU|5.0|As a child I watched this all the time with my niece. Now my 2 yr old daughter can't get enough of it. Love that she sings & dances with them.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I wasn't my favorite read.  It was disorganized and kept jumping around.  Maybe it was just the sadistic nature of the story telling that got me.  It was a read that kept me going though, that's for sure.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is the 4th book of Ken Follett I have read and by far the best. I cannot wait for the third book of this series.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Recommend for all fans of thriller books fast paced and truly riveting read.Good read<br />If you are a Prendergast fan read this good read
B006LSZECO|5.0|It kept me guessing throughout from the start. I did not want to put it down. I loved the ending!
B0036BP6XQ|5.0|This is a movie i never tire of. I still get weepy eyed & feel all the emotions associated with this movie as I did the first time I watched it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was intriguing right from the start!  I had a hard time putting it down.  I only wish I had realized there are a bunch of books in this series first, then I would have started at the beginning of the series, instead of the middle.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I am completely hooked on this fantasy series. It is addictive to those who like this genre. The characters are oriiginal and realistic. you love them or love to hate them, or occasionally can not decide which. The characters grow and develop without changing at their core. And their survival does not depend on their &#34;goodness&#34; or their importance. This storoy  has held together through four volumes, and leaves you looking forward to the next installment. I highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is very fun , but I find there are too many ads!!!!! The makers of this game need  to get rid of all of them.<br />  When I first got the game, there where no ads at ALL! What happened?
B00AQCMK32|5.0|As a life-long lover of video games, a game where I can control a game development company is ideal. This was the first Kairosoft game I played, and it made me fall in love with their products. It's cute, fun, fast-paced, customizable, and amazing. You get to choose what kind of video game to make, what system it's on, and train your staff to make the best game ever. It has parodies of real consoles which I thought was very clever. Overall, if you like video games, this is a must-have. If you're a fan of Kairosoft, it's a must-have. Just get it! It's AMAZING!
B002722R64|5.0|Goldeneye is one of my favorite Bond movies ... Pierce Brosnan ... what else is there to say Brosnan as Bond!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a stellar piece from John Grisham.  It kept me up at night trying to &#34;just read a little more&#34;.  Thank goodness I was on vacation when I read it, otherwise I would have been in big trouble.  It was fast paced, and intriguing with great character development.  He knocked this one out of the park!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Good light reading. Needs more information about the  characters for greater depth in this story.  Would want more depth in plot.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Love trying to get to new levels. I would tell anyone to get this game, Its a lot of fun.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I am a fan of the cast of this movie and amazons unwavering delivery of high quality digital downloads. Thank you amazon for sending wonderful movies right to my ps3
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|My son has watched this 3x already.  I think it's more of a guys movie but regardless, it had me laughing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love these books, but I am a sappy romantic so there's that...  The BDSM I could have done without, but a greats series without a doubt.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|This is an excellent film. It may be old (1975), but it is the best movie that I've seen that describes duty and obligation and what it means to fulfill an obligation.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This Spider game closely duplicates desk/lap-top computer versions.  If it weren’t for the advertisement pop-ups it would be a five star app.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie for its social and political references and i feel that it is a good influence on the younger generation and their responsibility to maintain a respectful and courteous humanity. Having said that this was an instant digital download and I love  the fast service and high quality of digital movies that amazon offers.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great middle book!  A great book to segue into my favorite book, the third book.  It's not a book by Tolstoy, but for what it is, an amazing book!
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a good story with solid acting. An enjoyable, heart-touching story that is worth a couple of hours of time and the fee to rent.

B005IZLPME|1.0|Stupid pig idiots!! Why can't I hardly ever just buy a single blu-ray release? They think I need a sucky def dvd and 3d when I have no 3d tv. What is wrong with these hogs? I won't buy any releases packaged like this.I have'nt watched the blu-ray so I can't review the release..Screw 'em!!!

B005NPBT5M|5.0|It's difficult to say something new about The Wall. Its reputation as a Rock Classic is cast in stone; but, by the same token, it has also accumulated a set of standard objections from detractors. Personally, I love the album, but some of the \\"contra\\" arguments are convincing as well. Rather than bore you with another testimonial to The Wall's greatness, I thought I'd discuss some of the main counterpoints.<br /><br />1. \\"The Wall is about a whiny rock star complaining about being rich and famous.\\"<br /><br />It's hard to argue with this point, because it's true. This is, indeed, a concept album about a rock star named \\"Pink Floyd,\\" who wallows in alienation, complains about his over-protective mother, trashes his hotel room, and starts some kind of riot, without ever really repenting. This aspect of the album inspired legions of [[ASIN:B0094EDBM2 angst-rock]] musicians.<br /><br />But it's not _entirely_ true. The rock-star angle is more heavily emphasized in the [[ASIN:6305603847 movie]]. By contrast, the first half of the album is essentially a meditation on World War II and its effect on families. Among the songs that are not directly about war, \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2\\" is whiny, but has nothing to do with being rich and famous. \\"Young Lust\\" is a definitive portrayal of the universal sentiment stated in the title. Only \\"One Of My Turns\\" (the hotel room song) really adopts a rock star's point of view. On the second disc, the rock star plot doesn't kick in until \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and even then, half of that song is a plain expression of childhood nostalgia, which you don't need to be a rock star to understand. Before that, \\"Nobody Home\\" now sounds quite modest (surely you'll agree that we now have access to many more than thirteen channels of <...>), and \\"Hey You\\" is a self-abasing call for help.<br /><br />So, only about a quarter of the album is devoted to complaining about wealth and fame. You might say, with equal justification, that The Wall is awar album. The war songs are among the best, particularly \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 1,\\" where a single haunted verse starts as an intimate soliloquy by Gilmour, suddenly breaks into an anguished howl, and then disperses in an ambivalent extended outro.<br /><br />2. \\"The Wall is a complacent arena-rock album from a band that made its mark with wild experiments.\\"<br /><br />Again, this is almost true, in that nothing here is as daringly free-form as \\"[[ASIN:B004ZN9Q3K Echoes]].\\" There are verses, choruses, and solos. But, as the old dirty joke has it, there are nuances. First, these arena-rock ingredients are all very good. Gilmour's solo on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" may have required a lot of studio trickery, but that's only because it is a titanic experience. There's even a shorter solo earlier in the song as a sort of fake-out, to make sure you're not prepared for the real thing coming. Gilmour was not the world's most technically proficient guitarist, but he did the impossible -- he wrote solos, not just simple rhythmic riffs, but longer and more complex passages that the average rock listener (a fellow not known for his sophistication) nonetheless followed with undivided attention and committed to memory. By now, you can probably play the entirety of the solo from \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2\\" in your head. Try it.<br /><br />Second, the backdrop to these set-pieces also has a lot of colour. \\"Empty Spaces\\" is a fascinating moody soundscape, deservedly imitated by [[ASIN:B000002LOB Joy Division]] on \\"Exercise One.\\" It foreshadows the dark dread underlying post-punk and the electronic experiments of the eighties and nineties...and then it suddenly charges right into \\"Young Lust.\\" These bracing tonal shifts keep the album moving -- it is one of the few rock albums to run over 70 minutes and yet remain consistently engaging. On the second disc, the bassline from \\"Another Brick In The Wall\\" mutates into a dark evil-disco groove on \\"Run Like Hell,\\" another proto-electronic moment, and turns Roger Waters' goofy Nazi analogy into an unnerving nightmare vision. On the first disc, \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" starts with three minutes of off-key whining, but then unexpectedly coalesces into a tragic piano/guitar melody and a desperate, lost plea.<br /><br />3. \\"The Wall has a silly concept, and the lyrics are not deep.\\"<br /><br />Once more, almost true! (Notice a pattern?) Indeed, there are better things to do than analyzing Waters' lyrics for literary references, Freudian subtexts, and other shades of Deep Meaning (for example, the significance of \\"the worms\\"). But The Wall's nature as a concept album gives the band a lot of flexibility to write various interludes and segues that connect different parts of the concept while exploring interesting tones and musical about-faces. Half of these songs don't work as stand-alone songs, but if you listen to them all together while completely ignoring the concept, you'll still get a multi-faceted emotional experience, like a series of strange but incredibly affecting dreams. World War II, [[ASIN:0940512491 teenage lust]], alienation and dystopian fears don't have a lot to do with each other, but face it: they're all indelible, powerful parts of your cultural code, and juxtaposing them isn't totally meaningless. Even the most throw-away bits, like \\"Vera\\" and \\"Bring The Boys Back Home,\\" work against all odds, as one-minute fragments, disembodied voices echoing from old newscasts.<br /><br />In this sense, the movie does the album a disservice -- for example, \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 3\\" forcibly combines war imagery with shots of \\"Pink's\\" unfaithful wife, which trivializes both topics. The Scarfe animations added a much-needed level of abstraction to the movie, but for me personally, there's no point visualizing these songs at all. Pink Floyd may have become an arena rock band by 1979, but they still thought much more about atmosphere and dramatic flow than any stadium-filling act before or since.

B008KOTNVA|5.0|This driver kit has all the bits you need to work on electronics. The bits seem to be durable and the handle is large enough to apply as much torque as needed. I have already used this kit to replace the hard drive in my iMac and replace the battery in my iPhone. The carry case is quite convenient and the bits are clearly marked. I would recommend this kit to anyone who works on their electronic devices.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|Things I liked: Easy to use, nice variety of material, and you can do things with digital materials that you can't with the physical materials they're imitating (eg color over crayon with another color of crayon).<br /><br />Things I didn't like: Can't change the size of the pencil, marker and crayon. Can for the brush, but it's limited to only two sizes. Also, you can't zoom in (which would allow for more complexity). These aren't really things I expected with such a simple product, but they would be nice. The stamp comes with multiple designs, but only three (different) colors for each design, which seems arbitrarily limited. I haven't actually used the stamp, though, so it doesn't make a big difference to me.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good product for doodling. I've also used it to illustrate a point in conversation.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you watched the movie and haven't read the books you should.  They are will written and even though I had seen the movie I still enjoyed the first book.  read them all in a week and a half.

B001WCN232|2.0|great album but why i disliked<br />the shipping was due to the enclosure. the plastic internal mechanism holding the disk in place was all broken out when i opened the disk for the first time
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Rebecca Hamilton's writing style is both whimsical and beautifully detailed. I adored this line: \\"As bland as oatmeal, yet somehow I'd become the rumor mill's hot sauce.\\"<br /><br />The scene between Sophia and Charles when they dance at Club Flesh was so hot... like hot sauce hot - flaming! That was by far my favorite part of the book.<br /><br />For the first half of the book Sophia is preoccupied by the voices in her head (and whether her heritage can shed some light on this weirdness), the harassment by holier-than-thou Mrs. Franklin, and her relationship with Charles, namely the fact that he doesn't age while she does.<br /><br />Which leads me to another great bit of dialogue: \\"You're hilarious. Really. But what are you suggesting? I move in here, and then...what? You gonna fetch my walker when I'm eighty?\\"<br /><br />Love it!<br /><br />The Forever Girl really picked up for me about 60 percent of the way in when Sophia starts getting answers about her past and begins to tap into her powers. I love the concept of what it means to be a forever girl. Totally not what I thought it was going to turn out to mean.<br /><br />The concept is cool and unique. And there's a war brewing so I can only imagine the excitement to come!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|After seeing season 1 we are hooked.  The drama upstairs and down keeps your interest.  The characters are easy to like or dislike and the story line is so interesting.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Better than the movie because it is actually the play. A friend said it was wonderful so I bought it. And it was wonderful. I saw the play in Boston many years ago and absolutely loved it - this was the next best thing to being there.
B009E2WX3W|5.0|This was a great tape when I got it 25 years ago.  I am so glad to have it again in remastered digital quality.
0307742997|3.0|Entertaining but I little predictable and unorganized. The story didn't flow smoothly and he went off on unnecessary details and plot twists.
1439102430|3.0|Maybe it's just me, but lately it seems that the Tempe Brennan books aren't as good as they've been in the past.<br /><br />This one felt like the story didn't get fleshed out completely or something, because when it was over, I was still trying to figure out how Brennan connected all the dots. Maybe the author should worry less about the television show and concentrate more on her books, since her writing is what landed her a television deal to begin with.<br /><br />Then there's the fact that I'm getting sick of Brennan's life being in danger getting used as a plot device to tie things up. It happens in every single book, it seems. Kathy Reichs has beaten that horse to death and then some. Enough already!<br /><br />I also have to nitpick about Ryan making Tempe drink the minibar bottle of whiskey. Reichs emphasized early on in this book series that Tempe was an alcoholic and that one drink would be enough to run her right off the rails. Yet Brennan takes that drink and apparently, there are no consequences. Unless, of course, the author is saving that for her next book?<br /><br />I hate it when authors conveniently forget things that are a major part of a character's persona. Either Tempe is a raging alcoholic or she can drink without having a problem. Make up your mind which one its going to be!<br /><br />I think this story, especially the conclusion, could have used more fleshing out. The first half of the book was intriguing, but the last half wasn't. It just felt rushed to me.<br /><br />I'm not ready to call it quits on buying the Brennan books just yet, but if Reichs doesn't start paying more attention to her writing, I may have to.

B005LAII80|1.0|EDIT: I am not reviewing the film, for reasons that are obvious in the original review below, but I am review the product; please keep that in mind. I will update my review once I receive a copy that is able to play on either of my two 3D blu-ray players.<br /><br />-------<br /><br />I picked up a copy of Dredd [3D Blu-Ray w/Ultraviolet] on January 12, 2013 from Best Buy. That night we tried to watch the movie only to discover that the disc will not read on our 3D Blu-Ray Panasonic BDT110 or PS3. Both players had up-to-date firmware and have had no problems reading recent 3D Blu-Rays, including Frankenweenie and Avengers. In an effort to do a complete troubleshooting I unboxed our old Samsung P2550 Blu-Ray player (one of the first produced) and although it took 5 minutes to load the 2D version of the movie would play. Since I did not buy this movie just for the 2D feature I will be returning the product to the store today, and while I was considering an exchange to make sure it wasn't a bad on-off disc I've changed my mind since reading several comments on Blu-Ray and Hi-Def forums reporting similar problems (also including missing menus and sound dropout after 30 minutes). Beware, if you have a PS3 or Panasonic player this movie will not load.
030759565X|5.0|Beautifully photographed.  I went back and forth about buying it because, let's face it, you can go to the website for free.  I bought this as a gift, and bought another copy for myself because a quick browse made me realize that it was worth having on the shelf!
B0089K7DGW|5.0|I bought this show in hopes that it would be as good as many other HBO series. Turns out that it's one of my favorites! This is a great take on the gangster genre and it even incorporates some true facts into the show which is great! LOVE THIS SHOW AND I CANT WAIT TO WATCH SEASON 2! (which I also bought and just have to finish up the last episode of season one before I can get to it)
B007Z5LBE2|5.0|After seeing Eddie Redmayne in les Miserable (which he was superb) i wanted to see him more in films.OMG he is an excellent actor !<br />I cant wait to see him more in movies. I am sure he is going to have a great career! I absolutely loved the movie. It is a great love story!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|This book was cute. It was not the best diary of a wimpy kid. But I did like it. For your next book add more middle school into it not so much elementary.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. it so many ideas and project that you can do by yourself or with your kids.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, I like the origianal movie better (with Liam Neison). NO singing in that movie.<br />  I do like the original song score or however you put it, they leave out some of the songs in the movie musical.
0765325950|2.0|I enjoyed ALL the books of A Wheel of Time Robert Jordan wrote, even the ones which were just story telling rather than following the plot.<br /><br />I enjoy reading Brandon Sanderson novels and I am looking to the second book of the Way of Kings. Tarmon Gaidon was not what I expected, the battle was very prolonged perhaps more than it should have been.<br /><br />There was a huge amount of pages relating to the battle between the armies of good and evil, but what of the Dragon's fight? I felt it lacked substance and gained little understanding of how the Dark One was defeated. To me Tarmon Gaidon was not the destruction of armies but the fight between good and evil. I don't feel this was portrayed in the best way it could have been. The character, Rand, I feel in this book was literally left in the dark, an excessive battle scene with no real battle where it should have been, the battle against Shai'tan.<br /><br />When I finished this book I was dissapointed. I felt as though something is missing. As though there should be another book, just to explain what happened so I can understand HOW Rand defeated the Dark One. How was it done? It took less time than it should have done. Little devotion was given to the hero in the last book, he had very few pages devoted to him, and I hate to say it, but it shows come the ending.<br /><br />Rand was the hero. Not Nynaeve, Egwene, Lan, Perrin or Mat, more pages were given to them, and it shows, it shows that in the last book Rand had become an insignificant hero, an afterthought of the entire series.<br /><br />There is one last thing I will say. Welcome to the fourth age, where heroes don't matter.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|Great way to get books you wouldnt normally read. Just like a library except better because you get to keep the book
B00946WMXY|2.0|The reason I'm rating this 2 stars is because it doesn't really work well for the iPad. I bought the hd version thinking I would get a crisp beautiful display but it's just a widescreen standard visual. It does give you a list of of tablets that support hd but but it's not very clear.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|The story line was very good. I wouldn't recommend this book for Children over the age of 13. But it was a great book none the less.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I got this book last night, and I was hardly able to stop reading for sleep. The twisting plot  and well-developed characters made for an amazing read that has landed itself into my list of all-time favorites.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I do not review books often, but made an exception for The Panther.  I have always enjoyed Nelson DeMille's novels and have looked forward to each new release.  I thought The Gate House was a weak follow-up to The Gold Coast, but did not dislike it.  I thoroughly enjoyed the John Corey series up until The Panther.  The character was fun and, while humor and sarcasm were ever-present, they were not offensive.  With The Panther, DeMille turned a flawed but likeable character into a gratingly unpleasant and bitter person.  A \\"real\\" Kate would never stay with this Corey.  The writing was ham-handed and very hard to read.  I slogged through to the end, but do not recommend it.  I question whether someone else ghosted this one.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|It was a good action movie but it kind of lacked the interesting plot the the first one and the second had it could have been much better I love Kate Beckensile I think she is one better female leading Actors in an action/sci-fi/drama movie

1932100660|5.0|So many people are confused about diet and health. Many proclaimed diet authors, In an attempt to capture a broader audience,  twist what should be a simple message and market their nutritional programs in favour of peoples tastes, preferences and addictions (never underestimate the power of telling people what they want to hear). This has resulted in many people becoming preoccupied by calories alone. However, being thin and being healthy are not the same thing. For those of you who are fed up with the 'quick fix' paradigm and who are seeking authentic nutrition and health longevity, you must read Campbell's China Study (several times!). The results of Campbell's life's work may be hard, for some people, to initially swallow, especially if you follow conventional wisdom and/or if The China Study is your first exposure to nutrition science (not popular diet books).<br /><br />Conducted in some of most pristine environments on earth, before modern farming methods/chemical pollutants and before the introduction of refined flour/sugars, The China Study exposes the causative links between what we eat, our health outcomes, the length and quality of our lives. Dr. Campbell's extensive research shows how certain foods can be as powerful as medicine, while others, as toxic as a drugs. And, by making some simple changes in our food choices, we can not only prevent, stop the progression of, but in most cases reverse some of our most crippling diseases.<br /><br />Remain open, dispute your current thinking and set yourself free from dieting and personal agendas. The China Study will not only lay the foundation for your health, but the sustainability and health of our planet - a win, win. A word of encouragement for those who believe they are addicted to the fatty/sugary Western diet: Your tastes are completely determined by your eating habits and are subject to change at anytime!<br /><br />Stick with the science and the message is crystal clear! Get caught up in personal opinions and preferences and you will surely get confused and fuel the current health model. Enjoy!!

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this show and can´t stop watching! Watched all first 5 seasons in a row, almost without stopping (had to sleep of course).<br /><br />Extremely well-written, funny as a warm place, great actors and a fantastic mix of characters.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made middle school bearable, and if it did that for me, I can't imagine it wasn't that way for others. My tattered \\"real\\" copy is falling apart from many reads, and I would recommend the book to the struggling adolescent as well as anyone looking to read a lovely modern classic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put it down!! Captivating from the first chapter. What an amazing story, creative, exciting. Loved every part of it!
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Obviously this fimwas not on an epic type of movie. But for what it was, it was a fun combination of action, humour and awesome special effects. I was particularly fond of the Hulk and his &#34;smashing&#34; when he was on screen, which was a lot less than I would've hoped.  I didn't see this at the movies, I rented it here on Amazon and am glad that I did because it was a fun, light Saturday-type of film.  Ironman was sarcastic and funny, but great machine and stunts, as would be expected. Thor was pretty cool and otherworldly. I was disappointed by Scarlett Johansson's performance as the black widow as I was unimpressed by the skills of the black widow. Hawkeye was okay.  Three stars within the genre of action, science-fiction type films.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Both actors were fantastic in the portraits they painted of husband and wife characters trying to rediscover what marriage is all about. While I expected Meryl to be excellent, I did not expect Tommy Lee to reach such heights of this character development. Both actors were superb

B000FA5SMK|3.0|I enjoyed about 2/3rds of this book.  Then the author got a bit crazy.  As soon as the forecast of 'hurricane' was mentioned I knew what was coming and so it did.  Too bad. I could have done with fewer references to the main character's penis under its many pseudonyms, but it was marketed as a 'man's book'.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This was recommended to me by love my kindle fire blog.  A MUST HAVE FOR ALL KINDLE FIRES!  it allows me to do so much more.  Camera, games on fb, and some other things.

B003XT8Y3K|5.0|Caught Kaufmann on the recent Faust MET broadcast and was hooked.  This is a voice that sounds like it could easily encompass many of the higher baritone roles, more reminiscent of the Russian baritone Hvorostovsky than many tenors who sing this repertoire.  An exciting vibrato, not quite as fast as Corelli, a voice made for Otello,  A lot of standards on the CD, not a bad thing, the second Cavalleria aria is particularly moving.  If you love the big voiced dark sounding tenors he hits on all cylinders.
B00846REIS|4.0|I did like this or I would not have read the sequel as well (Reflected in You), but I didn't love it.  The story line seemed a little repetitive and lacked the magnetic draw that some romance novels have.  The one thing that I can say about this one is that it really helps us fall for  the characters, which is a must in order to appreciate the sequel.  Again, it's not that I didn't like this one because I absolutely did!  I just didn't LOVE it!  Keep in mind though, that you need to enjoy this one first for what it is before you can really appreciate the sequel, which is AWESOME!!!
B009K6DKTS|5.0|I like books that make me think. By that standard, this is the best book I have read recently.<br />It is very entertaining and contains several quite big ideas.<br />The strongly anti-reviews seem to me to take Taleb a bit too seriously.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|I don't want to waste any more time on this piece of garbage so just a short review. The acting is marginal and the story is pathetic. Just do NOT watch this complete pile of dung.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|This is a fun read, a humorous take on the apocalypse.  It isn't as entertaining as the best of Terry Pratchett but readers of his work shouldn't skip this work, written with Neil Gaiman early in both their careers.  It definitely feels more Pratchett-like than Gaimanesque so his readers will feel very at home.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really loved this!  Sylvia Day has a real knack for writing what romance addicts want to read.  I actually loved this one even more than the first (Bared to You).  It had all the steamy scenes that we love as well as the emotional connections that keep us hooked.  A definite must read.
B005LAII80|5.0|Captures the look, feel and ugliness of Mega city. Worth every credit paid for the great blu ray. Smart and tight. Great casting.

UNABLE to fix this with updates, changing wireless channels, connecting via USB, turning off other wireless devices / microwaves / cordless phones etc.<br />- joint holding ear cups to the head band will start breaking within the first month! If you find pieces of random cheap brittle plastic on your desk, it's from the headset!!! Check the plastic joint covers it will be cracked (they have 4 screws on them iirc)!!! RETURN IT ASAP, I discovered where the plastic was coming from farrr too late unfortunately. Once the plastic falls off, it is essentially useless.<br /><br />Check the Logitech forums for G930 and believe the faults ppl mention because they are true!
B0076DELIG|4.0|As always it's a god read and keeps you turning pages until the very end.i'll be back again when the next one is released.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Almost every time you open any window with flash in it the program will crash. I was able to sideload Adobe Flash to the Kindle Fire H D but the Kindle will not let me open it.<br />If anyone knows how to get Adobe Flash player on the Kindle Fire HD please let me know.
0385344228|3.0|Hard not to see where the book is headed after the introduction of a couple of unlikely characters who make little sense. And, what's with that ending. Completely goes against the grain of everything learned in what little character development there is. My advise, skip those views that compare this to Presumed Innocent and We Need to Talk About Kevin ( a masterpiece). Ths book is an excellent beach read, nothing more.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|My first CD, twenty-five or so years ago, when CD's were the latest thing, Chronicle: 20 Greatest Hits, by Creedance Clearwater Revival, was twenty, twenty-five year old music then. These songs are still played on the radio everyday. I heard CCR's songs on the radio then, and had grown up hearing them, but when I got the CD, and got to actually sit down and really listen... WOW!<br /> Just four guys making all that sound?! Sit down, relax, and listen to &#34;Have You Ever Seen The Rain?&#34;. Get into the beat, notice how and learn to anticipate how Doug Clifford changes it up from one verse to the next. Enjoy the passion John Fogerty exhibits as he belts out the poetic lyrics... and it's all tied together with a bass rhythm and long, really long and subtly changing chords on the organ... Still, my favorite song of all time, with 50 yrs of listening, and I listen a lot! CCR doesn't get the credit they deserve, but are quietly honored by being on the radio still, close to 50 years after they recorded this music.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Taylor Swift's music.  Very upbeat and personal.  Would highly recommend this album. Worth every penny.  Thank you Taylor!
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is the funniest show on tv.  So I needed to get the seasons so I can watch any time I want to.
B0098VYKSA|2.0|Another boring Kristen Stewart Movie.  The Queen was more interesting--and a lot better looking than Kristen Stewart.  KS playing another poor helpless sap.  Movie needed more special effects and interesting characters.  If they couldn't do that than it at least should have had more violence.<br /><br />Skip it--nothing to see here.
B005LAIISA|4.0|Children enjoyed the DVD.  They were happy and it kept them busy for a while.  The story was fun as well.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Very good product as advertised.  Thank you.  In good shape.  Very good product as advertised.  Thank you.  In good shape.
0316017930|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT, FAST DELIVERY.  AAA+++
B000FCK65W|5.0|FRANCIE IS REAL<br /><br />I first read this book when I was ten.  I didn't understand a lot of it but I liked it even then.  Reading the book again, I'm now 75, was so comforting.  I now understood everything. A &#34;Tree&#34; is historical,and socially revealing.  It reads like real life.  It didn't seem like a novel, but a young girl's diary--Not unlike Anne Frank.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|It looked pretty funny for the first 20-30 minutes but got lame fast. It should have been more about the bear and less about relationships.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat. A very surprising ending. Hope there another series is released  very soon.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book captured me from the beginning.  It was the perfect blend of mystery, adventure and love.  You spend the entire novel feeling the emotion of the characters.  Nicholas Sparks delivered another great one.
B008OIQYTG|5.0|Perfect musicianship. Perfect melodies (especially \\"Rose Pedals\\" w/ Dave Grusin). I am really glad guys are coming back to their roots with Fender Rhodes keyboard! It is great how Lee's relaxed experience influences everyone he works with; live and in the studio! Lee has done it again! Bravo Lee! :)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Speechless!! One of THE best shows that is on the air right now. I was hooked from the first episode!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|love animals amazing game. u have to play this game its the best. they need to make more like this game
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Very enjoyable series based on real history but with enough added drama to keep you more than entertained. Highly recommended!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game draws you right into its peaceful little world and wont let you go.  the haunting soundtrack just hooks into your brain too.  wow.  immersive.  fun to replay the same levels to try to better your scores.  highly recommended!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|After seeing season one, I was hoping that they would keep the level of intensity with season two. They went above and beyond season one!!!!! This is definitely one of my absolute favorite shows now!!
B004GTLFNW|5.0|Wonderful information. Love his no nonsense/common sense approach to strength training and nutrition. This should inspire anyone to be strong and healthy as a way of life. Thank you!
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|After finally Downton Abbey Season I, I had become totally engrossed in the series.  Like a good book I couldin't stop watching it until I had finished the last Season 2 episonde.
B008KZVNLC|3.0|This is an adaptation of a series of British novels telling a story of life in the period of world war one. It has an excellent cast. Its very good visually in terms of photography and sets. But the script has problems.<br /><br />They set themselves an impossible task in trying to adapt a complex series of books into a very few hours of television. There is just too much in terms of story and characters to cover in so little time. At best, it can be said to give an impressionistic view into the book or maybe just into the era. There are some interesting scenes, but the whole itself just didn't work. The early episodes are also rather odd because every negative or regretful comment about the war falls flat because we are rarely seeing anything to do with the war on the screen. The war is really absent through most of the series.<br /><br />The script spends far too long getting to the high point which is in my opinion the story in the book \\"No More Parades\\". It then neglects to spend enough time or enough care on that part of the story. They do a massive, scattershot build-up over several episode full of detail that could easily be got rid of and then neglect that on which time and care should have been spent.<br /><br />The other thing that didn't work for me is that the first few episodes were pure soap opera. Sometimes I wondered if Benedict Cumberbatch was just a supporting character in his own story. The story was somewhat turned inside out with the women characters being made the center of the drama rather than \\"Tietjens\\" up until really the last episode. It does turn around completely in that last episode. Cumberbatch puts in a very fine performance and established for me an attachment to the story/characters that I didn't have until then. The reunion scene at the house after the war was particuarly moving as were many of the war scenes with the commanding officer at the front and certain other things I will not spoil.<br /><br />Steven Robertson as Colonel Bill Williams was exceptional in a small but very important part.<br /><br />It was a long time getting there, but the last two episodes were more than worth it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It's a good read wish it didn't end this way. Was a little t o much death for my taste.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|From the Pilot, I was hooked on this show.  I watched the first season over a weekend.  I'm looking forward to seeing Season 2.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|It was the next best thing to being at a concert.  My \\"Directioner\\" loved it!  It was as if she had front-row seats and backstage passes.

B004A8ZWVU|5.0|Everyone should watch this movie....I read the book before I watched it. There were parts I wanted to cry but it also touching funny. Not sure if I'll ever eat chocolate pie again.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|Best show on television by far! tons of great extras included in this set! cant wait for the next season to start.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down.  The book is far superior to the movie! I can't wait to continue with the series!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I ordered the Kindle edition of this book and am certainly glad I did! I was swept away in the story. Well written - Deborah Harkness paints wonderful pictures with her words. I would recommend this to any of my friends looking for a good escape novel.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works for me. It loads quickly and gives me an accurate report. Great for people who want to be outside and need a forecast.
074322454X|5.0|One of the best books about real WW2. You get in to those soldiers, you become one of them. If you like HBO TV show Band of Brothers you will like book more.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|It is dark, thrilling, full of plot twists.  Everything you love about Jo Nesbo and Harry Hole to the max.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite of the solitaire games. Only bad thing is trying to get rid of ads....but gets easier to figure out,<br /> once you get hang of it...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Mr. Owen provides us with a personal look and feel of what it is to attain status in the brotherhood of US NAVY SEALS - and in particular, to be one of the elite - an long-time Operator within the vaunted and mysterious SEAL Team 6.  He explains the infrastructure of The Teams, and of DEVGRU especially.  He guides us through both the efforts he put forth to become an elitest Operator, and what it took to finally locate and deal with OSB.  He artfully relates to you the level of preparation which was necessary to accomplish this deed, and why that preparation is a hallmark of the SEALs, as well as why it was absolutely crucial on this particular op.  And YES!  For those of us who read about SEALS from the perspective of respect, honor and assimilating knowledge of the weapons and tools they have chosen to operate anywhere in the World, in  any environment - I promise you, much will be revealed which has heretofore been different as relates to prior writings.  Thank you Mark, and all of you in The Teams and in the background, for relieving the snake of its head!!!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|My case is great.  I use it all the time with my new Kindle Fire.  It's also a nice color and easy to carry with me or pack inside my purse or bag.  I would recommend it to others.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very surprised how much I loved this trilogy. People who told me about this book only talked about the sex part and what a control freak the main character is. They forgot to mention that it is a love story.
B000SW2F6M|3.0|Generally I liked the movie. Good effects, ok story and descent acting.  I was ready for the movie to end about 30 earlier than it did. Also, it felt more like a kids movie. Not a sophisticated war movie.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Really liked the movie.  The transmission was awful.  Had to keep turning the TV off to reboot.  The screen froze and flipped.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I bought this for my husband and downloaded it on my Kindle and he is watching it just about everyday.  He really is enjoying the series and is planning on buying the books.
0743289692|4.0|Even though my life did not take a high profile turn like that of Ayaan, we seem to have had very similar awakenings in our respective lives.<br />I so thoroughly enjoyed this book that it was hard for me put it down on several occasions.<br />The author echoes my own repulsive feelings towards ritual bound societies.  She very succinctly portrays the hypocrisy embedded within such societies.<br />I got confirmation from this book that the activities, which I used To think were highly moral actually wreaked of narrow minded ness.<br />I really feel very enlightened after reading this book.  I personally thank the author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a fun and enjoyable game.  one in which when you start you cant stop. a fun and enjoyable game.
1577314808|5.0|Truly a life changing book.  Helped me achieve a shift in consciousness that I had never experienced before.  HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I use it often just to get a quick glimpse of weather.  It's a nice tool to have easy access too.  I would recommend it to others.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Since upgrading to a Samsung Galaxy Note, I find I only need to carry one device.  Simply Great product, use daily

B009SQOGZ2|5.0|A wonderful tale about why being a little weird is okay. Not for children who scare easily. A few horror movie references only the bigger better kids (adults) will get. Some language as well. Overall one of the best animated movies of 2012.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love the ability of the application to both be able to read it and have the narrator read it to me.  The &#34;reading plans&#34; are also quite helpful.  I recommended this to several coworkers and now they are using it.  Good App.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent app...easy to use/easy to see keypad. I keep it on my Kindle carousel and use it instead of the calculator on my phone.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Every song on this CD is great. I saw Phillip on American Idol and really liked his style. My daughter, my husband and I all love every single song.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie! It was a great comic book/action flick. The video and sound quality on Amazon was great!
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|I don't watch a lot of movies because I work full time and am a full time student but I did get a chance to watch this over the holidays with my new Kindle Fire.  This was a great movie.  A real love story.  I highly recommend it to others.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a delight to watch this movie! I was hooked from the start. I had never heard of it, but based off reviews around the internet, I bought the movie, blindly, hoping I will enjoy it. Wow! It exceeded my expectations plus more.<br />Lots of contemplative dialogue that will motivate you to hold on for one more second when you just want to 'go home'. As the movie progresses, you forget about their age, because of their willingness to not let that inhibit their lust for life.<br /><br />An overall feel-good film, with superb wit and humor. This film is wonderfully paced, and I found myself laughing quite often. There were many great one liners, for example:<br /><br />\\"Don't you worry about the dangers of having sex at your age?\\"<br />\\"If she dies...she dies.\\"<br /><br />A must see, in my opinion!
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Reasonably faithful re-cretation of the written source materials.<br />Lots of action and a genteel romance. I watched it several times.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child's creation of the character Harry Reacher has made me feel I know Harry, and am always rooting for him.  Anyone who wants a good story told and who roots for the good guy who just outthinks the bad guys should read this latest Harry Reacher installment.
B000FC1JMQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to any female! It is the most wonderful and heartfelt book! It is by no means less than pride and prejudice or sense and sensibility in its substance and the good morals which are always relayed in books of this time period.
B00884GR0W|5.0|Several years ago a friend of mine showed me Minecraft. I was intrigued by the limitless opportunities in the game. At the time I could not justify paying so much for a game and I forgot about it. Then I see that this app is free and (expecting a free game:-) I downloaded for fun. Wow! It is better than the single player on mine craft! The only thing that could make this better would be a multiplayer option. Get this game!!!
B002UM5BXW|3.0|After watching Bourdain on television for so long, I thought it time to read him.  I know nothing of the world he lives in, but was entertained by the stories.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Typical Harry Bosch story.  It makes you want more, and sad when you've come to the end.  Any mystery / thriller fan will love all the Harry Bosch stories and this one is no exception.
B009IF82SK|5.0|I love this show. Have all 6 seasons and worth every penny. Would not recommend for kids. Subject matter deals a lot with sexual situations.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Just as good as Fall of Giants. I feel that the story was well researched. I gained insights to the day to day life of people at that time in history.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read the first Wool story for free, and bought the Omnibus collection of stories 1-5 based on the strength of that story. These five stories introduce us to a compelling new science fictional world, the world of the silo. To say more than that would spoil the fantastic way in which Howey develops the overarching story. Each story, and each chapter, gives us answers and presents new questions. Howey does a great job of expanding the world from one man's struggle to understand his wife's death to an understanding of the fate of an entire planet. I can't recommend this book enough, and I will read the next books in this series very soon.
B009TQ77KM|5.0|it was on my daughter's christmas gift list. she is a big Dr. Who fan especially the tenth doctor. this is more of a collectible item for her.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I liked the storyline and the relationship between Sky and Holder, but I couldn't get into how she could remember she was raped as a child and then go straight on to have passionate sex with Holder? A little unrealistic for the circumstances. I couldn't appreciate the suicide scene, just took away from the sexiness that I thought this book would have.
B005LAIGQ4|5.0|This movie was made from a true story and it is a really &#34;feel good&#34; movie. I will watch it more than once and keep it in my movie collection.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|i wanted to added to my Christopher Nolan set of movies and this was an inexpensive set to have. good special features
B007SYWFRM|5.0|you go to menu option and it should show the arrow at the bottom of the screen...try it for yourself.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was very funny and I loved it I wander what the next book is going to be I hope you like this book as much as I did
B00129H7VS|5.0|I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he was thrilled.  He is a die hard war movie monger and he told me that this was one of the best gifts I could have given him.  If you are interested in WWII then this is defintely the set to buy.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Our family thought this was a very funny movie.  I have to admitt that it is probably not for everyone.  If you like the actors listed and also like silly action films, then you should be satisfied with this video.
B005MSD6QU|5.0|I am addicted that is all I can say. My daughter and I do not have a television in the house because there is so much junk on television. When I discovered that I could buy this while I was recovering from recent surgery well, I have not put my computer down since.
0765325950|5.0|I feel, in many ways, that this was the best written book in the series in probably 7 books.  I agree that there were some plot lines that were resolved a little roughly, but, as a whole, the story ended pretty well.  I do wish that the series had not taken 23 years to complete (I started reading the series in 1990 at the age of 26).  However, I find myself missing the idea of a next book!  I did not expect that reaction when the series FINALLY ended.<br /><br />Well done, Brandon Sanderson.  You took on a very difficult task and completed it in a good way.  Thanks!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|For many, many years we start our Christmas holiday by watching this right after Thanksgiving dinner. Funny, funny, funny, funny!!!!!!!
0060936223|5.0|Amazing book! Patti Smith writes in a very accessible language and describes hers and Robert's adventures in an incredibly gifted way. Definitely a book worth reading if you want to get into the dynamic of the 70's rock' n roll scene of New York City.
B005PZ857K|5.0|I am a speech pathologist and I must travel between schools. This is perfect. The wheels are wide enough to go over the snowy and pot hole ridden parking lots. There are so many places for books, files and larger card boxes. It is heavy because I overload it but not too heavy to lift into the back of my Jeep
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I LOVE time travel novels, and Stephen King has lost none of his powers as a storyteller.  I couldn't put it down.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The color was true to the description which I loved.  It fits perfectly and protects my Kindle Fire HD with no worries for me.  Thanks Marware, for delivering on your promise!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|booyah what a sweet game. I wish you got more coins at regular intervals instead of how it is. Ill keep playing.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|I enjoyed the concept of this book, but did find it a bit young for me (I'm 26) and yes I know is it targeted at a younger age group than my own.
030758836X|4.0|Wonderful book - real page turner.  Last chapter or so a little slow but definately worth the read.  Looking forward to reading others.
1594203334|5.0|Throw out all of your parenting books, Moms and Dads!  This book will change your life!!  You will gain confidence, you will laugh out loud, you won't be able to put it down!  Instead of sifting through hundreds of parenting tips, you will learn the few that actually count and discount the rest.  It's a parenting book disguised as a memoir and it's the best I've ever read.<br /><br />I understand the controversy surrounding the author.  I realize this may make some parents lose their trust in her parenting abilities and her judgement.  However, even though I am a conservative Christian, I would highly recommend not throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  This gal knows her stuff when it comes to both French and American parenting and although I don't condone some of her personal choices, she is a good author!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is by far one of the best hidden object games I've played. wish they could all be this entertaining.
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I enjoyed the first book, but the second and third lost the connect I felt to the characters a bit more. The story just didn't feel developed enough.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Seller was nice enough to explain the conditions thoroughly in the ad. WTG great seller!<br />Nice stuff, and the little girls loved it, unfortunately it was a HUGE DISTRACTION, when they were prompted to do their homework, and otherwise, participating parents while watching video.<br /><br />Other than getting scolded & my friend catching the &#34;Raw end of the deal&#34;, I felt guilty for getting them something so distracting from their usual or normal routine of doing school work.<br /><br />Otherwise, I thoroughly enjoyed it! :) Timothy...

B003F3FJQO|3.0|The story felt a bit scatted in this second book of the series. I started to feel less connected with the characters.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I love it!!!!!<br />It is the funniest book ever!!<br />I think this book is good for ages 7-12, grades 2-6
B000001ESF|5.0|Finally,Rush is back in my album collection! Boy have I missed listening to 2112!!It brings back so many memories!!! It arrived in great shape and recieved very quickly!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great characters and a great story, keeps you on your toes. Worth the read. I would highly recommend reading this book.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is very addicting. You play for hours and don't even realize it. You think just one more time and I can beat those pigs.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|So... I accidentally deleted the app, but then re-downloaded it. Absolutely ALL of my progress was lost. And I was logged in the entire time, so shouldn't my gameloft live account saved all of my progress? I am very upset.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|love this game! I couldn't stop playing. This is a great puzzle game.  It kept my brain busy trying to solve all the levels.  After finishing all the levels other challenges are unlocked.  Can't wait for New levels.  Get this game!
B002VLNB1Q|4.0|...but it's still a good album with a good sense of theme and consistency throughout.  Well thought out and well written it's certainly a worthwhile edition (especially when discounted) with several standout tracks, even if John doesn't catch lightning in a bottle a second time.
B006SMLAMQ|5.0|I love this weather APP. I loaded several different areas and I check the weather everyday now :) My favorite part is how the background video will match the weather of the day!
B00004TB5B|5.0|A classic album that I grew up with.  I had to add this to my vinyl collection, right next to (the much more elusive) Slim Shady LP.
B000009HF2|5.0|This CD was so much a part of my younger years! It brings back so many good memories from yester year.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|All I can say about this book is that it perfectly concludes a near-perfect series. This is the first work of Sanderson's that I've read and I'm going to read everything else of his that I can get my hands on. He is a genius! I tend toward urban fantasy and even a little ya paranormal romance, but this series blew that out of the water. I cannot wait to see what else Mr. Sanderson has in his repertoire. If all of his books are as good as this series, he is now my new favorite writer (sorry Ms. Austen).
B008I43DYU|5.0|I love the way it can become a scientific calculator as well. The functions are very easy to understand and the buttons keys are big enough so you don't have to worry about pressing more than one at a time accidentally.
0316066524|5.0|A contemporary classic.  If you've heard of Infinite Jest, why waste your time reading this review?  BUY THE BOOK ALREADY!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think that this is a cool game but you should add coin when they run out so that the players do not have to wait for the timer
0439023491|5.0|This is a good book, though I thought it spent too much time showing the main character wallowing in her sorrows at the start, rather than trying to sort out the best way to handle life--didn't seem very characteristic of someone who had won the hunger games, but I guess Catness is good at acting when she's forced to, but doesn't act until that point.  Still, I enjoyed reading it & was eager to read book 3 to figure out which guy she finally picked.  I have read book 3 by now, and I'll warn you, you might prefer to make up your own ending.  It drags a bit and the setting gets too descriptive and complex I think.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Very fun game, I love the way the different bubbles have different types of gravitational pull, it adds quite a challenge to your classic Angry Birds
B005DOL0R0|3.0|It is nice. Fits the kindle fire nicely. It is well padded for protection against damage. But its only a sleeve not a case
B0097EWK3A|5.0|First game I completed after purchasing my kindle fire hd. It was awesome not only do I love the game it also made me love my HD. I have been hooked on games ever since and spent a small fortune on them. Great job on the game can't wait for another.
B00877R85I|5.0|This book caught you quickly in the start & was hard to put down until the climactic ending, which leads you straight into wanting to grab the second book.  It's so much better than the movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was great. It hit a lot of good points and real life situations that teens face daily. I would recommend this book to a teenager who is going through a tuff time in their life.
B005LAIHPY|1.0|I'm amazed at the stupidity of this movie. To explain why, I'm going to describe the first few minutes of the film. At the very beginning they explain how we built an entire radio array in 2006 (which will later turn out to be a radar station, because they're clearly the same thing) to contact the sole extrasolar planet within habitable range of its sun (how many radio arrays do we already have operating?). This is followed by a radio transmission in the form of a burst of energy like a phaser beam being sent out of this array via a satellite. I already knew I would hate this film.<br /><br />Then to impress a girl at a bar the main character breaks into a convenience store in what's supposed to be an amusing scene set to the Pink Panther theme. Against all probability he succeeds in winning the girl with this stupid immaturity. So then his brother signs him up for the navy. Which is funny, 'cause I didn't know brothers could do that. Maybe I'll enlist mine just for kicks. The rest of the film is supposed to be him getting over this immaturity, but after such a stupid display the character has used up every smidgeon of the sympathy we naturally feel for main characters. At one point he's actually trying to get his crew killed in a suicidal attack because his brother died and he wants revenge.<br /><br />Taylor Kitsch demonstrates the acting talent that make [[ASIN:B007Y36K46 John Carter]] such an unbridled commercial success. He's believable neither as the mature sailor nor the immature man-child. About the only thing he can sell right is cocky incompetent. And he still gets the girl. Whoop. The moral here (as in far too many other movies of late) is that spoiled, idiot, immature boys with no self-control offer a vital dose of much needed passion into the impersonal and formal environments of modern society, and worse, that they can actually perform when it comes to crunch-time. Why Hollywood thinks we need this lesson is beyond me.<br /><br />I will admit that over time I found Kitsch's obvious effort and passion charming, but it's the kind of feeling you get for a drugged puppy repeatedly walking into a wall. And it just isn't enough. Liam Neeson is in this film too. He has an atrocious gung ho American accent. There's not that much more to say about him since he spends the entire film on the wrong side of an alien force field. Genghis Khan gives probably the best performance in the film. Rihanna isn't actually that bad as a naval officer with no role. She certainly didn't deserve that Razzie. Everyone else is pretty unmemorable. The girlfriend and her entire plot features the worst acting in the film, except possibly for Peter Nicols who overplays an incompetent Secretary of Defense.<br /><br />The aliens are impossibly inconsistent. When the plot decides they want them dead they're incredibly weak, yet the rest of the time the Navy's full firepower can't touch 'em. Also, they don't shoot at anyone who doesn't attack them, unless they do. And there was a big revelation I kept waiting for that would have explained the alien motivations along with why they didn't kill certain key people. But nope. Just a stereotypical psychic flash of explosions and conquests from when Kitsch looked into an alien's eyes.<br /><br />Cinematically this film is all over the place. It makes a massive overuse of the 'rapidly slow down/speed up zoom in/zoom out' camera movements. The efforts that they go to to match up with the game are amusing. They have the grid laid out and everything (although apparently its weather buoys) and when the ships get hit by the aliens the missile things look like the pins you stick in the ships.<br /><br />Good things: The movie has two good lines at the end, one about dying and the other about the Art of War. And the final battleship fight is pretty cool, albeit totally irrational. I think that if the whole movie had been like the last twenty minutes I'd have forgiven it a lot, but by the time you get there it's already too late.ready too late.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I like it. but it wont  let me buy Doofensmirtz Inc. Evil. other then that it is great. really fun game
0439023513|2.0|The action wasn't as good in this one, it was harder to picture what was going on in parts, and it was depressing until the closing comments--knowing what I know now, I would have just read the epilogue.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great book! Not a fan of the politics King injects into the book, but he always has a way of creating a realistic fantasy realm within the everyday world, and this book is no different.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Functional, never forgets to scream at me. Just what I need. The options for the alarm sounds are great. The bird chirping Pillsbury cheap just doesn't cut it for me.<br />--Amandafaith
B00785P2QC|5.0|I know how alot of people are saying, this app is bad, well its really not! invesment points are pretty easy to get by doing quests and stuff and you earn PLENTY of credits every single day! theres not much adds, either. overall, this is a great game and i highly reccomend it. also invesment points dont do much any execpt demolish hills, get extra space, and build a few things. anyway this is a great app and anyone should get it!
B0036S4C6G|2.0|I have to say that I like Jennifer Egan's writing and characterizations.  I like the punk scene settings of my childhood.  I found many of her characters sympathetic.<br /><br />I did not find a plot, however, and gave up at the PowerPoint chapter.  I understand I am not the first person to have said this.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Sucks nor in very hard to read don't like. The second one either please rate less please don't read this
B0076DELIG|5.0|This was another good story from Connelly.  Better, in fact, than some of his other recent works.  Timely story plus a nice emphasis on his daughter growing up as well.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I really like this game, and the free play is great. I first got the game to kill time, and it got better and better.  I have spent many a night up longer than I should have been playing this game.<br />That being said, I have reached a level in the game where I need to buy things using REAL CASH.  I have spent $35.00 on gems for my park and still have yet to receive them.  I am posting this review days, not minutes or hours after I paid for the gems. The payments have been processed by Amazon and my bank and I still have not received any of the gems I paid for.
0374214913|5.0|A happy little read full of the sneaky nerd joy of discovering hidden knowledge, arcane lore, and doing it with modern tools, techniques and technology.  In few words, geek heaven.  the narrator/protagonist, Clay Jannon, has taken a job as a night clerk at the aforementioned bookstore, only to notice the patrons at the late hours rarely buy books, but rather take them on loan from the Waybacklist.  Clay is encouraged to carefully describe each patron as he logs the borrowing and returning.  curious, Clay looks into the books as borrowed and finds them all encrypted.<br /><br />If you are anything like a serious geek this will send a naughty thrill down your spine.  Clay begins to pull at this bit of twine...and thus begins the story, full of modern tools and ancient tales, Silicon Valley whiz kids and dowdy librarians and a secret cult at the heart of it all.<br /><br />I loved it.  I especially liked how Clay's romance of a sort with the Google girl (name already forgotten, since I think of her that way) reflects life's vicissitudes.  Also liked the realistic way the technophiles go at their enthusiasms with hammer and tongs--very lifelike.<br /><br />Because this is a relatively new title, the Kindle version is only four bucks cheaper (but no waiting!) at US$11.99.  There is an audiobook, but this reads really well when you have the flu.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|best app I ever got on my kindle fire Its awsome and free good thing to I have a lot of stuff on this game
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen's book is hilarious! I highly recommend this book… I have not read the others but I surely will. Love it!
0316069434|2.0|Aside from some pointless, distracting, and rather sappy conversational exchanges between characters, the plot chugs along fairly well for about three-fourths of the book.  Then the wheels come completely off.  Bosch behaves in ways that make no sense, and - partly for this reason - the plot turns in ways that are absolutely preposterous.  I hope that Connelly hasn't' gone the way of so many other authors in this genre who formerly wrote good novels but whose works now insult their readers' intelligence.
0385535147|3.0|Not one of his better books, but I have read all of his books, so I will read the next one.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this hand its amazing and addicting I can't stay away from my kindle. I suggest that whoever is thinking about getting this app should get it.
B00ARAN9JW|5.0|I LOVE ALL RESIDENT EVIL MOVIES AND GAMES...WOULD RECOMMAND TO EVERYONE I KNOW...I AM GLAD IT'S CONTINUING HATE TO SEE IT END
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not awesome. It is what it is.  A free game app.<br /><br />... Says my husband, who is the one who &#34;bought' and played it,
030746363X|4.0|Solid.  Lots of good information.  Definitely not overhyped.  I couldn't sleep the other night and turned to the &#34;Engineer the percect night's sleep section&#34; and I was asleep soon after.
B001JIHGO0|1.0|This is one of those movies where you sit stunned, waiting for the moment when it becomes clear that the whole thing was intended as a joke.  That moment never came, but I still think it's possible they intended much of the movie to be wry or camp -- they just missed.  How else can one explain a Mr Hyde who looks and acts like a pinkish version of Shrek, or a Dracula who's trying his best to be a family man?  Surely (surely!) plots don't get to be this stupid by accident.<br /><br />Jackman and Beckinsale get to play their roles mostly straight, and they do an OK job.<br /><br />Don't buy this.  If you must rent it, you have been warned.
0525953728|2.0|My husband really wanted to read this story but it just hasn't caught his interest.  He has started it a couple of times but is thinking that it is just not his style of writing.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|This CD collection is Excellent and includes all of the best hits by the Rolling Stones from their beginning in 1962  until now!!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|If I had to come up with an awsome movie night idea, it would be \\"Lawless\\" as the opener followed by \\"Unforgiven.\\"  While Lawless is not to the level of Unforgiven, it is in the same ballpark.  I thought this was a great movie and I believe it to be very re-watchable (for me, only movies I can watch over and over get four stars and above).
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|Ridley Scott himself said this would be an action movie that no woman would ever walk out on.  It simply gets better with time.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|My husband LOVES this CD/DVD.  We have had a recording of this concert saved to our DVR for about 2 years.  He plays this often, singing word for word. To say that this gift made his birthday special is an understatement!! Thank you!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|What can I say!  They were the best Disco group in the 70's and 80's. This Greatest Hits collection CD will not disappoint!
B0086700CM|3.0|This is very addicting; great for mindless kill time.  Levels can be hard to reach;  I am 5 1/2 yrs old
B0081KZ20E|5.0|This is one of the most entrancing stories I have ever read.  The movie, with all it cuts and omissions, is a top rate thriller.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of his better books yet still a fun read.  Can't wait for the next researched book.  Please hurry.
B009CPE7CQ|4.0|Such a good show! Sometimes the quality was below HD but I assumed that was my internet connection rather than the order.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this book as a present, and get rewarded for it with amazing meals each and every time.<br /><br />Just the pro's:<br />Easy and fast to make, often also healthy recipes<br />Recipes different from the blog<br />Well made book and cover<br />Descriptions are in metric units as well, not just imperial
B000VDDDVO|5.0|One of my favorite movies in one package. My family loves to watch this movies every Christmas. Love the easy access packaging.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Well written and acted.  The movie keeps you guessing on where it's going and keeps things pretty clear on what could be a confusing premise.  They could have cut down on the gun fire and still had an interesting movie.
B004FK24ZA|1.0|I choose this rating because when we started watching there was either Japanese or Chinese captions at the bottom of the<br />screen. That made it very distracting to the enjoyment of watching a classic movie. I started to send it back but the cost of shipping it back would have been more than the movie cost. Will not purchase any more movies from amazon.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Nice book to ready. Easy to download to my kindle fire hd. Easy to ready and interesting, like to ready more from this author.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You will not go wrong reading this account of a true american trained military sniper.  A super read and a book you will not want to put down until you finish it.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|This movie was such heart wrenching. I cried at some scenes and smiled during others. I have seen many of Tim's other films and my most fave was Nightmare Before Christmas, but now I am replacing that one with this movie. I am so glad I made the choice to buy it!!!<br /><br />Thank you for such an emotional remember able movie Tim Burton.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|my daughter likes to draw and color, so this app keeps her busy doing what she already likes to do.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Nice book to ready. Easy to download to my kindle fire hd. Easy to ready and interesting, like to ready more from this author.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The story was great!  I could not stop reading.  I was so excited to reach the end only to cuss out loud.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this app I have been playing it on my ipod and hoping that it would come out on amazon I have been. checking ever sense I got my kindle
B0081SPK0I|5.0|my daughter loves racing so this racing game give her the opportunity to do just that.! ! ! ! !
B0055B7K7A|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and adults alike! Like most pixar movies it's really entertaining and touching in some parts too.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed book two,more then book one.Book one was way out there,book two was more down to reality ,can't wait for the next ....
B007TNS6JI|4.0|it is a very good app andy would get a five star but I cant connect to multiplayer. when I try to logging it doesn't work and just stays at the logging screen. but dispite that I recommend it highly. I have a kindle fire.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|daughter loves it !! !! !! !! !! !! :-) !! !! !!  :-) !!!  what more show I say!
1419705849|5.0|Although I have not read this book, I can say that my grandson was happy to have received it.  He has read every Diary of a Wimpy Kid book published, and had asked his mom to buy it for him before Christmas.  Glad she said no, because it made a perfect Christmas gift from Nana!  Jeff Kinney gets to the heart of kids' reactions to situations, and in turn tells a great story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is so amazing.  I was totally blown away.<br />I loved the connection between Holder and Sky.<br />I can't even put into words how good this book is, but I'm so glad I've read it.<br />Def a keeper.
B008JFLWLE|4.0|It's fun to mess around with but I haven't really needed to use it much. It can be touchy at times, especially when trying to erase one of your inputs that you may have misplaced or that they app interpreted incorrectly.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really like this story line they fall in love but,neither one thinks that they are  not deserving of their newfound affecetion.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book..... wasn't predictable at all kept me on my toes always wanting to known what happens next... Great love story.
B009MFKO3M|5.0|Nowadays, I mainly listen to electronic dance music and rarely veer into traditional indie territory (guitars and stuff), unless it is to catch a more synth-centric act (examples from 2012: Grimes, Purity Ring, Passion Pit, etc.).  However, I will forever remain a sucker for psych-pop, and Lonerism is about as good as it has come for several years.  If you've heard any of these tracks and are interested, go get the whole thing--it's one of those seemingly endlessly replayable albums that only comes along about once every year or so.  I don't really have anything negative to say about it, other than that &#34;Elephant&#34; does seem out of place (akin to throwing a Hawkwind song into the middle of the Magical Mystery Tour).
B009PU2SX8|4.0|really like the song please come home. heard it on someone's fb page, and had to get it. decided to download the entire album. i think this is one of those that the more you listen to, the more you enjoy.
B008K8U13K|1.0|I think this may be a ripe off if it isn't its not worth 3 dollars I bought it but deleted it
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I was constantly looking for another book to read after I finished the harry potter series, and this series made me fall in love all over again! The detail Collins uses is genius! You feel like you really are in the book! You get so connected to the characters! Theres just so much to rave about this book you just HAVE to read it! Collins is an absolute genius!!!! I'll never find another book like this its been two weeks since i finished the last book and im in withdrawl:( if you choose not to buy this trilogy, you're missing out on some of the best books of the century. Believe me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game really well. It's fun to play & rules are well explained & I like playing it
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good read. I thought it was predictable but still liked the way it unfolded. If you remember that it is about a 17year old and get through the first part of the book journeying through teenage mindset, it begins to build up the climax of the story and turns out really good.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Pay no attention to the preview , the book is savagely paced and at times tense as a coiled spring that doesn't let go till the shocking ending. An excellent read
B0086700CM|5.0|This was a really fun game! It works on my kindle fire, and it's a great distractor. if your bored or need to pass time, this is a good app. tons of fun!
0307719774|5.0|Everything I expected and that's all I want to say or need to say.  Clicking on the stars is enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It took a while to get into the book. Once after a few chapters it all falls together. Lots of heart break but the love carries through. Very charming story. Loved the characters.
