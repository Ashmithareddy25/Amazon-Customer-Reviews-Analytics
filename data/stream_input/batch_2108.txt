B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an interesting book, even if you saw the movie.  There were twists and turns throughout the book that kept you interested until the end.  After the end of the competition, the rest was kind of anti-climatic.  But there are more books.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Great story lines and plot. I first saw this in Afghanistan and fell in love with the show, too bad they only completed the first season.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|read one .read them all .move on .not my kind of read .more for the kinky type and those who enjoy this type of read
B009CGYO0K|5.0|As a person who has a few felines, this book was right up my alley...I.especially love the office cartoons!!!  TooooFunny!!
B004TN7QPG|5.0|I have tried so many of the ereader apps and I must say that I love this one- the ability to highlight in different colors & underline- they keep making it easier & better! Also you can look at the pictures separately & make them larger- great for studying for meetings.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose a five star rating because the book is engaging and addresses bullying on a level kids understand and relate to. Helping readers love reading has an excellent link to a teacher's guide for the book. the teacher has done some workl to show meaning of the author's intentional references. Whole class and small group discussion is rich.
B004DL5K2K|4.0|Amazon really needs to get better at sorting out the reviews for multiple editions of the same material. The last edition, where the drum and bass tracks were rerecorded was definitely a horrible mistake that ruined the album. This 2011 edition reinstates the original tracks and remasters the entire album, adding some bonus tracks to boot. If you buy any reissue of this album, the 2011 edition is the one you want.
B004P1JEXE|5.0|Have seen all the movies except the last one...cant wait to see how it follows the book.<br />The books keep one on edge all the time.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|Was looking for something like Downton Abbey - which we are addicted to. This fills the bill.<br />My daughter and I loved it.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Have just started the last book in the series and looking forward to the film.<br />Also have had to watch the movie again as the story is just fantastic.
B004MMFBQU|5.0|I got this kitchen for my 14 month old son and so far we love it. Its really nicely designed and compact - works well in an apartment. I've had no problems with the doors or shelves and my son had fun helping us put it together. He plays at the kitchen quietly putting things on the shelves, playing with the spatulas and pans, etc while I'm doing dishes or other things. I have no complaints and really like how it looks and functions.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|The books follow on really well and very hard to put down and just started the last book in the series.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Well written, with intriguing character development and a health dose of heart strings pulled on. The cases the interns work often require some suspension of disbelieve but the medical terminology used and case presentations are well advised.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This case does everything right and looks good doing it. It's quite easy to use once you get the hang of it.  It provides lots of angles for viewing at horizontal and vertical orientations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved it! Can not wait to see the movie. This was hard to put down and kept my attention. Would recommend.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|I usually like movies involving sports anyway, so definitely liked it; actors were all good in their respective parts.  Getting older myself I could identify;  It was funny as well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never saw the movie but I'm glad I'm reading the series.  Have already planned to read 2 & 3.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is very good. it is highly addictive. the objectives are fun to do but they get very hard very fast.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down.  A must read.  Can't wait for the third book.<br />You held your breath through the entire games.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|It was very sad on how a horrific thing can destroy a family. Alice Sebold was able to bring it all together for a happy ending for the family.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Simple and nicely made. Soft on inside of cover to protect screen. I like that it protects the corners, unlike most kindle covers.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Really??  I absolutely hated the ending. Why would she leave us hanging like that? The book overall was good. The beginning was quite confusing and it wasn't until about  a quarter of the way in the book, I actually realized what was going on, and at that point really didn't want to put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator for kindle!  The interface is clean and there are no annoying ads that pop up in the middle of the calculator.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Mario clone, but it is a a solid one. You can play free without IAP. It has ads, but they aren't too intrusive.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A great and challenging game. It is very engaging. I would recommend this game for those of you who like to problem-solve.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am on day 20 and lost seven pounds.  I love the muscles I see forming on my arms and legs.  I just finished having my third baby and I feel this is helping me get back in shape.  Love it!
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|I usually like all the g5 games i play. But this one sucked! It is way to short, the zoom in & out sucked & so did the story line. Please make better games, especially if we have to pay for them!!!!!
B006YTTVHO|5.0|The reason why I got this book is because I am a very shy and meek kind of person but after this book I can approach anyone and start a conversation with them. I would most definitely recommend this book to anyone who is shy and needs a little help taking the first step to be that sociable kind of person.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|After being bombarded by talent shows and scripted so-called reality, an intelligent, well thought out series makes watching enjoyable again.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It's one of those books you have to keep reading until you finish even if it takes all night. That said it was a little predictable.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I fun action paced adventure in the amazing book battle of the labyrinth I love this book it is amazing
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've played over a year on my PC and not spent a penny.  When you're out of energy, you're out. Come back later and energy gets restored. I'm on level 39.<br />Good to see this on the Kindle, not quite as sophisticated as the PC version, but still fun.  Beautiful graphics, great way to relax and challenged at the same time.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I had missed watching the entire show while it was in the running late 90's early 2000s, only caught some of the episodes, but watching the entire 7 seasons on Amazon Prime, it closed the chapter nicely for me.<br /><br />Good cast of characters and great story, what else can you ask for.
0307887448|5.0|I can't believe this is the author's debut novel; it kept me hooked until the end.  It was one of those books where my emotions would align with those of the characters.  For those who remember the 80's, you'll feel like this book was written for you.
0321356683|5.0|I just finished reading (and absorbing) the entire book and I must say that I really loved it, and plan on using it as a reference going forward.  I am a software engineer of several decades and a Java programmer of 9+ years. This book has helped me deepen and strengthen my Java understanding. I found it to be very well written (easy to understand) with clear examples, and I love the whole \\"item\\" approach; the book consists of 78 items (or short concepts & examples) so I never felt overwhelmed with information. Also, the font is large enough that I never had an eye strain issue like I've had with some other technical books that use a smaller font.<br />Highly recommended!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A campy cartoon with a rather interesting &#34;Old West&#34; touch.  Dusty, gritty, bad guys and good guys,Western Opera sort of thing with a moral.  It even has a cameo of Rowdy Yates as the 'Spirit of the West' riding around in a White golf cart.  Unexpected fun!
B000R4SMCW|4.0|This movie has 2 things going for it: Excellent performances from Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling and some truly fine writing--the plotting is tense and exciting and the dialog is crisp and intelligent.<br /><br />This one's a keeper. You'll want to watch it again as soon as you've forgotten the main plot twists.
B0067R0APK|5.0|More like a mobile weather station, considering the sheer volume of info available.  Current conditions, radar display, forcasts, all with extreme detail.  I have it installed on my smart phone and all my Andriod tablets.  Well worth it!
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|The best of Clint's westerns. Good vs Evil, with Evil being on the side of the law. Shows how gun control can corrupt public officials, though this one is in the extreme. Great scenery, very well acted. A must have if your a western and/or Clint Eastwood fan.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|I am a major Grant fan and I collect his work as best I can.  This film shows him slinking across rooftops, eluding police, and capturing the real thief.  All caregfully designed to entertain.<br /><br />If you havn't seen this one, your in for a treat!
B000HZGNEU|5.0|Spock learning to curse, whales, mankind's misuse of the Earth, modern medicine vs future treatments and time travel...nothing more need be said.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|works great, no complaints, it does what the description says. I was able to scan all wireless connections and choose the best one to connect to.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is very fun. like new additions and graphic. it worked for a while but then it stopped loading. it will only get to the imangi logo.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Another waste of time and space on my kindle, this is a farce and does noting that was in the description. I realize scanning and finding peoples passwords for their networks is unlawful, however this would have been very helpful in my career as a PC tech. But it's a waste of space.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is VERY addicting.  It is hard to stop playing while your energy gets back up to where you need it to search a room.  This is going to be a long term game.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Wow. This is the most amazed I've ever been by a first album.<br /><br />Definitely five stars in my book. Their music is excellently crafted and they already have a sound that is as mature as other bands that have been doing it for years.<br /><br />The melodies are catchy but also interesting. There are a lot of things going on in the background and the style is difficult to classify. I am already a fan and hope to hear a lot more music of this caliber from Imagine Dragons.<br /><br />In terms of similar artists, this brings to mind The Killers and Melee. Take Melee's melodic skill and The Killers' vocals/lyrics, and you've got a recipie for great music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I saw plenty of people with this app and wanted to get it. then I finally did and I am in love with it!! it's beyond addicting!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Strangely, this book reminds you of the misery some spouses suffer and how few of them have the courage to start over. All this while no one notices the suffering but the abused. Good read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is better then the first one because of the graphics, gameplay, and it just has a different feeling to it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My wife had me watch this with her and i thought i would hate it. But i got hooked after one show. Awesome show.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Was a great book. Took me a day to read. I. Can't wait for movie to come out.. I hope it's half as good as the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey is just as excellent as season 1.  Superb acting, especially by Maggie Smith with other interesting characters and story lines.  Compares very well with its predecessor, Upstairs, Downstairs.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|When Spiderman came out I wondered how good the story line would be and the movie didn't disappoint. It explains from the beginning how he becomes Spiderman and learns to use his special powers. Very real. Great Graphics. good story . flying in NY City! the 2nd movie is a great continuation. Dr. Octopus great costume. and the 3rd installment where his dark side comes out THE BLACK SPIDERMAN. great movie.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The most unbelievable part was the premises of an FBI agent and Police Officer working together. However, it made for a good read. A little too much spent on birds and their habits, which dragged the story at times.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Ethan Hunt does great job getting the bad guys. Again. the scene on side of building climbing up just amazing.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|My favorite scene is when Kevin Costner watches the TV with Whitney's Houston's video playing.  I want a guy to look at me like that.  I'd never get tired of watching this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! :-D but it wouldn't let me open it so I had to buy it again. But it is WAY better than temple run one. Better graphics, backgrounds and way more!!!!! BUY THIS AWESOME APP!!!!! :-)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always been a fan of Stephen King's and have read most of his work.  Even though I enjoy his sillier (to me) styles like It and Pet Sematary, I prefer it when he steps out of that realm and attempts to do something new and more intelligent.  Like this book.  11/22/63 is a totally different style for King and he accomplishes it swimmingly.  It is so well done, incorporating some historical fiction aspects, as well as a hint of science fiction with the time travelling.  It has a wonderful smooth read, and a beautiful message.  It is really brilliant all around.  My new personal SK favorite.  Bravo.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun game for all ages. It takes a lot of focus and skill but is thrilling. You can buy players, hoverboards, and you can earn special mystery boxes. You need to play this game.
B0044C5SCU|4.0|I love this series. I didnt find this season as good as the second overall, but still very much worth watching!
B00APUYN0I|3.0|Great music and the performances were spot on.  Expected a possible teen movie, but was pleasantly surprised.  Highly recommend for a cold day inside.
B009VB998I|5.0|Excellent streaming quality, no hiccups or pauses during playback. My daughter loved the movie!  I've enjoyed the quality of Amazon streaming video above and beyond that of my video providers &#34;on demand&#34; service.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My 4 year old and I have loved playing the game for the last couple weeks... When we can get it to load! Try to open the game and it just gets stuck on the opening screen or just an all black screen.. sucks when some of the goals have time limits and you can't even access the game!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I didn't have my kindle at the time so I downloaded this app to my laptop so that I could get the books to read.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Nice program and all of is in the cloud so no need to worry about backups and nice intergration with other features.
0792841344|5.0|Scared the *** out of me when I was little. Great classic.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Good Sci-fi Western. Background story for main character is &#34;a take&#34; of a noble defeated Confederate soldier trying  to make a living smuggling in the Wild West, add a little twist here and there, and you got good sci-fi entertainment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is awesome if I had to pick what game on the kindle fire was better it would be subway surfers.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Does exactley what it is advertised to do. The app is easy to use and very informative. The start on plug in app is especially nice.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like how I can take care of a nice horse. It's fun petting and helping it putting it in competitions
B0086HGW42|5.0|This album is one of the best albums I own. I love every song. I have been listening to it non-stop since I bought it. The music and lyrics are superb.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|From a three year old to a fifty seven year old this game is fun for everyone. Looks excellent on Kindle Fire  H D.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have a hard time turning this one off :) I even watch it while I work out and have been catching myself staying on the treadmill for the entire show!!! I love downton abbey!!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Ok ok ok ok ok oo ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok oko kok ok... its ok . Good life lesson
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|ok probably more geared for children. d o  not really care for some of the sound effects.  thank you so much
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is really fun! The only bad thing is if you want to buy a horse they're super expensive and it's hard to get money.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Highly addictive, actually. More fun than it should be. A cross between Bejeweled and Sims. A great game for all ages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you like horses then you will like this game none of the games I ever played are like this,this is the best tragic and best horse game ever!!!!
B000W93CHC|5.0|I hate getting hooked on anything - so the idea of following Follett was against my nature.  But I am so glad I did.  When I finished the book I felt alone - without the rich cast list I felt lonely<br />Just a very special event - do try ALL
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I enjoyed the twists and turns of the book. Character development is good with an interesting story although the ending was a disappointment. Ah, but don't we always want books to end the way we want?!
B008RKKUZ0|5.0|Good quality of sound and image different than others I have watch at Amazon. No frozen images and very good sound.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game it helps me to pass the time when i have to travel. Very old game but very  challenging.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|It was  a good protector and very usefull at all time. In good condition and very timely. It was a good thing to have since the kindle is very sensitive.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|My daughter put this on my kindle , my grandson loves to play it . Would recomend to younger people.
B00296A4F4|4.0|I was reluctant to watch this series, now I'm all in.  Great pilot, I'm watching the remaining episodes on Netflix.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I spect more whit this stabilizer Is hart  to balance whit my Sony a37. We need more complete vídeos how to set the weith and balance
B0080CKGZE|3.0|Such a great cast!  But the script left much to be desired. The plot is predictable and leaves the viewer with little to be engaged with. On a high note, the costumes and interiors were good.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is amazing. I got this app a few weeks ago and I can't stop playing. Every time I open a new level, I get New colors or challenges. I recommend this app 100%.
B005LAIH3G|3.0|not enough 3D shots, sux, the movie I already had seen but not in 3D. so this rating is poor for 3D
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I have quite a few games on my kindle but I find myself playing this one the most. Easy and mindless fun :-)
B0072GPQ72|4.0|Good movie. Had some interesting things in it but a bit cliche, but still not bad. Probably you'll like it better if you're a furry.
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|Its very very good very interesting also, but too long. we watched 37 minutes and thought it had been 90.
0345803507|3.0|Never even read the blurb. BLah blah blah blah, I'm wasting space so i can post this review, I hear these books are good if your into BDSM and harlequin romance novels, blah blah blah.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|If you are a Dr Who fan, then you don't have to read this.  You already know that he has fun little jaunts in time and space, and manages to pick up trusty helpers along the way.  Generally speaking, this is &#34;normal fare&#34; for Dr. Who, which means it's enjoyable and fairly interesting.  I wasn't too thrilled with the big finale in the last episode, but it was a manageable explanation, and the way Rose &#34;opened&#34; the innards of the Tardis was a bit lame, but overlooking that, a fun ride.
B001FAFO3W|4.0|tried watching but I'm 30 now so I just could wrap my mind around musical animated historical fiction featuring Meg Ryan. Perhaps its good but I don't know. Blah blah blah, Amazon think you can't be concise and descriptive, blah blah blah.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but some of the &quot;pieces&quot; are near impossible to differentiate from the background graphics.
B000Q66QAG|5.0|I love HD videos and when you put in suspense and action its even better.  I like this movie and I do not know why it didn't do as good in theaters when it first came out.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I like the fact this was written by a Doctor of Neuroscience  to validate this experience. I enjoyed the fact he could tell this event from a scientific and participant view point
1451696191|5.0|This was actually a Christmas gift for my niece  who absolutely loved this book.  Nice read and book was delivered better than expected.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love this series and the chars. The way the story unfolds keeps you watching episode after episode . Like a good book you can't put down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series.  Everything about the series is terrific - the writing, the characters, the history lessons we get.  Wonderful ensemble cast.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had a great story that you didn't see coming. The writer unfolded the story very well and all the details came together. The characters felt very real.
B00973902K|5.0|I like this song a lot.  It's funny, jazzy and easy to sing along with.  Good party music in a mix
B000H5TVKI|4.0|For such and old film this looks good. Good original story for the time. If you haven't seen it Do so.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I was so happy when I could get temple run 2 on my kindle fire. it worked for a day and then it started to freeze and close. that means it force closes and goes back to the home page. its si annoying. I'm not getting the game until imangi studios fox's this problem.
B0015XHP3G|5.0|Looks sharp and clear. The sound is explosive for an old movie. This is even better than the first. Try it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is the most essential of the four official live Led Zeppelin albums (Song Remains the Same, BBC Sessions, this album, and Celebration Day). If you're a big fan, you'll want them all, but How The West Was Won is the album to get if you're just getting into Zeppelin and wonder what all the fuss over their concerts was about.<br /><br />What this album is NOT: a greatest hit compilation or a replacement for the studio versions. Zeppelin live and in the studio were two different beasts. The studio records were immaculate, layered and diverse. You know the songs. In concert, Zeppelin was a blunt, raw, energetic beast. They were living in the moment and weren't so concerned if they played a few wrong notes, had a cracked voice here and there, etc. The guitar solos were long, the drum solos were longer, and they threw in the kitchen sink every night. It was all about excess and taking it as far as it could go. If you can't handle long solos or loose playing, don't bother with live Zeppelin albums at all. That's who they were in concert.<br /><br />The Song Remains The Same is the soundtrack to their '70s concert movie and was recorded at New York shows about a year after the L.A. shows for this album. Because of that, the songlists are very similar (HTWWW omits a couple songs from the Houses of the Holy, which wasn't even finished yet at the time), but the performance quality is night and day different. TSRTS is a bit disjointed and contains particularly sloppy playing by Page in places. HTWWW, by contrast, is a show where everyone in the band was on fire. If you end up liking this album, you'll still want to get TSRTS, but just be aware that it's not up to this level--even the band members themselves admit that.<br /><br />Criticisms? A few. (1) The bass could be a little higher in the mix (it's not terrible). (2) No booklet or real liner notes. Zeppelin albums in the old days were noted for their deluxe and thoughtful packaging, but this is bare bones stuff. I've seen Zeppelin bootlegs with cooler packaging. (3) There was enough room on 3 discs for Page to have included all the songs played over the two nights, but a few were left out. Now that this album's been out awhile, I'd love to see an \\"even more deluxe version\\" with the full shows from both nights included. Zeppelin played the songs differently every time, and it would be great to have complete unedited shows. That doesn't seem to be Page's way of doing things as a producer, though.<br /><br />Get it. 'Nuff said.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This is a different type of role for Liam. He was great in it. Reminds me of the 80's actioners
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Twists and turns on every page. This book was better than I expected. Full of suspense and will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat.
B001UREJWM|5.0|A gift for my nephew. He loves it. The last with Ronnie James Dio. A good album for any Dio fan.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The three 90-minute episode format seemed strange at first, but they're all amazing. Instantly addicting. Can't wait to dive into season two.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|A great follow up to Iron Man. Looks and sounds good on Blu ray. If you like the first, you'll like this.
B002M9FWQE|5.0|The Boy Who Knew Too Much keeps the original style going that MIKA brought us with his Life in Cartoon Motion.  Many songs have an addictive beat, and each is different from the others.  There's only one song I don't care for, so I am glad there are so many great songs on which to put my focus.  MIKA even throws in some emotionally effective sad songs.  It's poppy, it's clappy, it's snappy, it's a rubbly ride on the Underground.
B0004Z33F0|4.0|This is a good follow up in the series. It is in keeping with the time. Give it a shot.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Well written, once you start you become involved in the lives of the characters, a thought provoking look at history.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game! My only complaint is that it is hard to level up / Earn coins and gems. Especialy Gems!<br />BUY IT!!! YOU WONT BE SORRY! :)
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I thought this was great, I missed the original first episode in the series. I plan to watch the entire series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I needed something to read while on vacation and I splurged and bought this book to read on my laptop.  This was a GREAT find.  It was a unique concept, intriguing, and kept my interest the entire way through.  I liked how it wasn't totally predictable.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Great film. Thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending was a bit mysterious, although I hope they will bring more to light on that in future films. I didn't grow up reading the comics these were drawn from.<br /><br />Interesting to see Stark portrayed as a womanizer, just like his son in the Iron Man movies.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|not exactly the old Oregon trail, but still a ton of fun! there is some challenge and strategy involved, so enjoy!
B005H9B44A|5.0|I've enjoyed all the movies I've seen with Natalie Portman in them. Also nice to see Kat Dennings. It was a fun movie. I need to read up more on Loki & the background to the plot. I have questions, such as, &#34;How do god's die?&#34; Will also be curious to see how Thor gets back to earth for later movies in the series.
B000OLGCI4|1.0|the only good thing about me buying the movie is that I got my money back. I bought it \\"new\\" and it never worked...
B008XKT9FG|5.0|i wanted to watch something pg but with a good story this film solved both deleminas it was a good fild
B009FBX5M0|2.0|Skyfall -I was very disappointed that it did not have the skyfall song by Adele! It might have said it in the title but I did not pick it up!
B009K86D86|5.0|everyone should see this film, a real eye  opener, i had no idea our food was prepared in such a manner
B0040HO01Y|5.0|A step back in time performed flawlessly with wonderful casting and a great script full of human endeavors and poignancy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I like how almost no one is safe on this show. Highly recommend this show along with Breaking Bad & Hell on Wheels. Keep up the great work AMC!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Not the first story on mars with this theme. But it's the best I've read so far , the tech problems are well solved ( it is just fiction remember) and there is a happy ending.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Bought this after seeing bits of it on TV--totally hilarious and worth it!  Definitely lots of sexual humor, so if that's not your thing, steer clear.  Otherwise, hilarious.
B000SLP4SE|4.0|Action packed story line which keeps on the edge of the seat. Do not want to give out any spoilers, but a very good Friday evening watch.
B009A3NGF4|4.0|Another solid album by M & S.  Make sure you get the deluxe edition; the extra songs are a little different from their usual style, and really fantastic.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63<br />Stephen King's signature, impossible to stop reading. Loved the end because it isn't either sad or joyful.  Long enough for a few days reading.<br />11/22/63
B009NQCK7I|3.0|i must say his daughter is more a pain with each episode a right spoiled brat..lol other than that the episode was good
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I've been a big fan of Judge Dredd scince I was a kid, and I felt that this movie did it justice,pardon the pun. While the movie didn't realy have that comic book feel that I had come to expect after the Stallone version, I felt that the writeing and acting were both better in this version. Karl Urban is completely believeable as Judge Dredd
1250010403|4.0|This book was not quite as good as the first book in the series.  A lot of secrets have been revealed that I think will set up a real strong finish in the third book of the series.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A tale of survival for the human soul as well as all man kind. Powerful and moving rich down to the end. A JOURNEY OF THE UNIVERSE.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I think that this is Bourdain's first book.  Makes me want to stay the hell away from the restraunt business.  It's not as good as his &#34;No Reservations&#34; TV show, but well worth a read.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love it but I wish it doesn't. connect to the Internet. it's. so fun and u should get it I would have deleted it if it sucked but it doesn't. it's. AWSOME get it
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am now addicated to this show.  I did find out that if your a cable subscriber, the series is &#34;ON DEmand&#34; included the current season.
0553801473|5.0|I can't wait for the next book although the author does have a proclivity to kill off many of the main characters. I'm pleased that my 2 favorites are still going strong - Tyrion and Daenerys.
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|Good vacation reading...I am pretty new to mystery novels, so all I can say is that I personally enjoyed the novel...pretty much for the reasons I stated above.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Pretty Little Liars is one of my favorite shows.<br />I love the mystery and suspense it just keeps getting better.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Cheryl Strayed [she chose her last name after a series of emotional traumas that derailed her] as a person is to be applauded for her total dedication to an unlikely objective...hiking solo for months on the Pacific Crest Trail, a wilderness trail running roughly along the West Coast.  Her experiences over the three months on the trail were a crucible for distilling her pain, rallying her sense of personal worth, and cleansing old residue of her pain from her psyche.<br />I will hear her speak at the San Miguel de Allende, MX, writers' conference in mid-February.  I am looking forward to meeting this superbly strong woman.
B006LSZECO|4.0|interesting story, but not a great book.  too many unlikable characters with no<br />redeeming qualities.  I,m sure it will provoke a good book club discussion
B00390BE7G|5.0|Reading it may change the way you think about your food. If you want to stay in your confort zone, don't read it. Very good written, hard but not moralistic.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It is the best book ever! I found it really helpful. I loved it! I would read it a thousand times
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I absolutely love Nelson DeMille's books; however this one was a little &#34;slow.&#34;  Too much dialoge and not enough action.  I did love the humor of John Corey!  I will continue to buy  DeMille's books, but could we ask for a little more action!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|It took me a long time to finally pick a book to read and I am definitely glad it was this one!!!  I would recommend this to any reader!
B004U52VPS|5.0|it`s the same in app<br /><br />it´s huge gift for kids<br />great excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellent the best quality great excellen<br />thnks<br />arrived on time in perfect conditions<br />great toy
B001JU4S44|1.0|Cheesey and lacking in interest.  If you're watching just to see the actors, then this movie would be fine.  If you want a decent story line and acting, then look elsewhere.
B007SO31BQ|4.0|Great story, a little slanted but what can you say? They wanted the driver to be a hero. Unfortunatly they made his Rival the villain. Probably didn't deserve it and it's the only flaw of the movie.
1616550414|5.0|Growing up a video game player there's few games that grab your attention longer than the year that particular game is hot.but Zelda is a game that most started following as a kid, and still follow as a grown up. Well this book has the story the pictures and is very inciteful on the making and backstory.if your truly a zelda fan I would recommend the book, I think it was a joy to read, and made me feel as good reading it as I did the first time I ever played the original game.
B009JTCBLE|4.0|This one has something that the previous releases did not(IMO). It feels more like a band effort than standout soloists on an otherwise boring song list. It still has strong pulls in the obvious directions (hello Led Zepp'again) but rather than sounding trite, they pull it off in a fresh way that didn't distract me.
4789004546|5.0|It is a very useful book for Japanese Learners, it defines the grammar structure very clearly, and covers a lot of important grammar.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|A ton of fun. I wish there were another 10 tracks. So nice to hear a real singer that absolutely OWNS it.
0071762345|5.0|Really enjoyed this book! It's definitely a must buy for all interested in improving their social media. The advice in the book is simple, yet powerful and effective!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can not believe this! This thing is amaziinnggg! It's so classes to 1.0.0!! I love how it has armour!!! I have minecraft on Xbox and this. Other than it has no caves, I love it!! Even though it's 7and I'm not lying $7, it is worth it!!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Didn't know if I would like it but I did very much. Interesting and unusual story. I had a hard time putting it down.
B001XV09UG|2.0|This movie just wasn't for me...I did not finish watching it.  I cannot criticize the movie, it was just something that I could not enjoy.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|I would not have given five stars to this album before maybe the ninth time I played it. It is tricky with little Fiona flourishes and nuances they do take time to appreciate. Once you finally settle down and really hear this record  WILL YOU UNDERSTAND  HOW VERY GOOD IT IS!
1451695195|5.0|This is a book I need to read again.  The medical terminology was a little tough to get through but it is the essence of the reason this neurosurgeon can speak with such authority.  The NDE is real as described in the book and very beautiful.  I am glad Dr. Alexander made the effort to write it!
B003QSMC18|5.0|I have to admit I'm in love with all the disney princesses and now I have yet another to add. This movie had everything good music, great story line, and a handsome Prince naveen. Although I have to also admit that it was a little darker than what I expect, it might be a little scary for younger children 2-3? If you haven't seen it yet it's definitely worth buying.
B007WFTFG6|1.0|I had to erase it from my kindle cause every time we opened it it froze, but my son liked it when it worked
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|excelent mouse to play easy to use and configure very fast the 8000 dpi are amazing and the size is perfect
B0094KT9Y0|5.0|When I need a quit moment I can turn this on and my son will sit and watch it. (Hes not interested in to much tv/movies )it's on my kindle so he can watch it in the car or on vacation instead of looking and getting into everything. We've seen this movie now about 100 times, at least, but it's so worth it.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Extremely informative and easy to understand.  The book provided a detailed chronology of how wheat has been genetically modified and the impacts of those modifications on humans.  It is an amazing example of the negative impacts of GMOs.  The author also provided step-by-step instructions to a gluten free lifestyle including many recipes.  I've been gluten free since reading the book.
B0012NVGHU|5.0|A sweet film and sad love story with really great music.  I can watch it over and over.  Lost it and had to buy a new one.
B0091REZMW|3.0|love this game. dont like that u need to play with your own money. diamonds run out very fast. takes to long to find collections items
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was awesome, one of the best books I've ever read.<br />I love the part where August wins the beecher prep award.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 Is a good game all around, good graphics, bigger gorilla, ziplines, minecarts, and lots of fun, and it's free
B005GFPZYK|5.0|He tried to excel in all that he did.  A Navy Seal, the Best Sniper, and coming home to civilian life to help other vet's.  He ended up making the ultimate sacrifice.  The book is a great read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this gamee :) :) AMAZING!!! Reccommended iff you want to pretend to take care of the horse! Very realistic.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Kinda x-files.  Kinda house.  Not the greatest show but better than most network dramas.  Holding out for subsequent seasons as I heard the show only gets better.  Female lead is the worst character but she has great supporting cast.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Saw the show before reading and I must say the book has so much more detail.  Makes me appreciate the show even more.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read...as usual couldn't put it down! Read it in less than one week, but only because I had to work everyday.  I can't believe how it ends!!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|One of the reasons I love this story is u feel like u are there with these boys. Fantastic, memorable
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I got this app and I love it .it is so cool I would SO recommend this app to anyone who is picky about the graphics
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This great BLU RAY was very hard to get threw retailers in my area.  It was great to get this BLU  RAY DVD back to me since it was stolen and now added to my BLU RAY selection thanks to Amazon!! I will be using amazon again. This was my 1st experience using amazon!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Where to begin? This is the best car speakerphone I've ever used. The sound is crystal clear on both ends. Pairing was very easy on an iPhone 4 and 4S. The battery life is amazing too! I got this a week after Christmas and I haven't had to charge it since then. I haven't tried voice dialing, however, since I'm not too big on that. For the price of this speakerphone, you can't beat the quality of this product. One of the few products left in this market where you get a bang for your buck! I have already bought several for my Mom and other family members as gifts and they all loved it as well. It feels good knowing that they'll be safer when talking on the road.
B007V65R54|4.0|The author presents a number of real world problems where accurate predictions would be useful. He also explains Bayes theory and presents some simple examples. Unfortunately he does not explicitly show examples of how he would apply Bayes method to the real world problems.<br /><br />It is still a worthwhile read. I learned a lot and recommend it to others.
B00B2EWBMI|4.0|I'm a huge RZA/Kung Fu fan, so initially I was really amped to see this flick,  While the fight scenes and stunts were great, the story was a bit lacking for me.  The bits of comedy were great, and Russel Crowe did a great job in my opinion.  Hopefully this is just a stepping stone for RZA and there are more movies like this, but with a better plot and follow through.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|great gift for grand-daughter.She loves this movie also the dvd and blu-ray comes in handy always a back up one
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Loved this book  and now have read it twice and plan on reading it again soon. Very enjoyable. Would recommend this book to anyone who likes to as I do.
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|great gift for grand-daughter,she loves it and the dvd and blu-ray come in handy,also great pricing great entertaintment for her
B003V9OCS8|5.0|This film should be watched for the cinematography alone. Simply amazing. On top of that, the story is fantastic, especially since it is a true story, and outdoor gear heads will be amazed at the &#34;quality&#34; of the equipment they used years ago. A must see foreign film.
B005LAII6C|2.0|I find it rather amusing that people are getting upset with those of us who did not like this movie.  I am starting to wonder if all the 5 star reviews are from people who worked on the film.<br /><br />I do give high regards to the animators.  This movie contains some of the best animation I've ever seen but the story just couldn't keep me riveted to my seat or even curious as to what was going to happen next.  I actually had to apologize to my wife and kids for making them sit through this.<br /><br />I recommend before anyone listens to the high reviews that they rent it and decide for themselves.  Don't feel pressure to buy because people are claiming it's the best movie of 2012.<br /><br />I would watch it with an open mind and not be pressured to love it because people are commenting that there must be something wrong with you if you don't.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|No plot, lots of exciting sex between two<br />very immature people.  Completely unbelievable but I couldn't put the book down.  Think it was because it's a good escape reading.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I see Ryan Gosling as Nick. Robin Wright Penn or Emma stone (too young) or tea Leoni as Amy.  A book of stunning sentences and characters.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Another good book about an unforgetable character. Tended to drag a bit at times but it is interesting to see the changes in Harry as he continues to age.
B008LD09LS|5.0|a lot of the people that see my husband with this can not wait to go out and buy one.  We purchased ours at a verizon store.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|I love Jane Austen and all her books!<br /><br />This is a classic novel that I believe everyone should read. It doesn't get dry like Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />This novel contains irony, dramatic irony, and comic relief with the funny things that the chacters' say or think.<br /><br />I don't want to summerize the book, because I believe that everyone should discover the magic of this novel for themselves.<br /><br />I will say this: I thought the ending was needing something more desired and solid. That is in my taste, though.<br /><br />Overall, I clearly enjoyed the novel. It taught me many things about England at the time, besides having a romantic story in it.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|This is one movie that really should not have been remade.  The original still holds up just fine, and there is nothing new they could add to justify a remake.  On top of that, I felt that most of the characters lost something in the translation.  I really didn't have any reason to feel anything for any of them.  I don't want to blame the acting, but something with the changes in story or how key scenes were played out just left me wishing I was watching the original instead.  In the end the movie is watchable, but I would feel very sorry for anyone who might watch this one having never seen the original, because they probably wouldn't even give the original a chance afterwards... and that is where all the magic of this story is.  One last thing to add for argument to watch the original over a remake... Kevin Bacon.  Enough said.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app stinks! I get more &#34;network errors&#34; than anything....or &#34;cannot connect to Facebook&#34;. It has to be the kindle app because I can immediately connect via my iPhone with no trouble. It's definitely not worth the frustration.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Just terrific!  For my money Ian Rankin is simply the best writer of the genre, and Rhebus is his greatest creation.  Not without it's melancholy, though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an awesome game its a strong rival of temple run but soooooo much better and the characters are a lot cooler
B006LSZECO|4.0|I expected a different kind of justice. I don't think it was just. I think it was sad. And delightful.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|My girlfriend recently watched the first season because she had it recommended by her parents. She thought it was a decent show but was just too violent for her taste.<br /><br />Loved streaming on the ipad through amazon prime though! So convenient...
B007R108WA|3.0|An unbelievable but interesting story.  Good cinematography.  Full of many ugly and a few beautiful characters one of which is at first I did not recognize as Dustin Hoffman.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|enjoyed the entire season,great story lines, lots of action, sex, and violence. I have watched all four seasons thru Amazon prime in the past month ! I can't wait for season 5
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved it!  Fun story with some real science behind it.  I always appreciate that.  Only problem?  No need for a sequel...boo.
B005EJNAK4|4.0|My husband watched this video and he said to give it a 4. It was action packed which he liked
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Quite an enjoyable series. Season 1 really delivered and I can't wait to get to the other seasons. I'm sorry I missed this when it was originally broadcast.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The funniest, heart warming and breaking book. This is my favourite book of all time. I have read this book five times
B00AAX68HG|5.0|helps my 5 year old think ahead and problem solve. Challenging but simple enough for her to play by herself. I would get this for pre k to 2nd grade children.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i luv this game but it needs...........ummmmmm it needs an update the update could be that we could chat with other people of our friends on the friends ........thatwould be soooooooo fun
B0094K1JPC|3.0|An okay movie. Light, and passes the time quickly. Harrison Ford over acted a bit...he did not seem natural or comfortable in the role.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a great game: it has good graphics, good music, and has a better variety than the first temple run.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|If you enjoy shows like Glee and The Voice, and have a good sound system, this is an enjoyable movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it because it doesn't have any glitches, it's fun and addicting. Graphics on the game are pretty good as well. All in all, it's amazing.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I love the Disney classics and realized I was missing the Little Mermaid. Disney locks them away in the vault. I knew I could find what I was looking for on Amazon. You never disappoint Amazon thank you!
B00782O7IY|3.0|was a strange little movie.,but I have heard that there were many silent scren actors that couldnt make it in film after there was sound because of their voices?<br />dont know if its true?<br />I got this movie for my Dad
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best it could be free to get the people we all want  it free. it just how it is
0525953728|5.0|This is the way it was. They tried to keep him from writing and publishing it.  Hard to put down.  I read the book and wouldn't waste my money on the movie.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|My daughters and I enjoyed the music, the dancing. We even got up and danced ourselves in the scene where the friend was learning to dance with the young girls teaching him.<br />I remember the original well, the references to the original were subtle and well done.<br />The scenes that were rearranged slightly from the original I thought played out better.
1599218011|5.0|I have four copies of this book.<br />I have prescribed it to so many of my clients.<br />I am thrilled that Kriss has shared her knowledge with the world.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I did not think that I would like this game but it has turned out to be really great ans fun :)
B0081336FO|5.0|Im a big Doctor Who fan, so I was excited to see Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss working on this project. Season 1 was a little slow for me, but season 2 was brilliant, complex, and suspenseful
B009IEXKXI|5.0|One of the most clever and informative books I ever read. The author must be a NASA scientist and super geek. The book was also very funny and original. Well done!
B008Y6QZ56|4.0|Good story-line all the way through. This is one of those movies you want to follow to the end. Good watch.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Love the interaction between all the characters, especially Harvey and Mike. Daniel is a great villian too. Kudos to the writers of the show for all the great dialogue.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|Not even sure what it was supposed to do but it froze my kindle...was not happy! I'm thinking of uninstalling it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The tension between old school Lord Markham? and the changes going through his daughters and the staff is interesting. The class system is weakening. Maggie Smith is a hoot.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Works perfectly. Has mute, expander, bass, chat, and game volume adjustable settings. Comes with cord to plug in so you can hear the game sound through the headset. Easy to use. You can hear footsteps in Call of Duty. Adjustable mouth piece, excellent voice and game volume quality. Very comfortable, fits any head size.
B00466HN72|3.0|***WARNING: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />For a while now, I wondered why we don't get that many nonreligious-themed Easter films--and while the idea doesn't appear to hold that much water compared to, say, The Ten Commandments or Ben-Hur, it is a curiosity given that we recieve a ton of nonreligious Christmas movies, but not many for Easter. But I do remember a couple from my childhood--given that they are specials rather than films. Peter Cottontail by Rankin/Bass, a Bearnstein Bears Easter special (gosh, does anybody really remember those books or the cartoon?), and It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown. I don't remember much about either one as I haven't seen them since I was 4 or 5, but I do occassionally chuckle over the Charlie Brown special whenever I look back at my previous viewings (then again, Peanuts always had a wry sense of humor).<br /><br />And that's where Hop comes in. Not feeling comfortable inheriting the position of Easter Bunny from his father, E.B. runs away from home (located on Easter Island, heh heh), and runs into Cyclops from the X-Men movies--without his glasses, and his condition apparently cured--an unemployed man struggling to secure a job. E.B. wants to be a drummer, and Cyclops wants to inherit the position of Easter Bunny. So the two strike a deal, and hilarity apparently ensues.<br /><br />The movie may sound like it's screaming ''Alvin and the Chipmunks,'' but props go to the movie for two reasons. One is that the film has a touch of genuine british humor and isn't just crass and vulgar (like, say, all the live action features loosely based on anything Hanna-Barbara had any involvement in in the past). Second is that it does sustain itself well with passable jokes throughout the 95 minute running time and doesn't simply feel like filler. Two key gags involve everyone taking in a talking bunny rather well and almost instantaneously, and another being the scene where Russell Brand in a cameo appearance is talking to E.B.--theprotagonist in which he provides the voice for.<br /><br />No, I am not a Russel Brand fan, and his comedies--I'm mostly referring to the likes of Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Get Him to the Greek here, but Bedtime Stories falls under the radar as well--are rather quite revolting to say the least. And there are plenty of moments in that film that do fall under the radar (remember, this film was directed by the same guy that gave us Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties, and the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, after all). A prime example is a gag in which E.B. would continuously produce fruit-flavored jelly bean pellets, which was a joke better off left on the cutting room floor. Another--in which the antagonists were all chicks with hispanic accents--just doesn't make much sense at all (if one were to give the villains of the piece a separate accent from the English-speaking rabbits, it would have made more sense to make them French or German, anyways). Another scene shows the two lead characters ruining a gradeschool pageant in which the quality seemed to have screamed Cool As Ice (in the aforementioned movie, the music in the prom was made to be absolutely dreadful just to make Vannilla Ice look talented by comparison).<br /><br />I will not question E.B. unwittingly backstabbing Cyclops near the end by feining his death. He was overconfident that his friend could fend for himself, and the doubleuntandre worked as a double-edge sword (he put his vest on a turkey boiling in a pan to trick the Pink Berets into thinking that he's dead, whilst simultaneously ''dressing the turkey'' if you will). The intended gag works, but in return, it does conflict with the characters themselves AND the narrative flow in general. That, and the ending seemed anticlimatic (let's just say, the gag worked better in Pikachu's Gotta Dance!).<br /><br />So is it bad? Mmmm....yeah. Is it dreadful? No. Is it even watchable? Barely. If anything, the jokes do sustain themselves throughout thefilm, but they aren't clever enough to warrant repeat viewings. It's essentially a film with only one good trick, and not enough substance to warrant being the film's saving grace. For casual viewing, I'd give it a 4 out of 10. But if you have kids, it'd be a 1 instead; I just can't fathom the idea of allowing children to watch these sorts of films without fearing the effects they will have on their brains. And heading towards the direction of films like that, it's better for them to watch films like Who Framed Roger Rabbit or the Shrek films.<br /><br />So by Amazon standards, that would probably make it a 3 out of 5 (though just barely).  Just don't let your kid watch this.  At least not until they are in Middle School.
B00498YZFK|4.0|This was a well-acted movie with an interesting story.  Being from Missouri and not far from the Ozarks, it was an interesting depiction of what some people are dealing with.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i have been using this app instead of the one on my phone, it works just like a regular calculator. i really enjoy it. thanks!
B000YMQI6E|5.0|I think Ryan Gossling has got such a talent, that any movie he  is in is great, and to act with Anthony Hopkins, it is a must see movie. Your not wasting you time watching it, Especially if you are a Ryan Gossling fan, or Anthony Hopkins.It is a different kind of movie, and Anthony Hopkins always plays creepy very well.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|This movie was very great. I love the plot. I didn't find any problems with the film and would most  defiantly recommend this movie to friends.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|The music is the greatest, and story line is great, and the actors are wonderful. Why this movie didn't do better at the theatre I will never know, I could watch this over and over again. Whenever I don't feel good, I always put this movie on, because the music alone makes me feel better.
0316010669|3.0|This book is well written and easy to read. There are lots of great anecdotes and interesting observations to convey the books main ideas:<br />* sometimes immediate, unconsidered thoughts are better than reasoned ones<br />* sometimes they are not<br />* experts can become very good at instant thinking<br /><br />However, it doesn't go much beyond this in terms of insight into the nature of thinking and judgement. As a consequence, it is a bit repetitive and long winded.<br /><br />If you want to improve your own thinking, or even to understand what is happening when people make good snap judgements, this book will not be much help. I learned more in the first 10 pages of [[ASIN:0374275637 Thinking, Fast and Slow]] by Daniel Kahneman  which is not as entertaining or easy to read, but has a wealth of insight based on years of research.
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|This book was a pick from one of my book club members. I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised by the simple and yet poignant stories. At times funny and at other times heartbreaking. I've been looking for a fast paced page turner for a while now and I found myself enthralled by this book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would have never thought to take a look, but a friend recommended Downton Abbey as a wonderful series, so i watched the first couple episodes of Season 1 - I became an addict.  I got all caught up and am now waiting till each Sunday evening to watch the show as it airs on PBS.  You probably don't have to watch all the past episodes to enjoy the show, but I would recommend it.  They build the characters nicely - you love some and hate others.  Also, besides the idea that the Earl and his family are very benevolent people (most wealthy folks of this era were not), the show seems to recreate the model and image of the classes in early 20th century England with historic accuracy.
1449410243|5.0|brilliant very funny!!  Accurate as well, I found a white board and some ammunition in my cats den once I realised what she was up to!! ;)
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If you like sophomoric humor, this will be a great movie for you.  I thought it was plain stupid.  Sorry, Ted.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Keeps the grandchildren very happy on car rides! Also brings them closer together with the older child helping the younger.
B0088D3PYE|5.0|The Prisoner of Heaven.<br /> A really beautiful read and a  great end to the trilogy.I found my self totally emerged in the story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book, i believe this is one of his best work. Very detailed and transfer you to the places and characters. I also like how he switches to each character making it very entertaining.<br />Love it!
B008O9V4C2|3.0|If you love Donald Fagen, you'll like this cd.  It cant compare to The NIghtfly, or even to Morph the Cat, But is does beat Kamakiriad, in my opinion.  The grooves are classic Fagen and the tunes are catchy.  I am not going to write a typical review where I go into each song, but it's a good typical Fagen record.  I would recommend it to anyone who follows Fagen. Course if you follow Donald, you dont need me saying this is classic Fagen.
B005LAII80|5.0|Much better than the Stallone Judge Dredd. This is a movie that should have done much better at the box-office and gotten the sequel it deserves.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book kept me very interested, its a good action book with a great main character to keep you coming back for more.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So good just sorry i waited so long to read it cant wait to read the last one....get it now
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This is a good movie to enjoy with your family and friends. It has a great story line behind it.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I ordered my set the day it was released, (2 days after the broadcast of episode 5 of 9) so now I've been able to finish the season just before the broadcast of # 7 - I guess PBS thought people would buy/watch no matter what.<br />I bought &#34;Original UK&#34;, it's American DVD format so no worries there, very clear picture and excellent color too, the DVD is so clear that if you can't afford Blu ray you surely won't miss much. I think the set of &#34;extras&#34; for season 3 may be the best in the series, and worth watching even if you don't like Downton. You can even watch them first, as I did, and not really get an episode spoiled with advance details- good stuff.<br />The stories are still at their high level of quality, the detail of the sets is amazing, great casting- better all around  than just about any &#34;American&#34; television.<br />I'm waiting for season 4 now, already planning to buy it too.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its the beat game of all time GET IT GET IT NOW! the only way to discribe it is that its awesome
B0044C3RB4|5.0|The series has veered off in new directions but its still as interesting and innovative as ever. Definately worth watching.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|I recommend this to everyone because of the combination of action, story line and excellent acting.  It is a WOW!!!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|It took me a long time to get on the SOA band wagon.  It really is a great series with a unique story.
0547884591|5.0|If you already know how to cook, then you may be disappointed with the low density of recipes (i.e., low recipes-per-page). But if you're just learning how to cook, then you'll love this book's organization.<br /><br />This book is ideal for anyone who never cooks and doesn't own any cooking gear as it builds you from nothing to full meals in a short period of time, including the best bang-for-you-buck gear. Even if you're beyond the novice, you should enjoy his approach (the book teaches how to learn anything, survivalism, etc) and humor.<br /><br />This book nests well with his &#34;The 4-Hour Body&#34;.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Not title<br />For my thing or review thaat i i iv i am trying to write a minimum of twenty wordz
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Welcome to the wonderful world of piracy.<br />You get to hire a crew and embark on adventures.<br />You need to download 125 MB app space first which can take up to 20 minutes.<br />There will be exciting battles and numerous options how to customize your place.<br />So why only 4 stars?<br />The reason is that the tutorial and mission goals are confusing.<br />I had to replay a couple of times to get the hang of it.<br />Still, an excellent game.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Retreating to Lark Rise and Candleford was a lovely escape from the busy and sometimes unfriendly world in which we live. It felt like coming home to family.
1400052181|4.0|Intriging story that caught my attention and held it for the entire book.  It was both heartfelt and educational.  I felt deeply for the Lacks family and learned a lot about science and the medical profession.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Works fine with laptop.  Unfortunately, I need one that could be used as a wall charger as I don't always have my laptop with me.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|The Belkin Classic case for Kindle Fire HD 7\\" is a good-quality case that holds the tablet securely with elastic with four angled corner pieces.<br /><br />The cover is a black woven polyester material that provides a good grip and is lightweight and resists moisture. The interior is a black soft touch material that feels nice in the hand when folded back for use. It's not designed to prop the Kindle up for watching movies but will stay in place against another object.<br /><br />There's no fastener or strap to keep it closed so it functions very much like a book.  Nothing fancy and no gimmicks, just a simple cover.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Great show. It really is an entertaining and somewhat factual show.  Just ask me, I have a Masters degree in Science.
B000VK99Z6|4.0|funny a great buy. nothing better than a bunch of guns geese and geezers killin your lungs from laughing so hard
0765325950|4.0|As much as I love this series, I am sorry to see it end. I believe the last book should have been split in two at least. I have never read a chapter as long as the Last Battle either! Many aspects were skimmed over and appeared to be added as an after thought, Padan Fain for one. I still believe the book rocks, I couldn't put it down, and there was a lot to not put down! Huge book, huge story, and even bigger shoes for Sanderson to fill, but he made a good start!  As always I still want MORE!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderfully created series. Great writing, great acting, great editing, great casting. Just an all around wonderfully produced epic. We are hooked on the series.
141659521X|5.0|got this book in 2012 when it came out, put it on the shelf until just this week..<br /><br />this vince flynn book is, once again, a great read..<br />with a few interesting plot twists..<br />the usual cast of venal characters, well described..<br />well written action sequences and a few hints for the coming insurrection..<br /><br />too bad we now all live in a highly politicized america where the current band of elites spout their well crafted and focus group tested propaganda and soon we will have a less than talented DCI rammed up the derrier of america rather than someone like irene kennedy..
B00B7FW6U4|4.0|Absolutely the best so far.  Positively creepy (although it felt less like it was &#34;discovered video footage&#34; then any of the others).  I highly recommend it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent acting, very well written show. An absolute must see. I had always been curious about this show, but often just brushed it off as another so so period drama, Then I dare to watch one episode and I was instantly hooked.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was very impressed with the writing style of this author! I was concerned that the reading would be more geared towards young adults, but it kept me hooked! I loved it! Adult content and subjects, but not trashy.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett has done it once again! I read through Pillars of the Earth 3 times and will most likely do that with this book. It was grand, outstanding, emotional, and as always, tied up in a neat bow. 5 stars!
B005PK56TA|5.0|I never thought network television would be so bold - I was wrong - great series kind them coming Thanx
B006MW3UZW|4.0|My wife and I really liked Downton Abbey and wonder that people actually lived that way from both the servants and the employers viewpoint. I watched what episodes were available on Netflix because Netflix has closed captioning and Amazon does not. Too bad because I think Amazon has some good content, but I do need the captions to be able to understand all the story. We are now watching Season 3 week to week after recording it on our DVR.
B00821OX98|5.0|I cannot get enough of it - I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good sci-fi thriller - great!!
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I bought this from an independent Amazon market place dealer at a great price.  It worked great, had absolutely no compatibility problem, and it was a six core processor.  What else can I asked for?
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This a very well written/acted show. I highly recommend watching these shows. Made me go out and buy a Harley.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|My hub and I watched twice. We really liked it. There were a few cheesy moments but it just made us laugh.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is an awesome app, but it takes too long to load...<br />but it is very realistic. I think it is worth the load time though!
B007HACDLK|4.0|The only bad thing I can about this book is the main story line.  It's an incredibly fast read.  Kind of scary at times.  But, you have to have a willing suspension of disbelief, to buy in to the Rickman storyline.  I have to admit I'm an expat from Minneapolis, so I read all of Vince Flynn's novels.  ( Where were Joe and the &#34;rookie&#34;, in this novel?! )
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a challenge but fun. I love all the levels like New York and Rio. I really recommend this game!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Exciting and a lot of action, there were hints that Jason Bourn was around but nothing came of it.  Based on how it ends, it looks like there will be another movie soon.<br />Frank.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I love this game. I offers a certain challenge I have not found with some of the other match 3 games I have downloaded.<br />If you enjoy racing the clock, I would highly recommend it.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Cant wait to season five come out... The price was right. Better than Walmart, and Best buy. It was shipped on time, I would buy again.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I picked this movie because I liked the Marvel Avengers movie with all the super hero's in it. I liked Thor so I choose to view the stand alone movie and was surprised how very good it was. It was romantic, funny, had adventure, It was all around good entertainment. Try it for yourself if you have not already. It's a fun movie to watch.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great sci-fi story . Well written and acted. Very believable. Locations are very realistic and well photographed. Titles look three D. Fringe is a great series
B005PK56TA|5.0|There is a lot of gratuitous sex and violence (gore by the gallons), but the plot lines are forever twisting and turning while the character development will always keep you guessing.<br />If you like season #1, you must watch season #2 !!!
B002UD56I6|5.0|NONE WORDS TO DESCRIBE HOW MUCH IT IS AWESOME. I HAVE BEEN SOME DISAPPOINTMENTS ABOUT SOME ORDERS. BUT IT ARRIVED 5 DAYS BEFORE DECIDED. IT'S BECAUSE I'M HUGE AMAZON FAN!!!!!!!!! THANKS A BUNCHES!!!!!!!!!!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Where did all the great/good sci-fi shows go??? With Fringe ending, all that's left is reruns on cable or Amazon. I only hope Falling Skies returns. The track record for shows returning isn't good. Stare Trek, Firefly, V, Jericho, Terminator, Heroes, Stargate, Caprica, FlashForward, The Event, Threshold, Tera Nova, Farscape ...  The list is endless. I guess this is a good reason to join Amazon Prime, BUT ONLY IF THEY OFFER THESE SHOWS AS PART OF THE PACKAGE!!! ARE YOU LISTENING AMAZON ???
B000W93CHC|4.0|Hope you are not squeamish.  The time of the setting for this novel was neither kind nor lovely,  however it is a nice ending to Pillars of the Earth.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Awesome mix of syfi and western with its own vocabulary! One year was not near enough! The following movie did give it some justice
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Season 1 was so creative and diversified. Each episode realty made me think \\"is this really possible\\"? One of my favorites !
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show keeps me entranced with the characters & plots as well as the history & culture of the times.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|Look if you know chris yu know he's a R&B's bad boy, he's always in trouble but yet he's fan's love him even more.. And i think it's because of this album, I love just about every song on this new one and even the futuristic album itself.. the 3D cover, and alien number on the back i feel like it's a cd from 2025.. T&#34;Turn up the music&#34; number 1 track show's the future of club hits..it's makes yu get up sand dance, like crazy, 2012 I've had this on repeat forever still in 2013 im listening to it, There's so much to say about this album.. BOTTOM LINE BUY IT!!! :)
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger game series.  I little scary but different for the mind. Katniss is a great character.  Hope this book comes out in a movie also.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|A great movie, much better than the first one. If you loved the comic books you'll love this. Hope they keep it going, I'd love to see more of these.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My nine year old ordered this, she plays it daily.She thinks the game is awesome. It is a great game for long car rides.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I bought this book based on the initial review by Allegra Skye, author of Saved, who claimed “A breathtaking new epic fantasy series. Morgan Rice does it again! This magical saga reminds me of the best of J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien. I couldn’t put it down!”. This is EXTRAORDINARILY MISLEADING! I am an avid reader of fantasy, and a fan of Martin, Paolini, Tolkien, Brett, and Rothfuss to name a few. I am rarely compelled to write a review, but felt it necessary in this case. The story reads as though Rice felt that she HAD to write it, like an assignment, and an overdue one at that. Grammatical, structural and logical flaws abound throughout this series( yes, I have a young reader and we have read the 3 books in this series together) making it a difficult read for adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book had me staying up nights just to read it! It was intense and exhilarating! Good job Suzanne Collins!!!!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I don't normally enjoy serial dramas, but this show is addicting! The setting, the period, the english accents...and the contrast of the wealthy and the working class make this show very enjoyable.<br />[[ASIN:B003DKVNKA Midi Myoroller Therapeutic Full Body Massager]]
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really cute. It is very realistic. It is also very easy to use. I like the variety of activities.
B002KVZBGA|3.0|A fun film with the likes of Benny Hill and location shoots throughout Italy. A bit slapstick and farcical but a fun 60's flick.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I LOVE this movie! And the Blue-ray/ DVD Combo is great! I have a blu-ray player in my living room for my big TV but only a regular DVD player in my Kitchen on my little TV. I really like that I can put the DVD on in my kitchen while I'm cooking and cleaning. Definitely would recommend people buy it. The movie has a good story line and if you like Christina Aguilera, I think you would like this movie.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|King of Leon is a great group, I like most of their albums but this one is currently my favorite one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a real good and fun to play and good to take up time and recommend that everyone gives it a try a real good family game
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I discovered fringe by accident and I love it. I am watching it on amazon prime. It is the only place you can stream it. As currently it is not available on Netflix or Hulu plus.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Little ones (under 5) may be pretty scared with the rattlesnake and hawk, but they had a great time watching the movie.  Little twists and turns.  Voice acting is incredible and HD is amazing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Dowton Abbey is a smartly written, well casted and beautiful show.  The second season has a faster pace, without losing its complexity and humanity.  Three dimensional characters -in all of their social levels-, make for a wonderfully interesting and moving storyline.  I absolutely love this show!  Wish there were more quality programs like this one...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm enjoying season 3 just as much as seasons 1 and 2!  As always, great acting, and beautiful costumes, furniture, and scenery.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read the next two &#34;Old Man's ....&#34; Series as soon as I could.  'Gave this one 5 stars, the second 4 1/2 stars, and the third 5 stars.  Just ordered the fourth, &#34;Zoe's Tale&#34;.  Think I'll be reading a lot more of Scalzi's works in the near future!  As an &#34;old man&#34; and a combat arms vet, I've read SciFi for over 50 years since my teens.  This is definitely some of the best, the right stuff!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an amazing TV series, engrossing, entertaining and addicting.  I look forard to sitting down and watching this episode by episode
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|DVD arrived quickly and was packaged well. Item was brand new as described. It was the best price I found. Thank-you !!!
B006JRY0Q8|5.0|I loved the Sopranos and I love Game of Thrones. Sons of Anarchy rounds out my top 3. The characters are complex as are the story lines. Complex but not confusing. The show not only gets you to invest your interest in the main characters but also the supporting cast. There are so many connections to what happened in a previous episode or season that nothing in the show seems trivial. I have watched all the first four seasons on amazon streaming ( somehow I missed this series and just heard about it about 6 weeks ago), and can't get enough!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Tremendous show! Great plot, great costumes, wonderful acting, tremendous set design and great to watch on Amazon commercial free! Must see TV...
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|This is a great introduction to mass food production. Not overly graphic yet still gives an honest look into where our food comes from.  Great movie for someone who is just getting interested in food truth.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Absent minded escapism.  I was surprised by the performance of these pretty people :)<br />I watched it at a time when I just did not want to think. It was cute.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Great reading. Had you guessing right up to the end. Didn't see the ending at all which ment they had you guessing to the end.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is awesome.  I have dropped it on a tile floor and it didn't damage my kindle.  A must buy!!
0385504209|5.0|The book was very interesting in its review of history and the surprises that has to do with the Bible.
B00AOCLWF6|4.0|I think this is great but it could be better by fixing the sound quality and maybe adding some subtitles.
B007KQ6XYY|2.0|I boought it for my 4 year old grand daughter. It will not start up and go right into play mode.<br />Jim L frankfort KY
B005PK56TA|4.0|I missed season 1 initially and just watched season 2 as it aired this winter. It was so good that I opted to watch the first season on my kindle.  I loved it. it was definitely a &#34;what's going to happen next&#34; give you the creeps kinda show. Jessica Lange is a villain that you don't know whether to love or hate.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|By far the BEST song on the show to date is Kiss!  But I look forward to other CD's of the show to come out.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was very real,sad,and funny at the same time. I kind wish it would have never ended. Can't wait to see to see the movie now:)
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|I really liked this movies. It was a good action packed movie with alot to like and sure there are some not so good parts, but I find that in almost every movie, but overall I liked it.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter, she loves the book bundle and has almost completed reading them all rather quickly.  She likes them as a bundle as opposed to purchasing them one at a time and then having to search her Kindle library for them or trying to figure out which one is the next one in the series, they are already placed for continual reading.
B00846TTDG|5.0|It was a good movie, action packed . Great husband and wife movie, something for both of us to enjoy.
B000053VAZ|4.0|The product is a DVD, the extras on the film were good and I received it w/out any damage and in good time.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Love this movie one of Mel Gibson's. best performances. This movie is in top ten of all time. Great acting by all cast members.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's novels and look forward to her next. The Secret Keeper is the most heartfelt novel of Kate's this far. I like the side plots and the format of her novels.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis and  Madeine Stowe bring this movie to life.  It is one of the best love story of all time.  The score for this movie just makes it more exciting.  I love this movie!  It so touching.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I enjoyed it and can't wait to start the final one. I think a lot of people would enjoy this.
B007N31YQ6|5.0|Based on a true story of Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three who was barely making it by when she got into a car accident and then starting working for her lawyer. In time she would discover a mysterious case in which PG & E wanted to purchase a families house and land. The story unfolds as Erin finds out that this family and many other families like this in one California town are all ill and she knows it has something to do with PG & E.
B00821OX98|4.0|The storyline is not very original but is well written and acted.  The characters are good.  My only criticism is the depiction of the aliens.  Neither the skitters or the overloards appear to have the manual dexterity to produce sophisticated devices.  This is a typical failing of most science fiction.  Aliens don't need to look like humans, but they need to have certain common physical characteristics.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|You can't say a whole lot more than that except to meet the minimum number of characters needed for this review form.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I have enjoyed noting the parallels in the series of Upstairs, Downstairs with the series of Downton Abbey.  I don't want to spoil it for others so will not identify the parallels.  The episodes in Upstairs, Downstairs are fairly well self contained and do not necessarily spill over into the next episode.  In Downton Abbey, however, each episode usually sets up a situation or a twist in a character that surprises and creates an eager anticipation for the next episode.  That being said, the individual episodes in Upstairs, Downstairs create episodes of fascinating events and characters that create a sense of the initmate history of the family household.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|What a great movie. My son will always love trees and help do his part because of this wonderful movie.
1592536913|5.0|This is a great book whose intent is to give you inspiration in creating your own Steampunk items.  Ideas of your own will flow into the images you'll see in this book.  If you're seeking a book that offers a project and the steps to create one just like it.... look elsewhere.  If you do not need your hand held and can springboard from your own creative juices into a project of your own, or similar.... by all means, get this wonderful book.  Tomas The Absurdist
B004P1JDJO|3.0|Many of the ideas are novel compared to other motivational books I have read.  Application is always the hard part for me.
B008Q086AC|1.0|I choose this because Samuel L. Jackson was in it.  A major dissapointment.  This movie was just plain stupid and the acting bad.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I got to see it, research to find out if it is all true and .... Change your behaviour and the way you buy if you think it is necssary
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game!<br />You can do really fun activities and enter your horse in competitions.<br />It is very fun
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Words like awesome were created to discribe things such as this. Complete album kicks ace! Can't wait to see these guys live.
6305090564|4.0|I'd place this into the horror, action, comedy category. There is plenty of action interlaced with plenty of surprises and comedy.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I only like one of her songs.  But, I don't get it why USA is giving so much attention when we have as good if not better talent of out own.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Though well written and certainly a page-turner, I felt slimy reading about this very sick and deranged couple. I regretted spending my valuable hours with these characters.
1416972250|5.0|*Minor Spoilers*<br />The third installment of the Mortal Instruments, the City of Glass, was a continuation of Clary's idiocy. Don't get me wrong, I liked this book, but.. eh.. there're better ones out there.<br /><br />After reading the first two books of this series, I started to get frustrated with Cassandra Clare. First off, how many times does she want to kill Simon? Or should I say, torture him. By the end of the City of Glass, Simon ALMOST died four times (actually dying one time to become a vampire). I didn't even bother to believe it anymore when Raphael wanted to \\"kill\\" Simon. And then, there were the unnecessary deaths. Out of all the characters, I do not understand why Cassandra chose the most random and innocent characters. Max Lightwood. The cute little boy who enjoyed reading and loved his family. He was killed just because of an insane lunatic. The insane lunatic (aka Sebastian Verlac aka Jonathan) also killed Hodge. Hodge, who got the worse punishment of all for leaving the circle.<br /><br />The second thing is.. Clary is an idiot. I feel like she never knows what she is doing. For instance: when she found out that Jace and the others had left to the City of Glass, she whined like a little girl about how they left her behind and then she made a portal of her own. WHAT. On the other hand, she doesn't even know herself who she loves. She goes on and off the Jace, who is supposedly her BROTHER (untll the end) but then she willingly lets Sebastian (who is her real BROTHER) kiss her.<br /><br />Then there is the ending. I find it hard to believe that Valentine is dead. If he was dead, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be a fourth and fifth book. Speaking of the fourth and fifth book.. at this moment I do not feel like they are necessary. Valentine, the enemy, is dead. Simon and Maia, Jocelyn and Luke, Clary and Jace, and Magnus and Alec all got each other which is all they ever wanted. The downworlders and shadowhunters no longer hate each other. See whatI mean?
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and enjoyable. There appears to be a few bugs that need to be worked out, but otherwise gameplay is smooth.
1426209584|5.0|This book is beyond my expectations - those pictures are a dream for any nature amateur photographer and for anyone who admires the natural beauty.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|I bought this after hearing my son and daughter talking about how good this album was. I liked what little bit of The Black Keys  I'd heard before and thought I'd buy the MP3 album. It's all I've listened to for the last 2 weeks!
B005DN5BE4|1.0|When viewing the video the sound would go in and out during numerous times. Not a very good movie experience.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I've seen Wonder around and thought, I should really read that sometime. It is an absolute must-read. I plan to read Wonder with my fifth graders starting Monday. Our kids today need to hear this.
B0094K1QR8|4.0|A fun movie, with a little humor.  Not too thinking orientated so it gives the brain a break.  Nice cast.
1250006341|5.0|I bought this as a coffee table book and love it.  It was great looking in on the scenes and backstage!
B009K86D86|5.0|Have watched this movie many many times and love it.  It has inspired us to buy our own animals, buy local and support the food industry as little as possible.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Good game but needs tweaking.  The energy doesnt last long unless up buy it with real money and the diamonds don't add up quickly unless you buy them as well.  Lacking imagination with articles to find and where hidden.
B009A87X80|5.0|I have recently been introduced to Eva Cassidy's music.  I love it.  I find her voice beautiful, soothing, unique, with a wide range and sensitive control.  I like her creative interpretation on old melodies as well as what she does with songs I've never heard.  I listen to this album nearly everyday.  dcd

B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe brings back the best elements of 90's Sci-Fi shows (X-Files, various Start Treks, Babylon 5 etc.).  Cool monsters of the week, an awesome story arch, and likable deep characters that you actually care about.  Overall a great revival of an awesome format.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Even more exciting than the first book. I'm anxious and excited about reading the next book. I can't wait to see what's in store for Christian and Ana!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great movie, would see it again and again and again and again and again and again. Fantastic!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|In the tradition of Upstairs Downstairs. Great sets, costumes, acting, and plot.  All lead characters are well cast, but Maggie Smith is wonderful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is such a great app! you can help your horse in different things and train them to be in ...
B00499NHLC|5.0|Very well written. A little quirky, but that comes from trying to freshen up homes. The characters are familiar and some of the plots fit exactly to old stories. One thing I liked was that all the clues are presented if you are really paying attention to details. There are no clues that you could not have seen... Although they may have been hard to pick up at real time. I found it to be great entertainment.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|The simplicity of this book allows the reader to connect to this story in their own way. Fantastically thought provoking!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I installed it with no problem and  have used it a lot to take pictures of family and friends. it was easy to use.
0439023491|5.0|Gift for a reading kiddo!  He asked for it and we conveniently purchased it online.  Thanks for a good deal!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Many of the modern games really get your blood pumping; many are irritating, even WHEN you like them.  Journey is a completely different experience.  I have never before played anything so peaceful.  Everything about it is relaxing:  the color palette, the music, the LACK of dialog, the lack of complicated maneuvers, the simplicity of the story.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its all right a little boring but the cool thing is that its like owning a real horse you could get.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|After seeing the previews I was looking forward to the movie.  Unfortunately the crash of the plane was the only few moments of action in the film.  The story line and acting were good, just kind of slow.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i like this game because it has mine carts and zip lines and a big monkey you should get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Never expected to be addicted to it soo easily. My best friend was playing it at a basketball game and it looked so easy! Well i was wrong, but i love the challenge and refuse to put it down. Works GREAT on the kindle fire. havent had a problem yet *knock on wood* :)
B00913DPW2|5.0|It took me awhile to figure out what to do, but when I did I had a great time finding the objects and putting the puzzle pieces together to solve this game.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a business associate and I'm so glad and grateful to have read it.  It's straightforward.  It's simple.  And it's so appropriate for everyone at every stage of life.  It's a how-to, but more, it's an attitude changer and an inspiration.  It's real and it's immediate.  It's a game changer!  I'd recommend this to everyone from high school kids to seniors.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I found this book to be a welcoming introduction to living minimally. The author's style is conversational and warm. It was a quick read as I couldn't put it down!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I haven't been able to find another show to watch that doesn't bore me after watching SOA.  Charlie Hunnam is something excellent.
0345803485|1.0|Taking into consideration the number of reviews, good and bad, I have very little to add. I read this trilogy in 2 days and found it hysterical. A very poorly written satire of a true erotic romance that had absolutely no accurate connotations of the BDSM lifestyle as purported by other readers.<br />I am a true fan of the genre and respect writers such as Annabel Joseph, Kitty Thomas, and Cherise Sinclair. These are authors who take the time to truly understand their subject matter in their writing. I have read every one of their books in excess of three times.<br />After the first reading of the Fifty Shades trilogy (laughing the whole way) I could not even focus for 10 minutes to try for a re-read even after a few months.<br />The verbiage is juvenile, trite and unrealistic. The character development is ridiculous in its inconsistency. The portrayal of a true Dom is laughable and Ana's supposed role as a submissive is equally unbelievable.<br />These 'novels' read as nothing more than teen angst in the first throes of love for both H/h. At 50 yrs of age I've bypassed that 30 years ago. If I see hundreds of 5 stars for a review on Amazon I want my money worth, not the hype<br />I received these books from a swap website and am glad I didn't waste the money to purchase them. Good for a laugh, yes; for an investment, NO.<br />Do yourself a favor, trade online or buy bargain basement used.
B003M70O5O|5.0|I haven't been able to find another show to watch that doesn't bore me after watching SOA.  Charlie Hunnam is something excellent.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is amazing, and at such a cheap price, you better pick one up ASAP! They are constantly on back order, so get one while you can. This knife was delivered razor sharp, and had some slick packaging. It is very heavy, and well put together with a full tang design. This thing was built to take a beating! Also, compared to knives of the same caliber, you can't beat the price of this one. I can't wait to get it out in the woods for some work.
B003DT19F0|5.0|I give this movie two thumbs up. My two year old loves Tinkerbell. I've had to watch this movie everyday since i received it
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I guess I was expecting more from this little guy, but it just doesn't seem to live up to my expectations. It couldn't get an old, beat up, Swiss army knife i had sharp, but i wasn't really expecting it too. It is a relatively new item to me, and i haven't used it that much, so i am hoping it will work better with other knives i have.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Smooth working app, no negative issues.  Downloaded several books initially, no problems accessing or viewing.  Look forward to using extensively.
B0095P29EG|4.0|I love all super heros..was it oscar worthy?<br />No way...just totaly entertaining.  its always fun to watch a film with a funny, handsome, great body good guy...and pretty hot bad guy too..special effects great too
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Great novel, easy reading format. The app (Kindle) works smoothly, allows me to read smoothly. Language in this book requires diligent attention as it is more complex than most modern novels.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I have not seen anything that even comes close to this being a flash player. How about giving Kindle Fire HD owners something that actually does what the Adobe Flash Player accomplishes.  As the British would say: &#34; A load of bollox&#34;.
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|May be interesting for  SW fans. Cute characters enliven the game, and play style is different from the original Angry Birds. I'm not a regular gamer, so others may find this more fun or have a better idea of the challenges involved.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Dragon Hunter is a very well written mmopg. third person.  I really enjoy the daily goals also the board has three goals you have to beat.  The game runs very well on my Kindle as long as no messages come up sometimes freezers just hold roentgen's the power botton and the Kindle will restart.  I really enjoy the game as I have good luck.  Roy eroymotion is my handle. join me plz.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Really feel good story.  In particular because Rodriquez seems unchanged by the new fame. His priorities were set long ago and it appears he sees no reason to rearrange them just because he is famous on the other side of the world.  Now it seems he just enjoys his music being celebrated.  He could easily have lived his life in obscurity.  His happiness appears to be internal.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I have seen this movie 12 times in just 2 weeks. I love it so much, it is a really funny movie and it appropriate for teens. Would not recommend for children under 12 because of the cuss words in it.
0307593312|4.0|I love Murakami's books.  I must admit, I was disappointed with this.  There were no Murakami touches, the gentle humour etc.. I have thought of this book of all the angles, maybe I missed... But I have to say, I like it least of all his books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is one of the best games I have ever played. It is a great game that makes me want to almost jump into the game and try it for my self. I love sliding down ropes and driving my character through the mines. If you get it, I hope you enjoy temple run 2.
B00820N2JG|2.0|This movie does not hold up over time. There are few laughs, but the profane songs will stick in your head long after it's over.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I had heard about this series, but hadn't watched it.  I wanted to see it from the beginning, so that I would know EXACTLY what had happened, and when, and (hopefully, eventually) why.  The characters are extremely real, with flaws and flubs and the whole human emotional range.  You can see how their personalities have changed,not only in the present, but from when they were younger: especially Walter Bishop.  The actor does an extra-ordinary job of portraying a brilliant man who's not only struggling back from madness, but seriously trying to right the wrongs he did when he was younger.
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|Not the most painful movie I've ever endured, but by far the worst of the Paranormal Activity movies. If you're familiar with these films, then you've come to expect the slow build-up to action until, at some point, all hell breaks loose. The hell-breaking point in #4 is a LONG time coming. In fact, I'm not sure it ever arrives. All of a sudden people are dying, and then it's just over, and my boyfriend and I looked at one another and went, \\"Oye.\\"
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is basic.  Easy enough to do all calculations and numbers big enough you don't have to squint to see them.  I really think its the best out there.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Enjoyed it from beginning to end. One of the few books I have taken the time to read in a day rather than a week. Looking forward to the next installment.
B005ERYEGU|1.0|Only one idea gets repated all the time. If the book was priced at 1USD it would be OK, at this 10usd price its a scam! Not worth it!
B0095P31L6|3.0|This had some funny moments and lots of highbrow jokes for parents, but the pace dragged in some places of the film.
B0026772N8|5.0|A friend recommended this more than 35 years ago.  I didn't have time and subsequently forgot about it.  Should have read it then!  Back then, I was informed that the book wasn't about motorcycle maintenance or Zen for that matter. And I knew nothing about the author or the fact that what I was about to read was the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition.  I found that the book is much more than those topics, a captivating narrative of a life journey and of values.  I'd say it's a very worthwhile book for anyone but especially for those who 'ride' (or have ridden).<br /><br />An oooold rider in Minnesota...
B0094K1K42|3.0|Chralize's character's life is screwed up and she has some terrible morals in the film. I think I kept watching to see how far rock bottom she gets. Patton Oswalt does well picking up the mood in many points of the film.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Loved this one. Had a great time playing through all the levels. It's fun to try and get the most little goo balls.<br />I didn't find it super re-playable, but I'm not much of a completest. If your one for getting the best score you could probable get hours more fun out of this game.
B0068THAGY|5.0|We own the dvd and love it.  The kids in the cast are great and the movie is well done. Being able to watch it on my Kindle was great!  I would highly recommend the film as well as watching it as a download from Amazon.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I like this app a lot! Great radio station you just pick a station and go about your business. You can pick your station by genres or decades. I must admit I've only listened to the 30-40 swing station since I got this app. I love it :)
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|It is a really cute show. Not the best graphics, but I enjoy watching it. I also realize it's an older show and the story line is a bit out there. Of course, that's what makes it fun.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Not too put too fine a point on it, this app simply does not work with my Kindle Fire HD
B002R5LKOQ|5.0|Movie was very well done.<br />I enjoyed it very much.<br />Great for male and female viewers.<br />Was a little long.
B003F5NSTW|5.0|This is a must read book but read it at your own perill as it has no happy ending.  Kevin is a dysfunctional child who takes a path of destruction.  You will feel frustrated with Kevin's parents as you are drawn into the inevitable outcome of Kevin's problems.  The story feels very real - it's hard to believe it's made up.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The first episode ,Rose, was probably my favorite for season 1.  It got me started in watching the series.  After that, each episode had its moments.  Billie Piper (Rose) steals the show as she acts like this is really herself if real life.  It felt natural .  The 2nd episode, End of the World, was just 'meh' for me.  3rd, Unquiet Dead, was good---it's story interlaced with factual portrayals of Charles Dickens and the period.  \\"Fathers Day\\" was pretty decent.  The other episodes are good but maybe not great.<br /><br />After season 1, I've only been able to watch David Tennant as the Doctor.  Matt Smith doesn't do anything for me other than nausea.  And, I've tried to like him by watching Vincent (Van Gogh) but it doesn't work for me<br /><br />Martha Jones (Freema) was a great replacement for Billie, when she went off to a higher calling portraying a call girl...  Catherine Tate does a great job as the doctors companion, Donna Noble, in both seasons 3 (Runaway Bride) and 4 (entire season)
B004DHUAZQ|4.0|If you are a fan of the genre you will like this. classic Stalone with cameos of AAARRRnold and Bruce Willis.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|I wish the series would have continued. I would like to see more stories of this quality. Too bad it didn't make it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game. my kids and I play it all the time. I have it on kindle and my smart phone
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Thanks for a really great movie that was done really well. We ca't wait for the next one. Thank you!
B005LAIISA|4.0|I like the ICE AGE series. It is good to show the grandchildren. This is one of the better ones!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This is just an awesome movie. Tom Cruise did one heck of a performance & we hope that he makes another.
B005LAII8A|1.0|There wasn't much of a plot. I had trouble watching the entire thing. It will be in my collection but I probably won't watch it again.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was one awesome movie that was just so much fun to watch. Iron Man & Thor just made it all happen!
0143119680|5.0|I read novels for the pleasure of exploring new worlds.  This one carried me to several.  I love the complexity and depth of the characters.  In tackling the often frightening subjects of Vampires, Witches and Daemons, she displayed their humanity and their dark side. It is also a picture of the shadow side of humanity.  I love that the violence was appropriate to the story and not just violence for its shock value.  I look forward to the rest of the trilogy and further books by this author.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Great movie, we loved it & can't wait for them to do several more. Blue Ray is of such good clarity.
B007N8RULO|4.0|I've played this version on a variety of devices for years. I enjoy this one most. But it does freeze upon opening sometimes.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|This is a really fun, good movie for everyone. It's a quite unbelieveable but lots of fun to watch. Thanks
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its really cool! And its way more fun then the 1st Temple Run. :) I reccomend this game for all ages!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Thanks for one really good movie. This is a true story that happened not too far from where I was born & we have family that lives there.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait to see another episode of this heartwarming series.  All the characters work well together.  Highly recommend watching it.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|I was pleaseantly surprised by the fact that this DVD includes two features....Friday Night Frights, and Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love??. Mattel could have easily released them seperately and charged more but they chose to put them together which I think is pretty cool. Both movies come on one disc which I think makes it easier for viewing since you don't have to change it out to watch one feature or the other. I will give a small synopsis of each movie (I don't want to give too much away).<br /><br />In Friday Night Frights we see the \\"ghouls\\" learning the power of being true to (and believing in) yourself when they take on the task of playing on the Monster High \\"scream\\" team in the Skulltimate Roller Maze after the guys on the team get hurt. At first the girls face opposition (tradition states only boys can play) but they never give up and eventually win the respect and support of their schoolmates and even their rivals. I like the message of this dvd .... it is totally girl power. It tells girls they can do anything and should not give in to peer pressure.<br /><br />Why Do Ghouls Fall In Love is a Valentines special. It is Draculauras sweet 1600 and the girls are trying to throw her a fangtastic party....unfortunately there are a few glitches. An old flame from Draculauras past (a vampire named Valentine) and Toralei do everything in their power to cause chaos. The underlying issue is about the power of true love, and having realistic expectations about things.<br /><br />Both of these movies are really cute....although personally I like Friday Night Frights a little better due to the positive messages it sends girls. Also I think Abbey steals the show with her funny jokes thrown in throughout both movies. These are movies that adults can enjoy with their kids as well. This is a good value for the money and much better then most of the kids shows out there.
B009O2XY12|1.0|this app although free is really an app to get you to buy the paid version. While the game is simple and fun, there are better bubble games out there and free.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I chose to give it a 4 star rating simply because I am a child of the 80s and don't want to totally dis my era, but all in all the movie was really good.  It basically stayed with the original storyline and the characters were engaging. I would recommend other see it, if asked my opinion.
B0075HP2K4|4.0|I purchased the album thinking that it was going to be predominately  vocals and piano the whole way through.  The vocals and piano combination are amazing, but somehow I felt a little bored halfway through and felt at points it lost it's originality.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have been playing this version of Coin Dozed for MONTHS. I have completed the entire puzzle. I have over 100.000 coins and I am on level 270. I know I can't lose anymore but I still love to play when I have some spare time.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|My husband and I saw this in the theater, and now we get to share it with our children, too! Everything from the fun character voices and actor personalities to the meticulously designed sets and outfits--it's great from start to finish. If you loved the book or just like Roald Dahl or Wes Anderson in general, you'll love this quirky, fun little film!
B006YXTRHY|4.0|My mom wanted to see this so this is her review: It was nice but I didn't love it as much as the previous ones. Bella was in bed most of the time. I hope the second part has more action in it. But I still like this story.
0345803493|5.0|Again, hot, hot, very hot.  Yes, the books are heavy to carry around and you get side ways looks.  But, they are worth reading over!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I love the stories, what can I say.... whether to get involved or not, what is right what is wrong? It's my cup of tea, maybe not everyone's.... Amok Time was awesome, Mirror Mirror was pretty cool, and IMudd was humorous oh and journey o Babel was cool because it involved Spock's parents ^_^
B00846REIS|4.0|A friend suggested Bared to You, I liked the book, it was simply written and it made a quick read for my winter vacation.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|Great story, The Harry Potter series movies have been more faithful to the books than any movie remake I have seen. sad its over
0345803507|5.0|Hot, hot, hot.  When readers say they could read  the trilogy over, I understand why.  I wish that I had order it for my Kindle; the novels are heavy!
B004G600A4|4.0|Fun, cute movie. Disney can take a sweet fairy tale and build a movie around it like no other movie maker I know.
B00A14V0MM|4.0|So much to love here, even if a few of the songs in the movie aren't included. Highly recommend this soundtrack.
B00003CXRM|3.0|Fun Movie, great song, george clooney at his funniest, Holly Hunter over the top, Not much else to say about it
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read all 3 books in a week. Nice fast read and love the style. Thought this was a great end to the series. Wish I could find another series like it to read now.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|Great story, The Harry Potter series movies have been more faithful to the books than any movie remake I have seen.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Now, I stumbled upon SOA during season 5. The show was so action packed with a fast moving story line and interesting characters that is sucked me in from beginning to end. I watched every episode of season 5 and still wanted more so I went back to find where it all began, and sure enough geniuses at Amazon found another way  for me to benefit from my Amazon Prime account by allowing me to stream SOA past seasons (not to mention hundreds of other movies and tv series) for FREE. I know this sounds like a shameless plug, however I am not convinced that enough people know all of the advantages of Amazon Prime...<br /><br />Anyway, I highly suggest that any fan (new or old) go back and enjoy the past seasons as this show is only bound to get better. BTW, the guy behind this show Kurt Sutter has a great video blog on youtube called SutterInk/SOA. Check it out if you find yourself like me and can't get enough of this show. Enjoy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Fabulous movie, disney at its best. Very good story telling and the animators captured Scotland in its glory. Especially the legends.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|The idea of this story didn't initially appeal to me, but on recommendation from a friend, I decided to read it.  The way it is written, from the perspective of a five-year-old boy, is really creative and makes it even easier to feel empathy for the main characters.  Though the plot seems like it would be very predictable, it is full of unexpected twists and turns.
B00008YLV2|5.0|Its really hard not to love Black Hawk Down. Those movies that show bravery and heroism of individuals, even in a campaign where the goals can be morally questionable, are usually the best movies. It has truth to war and circumstance, and is an extremely well put-together movie. Some of the performances are a little shaky in my opinion, and some of the scenarios perhaps a slight bit too dramatized, but otherwise I love this movie in its entirety.<br /><br />As far as this particular 3-disc set goes, its completely flippin' loaded with features, and interesting ones. The second disk is making-of, and includes lots of interviews with actors, their training sessions in preperation for their roles, the military's involvement in the picture, and pretty much everything else you could think of from a behind-scenes perspective. Disc 3 is filled with a bit more of that, plus documentairies and specials on the actual events that took place in Mogadishu, including historical experts and featurettes.<br /><br />I wont lie, I got this set as an indulgence, but you are really into war and movies and war movies, and want all the bonus features, get the set. Its worth the money.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I liked it a lot.  Very intense movie.  John Goodman had a great cameo.  Denzel starting to look a little paunchy.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|These are very comfortable, even for one with glasses like myself, and have good sound reproduction for its price range. A definite recommendation.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|True to John Corey character! Interesting in the fact the story hits so close to home! John and Kate always keep the story interesting!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story line, kept me reading when I should've put it down and go to bed. Couldn't wait for the next book in the series!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This movie is the greatest Batman movie, EVER! Period... End of review. Why are you still reading? Buy it already!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best, the horses are so realistic. It`s easy to play and the kids love it. It really helps to teach responsibility. Also teaches care and love for all God`s creatures.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|These two games are deffinatly some of the best the PS2 had to offer. The HD collection takes it to another level. The graphics rendered in high def are superb. The included 3D is amazing. One nice addition were the making of featurettes and a free dinamic theme.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I've been trying to get through it for months now but I alway loose interest. The characters and their sexlive is really a turnoff for me. Sorry, I just don't see what all this fuss is about???
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love this game  especially due to the fact it is ad free!!!. It was a great choice, thank you
B00B4804KS|3.0|I loved the movie and I have both the VHS and the DVD. I would love to purchase the 3D version and all I need is just the 3D DVD. I think a price of around $24.00 would be somewhat justifiable, but $43.00 would never be what I'll be willing to pay for it.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|This well-acted and compelling drama is unlike anything else on TV. I watched seasons 1 and 2 in less than a week, and I can't wait for season 3 to start in April.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Was really good. But the uthanation was really disturbing. The  story was really entertaining and kept my attention the whole time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love love love this show!!! Instant viewing on amazon was amazing!! Great high definition! And no hiccups, freezing or interferances.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I have watched merlin from the beginning..have all the DVD's..<br />Although this year will be the last I will enjoy it but miss it like crazy...<br />Merlin has great story lines bu.......t is funny also in every apisode
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is entertaining. I like games that make me think. Its not very challenging but enough to keep me entertained
B001XUJMZK|2.0|I collect historical swords. I immediately noticed the Scotts were all using Norman swords. While they might have captured a few, these would be more accurate for the English as they were the main battle sword of the Normans at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. A brief visit to IMDB told the tale. Scotts stopped painting their faces with blue woad hundreds of years before the historical date of the movie. On the other hand, they didn't begin to wear kilts until hundreds of years later in a different part of Scotland, and wore trews ( pants), not kilts, when riding horses because they didn't wear underwear with kilts.<br /><br />The known history of the main character in the movie was totally misrepresented. He was not orphaned at an early age and his wife didn't die shortly after their marriage. In fact they had two children.<br /><br />Of course this is a work of fiction intended solely to entertain, but, I don't like having history so misrepresented that I would make a total fool of myself if I repeated it as fact. Fiction is fine if it's presented as fiction.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I got to a level that was ridiculous. There was no way out or passed that level. Eh, got bored with it and quit
B005PK56TA|5.0|What a great and also creepy show! I watch so much horror films and shows that I can usually predict everything that's going to happen. However, this one had a plot twist in it that was a total jaw-dropper! When it comes in your viewing you will know what I am talking about. Highly recommended!
B00402FGE4|5.0|I love the StarGate worlds and have only been able to catch a few of the Stargate Univers eppisodes on TV and have never been able to see how it all began. This first season is wonderful. I just finished watching the very first eppisode and cannot wait to get back to seeing more. It is a bit different (perhaps a bit darker, grittier) than the usual Stargate SG1 or Atlantis but I find it every bit as entertaining and there is always that great Stargate feel to it even if it does seem a bit further removed at times. I loved it and am looking forward to watching all of the last season as well.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I loved this game.  Good graphics and easy to play.  Most of the g5 games i have played never fail to deliver.
B00APACSJG|4.0|Whilst I am a huge fan of the more militaristic adventures that Miles has been through, this was a well rounded tale mixing politic, intrigue, romance, morality and adventure. A great continuation of the Vorkosigan saga.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was one of the more interesting of the three books.  Haveing a mystery mixed into the story line help balance out the content.
B009T3AHDE|4.0|Cosmopolis allows Robert Pattinson to really show off his talent. He digs real deep and rewards us handsomely.<br />The story encapsulates 24 hours. What a difference a day makes!
B000N5F6OW|5.0|I enjoyed this movie,espeically the capture of the African animals.What I noticed as to the time frame of the movie was that Everyone smoked cigarettes, you don't see much of that these days.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I work 60+ hours/wk, have 4 kids & never have time to myself but somehow I found time to read this book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks has done it again.  This was a great love story that proves your current situation does define your future.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel app is great.  I can find out how the weather is in cities where relatives live, and places we plan to visit.<br />It gives a lot of helpful information.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this book but decided to try it... and am I glad I did! Kept my interest the entire time! Must read!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As a Stephen King fan, this novel was one of my favorites. Clearly well researched and entwined with pure fantasy.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|There are times when I need to control the overheads for a presentation and the computer is in the back of the room. Splashtop makes it easier to do it.<br /><br />PRO: control laptops from phone/tablet via internet.<br /><br />CON: Laggy, depending upon internet connection.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this book, I really did not want it to end. Hope there is more coming. Very intriguing.  Could not keep away the romance, mystery, suspense, and unpredictable. Of course the sex. I love how he finally opened up to her, and they so happy with kids and all. You rock E.L. James  Hope you have more to come!!!!!!!
B009XPGJYY|5.0|It was a warm day in December that I watch my very first episode. The kids were playing in the living room with me and I thought, &#34;wow, this show looks good.&#34; The music had my 2 year old dancing. Needless to say, it is not the best show for kids. Therefore, I turned it off and picked up where I left off later that night. I was instantly hooked.<br /><br />This series is easily the best series on Amazon Prime. Perfect for those late nights when the kids are sleeping. Looking for a romantic evening. This show is not a show for most couples, but it is perfect for a romantic evening alone with an ice cold drink of your choosing. Entertained? I think so!!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|Tin Tin was very entertaining!  Kept me interested the whole way through.  Can't wait to see the next Tin Tin!!!
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I liked the Angry Birds very much and I love space stories and etc so I tried Angry Birds In Space and loved it.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Love this series so much!  The only reason I give 4 stars, not 5, is because the acting skills of Elizabeth McGovern and Dan Stevens leave something to be desired, particularly in contrast to all the other cast members.  Jim Carter and Brendan Coyle are especially good, as is the incomparable Maggie Smith.
B004UPANGM|3.0|IT WAS OKAY.  I DIDN'T FIND ANYTHING REALLY SCARY ABOUT THE MOVIE.  BUT I WOULDN'T CALL IT A TIME WASTER
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This an extremely well done series and if given a chance captures the interest of all who watch within the first few minutes.  My 13 year old son came and sat down in the beginning of the show and stayed the whole time even though this is not the type of show he would generally stay for.  Can't wait fora,l the future seasons.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a completely wonderful series.  I am looking at all of them at this time. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I do not like this app.  It simply does not work or I am doing some thing wrong.  If I am opening it wrong, then it is very 'user unfriendly&#34;.  Strange, it worked fine on my Kindle Fire but not on my new Kindle HD.  Any suggestions out there????
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Very easy to stream from my PS3! The playback works well and now I have instant access from anywhere. Love it!
B000P12LWY|4.0|i was glad to see the story unfold in this way, it was very true to the real thing i think.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Such an interesting show.  Like a modern X-Files but at a faster pace and without the paranormal alien stuff.  Walter is so lovable.  All the characters work, even the Dawson's Creek kid.
B001EO748M|4.0|i loved it, everyone was so deceptive, but maybe that was how it really was back then.  To me it was very entertaining.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I like solitaire, just would like a couple of different versions.  This asks if I want a winning hand and on my Kindel if you are not connected to internet, you can't deal a winning hand, though I still win most of the time.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Fun game but $5.00 is too much to pay for the full version. Other than that this game is great and really addictive.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I really like this new album. Josh Groban is such a great vocalist and shows his versatility with the choice of songs on this album.
B00846REIS|5.0|So real with raw human emotion and the struggle for truth. This book has a lot packed into it. If you quit reading before you get to the end you will have cheated yourself. I love how the author took her time letting Gideon and Eva's relationship grow. It makes for a more powerful story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|a great young love story.  recommend it to young and old.  i really enjoyed it! i am 68 years young at heart.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was difficult to keep track of the story lines of so many  characters. The author used too many words to tell not much of a story.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I mean way better than overrated minecraft. The best feature is fly mode. This games where it's at! You need to play it! Very addictive
B001UV4XFG|5.0|All I can say is great...all of the twilight movies are awesome...If you have not seen the twilight series I would definately recommend it to anyone.
B005LW5J9O|1.0|I read this book for my book club and I thought it was a complete waste of time. I can't imagine wasting another two hours at book club discussing it -- but that is what I will do next week. Perhaps others will enlighten me about this book. It would have made a good 3,000 word article.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I am a huge twilight fan the best movie was breaking dawn part 2. All of the twilight movies are just great.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Was a fun and interesting game would recommend to others<br />The hidden object parts were interesting I had fun trying to figure out who was the one who stoked the jewell
B006LSZECO|3.0|Very popular book, but the story/theme doesn't sit well with me.  I found it depressing and wishing I hadn't chosen it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  Even though it was nearly 1000 pages, I still wanted more at the end.  I guess I'll have to wait for the 3rd book in the series
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I'm currently enjoying Series 3 on TV.  This is a wonderful series that I eagerly anticipate watching every Sunday. !!
B009YQJ322|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, the story was very Dredd like.  It took the idea that we already knew Dredd and the addition of a Psycher judge was the new element.  If you like comic movies that don't do the whole origin story this is a good movie.  I still liked a bit of the Stalone flick for covering more of an area since this was mostly a tower fight movie.  I'll watch it again and see what I missed the first time, fun stuff.
B0035XVVDY|4.0|This movie was excellent, however the only reason I took away a star was the fact that they did not show much of any build up in the relationship between his daughter and his wife. Although his anger is justified, the extent of it was a little uninspired.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|great action  Both me and my brother love this show.  We are now in season 2 and we like that too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The temple run 2 app is one of a cind. I love the zip lines and coster parts. Its is such a fun game to have.
B0094K1QR8|3.0|Funny at times, but too much like Grey's Anatomy. Seems like they were trying to copy that TV show. Not very original.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|I know I was already a Josh Groban big fan before I bought it, but even if I wasn't I would have bought it. At first I thought I could just wait for the songs on Spotify but after going to his live concert broadcast and hearing him sing a few of the songs, I just HAD to get the album the next day. I like all songs and favor 8 out of 10.<br /><br />The songs I think reflect mostly on Josh's love-life. He mentioned that in his concert. I feel sad and sorry for people who have to say the words in his songs. I think this album is perfect for after break-ups when you need to find strength to move on. He has 2 Spanish songs and an Italian duet song. Also, an Irish folk song that I think he did very well.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Very good story and actors. I like movies based on true stories. It kept me glued to the tv until the very end.
B005USZML4|1.0|John Grisham has always been a wonderful writer able to elicit a wide range of emotions. He also has great endings for all of his stories. How many times have I finished a book and was left thinking about the poor subject of his books and what had happened to him.  Unfortunately, the tribulations and adventures of a little boy are of no interest to me. He's barely out of diapers and is now sleuthing his way around! Go home and finish growing up! Don't get into trouble and leave me, the reader, out of your little boring schemes!<br />It was my first time reading a 'Theodore Boone' book and I was expecting the action to pick up later on in the book. I thought the little boy would go away sometime in the book but he never did! He was the book!<br />I'm very curious to know how this series has done in the sales departement!!!!
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I was expecting a hidden objects game and this isn't one. Puzzles were good, but so far nothing beats a Big Fish game. Hints were definitely needed and they were hard to follow sometimes.
B009X010RU|3.0|This case from Marware is nice but does not quite measure up to the Mareware MicroShell case I had for my Kindle Fire. The flap on this case seemed a little flimsy compared to the Marware MicroShell case I had for my original Kindle Fire.  Also, I wish that this case had the magnetic closure and on/off feature that some of the other cases for the Kindle Fire HD have.  And lastly, if you have the charger plugged into the Kindle Fire HD and the cover is closed, then you can not open it unless you unplug the charger and vice versa if the the cover is opened. I do love the colors that this case comes in, how light weight it is and how securely the Kindle fits into the case.  Also, the volume buttons and on/off switch are easily acceptable.  I love how the case fits snugly to the Kindle without interfering with the Kindle screen. So all and all, this is a nice case but did not quite meet all the requirements that I was looking for.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|thought provoking....keeps you coming back for more until its solved...great combo of mystery and hidden object play...great graphics....I will be looking forward to part 2
B000683VI4|5.0|It was a very wonderful, touching love story.  I would highly recommend it too bad more relationships couldn't be like theirs.
1884883303|5.0|This is simply the best source of vintage guitar, amp and effect pricing on the market today.  I use it all the time.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a wonderful story. It was very engaging, interesting and thought provoking. Even though I didn't really identify with the main character, I was able to understand why she reacted the way she did. I recommended it to my entire book club.
1616550414|5.0|This Book  any Zelda Fan needs.  If you not bought it yet do so  the art work and the manga are great + it is the timeline also
B0086HGW42|5.0|This is a great album. Absolutely nothing bad to say about plus. If you like \\"The A Team,\\" you will like the entire album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its soooooo much fun and addicting.But I personally think its wayyyyyyy to expensive. You can fly and connect with friends.
B0091W10TS|4.0|Great story line.....love the ending...when Constantine was face to face with Lou...it always gives me the creeps till this very day.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|I really like the overall quality and the HD. Amazon should add close caption or subtitles. The Fringe series are one of my favorite. I would recommend this series to anyone who likes sci-fi or X-Files series.
B005PK56TA|4.0|very scary and well done top actors good stories cant wait to watch season 2 hope its as good or better
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is good because it teaches you how to take care of a horse. This game is awesome. love it.
B00406O7YK|4.0|I love the movie, however it did not stream well at all on my Roku. There were many issues with it stopping for long periods and then restarting. It would eventually restart in slow motion and then return to normal. So obviously viewing the movie was troublesome. I have watched a lot of movies on Amazon on my Roku and have had zero problems with any of them thus far. If you're a Streisand or Walter Mathau fan, you'll enjoy this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love all the new graphics and challenges! they make the game more exciting, and a greater challenge.the rewards are really good as well.
B004H4XI5O|2.0|I did not enjoy this as much as I thought I would.  The title is intriguing, but the book is written more like a college textbook.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It's different than any other game I have played.  It's a challenge and makes you think .  It causes you to problem-solve creatively at times.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Jodie Foster is great in this movie of a Carl Sagan's book with the same name.  This is a must watch movie.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Jesse Cook is the most amazing flamenco guitarist out there. This is a wonderful mix with almost all of the best Jesse Cook songs. You will not regret buying this.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book! No matter what ur situation may be,  we all need to love and be loved. Because of that, we aren't different at all. I highly recommend this book and my plan is to go see the movie real soon.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It is clever, cute, and funny with wonderful characters and a unique story. Everyone I have recommended this book to have loved it as well. You can't go wrong with this story!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is a perfect accompanyment to the Mobil platform...and rivals that of the PC counterparts.  Great graphics and story line propel this title to the top of my list for mobil gamming.  I highly reccomend it!
B001VPJZOK|5.0|This movie is great because it has something for everyone. It's a comedy, murder mystery, love story, and quirky movie all carefully put together like a puzzle. I would definitely recommend this movie to just about anyone.
B00APVC8BI|1.0|Blu-Ray is FAULTY,.. maunfacture defect, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!! Freezes in same spot on both of my players, it also LOCKS up your player to where it can not do anything (manually or remote). If this happens UNPLUG it and plug it back in then eject it.

0307719774|5.0|I bought this journal for myself, my husband, and a friend and we all love it. The book is adorable, well made, and the paper is nice and thick. It is so much fun to answer the thoughtful little questions at the end of each day and I am so excited to see how my answers change throughout the years.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I'll keep it simple.<br /><br />Not for everybody,<br /><br />If you NEED to have a predictable, \\"Hero saves the day\\" or an \\"unexpected, miraculous, intervention\\" type ending, then move on.<br /><br />If you like a flick that sets a solid, creepy, desolate mood, right here, folks.<br /><br />Thought provoking, if you are so inclined...<br /><br />Oh, and bolt action shotguns are not that uncommon.
630282091X|3.0|this tape had audio and visual problems but could still be watched. description made me think it would be better. delivery was good.
B004AQR24W|2.0|I enjoy occasionally watching action films, however, the language wasn't necessary nor the showing of body parts exploding with blood spraying everywhere. This was not a movie I would pay to see or recommend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is really fun, but there are some things I don't like.  With all of the turns in the road, when I first started playing, made me think I was supposed to turn there.  Now, I am used to it.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|I wondered what this movie was like and it was exactly what I expected.  I usually see movies many years after they are released.  This was worth not standing in line for.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|(SALT)  I though it was a great movie. She was great, I would like to know if she did all the stunts herself.<br /><br />I enjoyed all her movies including  &#34;WANTED&#34;.
B005PK56TA|5.0|American Horror Story is one of those shows that you could sit and watch the whole season at once. It's extremely creepy and you'll be on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's a great storyline that hooks you and the acting is great. Highly recommend!
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|In the movie RED Bruce Willis was really good. I also enjoyed all the  die hard movives and waiting for February 14 for the<br />next die hard movie.
0684135051|5.0|Big Help with knitting problems.  My knitting projects always turned out way to big.  This book has showed my the problem.
B000FC13E0|4.0|Michael  Crichton does it again. I know, from writing [...] , that it is one thing to understand a complex topic...it is another to be able to explain it to those unfamiliar with it and do so while weaving a story from it. Bravo!
B002RI9UBS|4.0|- This is a good read, interesting story. I would recommend this book as a good short story. Loved the ending!!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Thet like it a lot.<br />always different and interesting plot lines and likable<br />ckaracters. Just weird enough to be cool.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I love these period piece that give you a glimpse into the well established lives of the wealthy English & there humble, loyal servants. Everything is so prim & proper ( now why can't real life be like this?).
B007IK44CK|5.0|Ever since watching &#34;Mr. Phelps&#34; each week getting an impossible mission accomplished, I've been hooked.  This updated installment of the MI story didn't let me down.  I'd watch it again!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Yes, I loved this version even more than the original show (though I never thought I'd ever say that!). The dramas keep you drawn to it. I think anyone who loves British films would agree.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Ever since the first Transformer movie each installment of this story gets more exciting.  Just when you think you've seen it all, the writers hit another one out of the park.  Great story; love the special effects.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very fun and can be played by all ages.Everyone should play it even adults.But it is not good to play all the time because it can ruin your eye sight.So just please try not to play it that much.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and addictiting I got my whole family playing it,personaly this is way better than temple run two or one
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Special Agent Pendergast  may be in training to &#34;jump the shark&#34; in this latest novel TWO GRAVES.  Somewhat formulaic and often tedious.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Courtney Milan is a great new discovery for me. I started with the Governess Affair - a novella which prequels this one - I've also just read A Kiss for Midwinter which is another novella about one of the secondary characters in this first full length novel of a series of 3. All are set in Victorian England, feature totally original plotlines and are wonderfully written with lots of emotional intensity and great characters. All three stories kept me up late into the night turning the pages and were beautifully paced with some great tension moments and realistic conflicts. This one is about Robert, Duke of Clermont (son of the dastardly Duke in the Governess Affair) who is determined to grow up as unlike his father as he possibly can. He meets Minnie - Minerva - in a rather unorthodox way and becomes fascinated by her. She has reasons for being shy and retiring and has a phobia of crowds but she's smart and kind and reluctantly drawn to Robert who as far as she is concerned it totally beyond her reach. Just over half way through they marry but he's so damaged by his childhood that he finds it very hard to trust their new found happiness. A major issue comes along to challenge them to do with his half brother and they have to return quickly from their honeymoon. A very satisfying, moving and emotional read. Great to find a new(ish) and great author in this genre who is coming up with something different.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was awesome. I couldn't put the book down. It was interesting into what navy seals do for training an the dedication they put into there job.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG its amazing you have to get this game I play this on my kindal fire at night cuse I have homework and so when its time for my bed time its so hard to get ride of my kindal :D
B00A23MVHA|5.0|ted was a very funny movie and i enjoyed it was very hilarious i would recomend the movies to all my friends .
B00APJLX8E|5.0|We are very careful about what we let our kids watch given all the garbage out these days. Loved that this film had really positive values, wasn't compromised with a peppering of inappropriate overt sexual references etc. Highly recommended.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I choose 5 stars because I enjoyed how the book always made things suspenseful and anything could of happened in that book.  I would recommend this book to people who like fiction/ fantasy books.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I chose this rating because I love how good the movie is. I think that it would have been better if they had added a bit more in to the first part of this film, but I still loved it because I have all the twilight movies except Breaking Dawn-Part 2 and hope to get it soon so that i will have them all in my collection of the twilight saga. I would recommond this film to any one who is a huge fan of the twilight series and have read all of the books before seeing the movies (Just kidding the movies are still good even if you don't read the books!!)
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|This movie was good...lots of hope for a couple that seemed hopeless!  Their love was hopeful, but there were a lot of obstacles to overcome.  Just goes to show what can happen if both parties do not communicate and take each other for granted.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|this priduct works like a dream,  would recommend this product 100 percent..try it for yourself you will love it. word
B008C20TDG|4.0|A friend recommended this to me as a cleanse, and I found that the book did a great job explaining the &#34;what&#34; for their recommendations and the &#34;why&#34; behind them.  Kindle version is easy to read, clearly laid out, and has lots of examples to explain their reasons for including or excluding foods from their Whole30 program.  The recipes are basic, easy to prepare, make sense, and also give you a way to then modify for your own tastes.  They even have a forum and links to other recipes on their website to help round out the book's ideas.  Highly recommended!
B000UYJR7I|5.0|The movie surpassed all expectation, Ricci was spictactular in her role, being half naked and chained, through half the movie, did not hurt one bit, lol! Glad I came across it, in prime movies.
B007IK44CK|4.0|It moved quickly and kept my attention, but I'm a romantic and would have liked to see him and wife at end together.
B00A8KJK7G|1.0|I have only left a review one other time for a product I loved!  This time the case is just the opposite!  I hated this movie and so did my kids!  I thought a movie with the Disney name on it would have to be good, I won't let that fool me again!  I should have known better when Tim Burton's name was also attached to it!  You either like his work or you don't!  It was very dark and creepy.  Even once the dog comes back to life, he is in pieces and even swallows a fly that goes down and pops back out one of his stitches!
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|Skyfall the movie did not have that super spy adventure and flow. The movie was about personal problems, not god and country//.  The name comes from his childhood residence???what does that have to do with anything in the whole movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Everyone says that the only reason I watch this is for the Zombies or &#34;walkers&#34; as they are called. This show is so much more than that with a very good story and solid characters. It's not just about the zombies!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|On a scale of 1-10 its a 9, maybe a ten.  One superb soap.  Just watch one and you'll be hooked.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Classic Josh. I do wish there were more foreign language cuts but hte smoot tones of his voice are as rich as ever.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just wanted to see what all the buzz was about and now I'm hooked. On to the next one.
B008N1LL42|4.0|Battleship takes a while to warm up.  At first you're inclined to think it's absolutely horrible judging solely the first 30 minutes which is dominated with WAY too much pointless attempts at humor.  They all fall flat on their face time and time again involving a Naval officer.  The bathroom scene is probably the worst... or how about the burrito/taser gun segment?  These two are EXTREMELY awful, seriously.<br /><br />However, almost out of nowhere (much to my personal satisfaction) suddenly 4-5 spacecrafts appear on radar and... guess where they're heading?  Why of course, planet Earth!  Wouldn't be very fun to have them crash on Venus would it?  Anyway, they blow an explosive hole through the atomsphere upon impact, destroying satellites in the process.  From here... well, what's the name of the movie?  Battleship.  This means several Naval officers are on ships in the middle of the ocean and forced to deal with these invading creatures.  Explosion after explosion, it's nonstop excitement.  Both sides constantly trading attacks back and forth... I was worried even MORE of these spaceships would appear!<br /><br />The aliens themselves aren't portrayed the way we've seen in several other films.  In fact they're drastically 100% different!  They almost resemble monkeys in the face, and aren't nearly as threatening without their spaceships.  That is, when the one Naval officer eventually finds one temporarily down and out and takes his helmet off.  This is when we finally see them.  I always love the suspense here.  What WILL they look like?<br /><br />My favorite segments are the one that show this giant destructive spinning ball made of blades storming off the spaceships and tearing up everything in its path.  This is downright *awesome*.  Why not tear up the little league kid playing ball, though?  Because that would be downright mean!  I couldn't help but compare these spinning balls to the legendary one and only Samus Aran (video game fans know what I'm referring to here, hehe, especially Metroid Prime lovers!)  Of course Samus can't rip things apart in her ball form... oh well.  Comparable enough!<br /><br />My only grip (other than the severely lackluster story-less 30 minutes in the beginning) are all the heavy metal/alternative rock songs.  They sort of diminish the action-packed storytelling and make the alien invasion concept seem significantly less serious.  I mean come ON!  Aliens are invading Earth!  Loud music doesn't really make these scenes any better in my opinion- tacky instead.  The AC/DC music near the end is really unnecessary (despite the song being great of course, because AC/DC is a great band!)  Overall, wonderful movie for science fiction lovers.
B00003CXRM|1.0|If you want to insult your intelligence buy and watch this stupid movie. I found no value in this movie
B009FZHYKU|4.0|So addicted to this show.  Everything about it is great.  I can't miss an episode.  The acting, the writing and special effects are the best.  Makes you want to go out and kill zombies.
B005LAII80|4.0|The movie is good, and looks great on Blu-ray.  It's nice to have both the 2D and 3D versions of the film together on one disc, plus the ultraviolet code, for a decent price.<br /><br />The special features are decent.  I only wish there were a director's commentary--then I might give it five stars.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't get enough of Holder & Sky, great story and characters.  Can't wait for Hopeless is Holder's POV this summer.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|look and feel of the real magazine. fun to read. really liked. loved the collection. the most important is for free
B0098A1TEE|5.0|Deleted Scenes From the Cutting Room Floor.  Love this music.  Heard, &#34;That Man&#34; on an NPR radio story and had to buy the album.  Caro delivers a great retro sound with spice and soul.
B00683JK9K|3.0|I like the puzzles but I have a difficult time picking up the pieces sometimes I have to try 3 or 4 times before I get a piece to move from the side to the puzzle.  I don't know why it's a problem on this game when I don't have that kind of problem on other games.  I got it for free so it will be fun to play until I get bored with it.  I'd like to play the timed puzzles but no way since I have so much trouble picking up pieces.  Since it's free I shouldn't complain.  I wouldn't suggest buying it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|For it's price it cannot be beat! Overall, easily worth the price and the five star rating I gave it. I would also go as far to say this is the best
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like the new game the effects are cool and there are fun new challenges. if u like the first you'll love the second
B00ARAO720|3.0|Ludicrous plot...they wanted something to need to be delivered and they wanted to have it be difficult...but that was the best they could come up with?  Great fun though..bicyclists are awesome. Super good looking cast!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is as good as minecraft Wichita is globing awesome! if you read this review then you should get this app because I don't write reveiws unless the app Is very good. just get the @#%&amp;@#$ app ok!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|The Martian follows the challenges of survival of an astronaut mistakenly left for dead on the surface of Mars. The book details the technical challenges and clever adaptation necessary to survive in an extremely unforgiving environment. It is filled with mission tactics and jargon; much of the narration is in the form of journal entries.<br /><br />Since he is alone, there is no social dynamic, neither does he suffer from psychological difficulties associated with his abandonment or solitude. He is calm and practical throughout most of the book, stoic might be a better description.<br /><br />While technical details and descriptions abound, there is little attempt to bring the reader onto the surface. There is very little in the way of atmosphere, visual descriptions, sensory perception or any of the other experiences that living on Mars would naturally entail. The book reads very much like a journal, it is cold, detached and clinical. It feels small and condensed, like a report which requires nothing but facts and proper accounting and eschews emotional references.<br /><br />The ending is similarly devoid of humanity, focusing more on technical aspects than in real emotion. The characters are there, but none are distinguished enough to be memorable. With so much space devoted to science, acronyms and tech there had to be sacrifices, I just wish they hadn't come at the expense of characters.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|The life proof case does just what it promises at a good price. Got it for my wife and she loves it, especially in pink. Tested it in the sink and it was indeed waterproof. Just in time for a cruise vacation!
B0072OFM28|4.0|I like the story line, but there is a MASSIVE amount of nudity, sex scenes and serious decapitation blood and guts. It is depicted in old Roman days of the gladiators....Man! if these people were really like this...pretty scarry.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing and really fun. I love playing it and feeding my horses. The competitive are really fun to be a part of to.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Blood, Lots of blood and guts!!! lots of nudity and sexual activity.  Based on Rome and the gladiators in its day.  However, due to the explicity of its nature I don't recommend it to friends or family. But good story line.
B001FVV2X2|4.0|The show is very entertaining and intriguing. I find myself watching at least 2-3 episodes in a row and even starting to rewatch some with my children.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Blood, guts, sex and serious nudity...not something I would recommend to anyone...but it does have a good story line.  I wish it were more contained...but that is the nature of this beast.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is one of the smartest and entertaining shows out there!  And it keeps getting better!  Season three is full of non-stop action and suspense. A must see!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a great app. I love that you can set up a whole week of alarms ahead of time and several alarms pet day too!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I have read some Mr. Baldacci books before and this one was a book club members choice, I'm pleased to say that The Innocent is a real page turner novel.  It was a book that I didn't want to put down until I'd read it all.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This is one of my favorite boo-hoo movies, ever.  I've watched it several times and I know it will make me cry but then there will be this very happy ending.  I know exactly what will happen and it still makes me cry (just like Gone with the Wind).  This movie made me a fan of Gerard Butler.  Now I have several of his movies.  I don't think this movie will ever get old for me and it definitely won't wind up at the Goodwill (where all my unwanted movies go).
B001AIRUOU|5.0|This movie's a classic and is a family favorite. Happy to have it in the collection. Great quality. as a lot of great extras. Very pleased.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This seemed to be a low budget movie. The scenes where limited and the special effects where far and few between.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This movie's awesome and is a family favorite (dark I know). Happy to have it in the collection. Great quality. Very pleased.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie was full of fun, action, special effects, and adventure. Enjoyed it very much, was more than I expected.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Tom does a great job keeping you busy in this movie. Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and those scenes on the building were making my stomach roll..
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This movie was awesome and a great sci fiction movie of 2012. I loved this one better then the first Total Recall. The special effects where good, non stop action and adventure. The cast was very good. Kate Beckinsale was one tough chick, and don't forget Jessica Beil she held her own. Colin Farrell was not a disappointed either. Highly recommend this movie for the ultra sci fi fan.
B0036UW09U|5.0|Love the music, besides the award winning song, the rest of it is also good. Great version of the remake classic. Back then Kris was hot!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I don't think there is anything wrong in this game. It is super fun and if works fine. I recommend this game.
0061537969|5.0|Without doubt, the best dog story I've ever read. You will laugh and If you don't cry, your heart is made of stone.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|INTO THE WILD - VERY INTERESTING EVEN WITH A  SAD ENDING YET WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.<br />THIS MOVIE DEFINITELY HELD MY ATTENTION!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the patriotic theme , and the aliens are cool too fitting right in with the call to freedom ideals . Good pacing .
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book was a very interesting account of a doctor's experience with near death experience.  While this is not actual prood of the existence of heaven, it certainly provides one with a lot to think about.
1594745692|4.0|This is my first tarot deck. I picked it because I loved the illustrations that were shown on amazon. I'm very content with the size, thickness and durability of the cards and the box is extremely cute. The illustrations on the preview for the cards are all excellent however, some of the minor arkana are a bit too obviously photoshopped and pieced together. The booklet is decent, listing just enough about each card to get an idea of what it means and there are a few different reading types that it describes for you.<br /><br />My main complaint about this deck is that it doesn't tell you how to read. It just says shuffle and lay them out in such and such order. No cutting the deck? Upside down cards mean nothing different? I wish there was a more in depth booklet. Sure, you can find everything online, but it's sort of a pain. For 12 dollars I'm happy. They say you should find a deck that speaks to you and this one did it for me. I'd say buy it, but be prepared to do some googling.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Enjoyed it alot.  Had not seen it in the theater and am glad I saw it here! You wouldn't be sorry if you check it out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|British television at it's finest. Delve into the lives of a 19th century ever changing aristocratic family and the people who serve them.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I found the book well written. The story was unusual with unexpected twists. I would be interested in reading other books by Erin Morgenstern
0823095223|5.0|Although the techniques and materials are aimed at the collectible figurine and action figure market, they all apply to military miniatures and other small scale projects.<br /><br />As a purchaser of other titles, it is safe to say that no other title comes close to the depth of this one. While the author is Tim Buckner, Tim has collected the opinions and experiences of other established sculptors. The section on possible modeling materials is worth the price of the book, alone.<br /><br />There are several chapters, which will guide a would-be designer from the drawing board to casting and painting a finished figure. There are many, many photographs and illustrations. I cannot recommend this title more highly.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I liked meeting Jack Reacher. He's a bad-ass and kicks much butt. I will read more soon in the future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love  this game it's fun and enjoyable and even my lil sister loves to play it all the time!!!!!
B001NHNG64|3.0|This is in 3rd person POV unlike the first Jack Reacher novel. It didn't feel like a worthy follow up to the Jack  Reacher standard. Lot of better books to choose from.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the different graphics, the new features.  We like Temple Run, but this adds some variety and few a new twists.
0375413405|5.0|What can a person say about Julia Child that hasn't already been said.  Love this cook book and have cooked some things from it.  I can just hear her voice while I am reading the receipes.  Good fast shipping, and shipping was reasonable.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Great band, Awesome songs. Great variety of tempos and themes. Definitely an album worth sharing. You should buy it and tell your friends.
076780421X|4.0|This was a good romantic comedy. Matthew Perry is great and Salma Hayek is perfect as the girlfriend/wife. Together they keep you amused for the entire movie.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|I accidentally rented the SD version. For $1 extra it's worth the upgrade. Now if u don't have a HDTV it would be  a waste of a dollar.
B0081HLM2E|5.0|\\"Headhunters\\" is one of the more fascinating action movies that I've watched in a long time. There are abundant plot twists that I didn't see coming, even though I knew that there were so many cautionary signs for the main character that he couldn't be as smart as he thought himself. I was yelling at the screen, \\"How many red flags do you need?\\" But don't let this stop you from watching the movie through to the end; you'll want to see what happens to this 5'6\\" art thief.<br /><br />There are a couple of gory parts in the movie: I actually had to make fun of one scene because it bothered me so much and yet was utterly absurd (the tractor was involved). Those gory parts were (mostly) crucial to the plot/ending. I hate subtitled movies, but this one captured my interest from the beginning (it's from Norway). P.S. I actually rented this from my local library!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|But I find that Downtown Abbey is beginning to look a lot like a well made soap opera. My husband loves it though.
B00AA7V2Z0|4.0|I had nightmares but I could not stop watching it. Each episode leaves you wanting more and more. D. S.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I choose this book because I love Kate Morton s novels.  I have read them all.  I very much enjoyed this one.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|We thought we would try a new movie when my grandson came to visit. This was definitely a good choice. That little boy could not stop laughing, except for a few short scenes. It was definitely a good pick.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Go to your main apps screen. Long press the \\"TuneIn Radio (Pro)\\" icon. Touch \\"Remove from Device\\". After confirming and removing the app, go to the Kindle Fire App Store (upper right where it says \\"Store\\") type into the white header on top \\"TuneIn Radio Pro\\" After the app fully comes up, touch the \\"Install\\" button. This should work to install the V6.8. It worked for me. I got this tip from the TuneIn website. Good luck.
B00190KZUU|5.0|Just a good movie all around. Different than most and you are really not sure until the end about how true the stories are.
B008XKT9FG|4.0|I like Helen Hunt and she is great in this movie.  It was an interesting story with an interesting setting.<br />I loved the story and the suspense filled ending.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love love love this book. Go read it!!<br />Couldn't keep my eyes out of it for sure a good book!
0316228532|2.0|I really wanted to love this book as I have heard so many people knock it and felt that this was just sour grapes and not wanting Ms Rowling to have a success outwith Harry Potter.  Sadly, it seems, the detractors have a valid point.<br /><br />The basic concept of the story regarding the fighting going on around the vacancy in the local council was very solid and could have made for a very funny farce.  Or if she had concentrated on the SocioEconomic element of the Weedon family and The Fields estate, then it would have been a more serious and interesting story.  It felt like she had these two separate ideas for a novel and merged them together into one, so doing neither story justice in the telling.<br /><br />It took me a couple of hundred pages just to get to know which character was which as there were too many introduced all at once.  I didn't feel like I actually got to know (or indeed care) very well for any of the characters, which detracted from any enjoyment I could have had from this book.<br /><br />It ended up being about 200 pages too long for me which, I believe, was caused by my point above of it actually being two separate novels merged into one.<br /><br />I still gave it 2 out of 5 points as the author is, without a doubt, a talented author and has great ideas for stories but this one just did not give me much enjoyment and I would not recommend to anyone to waste their time reading it.  There are just too many good books out there that will provide a lot more enjoyment to a reader.
B006MW3V6U|3.0|while watching sometimes the download freezes and you need to restart episode.  very frustrating.  otherwise when playing without any freezing good quality.
B004FS27JK|5.0|Whitney's music will live on forever, her tragic end brought tears to my eyes and an empty feeling in my heart. The cd's were perfect and all of my favorite songs by Whitney were on it. Whitney...I will always love you.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Love playing this game.  Just wish I could get past the second level.  Highly recommend this challenging game for anyone.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is just a great show! Great acting, great writing, great stories, great sets. I can't wait for more in the new season!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is da bomb it's super awesome now I can play chess anywhere in the world that I want
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|This app is great for taking notes in class, and just writing in general. I only gave it a four star review because it can't convert handwriting to text, but I think the ten dollar version does. Also it glitches and won't let me input handwriting if I go to another app before closing a text box. It is easily fixed by exiting that notebook and reopening it, but it's a pain anyway. Otherwise, I use it all the time, and find it really useful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is cool! And I it's lots of fun! I always play it, mainly in school. :p but I keeps me busy when I'm bored. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Another Gillian Flynn Book I could not put down. She has a way of making you think of every possibility and yet still manages to surprise!!!!!<br /><br />As sick as this may sound, there are certain authors, that I hope won't die before they write MANY more books (Stephen King for example).  I find myself looking forward to more from Gillian and thinking the same thing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I am amazed by this book. It has made me laugh, cry, feel angry, and grow stronger. This book is truly inspiring and I love it! Wonder is a book about being strong and lifting your head up high. August learns to accept him self, and goes through a lot of mayhem on the way. It reminds me of my life. I love  it and it makes me strong.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]<br /><br />The three top films of 2012 were the Avengers, Skyfall and The Dark Knight Rises. All three were written and directed by men born post-baby boom, so called Generation X. Existential angst and uncertainty are central to the main characters and in many ways the generational experience. As much fun as Roger Moore's Bond was, a fifty year old man lusting after 20 year old women and winking at the camera wouldn't fly today. Likewise the narcissism and preening of baby boomer Pierce Brosnan (who I also liked).<br />At any rate, it's a great movie. Can't recommend it highly enough.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I have been reading him as long as he has been writing and, as always, look forward to his next work. This book is current with what is going on in the world today and captures it very well. A great read!
B007REV4YI|2.0|This review is for the movie, not the DVD/BLU RAY - but this movie was so lackluster it hurts.  Plot holes so thin a train could drive through it; a character so tortured that it's unbearable to watch; and a \\"have to get to it ending\\" so contrived that it musses up pacing.  Why critics adore this movie is beyond me.  The entire story revolves around/requires James Bond to act counter to every incarnation of James Bond so as to make this movie, in my opinion, the worst of the lot.  He has a licesene to kill...not a license to talk - and for a reason.  The Bond from Casino Royale was awesome...much better than this \\"Home Alone\\" Bond who doesn't shoot a bad guy on a ladder when he has the perfect shot and, instead, waits for a train to barrow through.  Awful.  And I'm more irritated at the critics who gave this thing such high praise.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I think it is a great game!  Very similar to Mario Bros game!<br /><br />I don't like the parts of the game that u can't stop!
B00942G4UA|3.0|Movie itself was great and would get four stars. However, the streaming quality was poor, even in low definitiion. Lots or pixilation due to low quality bandwidth? Maybe it's my end but other movies in HD play fine. Amazon Prime is quick, easy and the search feature works great.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This was acute movie. I wanted to watch something light and fun and this fit the bill. Harrison Ford was good in it.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I'm a huge Bourne fan and this was hard to follow and not quite as smart as the other Bourne movies.
B008Y6WPXC|1.0|The title of this movie says it all -- this movie is expendable. Don't waste your time watching it. I like action movies, but this is about as bad as it get.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Our book club loved it.  we had a wonderful discussion and many wanted to read other of Gillian Flynn's books.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Excellent in so many ways: acting, character development, cinematography, historical detail. The story line is occasionally a little far fetched, but every episode leaves one hankering for more. The series even got my husband, who rarely watches TV and almost never dramas, completely hooked.
B0085OELXK|2.0|With such an incredible cast, we thought: we can't lose watching this. Plus we'd heard so many good things. And really, the movie itself was pretty good. But the ending is just so lame...this film ends up being a total letdown.
0425252868|3.0|I don't think I've ever read a book that was so different first half vs. second half. I found the writing in the first half of the book to be tedious to read,with a writing style I can only describe as sterile, plodding, and uninvolving.  I almost gave up on the book.<br /><br /> But then the second half of the book - when the American flyers expereince's first comes into the picture - is 180 degrees opposite.  The writing style is emotional, fluid, and involving.<br /><br />How to explain this?  I can't.  Maybe there were multiple authors contributing?  Maybe there was much less information available about the German protagonist's experience - which is the subject of the first half of the book.  I don't know.<br /><br />But it almost seems like the book had two different authors, one for each half.<br /><br />Having said that I am very glad I stuck it out and got through the first half, because the second half of the book is one of the more moving and compelling WWII air war books I have read, and I've read a lot of them.<br /><br />The fact that both the German and American pilots survived the war, and the story of what happens later in their lives (don't want to spoil it for you here), is really an incredible and moving story and I do highly recommend the book.<br /><br />Just be prepared to wade through a somewhat tedious and uninvolving first half.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Rick Riordan creates yet another beautifully crafted book. It's perfectly written, you can picture it in your mind. Amazingly awesome.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|One of my greatest reads of last year, full of humanity and humour, of love of the various characters. A must!
B0035S996U|4.0|The quality is not quite blue ray quality, but still very good. However it is more convenient than ripping a BD and storing it a media server. What a classic film. Warriors come out to play!
B009XPGJYY|5.0|This show always has something crazy going on and keeps you interested and entertained.  Hard to believe it is on F/X.
B00821OX98|3.0|Show is okay characters are not rememberable. Aliens are unique they are not the usual two arms two legs. Thank you and good night
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I laughed. I cried. I laughed some more. I'm pretty sure some type of liquid came out of my nose at some point.  You can't go wrong with MacFarlane and Wahlberg. I think this will be the best love story of our time...
B00000IZOR|5.0|I had bought this since it was one that was around the house when I was a child. Our 4 year old granddaughter recently came to our house and played and played and played with this so I left it out. THEN our other granddaughters came, ages 2 and 3 and they also played with it. I recommend it even if it no longer represents the telephones of today it can be a tool to show children how things used to be. Is cute and the eyes move up and down as you pull it along.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is great for those who feel Glee is a little over the top. It's hysterical, though I was a little sad that the hilarious parts were already shown in all the previews. Even so, you'll want to watch it more than once!
B003TTKB5I|5.0|I love grey's anatomy its a great show that no one wouldn't want to miss you really be glued to the t.v. always waiting to see what's coming next.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app daily.  It works great.  Always buy mostly the same groceries?  Make a list and add a check box to the items you need.  I also use it as a to do list.  The syncing is flawless.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Oh, how I miss Tennant! Most of his other works don't make it &#34;across the pond&#34;, so his fans don't get to see enough of him! We all agree that Hollywood is STUPID to not give him a series or star him in a film over here, but what can you do?<br />His final season as The Doctor was quite brilliant and I, personally, loved Donna! Finally a character who didn't have a crush on him and could go toe to toe with him! (Don't get me wrong, the love story with Rose, was AWESOME, but after that he needed a buddy!) She's brash, and witty, and won't let his ego get too big! She's tough, and smart, and sometimes even a wee bit sexy. The Vashta Nerada are introduced in this season, and I hope hope hope that they are brought back again someday... they are wonderfully frightening!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy this game because its fast paced and addicting, a perfect way to kill time on the go
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Silence will fall when the question is asked...<br />This is a season that definitely MUST be viewed in it's entirety! The storyline that follows the Doctor, Amy, Rory, and River Song through the entire season is EXCELLENT and should NOT be missed. The Silence are the scariest foe since the Weeping Angels, and in my book are THE absolute scariest creature the Doctor has EVER faced! Thanks again, Moffet, for giving us even more reasons to get creeped out by simply walking around town! &#34;Did that statue just move?&#34; &#34;Maybe, but would you remember it if it did?&#34; &#34;HEY!, Count those shadows!&#34; &#34;Wait, are you feeling a bit sick?&#34;
B0044C5SCU|5.0|A brilliant way of not only extending the series, but keeping it interesting and preventing the storyline from going stale. Fewer random/non-consequential episodes this series, so you're mostly watching what actually matters!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Matt Smith had a LOT to live up to! The Doctor is such an icon, even here in the U.S., that anyone who takes on the role, better be up to the challenge and Smith did a great job! I can't say that I don't miss Tennant, He's MUCH better looking and energetic, but Matt Smith surprised me with his portrayal of the Doctor. He reminds me a bit of Tennant, but even more of Tom Baker (kinda goofy and bumbling, but in an intelligent, boyish way). He is definitely his own character, however, and by the end of the season, I was holding my breath to see how the Doctor fixed it all!
B007M45PMU|4.0|This was a nice album. I especially am a fan on &#34; Classy Girls&#34;. According to this song, I am NOT a classy girl. Ho Hum.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|One of the greatest writers of all time, it's not like you can be disappointed in a classic! The Kindle edition is tough to read on my little Droid phone, but it was good to have it to use for a research paper I was writing. Once I transferred it to my PC it was easy to quote passages, search for info, etc.
B008K7RGA2|4.0|Well sung.  An excellent rendition of Puccini''s opera.  I have discovered that if an opera has people who sing well the music will usually carry the thing.  Big name performers aren't really necessary.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I've played Angry Birds on other devices so I thought this one for the PC would be fun... It's too slow to really be able to get into, it's just frustrating. Maybe the program needs a rewrite, or the ads are too script-heavy or whatever, but it just didn't live up to expectations.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun to play when you have free<br /> time.it's  cool how the places change from New York city and Rio.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|It's a decent app which will let you read kindle books on your droid. The droid is awfully small to read on, however, so it's not great to use to read for fun. Not bad for info for classes and quick reference.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really enjoy this show. glad that Prime has season 2 for streaming. great show. well written and casted . .
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Good character development, interesting story about the difficulties of life for the poor in a poor country.  Of course, another  indictment of the Catholic church.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Great music.  Easy to download.  Watched him on American Idol and this CD doesnt dissapoint.  Great music from a nother georgia boy
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Hands down the best bond movie ever made. Daniel Craig IS the best bond. The movie was amazing. I'd watch it anytime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever my favorite one is the Rio edition it has all these trees and the cute little. My favoite thing on that game to is the trans those are Kewl.I have so much fun playing this game and if u get it I hope u do to your welcome.
B005K17RU0|5.0|really like the options. good program to have. would recommend for anyone wanting instant access to weather. I especially like that you can save multiple cities.
B008FWHUQM|3.0|The movie moves at a good pace. Nothing spectacular, if you have other movies considering to watch I would recommend you do so.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like the setup and the fact that you can watch videos of<br />some news articles. Me gusta mucho el &#34;app&#34; lo recomiendo.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is awesome I mean who would rate this app a 1 star this game is great there is baby animals armor food zombies and other monsters and it's basically a guy named steave trying to survive I think its great.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Well written and suspenseful. I could hardly put it down..<br /><br />You can always depend on Michael Connelly for an excellent and enterntaining read'.
0743297334|4.0|Ernest Hemingway's novel \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", about a scattered group of American expatriates living in Paris who travel to Spain, is a book that manages to deal with deep issues in a way that is subtle but unfortunately also frustratingly slow.  The novel is short; at only 251 pages, it can be read in a few hours (although you'll want to read it slowly, since Hemingway packs so much into each short, declarative sentence).  Despite it's length, reading the book is like alternating between running through mud and running on pavement.  Sometime the prose is captivating, but at other times it is frustrating to deal with such annoying characters. How can Robert Cohn be so spineless? Why can't Brett Ashley understand that she's leading these men on? What is Jake trying to get out of pursuing Brett?<br /><br />What I ended up enjoying most about the book, and contemplating for some time after, were the same things that annoyed me when reading.  The characters are flawed, annoying, constantly giving in to emotion and self-indulgence, but these things make them real. I can compare them to people in my own life; I can imagine how these people actually are.  Hemingway is able to successfully convey how these people are because he omits so much. If he described their appearances and antics with too much detail, they would become difficult to relate to, but by keeping them somewhat mysterious, like a new acquaintance, they become easier to understand and fit into what I know.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot comment on how \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" compares to his other works. What I can say is that this work is possibly Hemingway's most well-known work about his time in Paris in the 1920's and many people recommended that I start with it. Hemingway's understanding of people and character is enthralling and makes the book a worthwhile read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was a can't put down book for me. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed The Hunger Games!
0385366752|3.0|I read this on the recommendation of a friend.  Unfortunately, I found this book &#34;interesting&#34;  but, disappointingly  predictable.  I found myself constantly guessing what would happen 20 pages before it did.  Not a very sophisticated read, more of a beach book (which I'm not a fan of).
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I like this game a lot....helps me pass the time, not too overly complicated but I'm okay with that as it keeps me enthralled into the gamplay.  Would recommend.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this film.  Of course with the acting group assembled here how could you lose.  I particularly enjoyed how the characters evolved during the course of the film.  I don't write reviews that give away the story so please get this one and have an enjoyable evening.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I like this game a lot....helps me pass the time, not too overly complicated but I'm okay with that as it keeps me enthralled into the gamplay.  Would recommend.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everybody should get this because it is sssoooooo fun and i never played the computer version so i dont know what the pocket edition is missing so i think it is one of the beat games ever!
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Awesome show! Great on going story with twists and excellent hanger at the end if every episode making you want to watch the next one right away.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It should have been rated GS for Great and Stupid!  No reason to say too much more or else I would just be trying to impress myself and that is really what douche bags are all about and I don't want to be one.  Enjoy the movie!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|It  was funny for me.I loved the book it was amazing.Jeff Kinney is awesome and I think you should read it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book made me cry and laugh at the same time. It really made me feel like I was there. Read this book!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is as really fun game, and my only complaint would be that it takes a long time to get energy and gems.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've always got a book/kindle in my hand and it takes a lot for me to impressed enough to write a review.  This book is great.  It kept me interested from cover to cover.  I highly recommend.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game.  Typical of this genre, good time filler.  Only irritating thing is having to navigate from scene so often and for almost every clue.  Graphics are good.
B00B21HCFW|3.0|The film was a little overlong but brilliant.Lately we have had to endure three  films that  had  a running time of almost 3 hours (LINCOLN;LES MISERABLES and THE HOBBIT)- WHY?. With such a huge budget  why did Peter Jackson film the  finale fight scene  in the day time with  a dark filter covering the lens? This 'day for night'photography completely  ruined the  film for me. Seeing  blue sky on a sunny ,partly cloudy  day and  the action taking place at night was  unacceptable.I would have given the film  a  much higher rating if I didn't have to endure this  cheap way of having night scenes filmed in the middle of the day. Please explain,Mr Jackson?It has put me off from seeing the  next 2  films in the series
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book.  Easy read.  Romantic and full of suspense.  Didn't expect the ending at all!  Worth the time to read.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was one of the best books that Grisham wrote, it keep you interested all through. it was hard to put down
B004TI5N38|4.0|I loved this book! The characters were great! Puller is a great lead! Can't wait for the next book! Hope it's as hood as this one!
B002SJ8FH6|5.0|While the story does not follow closely the mystery thriller written by John Buchan, it is a success in its on right.  I love the black and white film and now the nostalgic time period.  The stark beautiful scenery of Scotland adds to the tension and mystery of the story.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria got me through high school, and again through grad school when my partner bought me the DVD.  My only complaint is that since they couldn't get the rights to all the songs used during the original airings of the episodes, those have been replaced by nondescript made-for-the-DVD music.  For me, it loses a little something without the original songs, but I still love the show.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Great game! Easy to play<br />I think they need to get rid of the gems and make things easier to buy
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a good game for horse lover's, my nieces love playing this game. I would recommend this game for all age groups.
B002R5HR70|5.0|We like the actors of course, we like this movie a lot. Beautiful voice, good suspense. We will recommend this movie, thank you.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|I wish they would come up with a new one. This and SG1 are very good series. I hope soon.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Loved it in theaters and no exception at home.<br /><br />Great action and character(monkey development) or should i say ape? Anyways never really saw the original stuff but this was a good movie by itself! Great visual fx and Andy Circus plays wonderfully in his cgi ape character.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love this game. it helps keep your mind off of the daily grind.  easy for anyone to play.  wish they offered more free hints.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|Love the boxing, didn't own any of the Alien movies but with Prometheus and all thought i should get this. Wasn't disappointed, again, love the boxing there's some pretty pictures and some nice descriptive text. The box is formatted like a book, neat design.<br /><br />Movie quality is fine, looked sharp on bluray.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The box arrive a little battered but its ok. Just plastic. The content is great and well the songs are magnificent
B008CLI3TE|5.0|Wasn't sure if I'd like this so I'll touch on some things I was thinking before i bought this.<br /><br />Level of fantasy elements: Good fantasy world for the characters, more of a medieval environment.<br />Action: Good fighting/duels in a few episodes, not really any epic battles between armies.<br /><br />It was good I will say that! Loved the characters which is more than you can say for a lot of movies today.<br />And looks amazing on bluray.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use this app daily, I can upload pictures straight from my Kindle to Facebook, and pretty much do anything from my Kindle with this app that I could do on the computer. No complaints!
B004EARTN8|1.0|Don't like movies that are confined to one place. Kept losing interest and couldn't keep watching to the end.<br /><br />Gave up.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I've always loved mahjong. It's fun, requires some serious thinking, and has lots of different levels & tiles. One of my favorite games to play on my Kindle Fire HD!
B0012HEB32|5.0|Ok, maybe not five star but four and a half rounded up.  Some of the great suspense of the movies with a little annoying character development.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved solitaire. It's fun, passes the time, and looks just like computer solitaire! You cab change the type of deal, background, and card picture.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Remember Dong Li from the Chinese Emporium in the first Mysteryville? Well, he makes a cameo is this one! That is probably the most exciting thing about this game. It's exactly like all the other Nevosoft hidden object games. Each chapter has a lot of dialogue, then you find objects by name and/or silhouette, and in some chapters you find the differences. There is a zoom, and a few mini games, puzzles and other tasks, but not many. You DON'T have to log into Facebook or Twitter to play the game, there is an \\"X\\" in the right top corner, click it, and the game continues.<br />Overall, this is an easy straightforward game that doesn't require too much brain power. Also, it doesn't crash at chapter 13, I played the entire game with no problems on first generation kindle fire.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like how good the graphics are &amp; it's fun, too! There are lots of different tasks to care for your horse and lots of levels to conquer.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is hard to find a good story, excellent acting & production without a lot of glitz.  This is it
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am definitely addicted to pinterest. There are tons of recipes, DIY projects, ideas for children, ideas for the home, etc. the app works great on my Kindle Fire HD, I'm on it every day!
B0095P33IW|5.0|This is one of the first movies I watched in HD and it was incredible.  Very good transfer and streamed flawlessly.
B007YJ8ZRK|5.0|I watch Chronicle on cable last night but missed about 35 minutes.What I saw throughout was belevible.The camera shaking was a little bit too much but it was full of the unthinkable things happening.The friends had powers but did not use them right and one of them totally went overboard in anger and took it out on everbody and everything in his path.It is like the bullied student in school want it to stop and got really pissed off and fed up with everything.His father did not treat him right and his mother was dying from cancer.That is enough depression there to go off the deep end! The camera movements in viewing the scenes remind you of Clover Field.That was a shaky and dizzy camera view of scenes in the movie to cause an headache!I wish they make part 2 of that movie.Great movie as for Chronicle.The begining should have an warning of,\\" do not try this at home.\\"
B004UNX1LS|5.0|This app is the best app if you love music videos!  it's always up to date with the latest premieres!
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Just finished listening to this whole cd while I ran on the treadmill. Love it! If you're a fan, this one is a must have.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook so having it right at my fingertips is perfect.  it makes it easier to keep up with friends and family.
B0040GR01M|4.0|I'm not a fan of 3 Days Grace as their music is almost as overplayed as Nickel Back. However, for the price, I figured I'd give them a chance. Overall, is a good solid rock CD.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game because it makes you challenge yourself to get better and faster each time you play by timing you.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I'm not a big fan of Muse, however, for the price, I figured I'd give them a chance. Overall, is a good solid rock CD.
B008XG1X18|5.0|once you join in pinterest, it will b  hard to stop.  this website is extremely addicting and you'll find yourself wasting hours of the day.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series, well acted, well filmed.  All together a wonderful show to watch.  I was so glad I found the second season on Amazon, since netflix wasn't offering it.  Wait to go Amazon!!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter and having it close to me.  it's so easy to use and it's a lot better than Facebook.
0765325950|5.0|Its been a month since I bought this book and I have probably read it and reread it four or five times already.... As the curtain draws to a close the stage is set and the actors come out to play their parts to perfection. Thank You
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game!  it's so addicting! you can't stop playing once you start and It always keeps you guessing.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I enjoyed this film. good story line and good special affects. Others will enjoy if like science fiction films and horror films
B009VA1FN6|3.0|I bought the book because of the period and the country it was set in - as I remember those times and England was my home.<br />However, I didn't particularly enjoy the style of writing nor it it draw me in to want to read it all in one or two sittings as all really good books do. I thought the characters could have been rounded out a little more with more descriptive characterisations.  I liked the plot and the story line and certainly towards the end as the mystery unravels (which was a surprise) I enjoyed it more.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|cute film, not for childern. good acting, mark wahlbery still hot after all these years. would recommend to adult friends..
B000ICXQXI|5.0|Fantastic film and fantastic viewing experience from Amazon. Not only is it a great classic but also a great psychological thriller.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The MacGyver of space, non-stop action. Lots of detail. Interesting storyline. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction.
B007N31ZS8|5.0|This was a gift for my husband. He of course loves westerns and really loves Clint Eastwood!! This movie was a little different, but very entertaining!! I very much enjoyed watching it again! Good movie!!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This is one of the most amazing live videos I have ever seen! Highly recommended for symphonic rock/metal fans. Kamelot live show from 2006 in Oslo.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I haven't had the need to use this very much yet, but it sure be fine, I do love the big keyboard and the Calculator since I'm getting older and having to wear glasses more often
B00683JK9K|5.0|i love puzzles and enjoy this myself. it is fun to play with the kids. we get to challenge each other.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Love the Angry Birds Games...It's easy and lots of fun,  I have approx three different Angry Birds on my Kindle and the girls at work love to play it during lunch
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Why is this book so perf?<br />I love errrrrrthangg tbh! Best series of a book ever! Especially this specific part
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A great read...his story is being used to change lives. I read it in response to a man who read it and realised what was missing in his life - a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|We loved the movie, had  seen the play years ago.  The sound track is exceptional and pleased to have purchased it.  The delivery service and handling of the order by Amazon was our first experience and we are glad to have done it.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|This is a really good Bond movie.  Love Adele's theme song.  The ending left it open for another movie in the franchise.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I absolutely love this game I cannot honestly put it down!! Best graphics on the Kindle Fire cool game overall!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is an Excellent wireless headset with a good battery life (approximately 7 hours on a single charge of full 7.1 audio).<br /><br />They sound great and the range is awesome, I had them on 15 meters away going through 2 concrete walls and they worked fine.<br /><br />They do suffer from a little crackling occasionally, and I'm not sure of the cause, as it doesn't seem to coincide with low battery or any specific interference, but it is minimal and easily ignored.<br /><br />Sound quality is excellent on 7.1 or stereo, and the voice digitizer is hilarious.<br /><br />You may have some problems with software if you have other logitech devices installed. If so you will need to download the latest logitech controller software and not bother with the driver disc provided, as it will just overwrite any existing logitech controller software.<br /><br />Overall really good headset, and well worth the money paid.
B00004YRQA|5.0|i love my new memory card i havent gotten a currupted data on it yet and i can save all my data from every game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|JOHN GRISHAM IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS.  I LOVED THE BOOK.  HIS BOOKS ALWAYS KEEP MY ATTENTION BUT I USUALY READ THE LAST CHAPTER  IN THE MIDDLE BECAUSE I CANT WAIT TO KNOW THE END.
B005QUQP76|5.0|The placement of all buttons on mouse are placed very well for my hand, which is quite an average size. Depending on how you hold the mouse, this may prevent immediate access to certain buttons, but overall buttons do a good job staying away from being accidentally pressed. This mouse compliments my Corsair MM400 mat well, and have been satisfied since they both arrived. I would recommend this mouse to a FPS gamer, and a general computer user due to comfort and ease of use.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|This is a great movie. If you like strange movies this is the one for you. The bunny is creepy.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Likeable characters, John Noble who plays Walter Bishop, is a hoot!  If nothing else, focus on him.  Be sure to watch each episode of each season. Plot twists can be confusing if you don't pay attention.
B004AFFZNI|5.0|I got this to run the gopro in the truck. It is open so i can hook up the usb power cable in the truck.
B008XKT9FG|5.0|A Good Woman is superior to most movies being made today.  The dialogue is clever and funny, the cinematography is beautiful and the cast is appealing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandson Jacob is 8. He says it\\"s awesome. It\\"a lot of fun to play and he recommends it to all kids.
B004AQR24W|4.0|Basic plot but great action sequences. His good guys /bad guys are likable and suitably cast. Great rainy day viewing.
B009186JYI|5.0|Riots, Mick & Keith writing Sitting on a Fence, Mick & Keith drunk. What more could a Stones fan ask for? Essential viewing for any Stones fan.
B0045XICB2|5.0|It came very fast and was in wonderful condition and was in perfect playing condition as well. couldn't be happier.
0811875555|5.0|I'm a Tangled fan, so I may be biased, but I loved the art that went into this movie. Everything from the detailed to the free gesture sketches- everything looked as though as it fit together and showed the development process that made this movie what it is today. Sadly I had to give this book away as a Christmas present, and almost didn't because I loved it so much, but gave it to her anyway because she loves Tangled even more than me, but this will definitely be on my desk again soon!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|No unnecessary, gratuitous violence.  Excellent acting.  Incredibly beautiful sets and costumes.  What more can you ask for!  I loved it.
1423151054|5.0|It's so awesome to see the animation process frame by frame without any other components around it. It also shows the acting ability and draftsmanship each animator possessed and it is just mind-boggling to flip through the stack of pages that is only maybe one second on screen, but to see of all of the work that went into each drawing. Each book just proves why these men are praised in the field of animation and definitely recommend for any animation or Disney lover.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|My husband is an avid Sci Fi fan and really enjoys this series.  I enjoy it as well.  Wish we'd started watching from the beginning.
0240810961|5.0|Most drawing books I've found are structured and tell you how to draw this and how to draw that and just pretty much lays it out to you to get it to look like the picture in the book. Not very creative in my opinion. This one, however, is different. Good different. These are notes by Walt Stanchfield, who taught drawing classes to some of the great animators of today such as Glen Keane, Joe Ranft, Andreas Deja, and Eric Goldberg. In this volume he emphasizes the gesture drawing and capturing the essence of the  action. This book is meant for animators who need to think in motion, but can be very helpful for any artist who wants to make their drawing more than &#34;just a drawing&#34;. (He uses that phrase a lot). Most of this book is reading material with drawing illustrations to stress the point, but the reading is so fast and almost conversational in a way because he uses humor, drama, stories from his life, and stories from his drawing classes. I always end up smiling in each chapter and even sometimes laughing out loud at some of the things he says. I recommend having a pen or highlighter with you when reading each chapter because he says some pretty enlightening things that hit me like &#34;why did I not think about that in a drawing before?&#34; So whether you be an inspiring animator, such as my self, or just want to better your art, I highly recommend both volumes to really bring your art to life!
B009K86D86|5.0|There are so many ways to review this movie. At the end of the day, it's the most educational, eye opening film I've seen in forever. It has changed the way my family looks at food and has prepared us for a healthier future. THANK YOU to the makers of this movie!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love the new graphics but I don't like the new mine section. The 3d is awesome! I wish I had a cheat sheet for the powerups too. They look different. All in all a great game.
B000F8O35U|5.0|A great classic!  Fun for the whole family. We have been waiting for a long time to see this movie and it was worth the buy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is awesome. its great for kids and audults. my dad and brother and me love to play it. it keeps us busy for a bit.its addicting! I give this 5 *****'s up!

B00A8ECU24|5.0|(this app was rated by a brony.) MY LITTLE PONY is great! nice 3d graphics! there's one problem. when I tried to sign up to gameloft's social network and says my email is invalid. it's probably a bug, but my email has periods (.) in it. is that a problem? please respond, gameloft.<br />  -unknown
B007EECSFA|5.0|What a ride.  Kate Morton is such a great writer.  It was even better than the forgotten garden. I highly recommend this book to anyone
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Started watching this in season 3. Went back to catch up on the past episodes and found this available on Prime. Very nice!
B005T87QCI|5.0|hey for the people complaining that atom and zeus aint there........LOOK AT THE STORE CUZ THEY GOT ATOM AND ZEUS AND THREE OTHERS FOR 3.99 IF U BUY THEM IN THE PACK AND THEY EVEN GOT TWIN CITIES!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|not as good as all the hype. good actors, but story not good. and slow in places. sad that it wasnt better.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|G luck. As we. Isaacs assesses gruff though uh huh Hugh Kirkuk though thigh Cardiff gagged Kirkuk hubbub assesses gagged
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|good story re-told with more action. loved the twists and special effects. good actors. hard to follow in just one place.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin is an excellent historian and the book takes you thru the lives of not only Lincoln but members of his cabinet.  The writing fills in the lives and therefore thoughts of these men --excellent writing and good read
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game I wish that you could earn coins or something to earn upgrades and earn swords faster. I just also have on my ipod touch.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though this book is labeled as Young Adult I would highly recommend it to anyone.  It's not your typical teen love story because John Green brings a great deal of wisdom and insight to his characters.  Hazel and Gus are not the usual flat character you tend to see in a lot of YA fiction.  They are well developed and easy to imagine.  This book drew me in and wouldn't let me go; I finished it at 3 am after I started reading around 7 pm the night before.  I am putting it on my shelf for now, but I will definitely be returning to it sometime soon.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A thought provoking story that reminded me to appreciate what I have in the moment. Well written with rich characters.
0062202081|5.0|This was a awesome book and I love Justin bieber and It was inspiring and if you read it,it touches your heart
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is probably the best book I have ever read. He really knows how to connect with people. Best book ever.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|Unlike the recent Fame reboot, this remake provides solid retelling of the town where dancing has been banned.  The story and characters mirror the original pretty faithfully, and the actors cast, although they harbor similarities to the actors we remember, has found a way to own their roles. I didn't think I'd enjoy the movie as much as I did. Try it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A fun read.  Another Vince Flynn book that is hard to put down.  Waiting for future adventures of Mitch and friends.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|It's a classic and wonderful but like all novels of it's time it is very lengthy.I would recommend it highly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Get it<br />it's awesome I play it every day you can never get bored of it so get it peeps / people later
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I ordered this series because my husband started watching season 1 and he could not watch them fast enough! He loved it

B0032UYFA6|5.0|I purchased this because my husband started watching this series and he couldn't watch them fast enough! He loved it!
0307719774|5.0|I just got it, but I really like this book!  It has good questions, that aren't always thought-provoking, like &#34;WHat are three things you need to buy?&#34;  But I definitely am looking forward to reading this a couple years from now, and seeing how my answers change.
B008Y6SLL2|1.0|I've tried to watch MIssion Impossible and Margin Call using the Amazon Prime service. In both cases the film hung up the system after just a few minutes. This is not a high speed streaming system.  It delivers clogs and frustration.<br /><br />I watch netflicks, hulu, and dozen others using my roku system. Only Amazon Prime fails to deliver.<br /><br />I thought we'd be getting a huge selection of films and tv shows as well. Not so. Just a few with the option to purchase others.<br /><br />I just don't use Amazon Prime video anymore. Why pay to be frustrated?  (BTW I have a very high speed internet connection, way beyond a typical home user.)
B00935KWWO|5.0|Easily the best Twitter app in the Amazon app store. Easy to create multiple streams and lists, quick to update and with lots of other great features including colored tweets. My Twitter app of choice on kindle and smartphone, especially now TweetDeck hast forsaken us.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I loved matched so much because it was easy to read and i loved the story line.When i started reading crossed it was kind of cute but like twenty percent through it ,it is cassia is trying to find ky by running away  and ky ran away and is trying to find cassia and it gets so boring i gave up on it
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Love this cd.  Great song selection.  Listen to it often.  Downloaded right into itunes and I can listen to it on my computer whenever I want
B00B0NF4L6|5.0|Ok, seriously I thought punk was dead after it was sucked back into the system, but Fidlar made me believe there might still exist people, musicians and artists who are true and unique. They have serious sound, so you better listen to them!!!<br />*FIDLAR*
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm over seventy years old and found Hunger Games an exciting read.  The author did a great job of selling the plot and characters.  I'm sorry to say, her next two books did not accomplish the same.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|You will be happy for a week after you watch this film. A remarkable filmmaker meets a remarkable subject - magic.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I read the book, followed the instructions and got my books on kindle.  I had troble placing an image in the first book, but that wa probably my fault, since it worked in the second.  All in all, well written.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Still watching the series. I have enjoyed it to date. Looking forward to watching all the episodes. I enjoy English and Irish videos.
B0088P2A7A|4.0|Nice app. Does everything [...]does, and does it well. Pages look good, almost the same as web site, and you can change the font size/view pictures in larger form.    Only annoyance is you may only view one page at a time, which isn't a problem using the kindle browser.    Overall a great app, would recommend.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|I was thrilled to find this movie and it is very good quality. It was also a fair priced dvd. It came in a timely manner to my door and I was impressed!
B004WGIXX4|5.0|easy to watch and enjoy! not too predictable. I would watch it again. Hightly recommended if you need something simple to enjoy!
0316228532|4.0|I love the feel of the book jacket. It was a good book, though plenty of foul language on every page. Not for prudes, that's for sure. Interesting how it all pulls together in the end.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This gets 5 stars every time.  We have watched all episodes around 3 times each in the last 12 months.  Allons-Y
B009G8GRX6|4.0|This album contains a lot of songs that aren't Muse's usual type of music, but I do find them very entertaining. There are maybe a couple that didn't sit well with me, but overall the album was powerful and fun to listen to.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun and time consuming but worth it! Very easy to play for hours upon hours! Cute animals and love having the characters from the movies!
B009JTCBLE|5.0|Fantastic new music from old veterans. Jason Bonham does his father proud as the drum playing is excellent!<br /><br />I have all three of their studio albums. All are great. Each one better than the previous. This is the third.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|It's got the &#34;Indiana Jones &#34; feel,  in a perfectly rendered digital movie<br />Steven Spielberg, you absolutely rock sir !
B00913DPW2|5.0|This is a classic, point and click adventure game.  The puzzles range from a) easy if you are paying attention, through b) tough to figure out, but fun once you do, right up to c) puzzles that are so annoying and tedious to finish, even once you get the idea, that you will quite happily use the \\"skip\\" button.  By the way, for people who said they could not skip puzzles -- go to the main menu and select that option in Settings.  But, by all means, give the puzzles a try before you take the nuclear option.  The story line is good, but not too convoluted to follow.<br /><br />I didn't think I would like the jigsaw puzzle feature, but actually I had a good time fitting together all the pieces.  I waited until I had all but one piece (never did find it) and it took quite a while -- BUT - even though I was missing a piece, the items I needed were \\"unlocked\\" and available for me to finish the game.  I finished the game without ever finding that last piece of the jigsaw.  Other than the jigsaw, the \\"hint\\" moths, and coins for the jokey fortune teller machine, there were no hidden objects.  You don't need to bother with the moths or the coins to finish the game.  There were no arcade sequences.<br /><br />There are hints available in the game, by using the moths you find here and there.  These might be enough to get you on the right path.  If not there is a complete walk-through available on the net.  The game occasionally froze on the living room scene, but it was only necessary to go to the main menu, and then select \\"continue game\\" from the options.  This unfroze things and allowed you to move on through.  Otherwise, there were no technical problems on my Kindle Fire 2nd Generation.
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|I gave this movie a top rating because of Cher's stupendous performance - she's incredible.  The audio quality, however, is at times poor.
B002JXICCY|5.0|It's led zeppelin.  Enough said. One of the best live videos ever.  Watching jimmy page's fingers fly a cross the fretboard is simply amazing.
013168728X|5.0|I bought this book for a class last quarter. It is very well-written and serves as the seminal text in the digital processing world.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I ordered this movie not really knowing a great deal about it, but it is a fun movie and arrived in good condition.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I recommend that anyone who had struggled with their weight to read this book.  Reading this book has opened my eyes and it makes so much sense ! What do you mean calories in calories out is bot the way to lose weight? I can eat red meat and bacon ? Fat is not bad for me ? It's like we have been lied to our whole life.  I am currently cutting my carbs and sugar to see what happens.  I do feel much better since eating so much wheat especially and my mind is clearer.  I also changed my breakfasts from oatmeal with fruit to eggs and sausage.  Guess what I'm way less hungry ! Read it and judge for yourself.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Along with SGU, this is one of the best shows ever. They need to start up the Stargate series again with SGU.
B00821OX98|3.0|If it weren't for the frequent, and slow, bufferings, I would give this one a five. I don't have those buffering issues with Netflix.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I had read the previous 2 novels and # 3 certainly did not disappoint.  The hero is very nicely drawn, and the &#34;heroine&#34; is absolutely outstanding as a unique character portrayal!  I was deflated finishing the 3rd vol. because I was aware there was no 4th!  Wish Larsson were still alive and writing (or maybe even continuing the saga!)
B004K00NMG|5.0|Have always loved this animated classic, and now with it in bluray, it was even better. The animation looks amazing and it's such a great story.<br /><br />Also, the special features are great if you want to see how it was made. Really great stuff.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was not familiar with either O.S. Card nor with the &#34;Ender&#34; Series.  The novel sufficiently intrigued me that I will probably seek out additional volumes in the series.  Very readable!
B001R0O9K4|5.0|Great film - Liam Neeson is brilliant!<br />It covers the failed 1916 rising and the callous way the British shoot the signatories to the declaration of Independence - even James Connolly who is dying of his wounds.<br />The film didn't cover the treaty negotiations in London in any detail - I guess that's the subject of another film but if you are interested Frank Pakenham (Lord Longford) wrote the bible on the negotiations and the book is well worth a read.<br />The film covered the the tragedy of the civil war and the death of Collins.<br />Enjoy!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading Mile 81.  Fast paced, great characters and very entertaining.  Stephen King is by far my favorite Author.
B00000JNNY|5.0|My Etta James collection wouldn't be complete without this CD. And of course the track 'At Last' is huge, was huge and always will be huge.
0141345659|5.0|Came in almost perfect condition, a tint fold in the back but that didn't matter! Came promptly and I can't wait to read it!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Purchased it mostly for the alarm feature. Works great. Only have to set it one time and forget it. Am thinking of upgrading. Numbers are big and bright.
B005AERS74|5.0|I always like anything from Maroon 5. I used free MP3 credit from Amazon to order this album. These songs transferred easily into my iTunes library.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|First off, I have to complement the developers of this app. Their customer service is amazing. They recognized my earlier complaints, and fixed them so I would be pleased. Thank you very much, and kudos to you guys. I am very impressed. Read the comments of this review if you want to know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />Now, to review the app, it is much better than before. Originally, you had to click ads and complete tasks like signing up for credit card websites in order to earn enough in-app currency to unlock the video feature. After my complaint that I felt I was still being conned by the only free camera app available for Kindle Fire HD, the developers put in more work (they built this app from the ground up as opposed to writing three lines of code to open the Kindle's camera, which in my opinion should just come with the device like EVERY OTHER DEVICE IN EXISTENCE) to improve the app.<br /><br />Now, the video mode is unlocked out of the box, but it takes 10 units of in-app currency (camcoins) per use. So if you don't click any ads to complete tasks, you get 15 videos (the app comes with 150 camcoins). However, if you download Coin Dozer (for free) and level up to 4, which admittedly can be a little tedious but wirth it, you get enough camcoins to unlock the unlimited video. I much prefer 400 camcoins to the previous 1000 camcoins. Thus, since the app is free and unlocking the video function is free, this makes it THE BEST camera app for Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />Once again, thanks and kudos to the developers.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It's not perfect in that characters seem to be in the line up and then in another episode with no explaination as to where they go. Some of the episodes flow nicely together, but other one are completely isolated.
B007SGM084|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is a great read....i foind it to be a very captivating & eye opening sensual story line!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Lee Child maintains your interest from the beginning to end with new surprises in this high intensity action packed novel.  Hard to stop reading but easy to pick up where you left off and jump right back into the characters and the story.<br /><br />Very good reading if you like action packed stories.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Like the actors and the stories from this show. The way they work to learn about the bad guy and that it helps them get them in the end.
B0019GO5DC|5.0|some kind of wonderful was a fun movie about the young Tom boy falling in love with her best friend him not knowing that she was in love with him, while he was in love with this young high schooler,Amanda Jones, instead. Some kind of wonderful was the highlight of the eighties movies.ah young love! :-)[[ASIN:B000068QMB Some Kind of Wonderful]]
B0000549B0|5.0|Love the story. Like all of the movies with James Stewart that I have seen. He does a great job of making you beleave there really is a rabbit next to him.
B003Y5H574|5.0|I love Crazy Stupid Love specially the part with Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's characters.Steve Carell and Julianne Morris  were also great as the parental love story. also loved the dirty dancing scene with Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. :-)
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I actually like the original Judge Dredd movie but this one is amazing. Completely unpredictable. If your like me you did not want to see it because you thought it was going to be a horrible remake. Its not. It's got far more detail to a much simpler story than the Stallone version. Just put it this way, this is the first product I've ever written a review for and I've been shopping on amazon for 10 years. Something compelled me to do it. I want the world to feel the joy I have right now. I want to get it on Blu-ray and I'm going to google if they are going to make a sequel. Don't let the feeling of seeing someone else in the Dredd mask shake you. Just sit back and enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I feel the casting is superb along with scenography being on spot. Must watch all seasons to get full impact and understand plot lines. One of the best written scripts on tv.
B007J2TMQ0|4.0|Antony Beevor writes vividly and with unexpected insights about this apocalyptic war. Always a jaw-dropping period to read about. He doesn't dissapoint.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I am a big fan of Joss Wedon. His ability to create deep and lovable characters is on full display in Firefly. The only bad thing about this show is that it wasn't given a fair chance from the network which led to its cancelation.
0545265355|5.0|This is a nice set of high quality books. I am a Bookbinder and am always checking book quality. Great price and value. I highly recommend this set.
B009RH973I|5.0|Very useful with the strap that enables you to hold it to eye level.<br /><br />Text changes when you switch from right to left hand.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|One of the best books I ever read. It is clear the author understands her subject and is an expert, yet also a master story teller. It is shocking, the scenes leaves the reader afraid and devastated; yet for the first time I gained insight into women's predicament when trapped in an abusive relationship. The emotional breakdown is terrifying, the outcome unbelievably tense. A masterpiece.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Heart raising in a lot of the scenes.  Could not  put the book down.  One of the best I have read.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|As with everything Dave Grohl does, this movie is AWESOME! Tells a great story that involves some of the greatest musicians in rock and roll. I can't wait to get the soundtrack.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is fun and challenging, if you don't get the best score on a level you can repeat it until you do.
0786891416|5.0|If you watch the show Castle you will love the books! I am obsessed with the show and now the books!
0765325950|5.0|Written in the true spririt of Robert Jordan.  Absolutely amazing.  Started reading the series umpteen years ago, sometimes got a little impatient for the next one but well worth the wait!  Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game and i love it. I found it on my friends phone and it works great on my kindle fire.
B008I34ZFW|4.0|This movie starts by planting tongue firmly in cheek, then strides boldly forward into satire. The Evil Ones have been creating the Fourth Reich from their stronghold on the dark side of the moon, and are about to launch their attack on Earth. All they need is a few cell phones or an iPad, and their war machines will take flight ...<br /><br />Once you adapt to the transparent silliness of it all (complete with evil scientist), the satire shines through brilliantly. President Palin and her closest advisors quickly see the value of being a war-time president, so welcome the chance of a worthy foe - or a stirring orator, if you can get the Nationalist Socialists on your side, either way works. If you want an outsider's view of American politics, I'm not sure it gets any better.<br /><br />But, for all its self-conscious cheesiness, production values are surprisingly high. Computer animation of space sequences equals the best around, props and sets approach a comic kind of steampunk in their bold anachronism, and the background music features allusions German opera, national anthems, and probably lots more that I was laughing too hard to pick out. The well-informed movie fan will see tribute to many classics as well, not least [[ASIN:B000P407K4 Dr. Strangelove]].<br /><br />Simple descriptions don't do justice to this complex comedy - just see it and see for yourself.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0036JU6CY|5.0|I am not normally squemish but I will admit that the shock value in this most graphic tale was close to over the top...not that I am complaining.  After a week filled with responsibility and pressure...well watching someone have there head split in two with a sword is diverting.  It plot was fast paced, graphic and the hero inspired my afection.  what more can you ask for in a film made purely for entertainment?
B00000J2PH|5.0|I had asked for this CD for Christmas but didn't get it.  I'm at a season in my life where I want to revisit the era of music that reminds me of my youth.  This was one of my favorite albums (yes we had it in vinyl) and all the songs bring back fond memories.  Thank you for having it in stock and delivering it so quickly.
B003RV43X4|4.0|The film made you pull for the hero and despite worry that he was in danger and the ever present chance that things would not end well...there was not enough doubt to break the escapist mood the film engendered.  A nice ride.  If you haven't seen it take a look.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Great read...perfect blend of baseball and business!  I would definitely recommend this book to the avid baseball fan and anyone looking to get a better understanding of the business side of the game.
B0093ST02E|1.0|We could not get into it. So found another movie to watch. The story line did not catch us and did not move us.
B0091REZMW|4.0|entertaining!!! I love the game, hard to understand at first then u get into it. I needed a game like this.
1592402038|5.0|Eats, Shoots and Leaves, arrived earlier than expected and in excellent condition.  I bought it used and was expecting the usual highlighting and notes in the book, but there were no markings at all!  The book itself was in great condition and the actual content in the book is wonderful!  The writing is humorous, witty and well-written; the author made grammar interesting and fun...not an easy task.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|This is the best film I've seen in a long time; and the special feature after with the real players in this thriller were so interesting. Thank God for the Canadians who so bravely helped these hostages escape.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. It was refreshing to find something well written and easy to get lost in. I would recommend this book to anyone!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|A little more challenging than the other &#34;birds&#34; games.  Still fun to play.  I like the background and the different obstilcles.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Though I love Downton Abbey, I have to say that I only gave this four stars because, at times, the quality of the video was somewhat pixelated. I don't usually have that problem viewing video on the device I watched it on, so I know it was not my device. Had this not been an issue for me, I would have gladly given it 5 stars.
B008D19WBQ|2.0|The show has a lot of deleted scenes in it. Definitely not worth buying. I need to find one that is not chopped up.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story is great. In every words it written you can see and feel it in your nerves...Very romantic & suspense. I love it.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It's definitely provocative, but far too sexual for my taste.  It is worth a read, but don't expect too much.
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|Good flick, believable plot, lots of old guys having fun kicking but, if you like the typical Stallone flick you will like this one
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Is there anything bad one can say about our beloved Downton Abbey?? Except that maybe there needs to be more episodes in each season!!!! And, by the by, what IS a weekend? Currently in the midst of Season 3, I am positively DREADING the nearing of the last episode for this year!! I am a diehard fan of all Masterpiece Theatre Classics, and this is absolutely the best one ever done, in my humble and totally unbiased opinion.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|We liked it. A bit of a nighttime soap but very enjoyable. Great characters and settings. We'll watch 3rd season for sure.
1250006341|5.0|This book came out after Season 1, and has since been updated, I believe. However, I loved it, and as a Downton Abbey enthusiast (to say the least!!), I really enjoyed it! Filled with lots of nuggets and great photos.
B007THA4FI|1.0|How can I like it when I never recieved the book. It never down loaded to my Kendle, thank you.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|It worked perfectly and it had no scratches.  The movie was great and was exiting. It was better than the first one. It came really fast. I'd give this item a 10 star if I could.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Watching a nice suspense thriller after quite some time. Would suggest to try this out if you are looking for one.
B008PZYZH6|5.0|'Saraha' is a fun mix that includes action, humor, romance, a trip into an archaeological mystery, covert missions, and a dab of environmental pollution vs plague. From Texas to the Middle East and from the Confederacy to modern military conflicts?  Matthew McConaughey fan? This is a 'must' for your collection!  [Didn't realize that the 'instant video' version was included with the DVD. Saved to Amazon cloud . . . smooth streaming and crisp audio for this terrific cast!]
B00571F26Y|5.0|Amazing info, great resources all cited. On is diet now, stay tuned. Highly recommend you try the diet. Great book
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is the third time I have played this game.  It is fun and keeps you on your toes.  If you enjoy hidden object game this is a must.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It's a soap opera for grow ups with an appreciation for good acting.  Starting with the sinking of the Titanic, Downton Abbey allows the viewer to live inside the lives of the servants and family of a great British estate.  Maggie Smith is priceless as the Dowager Countess of Grantham. She's hard as nails with an often surprising soft side.  It's addicting. I watched the first two seasons in a little over a week. It's great television.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is probably the most stable game I have purchased. It has beautiful graphics, fun and challenging. Best match 3 game out there.  Highly recommend!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this to replace a cheaper cooler that made my whole system sound like a small jet attempting to take off in my office. When I took the cooler out of the box I was a little nervous that it would actually be too tall to fit in my standard ATX case. I had to to take off the plastic funnel on the wall of the case which is intended to help direct cool air to the CPU. I also had to pull the motherboard so I could install the bracket on the other side so the Cooler would mount securely. I couldn't access the other side of the motherboard without disconnecting everything and pulling it. Thermal paste came with the CPU, which was a nice surprise. Total install took under 30 minutes, and the results were impressive. The temps were significantly lower, the chassis fans were not required to run at a high speed, and the whole unit was quiet and smooth. This is the cooler I should have bought in the first place!
B004LE7PCM|5.0|Those are amongst the tales you've read a dozen times and still enjoy at the utmost with a renewed pleasure. Great Kindle edition, all the collection seems to be there. Great job, and great purchase.
0345803485|5.0|This book is a fabulous read. I loved every aspect of it. I couldn't put it down.  Romance, meets sass, meets S&M.... LOVE IT!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is way more then awesome and I just think you guys need to know that. When I play this game I get addicted to it and keep at what you do!love it
0345803507|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I devoured it. It's one I will read over and over again. A MUST buy.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A very engaging easy read interweaving spirituality, self-actualisation and relationship issues.  A very good choice for a book club discussion
0345803493|5.0|If you love romance with a hint of sass you must read this and then read it again. I couldn't put it down. I will recommend this to everyone.
B004X4QVSO|5.0|This is a great martial art story about the legendary IP Man.  Great action thanks to Donnie Yen who himself is a master of martial art.  Enjoyed it a lot and watched it several times already.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I loved this game until it started glitching out and all my worlds got all messed up... everything disappeared and I couldn't play Multiplayer... if it didn't do that this review would've been five stars...
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I have always loved messing with my pictures and this app makes it simple and fun! I would most definitely recommend this app to everyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great read for all ages! Highly recommend the series so far...excited to read the final book in the trilogy
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|If you are seeking a game whereby you are challenged to sharpen your motor skills.  Download this game.  it will definately keep you hooked and motivate you to increase your speed.
B009E3EYS8|4.0|This was a gift for my husband and he loved it. The dvd quality is great and the extra bonus of a cd was awesome.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Horror stories often involve the supernatural or the extra-ordinary. Often times the only mundane subjects in such stories are the principal characters, generally mortal men and women bereft in a world that once made perfect sense. But what if the world never made sense? What if the horror itself was mundane and the result of a sometimes banal landscape? Charles Bukowski's Ham on Rye is as semi-autobiographical as his other novels except this one deals primarily with his coming-of-age. The horror to which I spoke of earlier in the paragraph is growing up feeling like the world has something against you, which is the general sense one gets reading this novel.<br /><br />To read the rest of this review and others, please visit the King's Crier: Book Reviews blog.
B004GJDQT8|3.0|It works right after download and never again. it must need frequent updates, but i don't have mine set to automatic.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game it has lots of adventure and my favorite is either the  Zip Line or the Mine
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This works grate but doesn't really keep track of actually how many hrs<br />Battery life  but it does tell good results
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Love this show! Great Sci-Fi, Great Casting, Great storyline, Humorous. JJ Abrams best TV show. A show that gets better with each episode.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a calculator. It has large buttons. It was free. 4/5 stars. Eight more words required to complete this review.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I consider the best because I never heard his songs before.<br />I like it because it the songs about love and emotion and facial ness<br />My Friends and coworks
B005JE7XW0|5.0|This movie took me by surprise. Extremely funny but very gory. I have watched it four times and still love it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|my husband and son play this quite often, they love the science behind it. i play it to pass time but all in all its fun
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Is for fun. A person can play this game without feeling like they have to spend a ton of money to get anywhere.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I always enjoy Denzel Washington's acting.  He brings a veracity and humanity to his roles that few actors can achieve, and it's these talents that allow the viewer to see Captain Whip's struggles with empathy.  A great movie!
0671646788|5.0|Well I'm a motivational speaker and writer.This book came in handy.Very good indeed.My kind of thinking.Is very much satisfied.would recommend it.
B0037NVM2C|5.0|One of my all-time favorite movies, a powerfully told story of the dangers of human hubris.  Linda Hamilton's performance is brilliant.  Plus, it's the one role where Arnold's utter lack of acting talent contributes to the story!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watch these again to see what I missed in U.S. version. Much more in episode 1. But, not a noticable difference in other epsodes.<br />Great show, Great cast.  Maggie Smith makes it even better.
B006BQM762|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my family. The kids love it so much that wanted to watch it again.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Very creative and interesting story that is wonderfully portrayed by great actors.  Well directed.  Saw it first at the show by myself, because when I described the plot to my family they just weren't interested.  That being said, I made them watch it with me around Christmastime, and everybody loved it, most notably my 2 sons, who are 13 and 17.  &#34;OK, mom, you were right.&#34;; I never get tired of hearing that!  Like most of Wes Anderson's works, the characters are quirky. This particular plot makes you really root for the good guys, which includes both children and adults.
B008FPZQRO|5.0|After 40 years they actually improve on the new mix of this incredible classic progressive rock CD abd add some new cuts for old fans ... perfectly classic
B001BANK32|4.0|Always a good read. Watched the film recently and was able to compare it. Always the book is more enjoyable
B007THA4FI|3.0|I can not say I dislike the book BUT its  only about the 6th chapter and I am still not involved. There are quite a few characters and I almost feel like  i need to make a character map. At this point I don't get anything from the book, no excitement and no reason to write it. Perhaps this will change if I get any further but I really don't have a desire to pick it up at this point.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is AWESOME:)!!! It is so much fun;)!!!!!!!<br />If I were u I would definitely get this game:)!!<br />AWESOME!!!
B004DHUAZQ|3.0|Has all the action stars, cheesy dialogue , and pretty good violence. Wish Arnold and Bruce were in it more though.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Love it!!! I hope they keep creating more games like temple run. I liked the first one, one but, this one is like, New and improved!! One thing is that you can't use the help me more than twice or it will shut down. I still love it!!
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Very quick and informative read.  If you're new to business, have years of experience or starting your own company you should be able to pick up a few tidbits of usable advice from Rework.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is still one of the best games ever!!!!  I love this game so much!!!!  The first time I played I was !!!!
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I don't use twitter a whole lot, and only use this app for a few people I follow.  The user interface on it is really easy to get used to, and it moves sharp with only a little lag.  A good way to check twitter while on the go.  One problem I seem to have is after it refreshes, sometimes it won't show the most recent tweets, but if I go on the web version all the tweets are there.  Don't know if this is user error or something with the mobile app.  Still a great app if you can't wait to go on twitter.
1439170916|5.0|Looking forward to more books by Dr. Mukherjee. The information in this book may surprise some people and I believe we should all become more informed about cancer.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is super fun and addicting, and it's free!  What more could you ask for?  You can earn coins for powerups, extra characters, and earn achievements to brag to your friends.  Not bad for something you didn't pay for.
1400052181|5.0|Since I told my doctor I was interested in the topic of cancer he suggested three books for me to read and this was one of them. I had no idea that her cancer cells are still growing and being used in research. Amazing!
B001GA1RFA|5.0|I discovered John Green back a few years ago when I reak &#34;Looking for Alaska.&#34;  An Abundance of Katherines is the best novel I've read from Green so far.  Great characterizations...wonderful plot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting premise with unexpected plot twists. Hard to put down. Should be good for book club discussion. Good book to gift.
B005K17RU0|1.0|clunky,<br />unwieldy,<br />difficult to use.<br />Uninstalled.<br />I would not recommend installing this app it is not worth the amount of memory you will use.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it!!! Can't wait to start the next one and see what happens next!!!  So much better than the movie, by far!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My daughter absolutely loves this series by Rick Riordan. She awaited anxiously for months for this book's release. She has dyslexia and as a parent I am delighted how the author has used the series to point out many of the positive side effects of dyslexia and ADD
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I generally do not watch TV (exceptions being Top Gear UK and Breaking Bad), but I AM HOOKED on The Walking Dead. Season One was good; you get the back story and learn the main characters, Season Two was too much drama, but Season Three completely knocked it out of the park. I am now on a mission to get other people to watch this series. Love it.
B000002KFJ|4.0|I got this album after Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and while this album was their masterpiece, Sabotage is still pretty good.  It's standout tracks are Hole in the Sky and Symptom of the Universe. The last four tracks on the cd don't sound like Sabbath, but this album is the last good one they made with Ozzy.
0739352962|5.0|My husband is always in his car. this was the perfect gift for him. he is not a big reader so he loved it
B004J09ONG|4.0|I like animals especially big cats. This movie is a good one if you are interested in knowing about lions even though it is old movie.
B007NZQU72|4.0|This is a great book, I read it in one sitting. If youre looking for hard science on affectation, look elsewhere because it's pretty much one psychologist's speculation on nervous system function with no hard evidence to support it. But I enjoy speculation so I found it fun. The only beef I have with it is the author's comments on religion and spirituality. She made it seem that atheism or secularism are extroverted or undersensitive, I find it to be the opposite. I think HSPs may be more sensitive to stimuli just below the level of clear perception, but that doesnt mean those stimuli are supernatural or religious in nature. The labeling of phenomena that arent fully understood as supernatural/spiritual is silly and base, not sensitive.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Julia rocks in this movie. It is really funny!<br /><br />Julia rocks in this movie. It is really funny!<br /><br />Julia rocks in this movie. It is really funny!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is just like temple run but, better. I love this game.<br />And it is really fun. when you get to 400 coins,  the game gets faster.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This book not only tries to get at the heart of what it takes to succeed, but it gives a lot of entry points for a variety of readers.  Even though the chapters on grit, curiousity, and character are wonderful, I found the chapter on the chess team to be the most useful for me.  Thinking ahead as well as reflecting on the past decisions really helps with continuous improvement and validating our own sense of success.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Not the most gripping story.  Frankly I found it quite dull.  Well made - well acted - well over length. Come on.  A functioning drunk pulls it out and makes an impossible landing.  Then for two hours we establish he's a drunk.  Then at the last minute he sprouts a conscience.  Lame.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|It is a great game. It is lots of fun playing especially if you are into flying and combat. Great sound effects.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I went through 4 other headsets until I got these, They are keepers ,great sound quality, no other noise in background and i have them right next to modem and router. Very comfortable. Great price at 199.00 recomend to everyone
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book was interesting all through, but the &#34;twist&#34; that happened near the end when Katie read the letter Alex gave her was such a shock.  Although I suspected something was going on with Jo, I did not expect that.<br /><br />Can't wait to see the movie.
0765325950|5.0|Great ending to a series that I've been reading since my childhood. Even considering where he was left with and the number of sidebars he had to bring to an end, Brandon Sanderson did a great job of tying everything off and giving us a satisfying ending- although it begs for more stories now!
B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|not  a great story  but they took a person who can carry off an action movie and make it believable.. easily one of the best hidden gems of the last year  looking forward to seeing her again  to my mind the only  woman whome you could believe as  a tough no nonesence take  no prisoners  type
B006Z21ZJC|5.0|Excellent concert, I recommend this to every Iron Maiden fan!!!.... the song selection is great and worth it, despite the age, they still got it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great in depth look into the lives of our elite fighting team, Devgru. It was fascinating to read how well planned the attack on Bin Laden was, and how amazing our Intel is. This group of men are true heroes. It's refreshing to read about young men who sacrifice their loves for our country, especially since the media has seem to forgotten about our troops. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great day of reading and enlightenment.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have to admit when my husband wanted to start watching TWD i had no interest at all, however since the first episode i have been hooked. I love all the actors and story plots every episode has you on the edge of your seat.. And it just keeps getting better! I would defiantly recommend this series to everyone!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games ive ever played and I hope there are more like it. Great game!!!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I love this show. It's funny, interesting, exciting, entertaining, and the cast is fantastic. Highly recommend it to everyone who likes fantasy.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|BEST APP EVER don't listen to any bad reviews.There wrong such a fun game get app totally worth time if hello kitty fan like MM!
B004LROMQG|5.0|I love this show. It's funny, interesting, exciting and very very entertaining. Highly recommend it to everyone who likes fantasy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is one of my top (3) games this is one of the best games since temple run.! I hope ya'll come out with a part two and new characters and features like temple run 2 did! I'm looking forward to it!
B001LF347E|5.0|I love this show. It is funny, interesting, exciting and very very entertaining. The cast is fantastic and I highly recommend it
0375507256|3.0|My title here says it all for me. I wanted a stronger book. The stories bored me even as I appreciated their interconnective branches and roots into the next stories. It is a great idea. I just wish it had been better written.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a cool game but there is no armer and herobrine killed me and put a bloody H in my house... but other than that I am happy with this game ;-)
B005K17RU0|5.0|Good app for the have had good luck with it so far.  Like this app. Like this app good app
B00A81MV3U|4.0|Not expecting a romcom, but it is not a typical romcom.  Dealing with the intricacies of mental illness, loss and new love, I would recommend this movie to all.  Great acting.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book started off a bit slow, but picked up quickly, adding some interesting twists. I found it harder and harder to put down as I got towards the end. In addition  to a good story, the book sprinkles commentary about the American Justice System throughout, so not only is it fun, but it can get you thinking.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great show, good amount of action and mystery. some comedy, and lots of wit. Great actors too - just wish there were more episodes
B0012VP8MQ|4.0|Most sequels are not as good as the original and this one is no different. If you were a fan of the original (which I was) then you will enjoy the Murphy and Nolte replay. Same banter, same fights, same shoot em up. Nice mindless entertainment.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great show, good amount of action and mystery. some comedy, and lots of wit. Great actors too - just wish there were more episodes
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The only problem we have with this movie is that the events surrounding its presentation in Colorado overshadow our enjoyment of the movie. We say a prayer for the victims before watching the movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I spend hours playing this game on my Kindle.  It is better than the one on my computer.  I am hoping this brain exercise proves helpful in avoiding altzheimers
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Amazon Prime Video is the way to go. No more plastic boxes with DVDs in them to clutter a bookcase or a table top. The movie can be accessed from anywhere, anytime I want to see it. Works on my computer, HDTV, and IPad. The movie looks great and sounds good too.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|Once you run a calibration, you'll have excellent estimates of your remaining battery life. I appreciate the ease of use and accuracy of this application. Much better than relying on the OS report.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|At first I wasn't too keen on watching this series but my wife wanted to see it.  Turns out it is really interesting.
B004J4XGN6|5.0|Eric Ries articulately explains common sense business principles that every entrepreneur must know and apply.  I love this book so much that I purchased copies for my entire team.
B0076DELIG|3.0|This plot felt too contrived. I did not like this one as much as many of the other Bosch novels
B00AMBH70S|3.0|It wasn't as good as the previous Legacy's because the plot was scattered. It didn't flow as a story too well. It was just lots of action and thrill without the depth. But I thought the main actor's acting was good.
B00AF6B22E|3.0|First of all, the opening frontal nude scene was definitely not necessary.  &#34;Whip&#34; being a womanizer could have been portrayed without salacious nude scenes.<br /><br />The promos gave the impression that this movie was more about the flight itself and not so much that he was a womanizing, alcohol and cocaine addict.  We thought that the possibility that he might have had a drink or three the day before the flight MIGHT have been the cause of the crash but the mechanical investigation was secondary to his being a full-fledged addict.<br /><br />The part played by John Goodman glamorized drug dealers.  He played it well, I laughed at him, he was a fun drug dealer.  But that's not reality.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Watch this movie without expecting an Alien prequel and it's quite good. Very impressive visuals. The story was quite interesting and progressed well. The acting was well done. If I had a compalint, it does seem quite similar to Alien with a few plot points of Aliens tied in as well.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have continued to enjoy having this app, use it almost daily for an assortment of items I need to view.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|It is clear from reading the book that this is a case of selective journalism. Ms. Goodwin is enthralled with her subject and goes to great lengths to place Lincoln and his associates on an heroic pedestal.<br /><br />I am not a Lincoln scholar. I can only remark that these men possess the most extravagant gifts of character, skills, shcolarly achievement, personality, astuteness and management ability that it appears to be one of the most competent assemblages of talent ever.<br /><br />Other than this, I enjoyed reading the book. Considerable research has gone into the supportive base for the tale.
1439170916|5.0|Very readable history of cancer and it's treatment. Worth reading by anyone interested in cancer and it's treatment including medical professionals.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Nice movie.<br />Has some great action scenes, but nothing really new.<br />Great idea, worth watching. If you like the genre, you should watch it.
B004OZZ624|3.0|The movie was interesting but I am not sure that anyone would really try to get their loved one out of prison by escaping. I guess it could happen but as the movie displayed, she was innocent so why not try to find someone that could prove it?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Not sure why using the options to turn off sound doesn't actually turn off sounds. I have my nook muted. I have all the game sound options turned off and still it blares along. Can't use the app unless I am home because it is so loud and I refuse to inflict people around me with the apps that I play. I love the game but not being able to make it quiet really limits how much a can play it.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|The story was easy to follow. It was realistic of what could happen when you decide to visit a country and need medical care. I felt all actors did a fine job in their roles.
0451529065|3.0|If you're looking for a &#34;primer&#34; on the subject of evolution, this isn't it. I found the prose quite tedious and repetitive. Long antiquated sentence structure reliving previous statements of observation over and over again; this makes for ho hum boring reading. If, by chance on the other hand, you are a non-believer of evolution and the now well known processes involved, reading Darwin with an eye on its significance in history is of course quite educational. This work is of a lifetime of accurate and insightful observation, years ago, when technology was, at best, limited. It's difficult in today's knowledge accumulated society to put oneself back into the mid 1800's and appreciate Darwin's remarkable insights, irrespective of his tedious prose. Not for the average reader . . .
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I found this movie sad and captivating to watch. I questioned his decisions at times. I thought he could have made a different choice so that the ending could have been different. A true story worth watching.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|thoroughly enjoy the time in our history when people spoke the language. well produced with great story lines. no sex or violence to keep your attention just character development and great acting.
B0068THAGY|3.0|This was not really a movie that I watch. If you like creature type of movies this is the one for you.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very enjoyable! Gives good insight intoo the culture of India... Interesting country....I like the characters in the movie. Order it now!
B0084670FU|3.0|I want to enjoy a movie. This film was almost all subtitles. If I had known that I would have never watched.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Movie keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!! Anthony Hopkins at his best!!!! Lots of twists and turns in the movie.....Sport!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This program looks high quality. The acting was excellent and it gives a great feel for 1914 England. Some may find the show a little slow but not me.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|We have seen all of the Mission Impossibles and although this was in the running, it was a little too 'out there' even by MI standards.  Still interesting and exciting.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its a cool game the only thing is that one day and it doesn't let you back in the game!!!!!
B003Y5H574|1.0|One of the best films of the year. I was excited to get it on DVD, but the packaging leaves an ugly strip down the side of the DVD case. It's a relatively small complaint, I know, I was just annoyed at the fact that these people can't even package a DVD correctly. It shouldn't be too difficult.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Charlize Theron is a great actress and so stunning. She really made this film.  I thought she made this movie worth watching.  I enjoyed this twist on an old fairy tale. She played the best wicked queen and the special effects were great.  Just a fun fantasy film.
B004DHUAZQ|5.0|Loved it, action packed and great special effects. It really holds your interest. I cannot believe that this movie did not do better in the theaters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game the best horse game ever I enjoy every minute I'm on it I love my horse I only have one
B008N1V11U|5.0|can u guys please make it 99cents. this game is awesome. I played it on my friends iphone and I loved it. please make it 99cents
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love this series. Lots of action. Very entertaining (as always).<br />I will read this once a year I am sure.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|The entire movie is a constant flow of cameos by the Hollywood action heros.  Story line and plot are so passe that the only thing that keeps one awake is all the noise created by the action heros trying to do each other in.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|We all know that John Grisham is an outstanding producer of fiction novels.  But this is one time in which he tried a new style of writing sadly failed.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Years before I read WWZ, I read Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide.  Where in Brooks laid out all the rules for a zombie.  As zombies are fictional, they can obey any set of rules determined by the author, but the more nailed down the rules, the more clearly defined the threat, creating a more believable setting.  When Brooks set out to write his oral history of a zombie apocalypse, he used his survival guide as a rule book, and created something wonderful.  I could not find fault with any part of the book.  each character was original, and different from all the others.  Every setting was believeable and wonderful.  The diversity was staggering.  While I will never admit that it did, who would have ever thought that in a story about a world wide zombie war, I could have found stories that were so powerful and moving that they nearly brought a tear to my eye?
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app.  When I can't sleep at night I play this.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|If you are here, and I am sure you are, then you probably were told how amazing these books are by a friend, so I won't spend much time doing that.  I will leave it at this:  I am a lifelong Sci-Fi nerd, but by halfway through the end of the first chapter (not the prolog) I knew I had something special in my hands. By the end of the book, it had replaced my favorite sci-fi books and become my favorite book series, ever.  I have bought the first three books three times each, because over the years they were damaged or lost.<br />Having said that, This review is for the first four books in one bundle for the Kindle.  I wish I had bought the books separately, instead.  On paper these books are 700 to 1100 pages long.  going back to reread a certain part, ot skipping ahead to look at the character descriptions is very difficult.  If you buy these for the kindle, do yourself a favor and buy each book individually.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this app, as I play Bingo everyday. I would recommend this app to anyone who is on the go.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|This is one of the finest urban fantasy books I have ever read.  Most of the other books of the list of Greatest Urban Fantasy are mostly the other books in this series.<br />These books are remarkable for many reasons.  HIs first book, and Hearne writes like an old hand, a vet of dozens of books.  It is original, as far as I can tell.  It is extremely well researched, all of his books are.  They span several pantheons of ancient religion and mesh perfectly.  The humor is just right that the books aren't comedies but can give you a good chuckle now and then.  The characters are memorable and likeable, except the ones that aren't meant to be likeable, those guys suck.  Six books in two years and they have not grown thin, boring, repetitive or stale, they are none of those things.  And everything is just well thought out.  A plot point may not be resolved for a book or two, or even mentioned, but he will get back to it, when it makes sense, without shoehorning it in.  These books are so good it is impossible to pick a favorite amongst them.
B008P1EWIM|3.0|This app did not give me enough information for the cities I was looking at.  I gues I'm use to the weather channel and this is not what I was looking for.
B005HSL626|1.0|not worth the ads to play a single game of ninja - you have to wait for ad to load and then hit skip and return to the game.  I am deleting the game.  I also should have ordered the full version.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Like to keep up on facebook when I'm away, and this app does it.  I would recommend this app to anyone.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show was so fantastic that I watched 2 whole seasons in less than 2 weeks on demand. I can't wait for season 3!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is addicting.  You just want those bird to get all of the pigs.  I could play this for hours.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This is quick an  easy. t has several short workouts that are great for keeping in shape. I enjoyed them and they are not extremely difficult but definitely effective.
B00821OX98|4.0|Okay for the most part, CG could be a little better but this is a TV series and not a major movie so the money is not there I guess.
B0090EIILU|3.0|The movie wasn't as funny as I thought it would be. Still if you are looking for a few good laughs then by all means check this out.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this product is amazing. i love to play this game. i could play it all day is i want. to bad i cant. they should make more games like this. this is the number one game i play when i am home. i love the characters they have the places. one thing they should have is a would tour like you get to choose what places you want to go to and when your done [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]with it you get to keep it. but everything else is fine this is a very good game
0670026603|3.0|Makes you think about life as a quadrapelegic and how you would relate. Compassion and understanding are the key words.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. I could not stop playing it I LOVE this game because it was fun filled game!!!!
B0068THAGY|2.0|This movie was not terrible, but certainly not worth raving about.  It's's pretty generic and just about average in terms of quality of Hollywood movies.    I watched it free streaming with Amazon Prime and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.  It's basically a \\"kids save the world\\" summer type movie best saved for when you don't want to have to invest anything (intellectually or emotionally) when you sit down to watch, or perhaps just have it playing in the background when you're doing something else.  I read some other reviews that equated this movie to ET or Goonies and this movie comes nowhere near being as creative, touching, or lasting as those classics. I would never have thought to put them in the same sentence -- pretty much the only similarities are 1) a mistreated extraterrestrial which was captured by the government, or 2) a bunch of kids banding together for a (sort of) quest.    In summary - watching this movie is not a the worst way you could think of to pass a bit of time, but there's nothing really memorable about the movie.  I found it pretty much indistinguishable from any number of similar \\"kids save the world\\" disaster movies.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Sorry to say that I blew this series off when it was on tv. This series is a prequel to the first star trek and does a good job of explaining how humans evolved into space.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|My initial reaction was that the dialect was so suitably written one could actually be IN IRELAND.  I had not read about the author prior to finishing the book.  A captivating read; well-phrased with circumstances explained tactfully as opposed to tasteless rhetoric!  Thank you  Miss McKenna, I CANNOT WAIT FOR YOUR NEXT BOOK!!!
