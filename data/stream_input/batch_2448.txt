1400069807|5.0|Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us is a very important book. It tells the story of how the food industry makes and markets food that people find irresistible. These foods are loaded with salt, sugar, and fat and are very high in calories. High consumption of these highly processed foods helps explain why Americans have become obese.<br /><br />The book is fascinating and well documented - we learn about the research, marketing, and desire for convenience that have led to the development of these foods. Moss had access to key people in the industry, key reports, etc. There are strands about major food companies (Kraft, General Foods, etc.) and their commitments to shareholders; and about the role (and/or lack thereof) of the FDA and Department of Agriculture in the changed eating habits of Americans.<br /><br />The grocery store looks very different to me now.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Who could ask for more in a movie.  This was action, suspense and humor all rolled into one great movie with an unforgettable, all-star cast.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I was really pleased with how good this book is. I honestly wasn't expecting much when I picked it up, but I've read it a half dozen times now and it's still great.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|It's fascinating to get a new perspective on the Vorkosigans from someone outside the immediate family, but still intimately connected. And, truly, it's fun to watch Ivan pull a Miles - coming up with a tactic under fire that's momentarily brilliant and completely life-changing.
0307742997|5.0|I am an aficionado of good mysteries & this is a good one!  I am deeply into it (about half way through) & the characters and plot do not disappoint.  I can't wait to read more of Jo Nesbo's works.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I thought that this game is way better than the first three and they give you a lot of sharks to pick from you can unlock megaladon a 200 ton shark
B001EOQWEO|2.0|Because this one is cheaply made. The discs were scratched, and scratched easily, the &#34;box&#34; fell apart after opening and closing it a few times, and the discs kept falling out. Save your time and money. Wall-E is wonderful though.
B002YVAT72|4.0|Easy to set up, just make sure you have speaker with the white and red input. Sounds great but I haven't used the Vinyl to MP3 feature yet.
1577311523|3.0|A pretty good book but I have read much better since. Save your money. I would suggest Michael Singers -The Untethered Soul- that is a book that you can read over an over an get something different an special each time. Amazon sells it also. I have given many as gifts too.

B007ZUX8CK|5.0|Love this book... my daughter is graduating in elementary education and bought it for her library of books she is collecting.
193700788X|1.0|I have read every book in the series and was looking forward to this final installment.  I am beyond disappointed Harris was suppose to end the story and tie up loose ends...instead she uses tired writing to give us what essentially could have been three chapters at the end of her last book and then has the audacity to have advertisement for a pre order for yet another book that tell what happens to all the characters...Im sorry that seems like an epilogue that she is trying to charge more money for.  I am disgusted and disappointed in her obvious lack of interest in her own characters and her very obvious greed.  Bottom line dont buy it just borrow it from the library if you have to read it.
B001CQONKY|4.0|I have been very happy with the condition of each DVD I receive.  I have had clean DVD and no scratches have been detected.
B00CKKG0JS|5.0|I waited a long time for Dexter Season 7.  Then I finally got it on Instant Video on my Roku.  The climax from Season 6 kept me wanting to know how that could possibly be handled.... I couldn't wait... and watch just one video per week.  I watched all 12 videos of Season 7 within a few days.<br /><br />Now, dang it, I have to wait another long time for Season 8!  The last episode of Season 7 was even more interesting than Season 6's!!<br /><br />Pretty sad, eh?<br /><br />Waiting... Waiting...<br /><br />;-)<br /><br />bs
076115728X|5.0|This is a \\"children's\\" book that really transcends all ages.  The multi-sensory story truly instills the ideas that learning from mistakes, creating from mistakes, becoming stronger through mistakes,  and not letting mistakes define us is healthy and universal. Besides being a grandmother, I am a math teacher whose philosophy is mirrored in this wonderful book. My grandchildren introduced me to it...and I have now given Beautiful Oops to several of my colleagues.

B0061JPYX2|4.0|Some songs are better than others.  It is a shame she is gone, one can only imagine what greatness would have followed.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Awesome strategy game that's fun for hardcore strategy nerds and and regular board game players alike. The setup and rules look really intimidating to start out with, but the gameplay really boils down to three rules: Roll, trade, buy. A player rolls the dice to see what resources will be distributed, trades resources with other players (or through special rules with the &#34;bank) if desired, and then buys anything he or she wants and can afford. Victory points are given based on items bought, and the first to 10 points wins! The game even comes with a handy cheat-sheet for every player to know what each item costs and how many victory points it's worth. The simple rules make it easy for just about anyone to break into playing.<br /><br />Despite the simple rules, a great deal of strategy goes into deciding where you want to place your settlements and cities (that determines which resources you get) and how you want to expand around the map. The map can be shuffled and recreated randomly for each game, making it infinitely playable with different results every time. There is an element of chance in which resources are distributed when, but most of that can be handled with a little foresight and planning.<br /><br />After a single game, Settlers of Catan became a favorite of our gaming group and we play it pretty regularly.
B0091REZMW|5.0|lots of fun and has kept me greatly entertained. I would reccommend this game especially if you like picture search games. great download for kids and adults alike.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Best Bond movie yet, Daniel was outstanding and story was spectaculor, sad ending with the boss dying out but I suppose she was ready to move on and her replacement Ralph Finnesss too cute
193700788X|1.0|Very disappointed.  I had no preference for who Sookie ended up with as her HEA, as long as she got one.  To end the series this way is just plain dumb.  Sloppy and out of character all around.  What a shame to leave beloved characters in such a shambles.  DEPRESSING!!!

B004R13U6Y|1.0|I send my PDF files to my kindle with my dropbox. It refuses to accept my username and/or password to retrieve it. Like so many other apps I've purchased, most are a waste of money because once it's bought it's yours. Most apps are just a bunch of empty promises, like this one is. Don't waste your money and memory space on it.
1401322786|2.0|As much as I have liked his previous books, I found this one choppy and difficult to read. I thought the concept was solid, though done before. It was hard to connect or appreciate the three main characters. I don't think they were well developed and by the end of the book I found myself not caring the outcome of any of their lives. I think he could have done a better job.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Not huge change but some. You might need to find another mounting idea under the tv doesn't work as well.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|this movie was like acually being there on the mission with seal team six the effects and the characters were great you can't get more for your money...

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow...This book should be required reading for every middle schooler in America.  What a great, much-needed message!  I loved it!
B00913P6G0|4.0|Great rap music usually feels dangerous, like you're eavesdropping on a conversation you don't always \\"get\\" because, well, most of us haven't lived a true gangsta lifestyle to fully appreciate, let alone understand. Kendrick Lamar offers gangsta-lite and substitutes that kind of visceral dialogue with taped and easy to understand telephone messages, but often just sounds like actors reading from a calcuated script. His distorted voice and nerdy intonations are more effective and subversive. It's this sort of arsty experimentation sets the record apart from your average rap record.<br /><br />In general, Good Kid: m.A.A.d City has everything that's likeable in a the best rock records: humor, heart, occassional moments that are (or seem) deeply moving, a little artsiness, atmosphere, and enough foul language to give it street cred.<br /><br />\\"Bitch Don't Kill My Vibe\\" and \\"Real\\" are terrific cuts.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse is one of the best purchases I have made recently.<br />Not only can you program the buttons, but you can also change the colour of the anchor symbol which gives a very fun effect :-)<br />I really like how smooth it runs and how customizable it is.<br />I would recommend to anyone that doesn't want to pay for a mouse over $80.<br />This is perfect.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|Not sure if I got a defective product but I can't sharpen my knife at all...will keep trying.<br /><br />My kitchen knife is blunt, after trying 5-10 pulls (as recommended), it stays blunt. I've tried many ways to sharpen it for 2 days and it still stays blunt. Might be my technique is wrong but using a sharping stone took only 5 mins and I can cut paper with the knife.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book shows you that love comes in different shades. To want to be loved and to love. I loved this book because it shows you that love is not all roses and happily ever after.  This is a dark side of love that to me was the biggest roller coaster. I can't believe that a woman would let a man belittle her to satisfy his needs but then again I understand the need to be loved. Can't wait to read the next book.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I was thrilled when I first got this.  It sounds amazing when it works.  Unfortunately the honeymoon didn't last long.<br /><br />The software is very buggy.  The audio settings on the headset constantly reset themselves every single time the headset reconnects.  Battery life degrades significantly over time.  Surround sound randomly stops working until you close down and relaunch software.  Random connection disconnects/reconnects, even when plugged in, which resets everything again.  The list goes on.  This is by far the most aggravating piece of hardware I have ever purchased.  The headphones themselves are very comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and when it works the surround sound is very good.  Unfortunately not a day goes by where I consider chucking these things against the wall due to sheer frustration.<br /><br />I caution anyone thinking about purchasing this product to take a look at Logitech's headphone support forums, and look through all the G930 posts.  These are very common problems that many people are having with the G930, and Logitech has known about them for at least 2 years without coming up with adequate solutions other than \\"try reinstalling everything\\" (doesn't help):  [...]
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Yes, I love it! Great film!<br />I think It is a very cool and interesting film.<br />It's a funny and nice movie
B002PHVHFI|5.0|I am an avid listener of all genres of music, and I honestly haven't heard many albums that match this work of art in emotion and beauty. The lyrics alone make this a masterpiece, add in the wonderfully arranged music and Jeff's raw and mesmerizing voice, and it becomes a classic of 20th century music. The piece is timeless, and also serves as an incredible tribute to a true heroine, Anne Frank. Everything that needs to be said has already been said. It's perfect.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY FIRST, LOST COPY. EVEN AFTER SEEING THIS MORE TIMS THAN I CAN COUNT, I STILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.

B008JFUTT0|5.0|I watched this story then purchased several copies for others because I was so impressed.  It was a little iffy at first because it was a &#34;documentary&#34; type film but I couldn't stop myself from watching it all and I do not regret it.  Since viewing the movie, I have searched for more info online and found this guy's concert tour.  I purchased front row tickets to the nearest venue and the show was fabulous!

B009RH9FR6|5.0|I really love this it of Great quality and functions with a good way to handle my Kindle Fire, Which  I received as a gift from my daughter and Granddaughter, This also was a gift bought with Gift card from my husband for my Birthday and Mother's day. It covers the Kindle and it is well protected, when cover is shut it doesn't shut down the Kindle, when you open it back up it is only needed to be unlocked and not start all over again when you need to do something else for a short time. And has different standing positions and you can turn in different direction it as well, it locks into place in the convenient holder shaped just<br />right.

1843104954|4.0|My grandson is autistic with some of the characteristics mentioned in the book.  His mother says that the term Aspergers is not<br /><br />used anymore, but is included in the autism spectrum.  Would have liked to learn more about how to work with children with<br /><br />the type of problems of children mentioned in the book.
193700788X|1.0|Wow, really bad. Badly written plot, stupid addition of old characters that didn't add to the story. Including the \\"bad guys\\". Disappointing and unsatisfying ending. Bad dialogue. Rambling pointless paragraphs of drivel we didn't need to know. Wish I hadn't preordered it. If I'd read the reviews I never would have bought it! The series should have ended three books ago...
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Enlightening book.  A good mix of science and the afterlife.  Thought provoking, enjoyable, intellectual  and an easy, short, quick read.
1742200508|5.0|The husband and I are planning and saving for an anniversary trip to England. I've been bookmarking and emailing links for years, but this Lonely Planet travel guide is AWESOME. As much as I love the internet and my Kindle, there are some things a real book can never replace!<br /><br />I loved that the authors gave several variations of itineraries based on the time you have for your visit or what interests you, such as castles or sporting events.<br /><br />And my favorite part of the book? Not only are all the important landmarks and must-do places listed (as well as what or when to avoid), but insight from locals are given as to the best view, best eats, AND Lonely Planet shares lesser known festivals and tourist attractions with you, ie: the Pooh Sticks World Championships in Little Wittenham. Really?! Awesome! Ok, you may not find that interesting unless you have young children and know what Pooh Sticks are - yes, it has to do with Winnie the Pooh! ;-)<br /><br />You don't need piles of maps or pamphlets - get this book, and you'll have all the info you need to enjoy England! Super guide!
B00B9JDBSO|4.0|I love The Knife. Definitely brilliant. This album has alot of different styles of music. Some of it seems tribal, electro, soundscape, Some of the music is danceable, some of it seems like it ought to be in a movie soundtrack. A few tracks may make you scratch your head. I kinda like their last album Silent Shout more but it's definitely an interesting listen.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great for the Kindle.<br />Fast,<br />Something to do while you wait in the doc's office or the dentist.  Better than their old magazines.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Excellent HBO series; nice to see it on DVD. Worth having in your permanent collection. Very good writing, cast and sets and costumes.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This one on my Kindle is fun, but also have it on my desktop.<br />Like it but I like the desktop one better.

0240816250|5.0|&#34;Way Beyond Monochrome&#34; is a very fitting title for this enormously valuable reference book for monochrome, wet-process photography.  The blurb in Amazon's description says it well:<br />&#34;Photo Techniques Magazine stated: 'All our readers need to know about this very useful book.' Indeed, there is no other compendium that is as in-depth as this for the beauty and magic of fine-art black-and-white photography.&#34;<br />The magazine quoted (now called &#34;Photo Technique,&#34; singular) is a magazine for experienced photographers.  &#34;Way Beyond&#34; is geared to people with experience in the medium, not a tutorial for people wanting to begin.  That said, it can be of value to others who are willing to dig in and not be intimidated by the volume of material.<br /><br />The book indeed goes beyond the famous series by Ansel Adams, and the updated edition &#34;The Ansel Adams Guide&#34; by John Schaefer (books 1 and 2), and I know of no better single resource on the subject.  The reader of this review is invited to read the table of contents to appreciate the extent of coverage.  My bookshelf has about two dozen books on the subject, but if I could have only 2 books, they would be &#34;Well Beyond&#34; and the much more highly specialized book &#34;Controls in Black and White Photography&#34; by Richard Henry, which digs more deeply into real, scientific measurements to draw conclusions on materials, chemicals, and myths.<br /><br />Even though the book is geared for experienced photographer, there is much information that can be of valuable to others, such as the specifics of human vision and image processing within the eye and brain.  Another is the choice of print density and its relation to the illumination used for display.  Many experienced photographers could profit from these as well!<br /><br />Numerous hours have been spent reading various parts of the book, and the hours were profitable.  Having so much information in one place with a good index is very valuable.  By no means have I yet explored the entire book in detail, but the authors have done an excellent job in everything I have read.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Takes.a lot of space but worth it. I really like it and I think you will as well. Have fun and good luck.
193700788X|5.0|I just had to put my two cents in with how many people have given this poor reviews. This was a great book, it ended just like it should have all long.<br /><br />************SPOILERS AHEAD************************************<br /><br />Sookie would HATE being a vampire. She loves the sun (come on people). I loved Eric and Sookie together but I knew she would never end with him ever!! She deserves a quite happy life and being around the vampires all the time just gets her hurt.  The ending of the series went out like it should. What kind of person would Sookie be if all of a sudden she declare un-dying love for her HEA at the end after just ending it with Eric. There were always sparks between her and Sam. I feel Charlaine Harris left Sookie in a VERY GOOD place and I can not wait to read AFTER DEAD.  This will tie up those loose ends everyone is whining about.
B00406O7YK|5.0|There is nothing like watching Barbara singing in Hello Dolly to make you feel good.<br />The musical was reall clear and the movie.  Shock that it had a internermission but that is okay. LOL
B000XR4OC0|3.0|My boyfriend, bless his soul, doesn't know my taste. So he got me a pair of red Toms for a birthday present and was so proud of himself that I didn't have the heart to send them back. I assume anyone on this page doesn't mind the aesthetics of this shoe, so for me to say it's an ugly shoe is irrelevant. Frankly, though, these remind me of elf shoes. I want to go down to the Keebler treehouse whenever I wear these.<br /><br />However, I will say that they're comfortable with decent support. I also like the idea that a shoe will be donated to a child in need, but I don't like the fact that this is added into the cost. One pair is not worth the price they ask for these shoes, and I'm someone who doesn't mind spending a lot on clothes/accessories/etc. These are overpriced for what they actually are. They feel flimsy, like they aren't a shoe that will last a long time.<br /><br />I do like these for a quick grab and go shoe, however. They fit right into a laidback, run-around-on-errands outfit. It's too bad they don't fit my personal style more, because they are legitimately comfy to walk around in.
193700788X|4.0|Ms. Harris deserves credit for wrapping most loose ends to the extent possible. I appreciate her efforts and will miss the series. Despite the drama brought on by Sookie's choice at the end, I don't fault Ms. Harris one iota for giving the character some calm and stability. I read the book cover to cover in one sitting, and liked how the story can still and will continue in my imagination for sometime to come. Her characters are certainly strong and memorable, both in the good and bad sense. So tan on, y'all
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Out of the three books, this one was my least favorite - there wasn't as much action, Katniss became a character that I didn't love as much as the other books, it was just lacking compared to the others...but still a good read and an AWESOME series!

B003O86FMW|5.0|once again I was hooked on this series - the description in these books makes you feel like you're living it with the characters and you just keep wanting to read more!
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|I received the lens and was eager to try it out.  Very easy to assemble.  I am very pleased with it, you just have to know how to get the best out of it with the camera you are using.  I use the lens attached to the Panasonic fz100, it is an amazing magnification.  Two images of water droplets were uploaded, I hope they can be seen.  If you can't afford a macro lens, this is the next best thing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me on the edge of my seat - a must read for all ages and genders! You feel like you're a part of the story
B008JFUO72|4.0|I had been waiting to see this movie since it was announced; I kept looking for news of when it might be shown. I saw it and liked it, but it left me feeling a bit let down. So: four stars.<br />The actors are as good as ever, Downey in particular - my favorite -- as the quick and quirky Tony Stark, dead pan, courageous, and as neurotically obsessed as ever.<br />But I must say that, while the first part and middle of the movie were great fun to watch, the last part - in particular the climactic battle on board a big industrial ship that might have been used for either oil transport or exploration, is something of a mess. I got the feeling the director put together a lot of short fight scenes and could not suffer to part with any of them. The result is hard to follow: something tremendous happens, but before one is sure of what, the scene is cut to the next big explosion that is cut half way to the next bad person being blown to bits that... `Choreographed' it is not a word that describes it very well.<br />In my humble opinion, if the director would had left out half of those takes and gave the remaining ones two or three seconds more each, so one could have enough time to appreciate them and get some overall idea of the mayhem in progress, the effect would have been much more satisfactory.<br />In general, this movie has more in common with the \\"Avengers\\" than with \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Iron Man 2\\": here Tony Stark is more like a comic book super hero and less like the bright genius cum regular guy that just happens to have invented and uses these great armored suits, but is otherwise just your basic daredevil billionaire.<br />I know that some critics and people writing here about the movie see depths in it, that some kind of existential doubt assails the hero; to my mind that is \\"a bit too much of a muchness\\", as the Brits would say.<br />Summing up: this is an action movie with good acting, but it could have been edited better. Mostly fun and worth watching, but notas good as what its predecessors had made me expect. And if this turns out to be the greatest box office success ever on planet earth and even the whole galaxy? One goes to the movie theater to see movies, not make statistics.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|Only had the first movie on VHS. I might as well get all three great movie on Blu-Ray to better my movie collection.
193700788X|1.0|This was horrible. I agree with many other reviewers in that the Sookie we all knew and loved was just gone in this book.  NONE of the characters resembled their earlier counterparts and it seemed as if they just made a cameo in order to appease the general public. It was weird, disjointed, flat and uninspiring. I am so disappointed that this is the last book and she doesn't have one more to FIX IT!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Fabulous!!!!  The acting is superb, well written and a solid story line!!!! The story really pulls you in with wonderful characters!
B009AMANBA|4.0|My concern about this movie was that Daniel Day-Lewis would still be 007 and that would interfere with my enjoyment of the film. I should have had no concern, his performance was superior. I forgot that this was an actor's portrayal and saw only Lincoln. Mrs. Lincoln did not have the same effect. I found myself thinking ... I really, really, really did not like your performance.

B00AJAFNIA|4.0|This game is well worth $0.99. Bright and vivid graphics with simplistic, yet fun and challenging game play. The only reason I can't give this game 5 stars is the controls to boost of of a gas giant don't work. If they fix this, or maybe even change the control to boost from a gas giant altogether, I'll give it a 5.

I like most all the stuff PINK FLOYD created, but DARK SIDE OF THE MOON is a legend....an almost PERFECT collection of ROCK songs with poetic lyrics and unbelievable instrumentals!!!!!!! WELL DONE, PINK FLOYD!!!!!!BRAVO!!!!!!!!
B00BF11STU|5.0|The attention to accuracy in every detail is excellent. If you read \\"One Long Day\\" by the Seal who was there, it follows exactly.  CIA and SEAL interviews for the movie were extensive. Reality may be tough for those who live in the I'm OK your OK world and think as long as we treat people with respect the whole world will reciprocate... Make no mistake, Jihadists want to kill Americans. The movie makes clear the xenophobic religious hatred of the west and drives home the point that defeating them in most cases means killing them before they kill you. If you really want to know what it's like out there, in the real world, watch this movie.
B000002IOJ|5.0|Practice what you Preach must be my favorite album from the great Thrash band Testament! All the songs are great like the title track, Perilous Nation, envy life and Time is Coming!!!!!New Order, souls of Black and Low are amazing too, but this one simply shows Testament at their peak!!!! Recommended if you like old Thrash a la Metallica and Megadeth!!!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|Although I was reading this series as an activity with my ten year old son, I enjoyed the stories very much as well abundant wait to read the prequel.
B000021YQV|5.0|TOXICITY is a inspired, hallucinated, raw and unique collection of HEAVY METAL songs from the great band SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!! While i prefer the first SYSTEM album(AMAZING HEAVY STUFF!!), TOXICITY is the moment when SYSTEM become the greatest HEAVY METAL band of the early 2000´s....in fact, maybe SYSTEM was the LAST METAL band to go mainstream with a real HUGE success.....The singles CHOP SUEY, AERIALS and the title track were HUGE HITS, but ALL the songs are AMAZING!!!!!!! A, i miss the SYSTEM years.....TOXICITY=TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!WELL DONE, SYSTEM!!!!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books I've read recently. Just when I thought I had figured things out, Gillian Flynn pulled<br />another rabbit out of her brilliant hat! A great read!!
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|ANIMALS is one of the best albums from the legendary band PINK FLOYD.....It´s not a legend like DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and THE WALL, but ANIMALS is AMAZING too....ONE OF MY FAVOURITES FROM THE GREAT FLOYD!!!!!!!!!!!
0307341550|3.0|I was expecting something more similar to &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, and am glad I read that first. I plan to finish it, but it doesn't hold<br />my interest as well as &#34;Gone Girl&#34; did. I can really seen how Gillian Flynn matured as an author by contrasting this<br />with her latest work. Still, I'm interested in reading more of her works.
B000002IKR|5.0|THE LEGACY, the debut of TESTAMENT is a complete THRASH masterpiece from the late 80's!!!!! The sound is completely RAW and THRASH, Chuck Billy scream like a insane Hetfield and all the stuff turns into a BRUTAL METAL insanity!!!!!!! GREAT DEBUT!!!!!but, PLEASE....THIS NEED TO BE REMASTERED!!!!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I was definitely kept on my toes throughout the whole book, still many things left unanswered, but that's why it's just the first in the series. there are definitely moments where I felt the situation was totally ridiculous, and people were overreacting, but overall I liked it.
B000002J0G|5.0|Low is one of the best albums from the legendary Thrash band Testament!!!!! I really like all their stuff, but i think their 90s stuff is heavily special.....Chuck Billys vocals and roars are amazing, beautiful and tremendous here.....All the songs shines with first class musicians creating heavy music....Wow!!!!.....Totally recommended!!!! This one is a masterpiece!!!!
B00C7L8DM2|1.0|Don't waste your money on this rental. The sound track is just horrible. Even turning up the sound system and/or the TV does not help the imbalance. The dialogue is almost whisper like and we just could not hear it. We turned the movie off after 43 minutes in total frustration. I have not had this problem with any other Amazon Instant Video rental before. Very frustrating and I want a full refund of my rental price from Amazon. I see now that other viewers had the same problem so it is a problem with the video itself - not with my TV or sound system. Amazon should pull this one from the listing.
B004ZN9W5M|5.0|PINK FLOYD is more than a common ROCK band....More than a progressive psychedelic band....They did art through music....That´s true!!!! Most of Pink Floyd´s albums are AMAZING, but DARK SIDE OF THE MOON and this one, THE WALL are pieces of genuine art!!!!! The songs together provide a deep reflection of life through music.....Some tunes like COMFORTABLY NUMB, HEY YOU, ANOTHER BRICK ON THE WALL and RUN LIKE HELL are ROCK pearls.....The lyrics are pure genius and the whole band shine on THE WALL!!!!! What more can be said.....THE WALL is a piece of art!!!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED for every person on EARTH!!!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Love this book, thought it needed a different ending but other then that it truly was great to read. Check it out.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Played on kf hd no problems.  Not much to say except that even though I am not a fan of 'scary' I'd still give this five stars. Great adventure and if you get tired of the HOG you can always pay dominoes! Thank you for the diversity, the nice length and good puzzles. Oh, and my only other compliant is with the music box fish. My disability gives me shaky hands so I can never ever make all the achievements because I have to skip that one. Bummer. Keep in mind that I have deaf friends so don't make games you have to be able to hear to solve and you stay aces with all of us.
0765325950|5.0|I have waited much too long for this book and it was worth the wait!  Happy reading to everyone. Enjoy.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller works great just like the description says. When you use it for a long time, the buttons do tend to stick a little but overall its good.
0452295548|5.0|I'm reading this now - I find it very interesting so far - it's so amazing what our brains are composed of and capable of
0399230033|3.0|There is not much to read, I like to read to my grandchildren at night when they come to visit. I purchased the book and read it to my youngest grandson, it was a cute book, the pictures also but just a few words on each page of the small book. I added other words to the story to extend the story reading that night.
B0045JEPXK|4.0|I remember back in the day when \\"Bleeding Love\\" was constantly playing on the radio. I never knew who the artist was but I loved it. Then one day my daughter was in the car with me when this song played on the radio, asked her if she knew who sung this and she told me Leona Lewis. And that my friend I bought Leona's album. This DVD/CD combo is awesome, picture is very crisp and in widescreen. I'm always behind a couple of years on music products so when I found out that this was a concert DVD, I knew it was a must. Leona is so HOT and this hour and half DVD is great to just stare at her. My favorite songs of Leona has always been \\"Bleeding Love\\", \\"Take A Bow\\", \\"Run\\", \\"Better In Time\\", and of course Eurythmics \\"Sweet Dreams\\". Awesome to see that Leona sings them here. My only gripe about the DVD is that the bass is not played through the sub woofer on the 5.1 surround, instead it's coming out of the center speaker so you're not able to enjoy the phat beats of Leona's music. I switched it to 2.0 and it sounds just as good with the bass bumping correctly through the subs. It's not a big deal, overall this is a great DVD concert of the HOT Leona Lewis!
B00CBKLO52|5.0|Very good Sim. Starts you off with an awful boat though if you get another one it's worth it!!! (Yellow boat is my favorite )
B005HSG3TC|5.0|perfect cover.  light weight.  protective and doesn't mess with the function of the kindle.  It will set up nicely as well.  Don't expect it to stand up to a earthquake, but will sit nicely on its own for viewing.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|This Bon Jovi album is another good album.  It's got some great music on it-and more great sing-along hits.  You can't go wrong with this CD!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is great for anyone whose had a dog and wondered what he/she was thinking.  Garth Stein made this book so believable.  I almost didn't read it because I didn't want to read another dead dog book, but the ending is so good, even though it's not a total surprise.
B007SUW24W|4.0|After hearing a couple songs from this album on the radio, I decided to invest in this CD.  It's an excellent debut album for Ed Sheeran!<br /><br />Many songs remind me of some of the great folk singers like James Taylor, etc.  Ed Sheeran is making waves in the music industry.  Catch onto the ride now!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is just what I need for quick and easy math around the home.  We are currently remodeling our kitchen, so I am using it all the time for dimensions and costs.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Loved it!! Mrs Harris can virtually do no wrong in my mind<br />She tied up some loose ends, created a good beginning for character spin off, and gave a nice happy ending in my opinion
B004478AS4|5.0|I chose this book to read because I was interested in the African's perspective of their holocaust.  I already knew the outcome, however, this book enabled me to be exposed to their life changing events on a personal level and I am glad I read it!
B009AMANBA|1.0|It started in the middle of the movie.I like to change it for a correct one.<br />After I returned one because it stopped contunuosly towards the middle and the end
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|Since when did it become 'ok' for a producer to CHOP up a classic novel like Tolkien's &#34;Hobbit&#34; so he or she can maximize stupid, I mean $?  I was thoroughly disappointed and wondered why after watching the film, I had an urge to go watch that 70s cartoon that actually was able to fit the whole story in, with music and the demise of Smog?????? Anyone, anyone? Yeah, disappointed.
B009T8XBBO|2.0|Normally I'm a fan of empire building. This game doesn't allow that. It's short and very easy missions done in a manner similar to a tutorial. Tons of unneeded popups telling you what to do all the time.  Go pick up the wood that is glowing just in case you can't figure out what a pile of wood looks like. Then repair the bridge. Great, you passed a level. On to another boring easy level that anyone can figure out. I kept playing to see if it got harder but really it didn't.  It just got longer each mission. Eventually you have to use some no-brainer logic.  If you gather extra supplies they will be lost on the next level. So this game is not for me and I can't say I'd recommend it to anyone unless you are extremely easy to entertain and rather young of age...like 8. Works fine on my kindle fire. Graphics are decent with no glitches. This was a free game for me but I'm just not interested in keeping it. Ah well.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|I was alive in the 70s and I don't remember people openly cursing like that ALL THE TIME in EVERY SITUATION.  Yeah, that really ruined it for me.  I would not watch it again, but the storyline was interesting.  Hollywood producers must have a limited vocab or something.  Gee whiz people, really? Get some better writers people!!!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This cover is extremely strong. The built in cover is an excellent piece that is integrated into the cover.  I love the fact that it is small and sleek--it doesn't add too much size to the overall size of the Kindle.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Such a nice album to relax to. Great music and lovely lyrics. Goes wonderfully with a glass of wine while cooking dinner. :)
B004ZQRFGM|5.0|Once again she has a powerful voice and is fierce on the guitar. Can't wait tc her again when she goes to Moondogs in Pittsburgh.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Us to all its works great on my kindle HD , I been I lover of drawing since I was a kid and this gives me free thinking on what to do it has allot of diff brushes and effects to work with , nice colors and even layers.plus it's great for tattoos to design!!!!!!!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a really great game. It is like a super advance runner game where you can fly and destroy stuff with iron man tech.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This truly is an amazing story. It is well written and keeps your interest. I also got narration of the story. Wonderful. I would definitely recommend it for anyone. Just great. A true classic. If you haven't read this story you should. Its free!! You wont be disappointed
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazzing I love it a lot<br />You should buy or download it like they say never judge a book by its cover
142311339X|5.0|I like the new series, it is still a very good read. looking foward to the rest of the series
B008XG1X18|5.0|cannot stop pinning.  works fantastic with my kindle fire :)  I recommend it to everyone.  I've even inspired my husband to redo our backyard...
B002KKCVS2|4.0|Strap which adjusts over toe area had a very sharp edge to it after having it shaved down by a friend who does leather work, it felt much better.
1439181780|5.0|I really enjoyed it and found that it showed me how to put the Secret into practice by using the power
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite Greek mythology books that I have read so far ,I I look forward to reading the next book
B001THZAAI|1.0|How can this inane piece be the highest grossing film ever in France?<br /><br />I love French films, and French comedies, but this one is appalling. I did not laugh once.
B005URRCUY|5.0|Whether you love this band, or don't really know them.. I am sure that you will enjoy this album.  Buy it.
B004H0M8EA|4.0|Good read, although a bit dated at this point. Mr. Diamond's analysis of past civilizations and their success or failure left me with little hope for humanity's future.
B0014QABX0|5.0|I regret not knowing this band sooner.  I am so happy I invested in their music.  This album is stellar.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Great story and perfect ending to the Hole saga. Nesbo gets it right staying with the spirit of Harry. You won't be disappointed.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|These girls do not disappoint me at all.  If you're a fan or simply looking for new music to get into, try this album.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|it is great for kids it makes the kids understand how to do tasks in the game and in real life
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I couldn't say enough good things about this band.  Buy this album!  It's great.<br /><br />Six more words required to close out this review.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|You don't<br /> have to play against anyone else to enjoy this game.  Five lives and you are finished. No long games for me!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|My daughter and I played this together.  We both found it challenging and fun.  The clue were easy to find yet not frustrating.  Would love more games like this.
B00BSWMITK|2.0|I was hopeful about this cd after reading about it Guitar Player. Boy was I disappointed. I'm not a huge Satriani fan to begin with, but since good music is quite rare these days I decided to give it a go. Sigh. The Guitar player article raved about how diverse it was, and much different than his other material. Not sure what they were talking about. A couple of the tracks are ok, but by and large it was very sterile sounding and had a \\"Muzak\\" sort of sound to it.  I understand that every guitarist has his signature licks and sound, but this cd sounds just like the rest of his cds. Uninteresting. I much prefer Steve Vai, he makes you wait a lot longer for new releases but he kicks some serious butt. sorry Joe.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game was found by one of my friends and she finally convinced me to at least try it. It actually took over my addiction to temple run 2. Updates good. Lots of fun. If you are not sure about getting it, check it out, it could become your new addiction!
1609611543|5.0|Information the average Joe should know.....  Gets a little technical in spots, but you kind of need it in order to understand the whole concept.  I've gone wheat/gluten free and it has made a world of difference for me.  This is not just good information for diabetics or people with celiac disease, but also for the average Joe with the &#34;middle-aged spread&#34;, &#34;chubby around the middle&#34; person.  Taking the wheat out of my diet has helped me lose weight around the middle, helped control my blood sugar and I sleep much better and overall feel better as a whole.<br /><br />Interesting read for sure!!  Recommend to anyone that is &#34;addicted&#34; to wheat, bread, pasta, etc.  Here is some info you need to know!!
1451695195|5.0|This experience that Dr. Alexander experienced was amazing. ( I realized that I had experinced some events in my llife which were similar)<br />. It is his story that provokes much thought and evaluaion. I find it fasinating, uplifting and comforting .I am always anxious to learn more of God's plan for our lifes and our afterlives
B005F3XV62|5.0|Have watch this a few times already. Really enjoy it. Great for kids and adults. Keven James funny as always.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very short read introducing you to Nikola Tesla, of which I was mostly unfamiliar with. Much of the beginning of the book isn't about Tesla per say, but I still found the information interesting.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The prose was so clearly focused, you truly feel like you are in Pat's mind, and his thoughts and actions are clear and make sense, however it's easy to see how they don't make any sense to those around him. I did not want this book to end. Just wonderful!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so addictive I cant stop playing. Temple run was fun but in Temple run 2 I unlocked Scarlet Fox for the first time. In the first one she's 50,000 but now she's only 1,000<br /><br />  ★Kat★
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I had never read the  book before, just seen the movie.  While the movie is a dark and frightening one, it certainly pales in comparison with the deeply evil psychological thriller of the book.  I was riveted to it while at the same time wanting to push it away in fear and loathing.<br /><br />Best read late at night...
B000F8O35U|1.0|Disc One was blank ! ! ! Disc Two read well, but that was the 'bonus' disc.<br />VERY DISAPPOINTED! ! !  This was a gift for a 4 year old's birthday.<br />I am returning it and ordering a 2nd.  Hopefully, it will work as expected.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This app cuts the time I used to spend shutting down running apps on my htc android quick and easy to use.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I waited as long as I could (8 hours after it came out lol) before I bought this book. I had a feeling it wouldn't be that great based on how Deadlocked ended but I just HAD to know for myself. This book seemed rushed. Like the author just needed to whip up a final book to get it over with because she had something better to do. I'll definately be looking to TrueBlood the tv series this summer to fill in all the empty holes left behind by the book series. I'm just plain disappointed! Can you ask for a refund on ebooks?????
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like adobe pdfs and use them on a daily basis this app make me able to go outside of windows to use it even more
B0001ARCFA|5.0|My son said these were the best headphones he has ever had.  Crystal clear sound and good price for the great quality.
B000FBJFSC|2.0|This is a story about a family (the Mc Courts) who live in extreme poverty due to the drunken father.  It starts out in New York then the family moves to Ireland with the donations of family members.  It tells of the family children dying as babies, the struggle for food, growing up Catholic, tha father spending what earnings he has made at the pub, the mother smoking cigarettes, which is money that.could be used to feed the kids.  The rough neighborhood.  It is told by Frank McCourt.  I am over half way through and it has been a struggle to get that far.  It is just the same o same o so far.  I am considering not finishing it.
1423151054|4.0|It´s really beuatiful, but the flipping it´s a bit hard to do.<br />It´s worth due to the original drawings .
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|The movie is about a couple who have a mundane marriage.  The wife wants to rekindle the spark that they once had.  She sets up a retreat  vacation with marriage counseling.  The movie ends in a feel good note.  It made me smile.
0394721772|5.0|This is another cookbook I bought for my daughter in Vermont (really for me to have back there in the summer)  I found The Art of French Cooking Vol. 1 in a used book store but couldn't find Vol. 2, so of course I ordered it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played the game for a long time an I can tell you that I couldn't think of a better game then that.( my opinion)
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Filled with action and suspense. It was a fun read in my spare time. I look forward to more Books on Puller.
B005LAIGIM|3.0|A THOUSAND WORDS...I had this movie on my DVR for the longest time and I finally decided to watch it. Now, I'm a huge fan of Eddie Murphy...the OLD Eddie Murphy movies though...oh and SHREK. I wasn't sure how this PG-13 Eddie would be and I gotta say. I liked this one. Cool little story - it's got comedy AND...you get to see the sexy, HOT Kerry Washington in a sexy, HOT outfit. That right there should make ya wanna see it - - AHHH...if you're into that kind of stuff. (lol)<br /><br />All kidding aside - there's a moral at the end of this comedy.
B003K16P3M|5.0|My daughter first read this book and recommended that I read it as well .. I was really happy with the story line as well as the adventure of it .. I encourage people to read this book
B005LAIHCM|3.0|NOW...when HOUSE AT THE END OF STREET came out in theaters - quite a few people told me it was wack..but for ME...I liked it...even my wife liked it and that's saying a lot since she's not a 'movie person' like myself. (lol)<br />HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET stars two of my favorite gals - Elisabeth Shue and Jennifer Lawrence. They play mom and daughter and do it quite nicely. My eyes enjoyed watching BOTH of them on my TV. (lol) Don't worry ladies - the movie has some eye candy for ya as well - they give you Max Thieriot, ya know - from MY SOUL TO TAKE and the A&E show BATE'S MOTEL. He plays the secret, damaged dude of the town. The boy has issues. (lol)<br /><br />HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET definitely has action and thrills - - with some crazy twists. Even I didn't catch it and I liked that. What you see in the trailer is not exactly how it seems. That's why my wife liked this one - she thought it was actually believable - that this crazy stuff COULD happen. I think it's worth the watch.<br /><br />I give HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET... 3 1/2 out of 5 popcorns!
B007RCJNDE|5.0|A great read from start to finish.  Jordan's tale is immense and detailed, with Sanderson finishing the writing but keeping true to the original storyline. RIP Robert Jordan, the true Dragon
B0091Q82L8|5.0|i agree with the extant reviews. But....i can never get enough live Who....altho it occurred to me that &#34;Tommy&#34; is kind of over-rated vs , say,. The Who Sell Out&#34; or &#34;Meaty Beaty....&#34; or &#34;Direct Hits&#34; whivh i've never found on CD.....I love &#34;Dogs Part One&#34;
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is free but if you want to move along at a good pace, you will need to buy credits with real $$$.  Lots of fun to play. Can get addicting.
0142000671|5.0|This was much better a read than The Great Gatsby.  I wonder why that was called the &#34;perfect American novel.&#34;
B009AMANBA|5.0|A must for Civil War buffs! Need to watch it several times to pick up on small details<br />I enjoyed it!
B004XMMSZG|3.0|It works well in overall with sounddock portable however, there is really a scratchy sound. It is quite noticable especially if you try to increase the volume a little. However I have to say it works pretty well with instrumental songs for some reason. probably the frequency range. It is definetely tolarable but why should you use a high quality system to listen low quality audio. I would say use audio jacks or the dock if possible.
B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|I have about half a dozen or more Clutch albums, love 'em all, but Earth Rocker is definitely among the best if not the best of the bunch. I have three or four favorite tracks, but there's not a bad song on the entire disc. This is the band at their best, straight ahead balls to the wall rock with intelligent and thought provoking lyrics. I mean ya gotta respect a band that calls the act of declaring war 'shaking hands with Necro-City.' Classic.<br />Bottom line, if you're a fan you'll definitely love this album as one of their best, and if you're new to the band this would be an excellent first exposure to them. GET THIS ALBUM!!!
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia has matured, in her look, in her hairstyle, her walk and of course, her music.I like how her audible lyrics tell about her journey of change to where she is now. Then there is a little rap of where she &#34;come from&#34;.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|This album is a delight.  The arrangements are a skillful middle ground between very traditional Christmas carol arrangements and a modern &#34;pop&#34; approach.  Enjoy listening to the album again and again.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was so ready for this book to come out! I loved The Selection and wanted to read more about all of the characters in this book. The author does an amazing job with character development. They are beautifully flawed and growing throughout the series. We get some great backstory in this book as well which I love to read. I can't wait for the third book and really hopes the author puts another novella out in the meantime.
B007O3QC8K|4.0|Hearing this album for the first time with the added (and reconstructed) fourth movement was quite interesting.  I will need to listen to it many more times to absorb the new movement, but first impressions are that it doesn't quite fit with the preceding three movements.  Time will tell how it wears.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great little app to keep you informed on your battery status.  It is simple to use.  Glad I found it.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|I have always have loved starches in so many forms and have never connected the dots that perhaps focusing on these are such a healthful way to eat.<br /><br />This book contains a good set of ideas on why animal products are just not good food for you; without going overboard about the gory nature of how animal products become 'products' ... Note there are more a few other books I can recommend you read if you want to add on those motivations.  Some really good information in here particularly about how your body processes different types of foods, stores energy.  Some of the disease information is perhaps the most interesting part, imagine if everyone was healthier, or what people were eating when everyone didn't have so many chronic diseases.  Most of the items contained in the book are ones that you've possibly seen before, heard parts of, or that just make plain sense.  Connecting it all together is the real critical part of the book.  Absolutely recommend for anyone interested.<br /><br />It is going to take me a bit and I'm never into 100% solutions, but I'm already shifting the focus enjoying bumping up the starch (and as a close second Veggies) in my meals.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this card game! My Kindle goes everywhere I do so when I have to wait a short period of time where ever I am, I get in a game or two.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|this is a great game but a a certain part it wont let me move on. Everytime I turn it off it doesn't save the changes I make.  Great game tho.  (b^_^)b
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to see and use,  I love the ring tone and the ease of setting it.  The color is easy on the eye  at night as well.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This movie is just all around great. Suspense, drama, comedy... all wrapped up in a witty spy thiller. Robert Redford and Brad Pitt really work well together and it seems as though they're having fun doing this movie. The story itself is also very well-done and quite realistic IMHO. I would recommend this movie to fans of spy films or anyone who enjoy a good balance of story/substance over action/effects, unlike the average movie of today's variety.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I just love, love, love this program.  I'm sorry that the 6th season is the end. The character of Don Draper/Dick Whitman is so well developed that I find myself just trying to read between the lines of his torment.  All the characters have a story and the writers have taken the time to truly develop each and every person that we find ourselves needing more.<br />I will most definitely miss this show; but have all 5 soon to be 6 seasons on DVD to keep me company.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What can I say, but yet another Disney movie that our family loves! Heart touching moments that Disney has come to be known for and some really funny ones too. The beginning is sad to watch as the old man grows up with the love of his life who he marries. They enjoy adventures and wanted to live on top of a certain mountain someday. They find they can't have children which is heartbreaking for them and she becomes ill and dies. After mourning her loss and developers are forcing him to move, he decides to move his entire home to the very mountain they dreamed about, using masses of balloons. The movie becomes funny once the young boy shows up to try an earn a merit badge by helping the old man with anything that will earn him the badge. The old man of course just wants him to go, but the boy is determined to help and accidentally finds himself stuck on the house once it gets airborne. The movie just gets better and better as it goes on. Wonderful ending!

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|Simply plug in and go.  Convenient compact device to keep my idevices charged and ready while on the road.  If I had one drawback, it would be to clearly label each USB Port for quick clarity of port designation. Otherwise, excellent product.
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|I love this  book it's awesome this is a truly s***y book it is a pile of s*** yours truly
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Great story with lots of action and dead bodies all over the place. Baldacci is one of my favorite authors.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Well in my opinion i feel there is probably more places you can put in for example, a backyard or like backyard animals or like some kind of different places to put in or give to the zoo keepers so we can put the animals in what we will think it is a good place to put them.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|A very few times in my life I've seen a movie that left me feeling crushed and uplifted at the same time. Act of Valor was one of them. It's a movie that brings vividly to life something that few of us ever see; true heroism and true evil. Our world is growing smaller by the day, but in some ways it grows larger and more unknown. I think we all need to know that there are people out there who have no qualms about kicking a person in the face and rolling them up in a carpet to kidnap them.<br /><br />One of the brilliant aspects of the movie was the use of the Canon Rebel for filming. The dSLR is just small enough to be taken into new locations that we've never seen before. There were sweeping, unbelievably beautiful shots of helicopters, submarines and swift boats, but at the same time with the use of the dSLR and the helmet mounted cameras, we were suddenly taken into the thick of things with heart stopping effectiveness. I've never felt so part of a movie before.<br /><br />The Navy Seals that were recruited to make this movie aren't acting, they're just being themselves and the simplicity of their lines brings them powerfully to life. I felt like I knew them personally by the end as I sat at the edge of my seat, willing them to live.<br /><br />But even Navy Seals, with all their state of the art equipment and specialized training, are mortal. The list at the end of the movie of those lost is short, but if there was only one name, it would already be too long. I assume that those same men that made the movie might possibly be down range right now, as I write this, keeping us all safe, silently and effectively. I want to know how they are, but unfortunately I'll never find out.<br /><br />They're the closet you can get to Supermen this side of eternity and there are only a few of them. I'd give the movie six stars if I could.
B004LR5K0I|5.0|Elvis' voice was still powerful in the 70s.  Five disc album contained live and studio recordings, a number of which I had never heard.  Fidelity was excellent and shipment was quick.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Downton Abbey is an Intricate family saga with believable, organic character development, intelligent dialogue, and superb acting .Exceptionally well done.
B00AB55BS0|4.0|THE \\"GAME\\" IS ON US  This series is called \\"Game\\" of thrones for a good reason. You have the common ordinary people living their lives, and in clear contrast then you have the \\"game\\" being played by the elite. And what a \\"game\\" it is: round and round we go, whoever is the last standing gets the Iron Throne! George R.R. Martin has given us a simplified yet insightful look at the use and abuse of power: those with the power can determine the lives of those without. Fight, be enslaved, go to the wall, be raped, order 2000  soldiers to die at your command (Robb Stark): the elites are locked into a high-stakes game for power, and everyone else is their pawn. This particular Game reminds me in this regard of The Hunger Games (my articles on THG here). It's what I have blogged about elsewhere and called Administrative Violence.    This critique that Game of Thrones offers us stands on its own. We see this today not only in the posturing of empires and nation-states, but of corporations who are playing their own high stakes game with consequences doled out to millions.    This is worth the price of admission on its own, because it stands as a sharp critique of the game elite imperialists play all the time. This reality that Thrones is critiquing is underdeveloped however. There is little if any acknowledgement that such brutal Administrative Power is oppressive and creates conditions of poverty, injustice, and marginality. Indeed, 10 episodes in and there seem to be no \\"people\\" who are oppressed at all, only individuals and \\"others.\\"    For Thrones, the real story is why they play the game at all. The working theory of Game of Thrones regarding the Administrative Power of the elites differs from Susan Collins in Hunger Games. Rather, the theory of \\"Thrones\\" is that anxiety, emotion, and pain dictate behavior and win out over law, honor, and principle. The elite puppet masters command the lives of thousands without concern in an effort to salve  [sometimes ancient] personalwounds. In other words, they are not fighting for what is right or good, they are fighting as an alternative to dealing with their emotions. People in the hands of an angry elite.    It's in this context that we see violence being trotted out for redemptive purposes. You have hurt me, so I will hurt you. Some (think Lannisters) enact revenge quicker than others (think Starks). But no one seems to have the capacity to escape their own anxiety surrounding their pain, and to function in any other way than tit for tat. Time and again, we see characters acting out of emotion, not thought, allowing fear, anger and revenge to be the unholy brew that determines behavior rather than principle or character. Viserys' ridiculous quest for the throne. Khal Drogo finally agreeing to attack Westeros only after Robert Baratheon tries to kill Khaleesi. Lady Stark's unwarranted capture of Tyrian Lannister. John Snow's skin crawls at the strictures of his oath when he hears his dad is taken prisoner. Upon hearing of Ned's death, Lady Stark says to her son Robb, \\"First we must get your sisters out. And then we will kill them all.\\" King Joffrey hasn't made a choice built on anything but teenage angst yet after 10 episodes.    This reminds me all too much of Germany between the two World Wars, of decades of battle in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants, and of certain imperial and xenophobic responses to 9/11. Game of Thrones is uniquely interested in unmasking how enslaved we can become to emotion to the detriment of healthy functioning and governance. They seem to be as little restrained by the power of honor as many in our systems are by the power of law.    It's this base primitive function, more than anything else, that connects the people of Westeros together. To the point that finally, even distinctions between good \\"us\\" and evil \\"them\\" collapse. Again, Saladin Ahmed has this to say,    \\"There is nothing unique about the savage horde's savagery. If Dothraki societyis depicted as violently perverse, so is Westerosi (i.e., quasi-European) society, which bows to the whims of the Aryan-featured boy-monster King Joffrey, and which has knighted mass murderers and rapists like Ser Gregor Clegane, one of the most horrifying minor characters in all of fantasy. Every culture is savage in \\"Game of Thrones,\\" and that's a very different view of the world than what Tolkien gave us.\\"    While I agree with this necessary critique, let me offer a word of hope. The real history of the world is the people's history, not the history of kings and kingdoms. Let me get religious on you for a second: God doesn't crown this king or that government as savior of the world. The unfolding of history happens at the level of ordinary people committed in faithfulness to God; not at the level of Presidents with a trigger finger. Don't get swept up with Thrones notion that all that matters is what happens at the top of the food chain. We've been paying for this lie for 1700 years, and its name was Christendom.    PEACE AT ANY COST  Episode 9 directly addresses what many believe should be the death of the pacifist mentality everywhere. Here we find Ned Stark in a tight spot after King Robert's death: follow your principles of honor and make war for the sake of the legitimate king, or shut up and \\"make peace\\" which is best for the realm. Baelish and Varys, the royal council, choose to make peace in an effort to save the kingdom from war. When Ned sacrifices his values and dies anyway, we're led to believe peace is for the weak. Peace, in the moral landscape of thrones, is perceived as bankrupt.    And perhaps it should be. After all, the peace they ascribe to is not a real peace, for its foundation is oppression, violence, and abuse of power. It's peace at any cost (and what a cost it is!) rather than peace built on justice. The true maker of peace forges a new community of justice through peace not violence. It is not an absolute \\"no\\" to violence which turns ablind eye to injustice and hate. In other words, true peacemaking denies both the validity of pax Romana/Americana and disengaged pacifism with no engagement with the world's brokenness. Perhaps expecting such a prophetic voice is too nuanced for the Thrones landscape. So allow me to move on.    THE PHYSICALITY OF LIFE  There's no room for disembodied, platonic, gnostic or strictly contemplative living here in Westeros. Life is brutal, winters are fierce, bodies are fragile, and doctors are scarce (the way it has been and remains for most outside are precise time and place). The contrast to our own virtual existence is relentless. Scene after scene will remind you of your body through the physicality of the life depicted. Your body is absolutely essential to your existence: hands, fingers, legs, food, sex, clothes, protection. I have been repeatedly reminded of Craig Detweiler and Barry Taylor's (A Matrix of Meaning) push for embodied theology: \\"\\"The Bible\\" they say, \\"must be recovered as an earthy, sweaty, sexy book... Blood, sweat and tears line the road to resurrection.\\" In Westeros, we're reminded rightly of \\"salvation's\\" ancient material roots of being rescued.    While fear of death plays a central role, death is also seen as playing a normative role: it's as much a part of life as breathing. It simply comes with having a body. And there are clearly things worth fearing more than death!    Finally, by the end of season 1 I began to feel a bit like I was watching yet another episode of fear driven Fox News. All of the foreshadowed fear mongering (Dothraki from the east and \\"white walkers\\" from the north) is setting quite the stage for Season 2, which I can't wait to begin.  I'll be anxiously following these and other themes into war and Season 2 soon.    You can read more of this review at: [...]
B00BPWDMP2|4.0|I love Lady a. I own every single album and song they put out. i Also love this album but there is one problem. THEY NEED MORE DUETS. My favorite songs on the record are golden, it anit pretty, and good buy town. But i must say, i like there old style better. There trying to do something different, don't get me wrong i love the new style but i peffer the old lady a.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I purchased this app because I own 2 Foscam 8910W IP cameras as baby monitors.  I already have a controller for my iPhone but wanted one for my Kindle Fire as well.  Initially I purchased the FOSCAM IP Camera Viewer and this app does nothing more than monitor.  It has extremely poor controls.  To pan/tilt you simply touch the screen in the direction you want the camera to move.  However, there is generally a 2-5 second delay and it often does not even respond.<br /><br />So I quickly researched other IP camera viewer/controller apps and found IP Cam Viewer Full.  This app had great reviews by other Kindle Fire owners with Foscam cameras.  The nice thing about this app is that it has a free version so you can try it out first.  The IP Cam Viewer Full app is great and works perfectly for my purposes!<br /><br />DO NOT BUY the FOSCAM IP Camera Viewer app!  It is a complete waste of money.  I am going to request my money back from Amazon!<br /><br />But I definitely recommend the IP Cam Viewer Full app!
B00BWC1UZE|5.0|I love this album from beginning to end! I reminds me of the days of how R&B used to be. It is definitely worth purchasing.
1452115567|5.0|When we first discovered maddie she was on things on Instagram through this wild idea. My son and I adored her and looked forward to her latest poses. Now we have the book and can turn to any adventure we like to learn about a quiet moment in time through maddie and Theron's explorations. If you love dogs, if you love silly sights across the US, if you want to take a glimpse at someone who had the courage to live their dream, then get this book.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|ordered it for the Mr he is delighted with the quality and the music. It was a great birthday surprise. Arrived on time as indicated by the shipment tracking. Thanks so much!
B000UX6THK|5.0|had a slight problem with the first disc but no problems on any of the others and we're about 2/3 of the way through them all. great show, great product and great price.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|If Johny Cash, Social Distortion, Metalica, and Elvis had a musical love child it would be Volbeat.  Straight forward, hard rock with a metal edge and a rockabilly sensibility.  I love the western theme of this CD.  If you claim to like Rock & Roll you must buy this CD.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The book surrounds you with emotion. You feel the pain and the pride of achievement of the children. Read it before being dazzled by the special effects of the movie.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I picked up the first two DVD's on Sale 21/2 years ago during the Thanksgiving Holidaze. I had never watched the show before but it was on sale so I decided to give it a try. The first season was interesting and by the end of the first season it became extremely good and has been consistantly good ever since. They continually keep coming up with new story arcs that are exciting and keep you hooked. If you have not seen the show you should give it a try. It's my favorite show and I own all of the DVD's.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|I love this one! It was a gift but I also downloaded it to my kindle for free! Now I have it too!
0761169253|5.0|I saw Youtube videos of Kleon talking about this topic. The book reflects these talks. The topic is important because it addresses the fact that every human being &#34;steals&#34; from the past. That's just how it is to exist. It has become an issue because stealing was once less obvious and sometimes more difficult than in today's digital culture. It celebrates the sharing of ideas and building on the work of others, rather than the greedy, mean spirited litigious world we find ourselves in today. It's a fun book.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is one of my favorite series... I totally enjoyed it and will continue to many times more. Thanks so much ...
B0000033IS|5.0|Nice greatest hits album
B008220D7S|4.0|This film was everything you've come to expect from Judd Apatow.  Paul Rudd & Leslie Mann have good chemistry together and make a more than believable married couple.  I laughed from start to finsih and went through the emotional rollercoaster of life with them.  And the kid REALLY does look like the spawn of Tom Petty!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator works nice and easily...not too many functions but very well for my use. it was a good download.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing to say the least! Charlie's struggles and perspective on life is something unique.. although the book is sort of sad, it is also uplifting! Great read.
B000001GBJ|5.0|Love this.  So moving and has power to elicit strong emotions.  The song with the drums though, with it's upbeat sound doesn't fit with the rest of the CD's mellow sound.  I find it very relaxing, though at first found it rather depressing and sad sounding.  But with repeated listenings, found I really enjoyed it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved the Sookie books from the beginning and have been sad about the end of the series.  But it had a fantastic ending.  I especially loved that everything was tied up and all the characters had a proper send off.  Nothing was left unresolved.  I really enjoyed this book.  I am forever a Charlaine Harris fan and will read anything she writes!
B008XG1X18|5.0|so many ideas for cooking:  kids : diy:  brand name products: secret boards for things you want to buy or I use it for favorite nail and makeup products!  or use it for favorites for family for their b days - holidays. and the pictures are amazing!

B00B19GKI0|1.0|I'm sorry to disagree with those who love this film, but it is utter rubbish. John Carpenter's lowest ebb. Badly directed and badly put together it is a waste of time.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|When I first watched this movie, it changed my whole perspective on life. A few years after watching it on demand a few times I wanted to own a physical copy. I went to best buy and walmart, both stores did not have the movie in stock. I then ordered from amazon. It was delivered on time, and still my favorite movie of all time. Thanks. Emile Hirsch gives a stunning performance. Christopher Mccandless (AKA Supertramp) was a very passionate and free young man, even though his life was cut short, his story is inspiring.
1603420398|5.0|EXCELLENT CHARTS AND CONCISE DIRECTIONS. BEAUTIFUL PHOTOS . YOUR IMAGINATION CAN SOAR WITH THESE TECHINQUES. i HAVE  MADE A BEAUTIFUL CAPELET IN FREEFORM USING DIFFERENT PARTS OF CHARTS.
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|I was surprised and sorry when this ended.  I had been thinking constantly of Bukowski's life as I read. Guess I will have to search out more of his prose.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm new on this site but so far I am enjoying it. So many things to see and explore. I especially enjoy the sewing and craft section.
B00AEBB8XS|5.0|Saw this years ago and try to find it on whenever I can. The directors cut is really good. Made the transition to bluray with no problems.
B008TMA1LY|1.0|Too childish, wasn't interested in it after I downloaded it. Maybe for a kid it would be OK but not for me.
B009AMANH4|1.0|The Lincoln Blu-ray product would not play on my Sony Blu-ray player. Neither would the replacement product. My questions are who produced this product and am I the only one with this problem? Previous Blu-ray products ordered through amazon have worked very well.
B0085RQLXK|3.0|This cd is ok. Not great but ok. I don't like the very 1st track because its weird but that's Aerosmith.
B0053O89YM|5.0|I LIKE ALL THE STARS IN THIS SERIES,THE ACTING IS GREAT RIGHT ALONG WITH THE WRITEING..<br />I WILL BE PURCHACEING SERIES #4
0385349947|5.0|This is a must read for young women in today's world. It is not only very readable and engaging, but also contains excellent wisdom on all aspects of planning a productive and successful life both at home and in business. I could not put it down, and I could not wait to send it to my 30 year old daughter. I told her if she didn't have time to read the entire book, she should plan to at least read all of the pages that I folded down. This was in the place of cliff notes, so that she would at least get into the book and get some real gems of advice. I wish that I had had this book before leaving college and embarking on career and family, with very practical and useful information from finding the right guy to settle down with, making choices, how to advance up or across in business. Read it and pass it on. It would also be a top pick for a women's book group.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Very well written. Want more. Switching story lines made reading very exciting. Continually anticipating each characters status while reading about current character.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was not what I expected it to be, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Its a different type of story Im used to reading, but I would definitely recommend it to others.
B009NY43NY|2.0|After reading many negative reviews of Dead Ever After, I decided that I still needed to finish out the series. In my humble opinion, this book lacked the usual flair with which she normally writes. As a writer myself I can definitely understand if she fell out of love with this story. I feel that Sookie's normal southern charm was missing. Her relationship with Sam seemingly came out of left field although it was an appropriate ending. Overall, I found that reading this book was mildly exciting, slightly depressing, and a strained effort.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Even when label says 10 Watts, I took a measure between 6 and 8 Watts. The color is bright and warm, like normal incandecent bulb.
1476734941|5.0|After 5 weeks I've lost 10 pounds and my blood pressure has dropped to normal levels. I can't wait til my next physical to see if my other numbers are improved as well. I won't say it's easy on fast days, but of all the diets I've tried over the years(I lost weight with all of them), this is the first one that I can stay on for the rest of my life. I only have 5 more pounds to lose to hit my goal weight, then I'll go to maintenance and only fast one day a week. The beauty of this life style change is it doesn't interfere with your life. I usually fast on Monday and Thursday, but if I have something planned on Monday, I just change to Tuesday that week. I've found that although you're allowed 125% of your daily caloric allowance on the days after fasting, I've found it's not needed. We just eat healthier now, I'm eating way more fruit and vegetables that I used to.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Of course, it's Taylor Swift. Taylor Swift is awesome! Get this CD....it's her best one yet! I still need more words.
B00BDSRISA|5.0|I must say, this album surpasses Wolfgang in every way. I honestly do not get why people rave about Wolfgang so much (only 4 songs were great, rest were good). This album, on the other hand, is pretty much awesome through and through. I really didn't feel Don't or Entertainment, but they are still good in their own right.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|We love Om Nom and this game is just as good as the others!  Om Nom rocks! He is cute and lovable and the game is very addictive!  We just can't stop playing!!!
034580404X|5.0|I loved this Trilogy of Fifty Shades of Grey.  All three books were great.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update is coming out June 6 or 7 all that has been confirmed is cake, buckets, and eggs. Maybe fire not sure. For some reason they keep moving the day it will be updated I have my fingers crossed!!!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is written really well. Couldn't putt it down. She does a great job of weaving a story and providing both perspectives. But wished the ending was different.  Won't spoil it so that's all I'll say.
0345803507|5.0|I enjoy thes books.  They are so easy to read and they hold my interest.  This is my last book.  So sad
B005G4TJI4|3.0|I was under the impression that Michael Bay insisted there wouldn't be any \\"dorky comedy\\" in this installment.  Nor would there be any slaphappy robots given to crude jokes and slapstick pratfalls.  Kindly explain then the two jokey minuscule bots who adamantly protest that they are \\"not pets or toys.\\"  Bay also introduced John Malkovich as a pompous one-joke idiot who goes berserk over the color red.  What was Ken Jeong's (Jerry Deep Wang) performance all about if not just a rambunctious mess of dorky humor?  Also returning as the butts of all the jokes, Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam Witwicky's dopey parents (bought in just to provide dumb jokes only to abruptly disappear once their shtick was delivered).  Bay even brought in Bill O'Reilly solely as a joke.  And by now, what is Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) but a bad joke?  Shrill, pouty, and more fidgety than Don Knotts on an off day, Sam has become an obnoxious twit who acts as though he'd like to be anywhere but there, forced to perform all that abrasive comedy.<br />Exactly what did Michael Bay improve in this installment?  He reinvented history, kept the usual number of explosions, the usual number of chase sequences, the vast array of bots (few distinguishable from their counterparts), replaced the officious dolt from the last movie with Frances McDormand playing what ostensibly is the same character doing the same tired, I'm taking over spiel, that the last two actors gave in the last two films!  What is this if not filmmaking by the numbers!?  There wasn't a new script just cut and paste elements meant to convey the same things repeatedly.  No fresh ideas, a foregone conclusion, and a daffy non-romantic romance with a new babe (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) who is clearly more of a friend who's a girl than a girlfriend.  I don't even want to talk about Patrick Dempsey.<br />Okay, yes, sure, Bay finally showed bodies and the killing of people, something he went to great lengths to avoid in the first two films.  But as presented here, in this plot, who were the Decepticons going to use for slave labor if they were killing all the people they could get their hands on!?<br /><br />And now they say there's going to be a fourth installment, sans Witwicky LaBeouf.  This begs the question, why keep remaking the same film?  If Bay hasn't gotten it right thus far, he's never going to get it right..

B004R13U6Y|5.0|Got it when half price and would have paid full price. It was well worth the full price and even better at half !!
B000ZOXDFA|1.0|I think that the title really says it all. I loved the first movie and I loved the Helen Mirren/Jeremy Irons Elizabeth I, so when I heard a sequel to Elizabeth was coming out, I couldn't wait. Unfortunately, this movie was piss-poor. The sets were good, the acting was good, it's just the whole story line bit a big one.

B007SGM084|5.0|This book was awesome not just the sexual content but the entire story.  The story was well written  and not had to follow. I rated the story 5 star because of the beautiful story that was given not the erotic sex even though it was a part of the story. I admired the fact that they both had to help each other even though he was more broken from his childhood. My friend even read the book again because she miss the beautiful story the first time she read the book. When I started reading and was talking about the story she got excited and read the books again. Awesome
B000P0J09W|5.0|i am going to watch this when i go to sleep tonight i am looking foward to it, seen this movie a bunch of times and never gets old love it!

B005OZE9SA|5.0|Solid build, fantastic performance and sound, easy integration with my DAW packages...very very happy!!  A huge leap in quality up from my old interface (original M-Audio Fast track...but this was still a great device) and definitely built for talking on the road!!!
193700788X|3.0|Okay let me start off with I did not enjoy some of the things that happened or how it ended.  I still think the book was great to read.  Ms. Harris is the author and this was hers to have written.  I could not wait to finish it which in my world makes it a good book.<br />Sadly I wish it was not over but I look forward to the next great series that will be written.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Really picked up about half way through. Got hard to put down. Could have ended better, but I'd recommend it to others. Should make for an interesting book club discussion.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Le parrain c'est un grand classique,on aime ou on déteste mais on ne peut être indifférant.Des images durent mais c'est comme la vie ce n'est pas toujours rose et dans se milieu (gangstérisme)il n'y a pas de la place pour le pardon.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Excellent puzzle game.  Very difficult trying to figure out what to do at first, but you get the hang of it in short order.  Recommended.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Totally loved it. I couldn't put it down! Read the whole thing in one night! Recommending to a friend in the morning :)
B0093LINVK|5.0|Using this as POS terminal at our small business. It's so much faster that our old desktops with traditional hard drives. I think having to buy the components separate is a great idea as it helps keep costs down plus there is no bloat ware hampering the setup. It was super easy to assemble and I was up and running in no time. If you don't have an external dvd/cd rom you will need to create a bootable USB drive. (google it)
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love it, It is easy to use and the instructions are easily understood. Diagrams are also included in the assembly instructions.<br /><br />Over all I am enjoying using it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app because it is very simple. Plus the numbers are huge! Im legally blind and the huge number blocks are great.  The colors make it easy to distinguish between the buttons. Easy and simple to use.
0316044695|1.0|I admit to only reading about 20% of this book, but it felt like an lifetime. While reading I had this feeling I was being sold something, a lot of \\"this guy was the most awesome guy ever\\" which was said about every single member of his team. Also a lot of \\"We are Americans so we are of course correct and righteous\\" type rhetoric.  I could put up with all of this just to get to what I suppose is a great story, if only the writing style wasn't so boring.  I don't expect Luttrell to be a master storyteller, as his craft is being a soldier not a writer which makes me wonder what exactly the ghostwriter contributed.  Probably just added some big words to make the book look more intelligent looking but in my limited exposure that was a failure.<br /><br />This is not a critique of Luttrell, the SEAL's or the USA.  I just thought the book was terribly written and couldn't make it a quarter of that way in before bailing.  I went and read some of the more critical reviews of the book and saw the rest of the book eas probably more of the same and just decided to wait for the movie.  Peter Berg makes some awesome television so I have hope the movie surpasses the book.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I recently watched all three seasons and it was excellent!!  I recommend them to everyone.  I'm hooked and cant wait until season 4.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The best TV series I have seen sense &#34;Lonesome Dove.&#34;  The acting is incredible, and the story draws the viewer into the drama with great expectation.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|What a great movie.  By the time you're finished with this, you'll understand why everyone is telling you, &#34;Argo *uck Yourself&#34;
0786958731|5.0|Great game especially if u wana learn d&d or just dont wana wait for your dm or all your players to join. It has great gaming tiles and lots of cool minitutes. The only disadvantage to the board game over original d&d is the lack of the role playing aspect. But other then that its a lot of fun and a good quality game!
B003Y5H59C|5.0|I have loved this movie for a long time and now I own it myself. I am especially fond of the extra features and a little of the why this movie was made kinda thing.<br /><br />My only criticism would be that I kind of feel it implies that everyone in the bdsm lifestyle is mentally ill, I feel the average person in this community is no more likely to be psychologically damaged than I'm any other group.<br /><br />Just my 2¢
B00866H7SS|2.0|Seriously, this book had no plot and absolutely no ending. I cannot believe I spent that much money on a relatively short book that didn't end properly. I know it's the first book of a series but it should be able to stand alone as a good story at the end with all issues arisen in that book resolved. Hot sex scenes but absolutely nothing else. Definitely won't be purchasing the next book in the series.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is simply an outstanding worship album from a veteran worship leader. Teaming up with Israel Houghton and the worship team there was a brilliant idea...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I ended up completely hooked and emotionally involved with this book after a very slow start. It became a 'couldn't put down' book which is always a good thing. Common themes were presented but there was definitely a fresh plot line present in this. The story really made you think at times - especially when everything was unraveling toward the end. Great characters and well written young adult novel.
1476733953|3.0|I recently finished Wool and liked the story and its characters. However, from a scientific or engineering standpoint it greatly lacks credibility. Starting with the silo's source of energy. It seems to come from fossil fuels which requires a source of oxygen for combustion. Where did this come from and where do the exhaust fumes go? Major fossil electric power generating facilities don't run very long without major maintenance requiring highly specialized skills. How did the \\"Mechanicals\\" prevent the influx of toxic pollution from the outside - no man made structure can ever be 100% air tight over centuries, not to mention likely shifting of the earth which would cause problems. Science Fiction literature has numerous and much better examples of sealed human colonies. Issac Azimov's Rama series comes to mind. Wool would be a much more credible read had the author provided more scientific credibility. Wool seems to be more Science Fantasy (e.g., time travel) than Fiction (scientifically credible). Also, why no elevators and what's the need for extensive computer systems?
B007ZCOT6C|3.0|This book has had such great reviews and I was so excited to read it. Unfortunately it just seemed a bit elementary. I have read so many young adult novels that are better written and with more developed plot lines. Having said that there were some really sweet moments and I did feel myself rooting for events to work out for the protagonists.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great twists and turns of technological problem solving on another world. Entertaining and thought-provoking as our civilization moves closer to manned space exploration. The universe is infinite. Would that we could look outward and expend more time and resources moving towards those limitless possibilites.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is the best in the world. I`m addicted to this epic game it totally rocks I really love it. All it needs is buckets.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The movie speaks for itself. The included digital copy is a big plus for playing on mobile devices. Not much more to say here.
B0016K40KY|5.0|&#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34; is arguably the besrt movie ever made. An outstanding international cast, a gripping story, superb cinematography, and exeptional directing. This is David Lean's masterpiece. I only wish it would make it back into the theatres more frequently. This films deserves a large screen format.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|They arrived quickly and were just what I needed for my bathroom scale.  I wasn't able to find them in this area.
B008NNA6OG|5.0|I agree with everything that has ever been written about this wonderful film. It is a Tour-De-Force from beginning to end and deserves all the praise it has received over the years. This is a Must Have for any film collection. It is likely the best musical to ever come out of Hollywood and easily belongs in the Top Ten of the best films ever made.
030758836X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The back and forth perspective and evolution of plot was interesting.  Some of the thought processes that each main character possessed were actually recognizable threads (albeit some of them a little extreme!).  I am surprised by the 3.5 star average.  The more I read, the more I became obsessed with knowing more.  Reminded me a little of the movie \\"War of the Roses\\" at the end.  Very enjoyable!
B0000AM6IY|4.0|If you want an entertaining evening of wonderful music and choreography, then this is the film for you. The acting however, feels a bit forced and I have always wondered whether Natalie Wood was the right choice to play Maria. But Rita Moreno, on the other hand, is outstanding as the older and more worldly sister. The score is superb. How can you go wrong with Leonard Bernstein? Overall, this is an enjoyable film based on a classic romance.
0316227706|5.0|If you are looking for something thoughtful for a friend that loves dogs, this book will not disappoint.  Frankly, even dog haters will find it charming to see the dogs at play in the water.
0307730697|5.0|To my earliest memory I have always been an optimist and felt I could do anything. Recently I have experienced a series of setbacks that had me doubting for the first time in my life. After reading this book that old familiar friend of optimism is back! Adam Brown is the most remarkable man I have ever heard of. As a one hundred and ten percenter I often stand alone, but now that I know of Adam Brown and men like him, I am once again encouraged beyond my wildest dreams! Every teenage boy in the United States should read this book as part of the high school curriculum. I have shared several copies so far and will certainly be sharing several more. A privilege and a pleasure for sure! If you have ever made mistakes or are just plain down on life in general, read this book! ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE and this humble gentleman proves it!!! Take care and God bless... ;-)
1442444053|5.0|This is just a great book for a young reader who likes animals and LOVES reading.  It is far too long for kids that like to read large-print short books with a ton of pictures.  My daughter loved it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game was a great way to waste time. I had a lot of fun playing. I would definitely recommend this game.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I despise these games, but my kids love it and waste incredible amounts of time playing it.  Between this and fruit ninja, I would have a hard time picking their favorite.
B005LAIII0|3.0|Interesting movie.  My family  enjoyed it but not sure i want to watch it more then once. Not sure if I would recommend it to a friend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great way to organize notes and access them wherever you are...as long as there is internet.  Would recommend for recipes and if you are planning a trip or event with others. Easy way to share information and ideas.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have loved all of the Sookie Stackhouse novels, and I knew one day she would move on to a new series. I know most of  the other fans of this series are disappointed that there will be no more of her adventures, but don't let their disappointment prevent you from reading this very well written story or series.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|The app is worth more than the current price.  I have had other similar apps that had too many problems and upgrades were far in between.<br /><br />This app is superior to the other wanna be's.  Very user friendly even my technology handicapped spouse loves the app and stated she wished other programmers would follow suit.<br /><br />Thanks for setting the bar!<br />USER FRIENDLY, USED FREQUENTLY, unlike other apps bought that soon lose my interest in their supposedly efficiency.  RELIABLE and ACCURATE.  MANDATORY APP FOR MONITORING Apps running in the background taking up processing power.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Thank you.  Excellent job.  BRAVO!!!
0071422943|5.0|I bought this book for my son who is a chemical engeering major at school. He loves this book! Perfect!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is so fun. It may freeze on you a couple times but it will go right back to good when you get this game make sure you update it!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|i love that i can put games on my kindle without rooting it that so cool. love it love it
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great ending for a very good series.  One of the best.  Hopefully Sookie can rest easy now.  I have really enjoyed this series.  More so than True Blood.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|OfficeSuite is great. It is decent and easy.  However, this software always requires me pay font. I don't recommend my friends.
193700788X|2.0|wow! She left so many things undone and unsaid!I really wish she had given us more closure. I just felt like I really don't know how any of the characters really felt. Poor Eric got the bums rush we have no clue how he felt about anything at all.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I opened this up to fix a place where the ball could not otherwise pass by.  It was a bit difficult to pry open without breaking, but I was able to successufully do so.  After drilling holes, I used small screws with nuts to hold it shut.  This took about 20 minutes to repair.  It's great for kids who will not drop it!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I don't know how this little book found its way into my life, but I'm so happy it did! I love this book and the lessons it offers. It gives me hope with my teen girl empowerment work. I teach troubled teens who deal with low self esteem and struggle with grades as a result that in spite of it all, they possess seeds of greatness and genius within them. They can get great grades and become stellar students if they apply themselves. This book let me know that I'm on the right track and to continue on this path. I can't wait to share the lessons I learned from this book in my teen girl summer cape called D.I.V.A. ACADEMY! Mr. Patrick, thank you for writing this book! YOU ROCK!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows i've seen! it keeps you on the edge of your seat and provides you with an emotional rollercoaster endlessly! LOVE IT!!
B001O54NL2|5.0|Great selection of songs! Takes me back to my younger years when happy songs that you could sing to were playing everywhere.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that I listen to front-to-back and in order.  I wrote about this album and my experience with synesthesia on my blog.  [...]
B008IGP8RI|5.0|Nick Cave and all involved in Lawless should be proud of what they achieved. It may have not been as appreciated by the mass market audience and I really do not know why; but it is appreciated by those who like a really good story, love the human spirit of freedom and the right to be an individual and of course the quality music.  It is a wonderful true story with drama, great characters, awesome music and good acting. The soundtrack reflects this with a high degree of quality songwriting, a spirit that captures the songs and takes us into a journey of the American dream. The individual doing it his way, struggling to survive and will not be broken by the tyrannical bully boy nature of government and politics.  It is a rich adventure of sound and each song truly is a pleasure to listen to. I love it. One of my favorites for a long time.
B00006AW63|1.0|When purchasing a DVD, the buyer should be made aware that certain DVDs cannot be used with equipment.  For example: a DVD purchased from a vendor in England will not work in an American DVD player because of the &#34;region codes&#34;.  I would not had purchased this DVD if I had known that it would be worthless to me.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Very additive game, I dont think you should have to spend money on it though. It should be get a certain amount of points or something.
B009NY43NY|4.0|First of all by far not my favorite Sookie Stackhouse book. **Spoiler alert....I wasn't disappointed, I always figured she'd end up with Sam so to me that wasn't a shocker, I always felt like Charlaine Harris was leading up to that. We did get closure on some things and the people that were out to get her, I liked that we got information on other characters in the book, but it was just okay, not my favorite.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|I was VERY surprised at how great this movie was. It sounded very cute but was really such a good story. My husband watched it with my kids and he had the same expressions as they did when they watched it (I had watched it first). He actually restarted the movie right after the kids went to bed to watch it again and I sure as heck did not stop him. A definite favorite in our house!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|This backpack is priced right, holds a 17&#34; laptop (as well as an additional 15&#34; laptop) and looks good too.  It's got enough storage to hall just about anything you might need.  I especially like the pouch for my phone/ipod that has an earphone pass-thru so you can stow your player in the backpack and still be able to use it.
0817439390|5.0|To any amateur or semi pro photographer out there, this book is a must buy !  Well written and very easy to understand, & follow along.  Bryan Peterson is an amazing photographer & teacher, just reading this book, changed the way I now shoot in Manual and/or Aperture priority with my 7D.  The results of my pictures are amazing.  Would I recommend this book to a friend ?  A DEFINITELY YES !  Must buy !<br />WTW2143
193700788X|1.0|I don't blame CH for the evisceration of the SVM series... She has stated previously that she planned to end it three books or so back and perhaps that's why the last few installments lacked the charm of the other books. That said, wtf? Prior posters here have glaringly pointed out the inconsistencies in character development, plot, themes and details ad nauseum.  Those posters who have been loyal fans from the beginning clearly know her characters better than she does. Passionate followers of SVM have made CH and her publishers very wealthy, the least they could have done was not pronounce the series dead on arrival as soon as it hit stores and electronic readers.
B009X01ELC|5.0|This case is very convenient as it gives users the chance to revolve their fire HD and to keep it standing so as to watch a movie or to read a book.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great read. Sad when it ended because it ended. Could have read another thousand pages. Look forward to the next work by Ernest Cline.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys never fail to amaze me with their talent and the gift of their arranger and fellow &#34;guys&#34;
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|I got this CD because Norah Jones sings Black on it.  She also sings two other songs.<br />The youtube video below has some scenes of Breaking Bad near the end.<br />The song BLACK plays throughout the 3minute video.....<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />[...]
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Im normally not a big reader but i will read these over and over and recommend to all women and MEN!!!!!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|These are soooo cool.  I bought them for my 4 year old grandkids to play with when they come to grandma's.  The stickers are really durable and the pad has lots of stickers to choose from.  I was worried about the kids trying to pull the stickers off of the pages thinking they would tear easily, but for the most part they could do this all by themselves.  I helped a bit if the sticker was especially small or thin.  Then the pad has different pages with different backdrops, and  it's cool to see where they place all of the stickers.  It's great for quiet play (but they don't stay quiet for too long).
1401235417|4.0|Heavy on backstory to explain the Bat's new nemesis: the secret evil organization, The Court of Owls. Apparently, in nature, the owl is the bat's mortal enemy and one of few animals that can challenge it, hence the connection to Batman and his challenge in fighting the group. Batman really gets his ass handed to him in several encounters, so these owls are tough hombres! The back-story plot line ties into the origin of Mr. Freeze, resets Alfred's involvement with the Wayne's and hints at a connection to Thomas and Martha Wayne's murder. Was it really just a robbery gone bad? The artwork is great throughout.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Exselent!!! One of the best martial arts movies I have ever seen!!! A must see!!! Donnie Yen brought Ip Man to life for me, I can see why the great Bruce Lee wonted to study under him!!!
B0091V6TF4|4.0|Bond... James Bond... what else is there to say?... Helps you really apprecieate the work that went into the themes of these great movies
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pocket edition is awesome. It is just like MineCraft computer edition. Updates come out late like the 0.7.0. update but otherwise awesome.
1439153663|5.0|This is a book that keep you turning the pages. It  will open your eyes to times that will make you shake your head. So well written that I felt like I knew the people.
0307476073|5.0|Great true story, I bought several to give to friends and family.  Saw her on Oprah, she did not disappoint.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|game is not easy to understand or maneuver through the different scenes, i would not suggest this game for purchase
193700788X|5.0|I loved the entire serie, some stories less than others, but this one is really good. It's a nice wrap-up and everything falls into place. I read somewhere a few weeks ago that Sookie was going to die *plain killed-no-coming-back-to-life-or-turning-into-something-else* and it made me angry! I'm happy those rumors weren't true. The ending is beautiful and peaceful<br />I guess I would have had a different opinion if I would have watched the serie but after seeing two episodes and realizing I wasn't rooting for the same people in the books as in the serie I decided to postpone seeing the tv serie for a few years and read the books FIRST.<br />So with only the books storylines  to rely on, I'm ecstatic she's ending with *him*----no spoilers! Go read this excellent book!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Wonderful book bittersweet ending. Sparks is an incredible writer, I could hardly put it down! Love these books so much!
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|I love Michael Bolton's singing.  This had songs on it I love to hear so I thought it would be great.  It is only good not great. He changed the tempo in some of the songs .  I know in the singing competitions they like it when the singer &#34;makes it their own&#34; but I prefer a good song be sung the same, always.  That's why it was a good song to begin with.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|This is *the* finest release by Rod Stewart in a long, long time. I am a lifelong fan, yet I could not stand the &#34;Songbook&#34; releases. I did not like the &#34;rock&#34; covers release from a few years back.<br /><br />I would say that this is his first proper release since &#34;Human&#34;. Although I haven't listened to that one in quite some time, this record far exceeds that one.<br /><br />I don't know if I like it so much because Rod has written more material here than he has in the last 30 years combined, or if it has just been so long since there's been a release other than &#34;Songbook&#34;, covers, or Christmas songs.<br /><br />Objectively and honestly, I have to say this is at least his finest release since &#34;Spanner In The Works&#34;. So that is like 18 years. I'll have to pull out &#34;Out Of Order&#34;, and have a listen, because I think this might be his best since then.<br /><br />Whatever the case, this was an unexpected surprise. A fantastic record and a welcome return to form.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|I like this cover it fits perfect and is very attractive.  Protects my kindle when in my tote bag or purse.
125000098X|1.0|&#34;Best Kept Secret&#34;---should have been the best kept secret is this is a terrible short story.<br />I have read every Archer book and loved all but this one. It is number 3 of the Clifton Chronicles. The 3 books equal a normal Archer book in length. But the quality and ending do not leave you wanting more they leave you why did I start this series.<br />Archer is becoming like so many authors today, no writers but grinders. I understand the need for more income but at least write a good book. Instead of grinding out quick money makers. Paying for a good book is month a problem, but alas this was not good at all.<br />I actually wrote Archer about this crappy book, his assistant wrote me back. Is he helping the High School graduates buy hiring the cheapest assistant.<br />Here is her reply...<br /><br />&#34;Anyway, maybe you should consider joining a library?<br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Alison Prince<br />Personal Assistant to Jeffrey Archer&#34;<br /><br />Really join a library so I don't waste money on buying his books?<br />How about support a library they are having tremendous problems nation we'd during last few years economic problems.<br />I can guarantee to Miss Prince I will get my next Jeffrey Archer book from our library, that way I can read it while I am there as it is only a 2-3 hour book. Yes stretching hem out only 300 short pages.<br />Jeffrey Archer be ashamed and at Keats give a good book for $30usd.
B00BGI07GC|5.0|I went into watching this show because I'm a huge fan of James Purefoy but if it wasn't a good show I wouldn't have watched all 15 episodes and been on pins and needles every week! I do not think it was real bloody, were there some gross scenes, of course, but I didn't find it to be any worse than say Bones. The acting is top notch from every actor, besides James Purefoy the duo who play Paul and Jacob stole the series for me. Very compelling and you just want to like them no matter what and you cannot help but feel for Jacob most of the time. I also loved the character of Emma, the actress was just amazing. Whether or not James Purefoy will be on in the second season I'm now invested in the other characters enough that I'll still watch!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Love this movie and the cast. Could watch it a hundred times so I'm glad I got the digital copy through Amazon which makes it easy to watch on any of my media devices.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I went to see this movie in the theater, $16 dollars, add in popcorn and a beverage, $29.75 and I loved the movie, it was well directed and Disney produces quality content.  However when I go to pre-order a packaged version of 3D Blue Ray, Blue Ray, and Digital Copy there is no such creature, instead you must order a 3D with digital copy, or a 2D with Digital Copy for double the cost.  I am not sure whether Disney is aware that the economy is in the toilet and money is hard to come by today.  Most people that I know choose Blue Ray and 3D Blue Rays based on movies they have already paid a Kings ransom to see in a theater and we are discerning customers who want to purchase a combo pack that we can watch on our one 3D tv, add to our iTunes library, and for those of us lucky enough to have a wifi 3D Blue Ray player add to our Vudu collection.although I loved the movie, and would love to add the combo pack to my collection but I refuse to pay double the price for the pleasure.  I think that Disney and any other company who would like to sell decent quantities of Blue Ray need to think about this pricing/packaging strategy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun game if you like seek and find games. Challenging with nice graphics. Just wait to refill and you don't have to purchase anything.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|This artist and his female &#34;sidekick&#34; has a unique collection of songs on this CD.  Somebody That I Used To Know is obviously the hit on this CD.  But some of the other selections are also oddly entertaining.  We liked Kimora so much (female singer) that we actually got one of her CDs too!  Tis music is quirky but catchy and something different to enjoy.
125000098X|1.0|After having enjoyed the first two of the Clifton Chronicles, I have to say I'm VERY disappointed with this book. The plot was thin and lacked credibility. Save your money. I will continue to purchase any Jeffrey Archer books that were written in the past which I have not yet read but I will not buy any future books. He has really let his fans down with this one. I felt insulted. I honestly can't believe he was the author...and have to be suspect about the initial 5 star reviews....
B001HQZJPM|5.0|These movies are very entertaining!  They are the kind you can watch over and over again.  Having the latest movie in this combo makes it a complete set!
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I have not read the books, but I sympathize with those who are upset with Cruise not fitting the Jack Reacher image they have been given from the novels. I would feel the same way if a movie studio got it wrong with any of my favorite stories. That being said, Cruise did an excellent job in this role and pulled off everything quite believably. It did not cross my mind once during the film that he was \\"not tall enough\\" or whatever else people have complained about.<br /><br />The mystery/suspense aspect was very well done and refreshing for a genre which is too-often deadly predictable and demands you check your brain at the door for 2 1/2 hours. The bits of humor throughout were a nice counterpoint to the violence (which is more implied than gory).<br /><br />Highly recommend watching this at least once.
0756405890|5.0|this is the best fantasy book ever, better than harry potter and, in my opinion, than the lord of the rings, I have already read it in other languages, but english is the best!!
B009INAGY0|5.0|there are few death metal cds that hold up to this one after 20+ years following somewould say 2 of the earlyist and most brutal death metal classics cds scream blood gore and leprosy= those cds both could not hold up candle to the technical genious of spiritual healing it was truly a crossover from oldschool to breaking new ground and mastering the genre of death metal at a time where many band in the sceane where great but few were masters of doing newer more innovative things in the music this I would compare to REGEIN IN BLOOD not in speed but everything else technical,brutal,groundbreaking,and at times even simple(because it fit and worked with the song to create better music.)but they were long from rising to the top of the crop of death metal bands,after a mass implosion and losing the whole band Chuck rebuild the machine better and more brutal and technical then before to shock with HUMAN(inshort that cd wss a musical nuclear missile to destroy what most death metal fans thought death metal was and could be but with out spiritual healing fans would have go HUH! who is this?what is this and wheres death? the first 2  cds were pure brutality and spiritual went forward to destroy the boundries that were there to create better more advanced ideas in death metal music like a like a degree at a local colleage then went on to get there masters at the ivory leuge collage then to become a teacher in philosophy later on but the advances and skills that made spritiual healing were much needed and to this day excellent to still listen to along with human in my eyes more than any other death cds they are masterfully ground breaking works of art,and brutal death metal every one needs to listen to!!
193700788X|1.0|I sort of wish that they would give me my money back and also pay me for the couple of hours I wasted skimming through the completely awful writing of this book.  I sort of figured Sookie would end up with Sam - I called that when she used the magical item to bring him back to life but this was done like complete trash.  Clearly the author was only concerned with getting out text so the company would pay her - and clearly they didn't care what they printed since they knew people would purchase it before they could complain as to what trash they'd printed.<br /><br />I've read horrible fanfiction that entertained me more than this book.  Honestly, you're better off just going to ff.net and reading there for free than flushing your money down the toilet for this crap.  Easily the worst thing I've read in years - I'm going to either use mine as a paper weight or as kindling (and I'm generally against book burning) but that's the only real use this text has other than as an example as to how not to end a series.<br /><br />I'm never reading anything by this author again, what a waste of my time.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but really expected more, based on all reviews. It is a good lesson in a phase of American history.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|He is one of my favorite country singers. He is changed from a homophobe to a changed man. He loves everyone and is open minded. His new songs were great. You'll definitely love hid new song &#34;it sure would be cool if you did&#34;. That was his first song.

0765334798|5.0|To those of us who came of age with \\" Star Trek\\" this is a book not to be missed. I read a great deal of science fiction, and this may be the  the funniest Sci Fi book of my experience.<br /> Stranger in a Strange Land it is not.

B00BEIVXKI|5.0|This is a review of the 2013 Remaster of \\"Kill Uncle\\"<br /><br />\\"Kill Uncle\\" was never my number one favorite Morrissey album. I've always loved the songs \\"Our Frank\\" and \\"Mute Witness\\", but thought the album was a bit too plodding. The reworked track running order works so much better, in my opinion. I like that \\"Our Frank\\" is followed by \\"Sing Your Life\\", since there is so much energy in these two songs. And,although it is from a few years later, \\"Pashernate Love\\" really does add some much needed muscle to the album. The cover of Herman's Hermits \\"East West\\" is a lovely and poignant addition. Finally, I've always much preferred the KROQ rendition of \\"There's a Place in Hell...\\" over the cabaret-esque one originally on the album, so this change improves the album significantly.<br /><br />The sound on the remastered album is excellent! The drums are sharper and crisper, and Morrissey's vocals are much more prominent. It's a much more enjoyable listen this time around.<br /><br />I know that purists hate the way Morrissey changes album covers, track running order, adds anachronistic songs, and so on with his remasters. I personally don't mind that he does it. I mean, it's one of those idiosyncratic things that makes Morrissey Morrissey and not Bruce Springsteen or Michael Stipe.<br />Morrissey is a professional eccentric and that's what I love him for.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I've been a Plex fan for awhile now. We discovered it after we bought our Roku box to turn our computers into media servers so we could watch our movies/TV shows and listen our music in our bedroom.<br />I'll admit, I originally wasn't going to buy this and Amazon's 1-Touch check out makes it ridiculously easy to accidentally purchase things. Initially, I had thoughts of e-mailing Customer Service and begging for a refund. I finally decided that I'd give it a try on my Kindle Fire HD and Android smartphone. This thing works almost perfectly. A couple of months ago we went on vacation to North Carolina and were streaming movies from our home computer to our room in a different state.<br />Best. Accidental. Purchase. Ever.

0316017930|5.0|This is a great explanation about things we've often wondered about related to success. No, it doesn't just &#34;happen&#34; or does it? This book provides poignant examples of the preparation it takes to meet opportunity and the other stuff that works for us (or against us) in the pursuit of the every elusive &#34;success&#34; as defined by this culture. Gladwell gives substantive back up to his propositions, forcing the reader to give his conclusions validity and credence. Great read!
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|This book will make you squirt milk out of your nose, it's very funny. But it's 4 stars because it could be better. But it's a kid named Greg who is a\\"wimp\\" and has to write in his diary, or journal. It is an LOL funny book, believe me on that.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|All of the superlatives I can think of are already overused on movies like Ironman 3 and the last installment of Men in Black. This is probably one of the best books I've read since Blindness. She must have been kidnapped in a former life.

B00003CX5P|4.0|Back in 1998/1999, I remember the excitement and the hype.  George Lucas was finally<br />going to do or had started to film the first of the prequels to his original trilogy.<br /><br />Now for the good points - the costumes were excellent and the advancements in CGI<br />made the sets look more futuristic.  I loved Qui-Gon Jinn, the Jedi that didn't exactly<br />follow the rules, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the Jedi Council.  I loved Watto, Shmi and Anakin<br />Skywalker, Queen Amidala, and even annoying Jar Jar.<br /><br />Then the not so good points - Anakin's lack of a father, midi-chorians, and also I felt<br />after seeing this, that it followed the formula of the fourth movie - Star Wars IV: A New<br />Hope - you know what happens there.  Still it's an awesome movie.  I have watched it again.
0937381888|5.0|Did some brewing 10 years ago and didn't like the beer I made. cleaned off the stuff and gave it another try. I purchase this book and it's been a big help.

B005HP2J66|5.0|The unveiling of images in Chavet cave in France creates a spell-binding look into our not-too-distant past. Mr. Herzog and a brilliant group of musicians and crew bring the spirit of not only our ancestors, but the natural world back to life.<br /><br />Under flickering torchlight the ancients surrounded themselves with animated herds of now extinct creatures that still surge across the undulating surface of the cave walls in a rich, moving tapestry of life within the womb of the Earth. This is a fascinating look into our past and a reminder of the life we share with so many others on this planet.
B003D0ZNWY|5.0|This box set is a great complete works of Mahler's music. Great conducters with great singers at the services of the composer's music.

0618918248|4.0|Dawkins makes some very good points in the argument over the existence (or non-existence) of God, but his disdain for religion is very obvious and in-your-face.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Who are these guys?? You know, the ones who built this great game. I can't imagine having the talent to create such detailed and outstanding graphics, as well as fun, intricate and just-tricky-enough-to-hold-interest-every-day puzzles. Right now, I'm stuck on a scene. I'm okay with that too-because that \\"stuck\\" feeling is what a great puzzle is all about. I know it's not tricky enough to be un-fun, and I have faith I'll figure it out. In the meantime, it's that very feeling that draws me back in nightly for my bedtime gaming, and makes me wake up still thinking about something I might try in the next attempt. I simply love this game, and have had NO issues with screen freeze or whatever others are experiencing. It works perfectly on my Kindle Fire. Even the colors are beautiful and the music could be a peaceful soundtrack on its own. Overall, best game EVER. PLEASE don't let anybody leave your company, Fireproof Games--you have work to do. I am waiting rather impatiently for the next version. And I haven't even found the entire solution to this one yet. Thanks for being wonderful.
1476719071|5.0|I rate this a five because of the way the book was written. As I know from experience this book was a perfect fit but for others it may be a total disgust to human nature.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|I'll come right out and say it -- I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell.  Like other actors of his brand of slapstick/gross-out humor (Jim Carrey, Mike Myers, Adam Sandler, etc.), he's usually way too over-the-top and obnoxious for me to enjoy much.  I didn't mind it in \\"Elf\\" and \\"Megamind\\" so much (probably because both were PG and he kept the potty humor to a minimum), but it just became obnoxious in films like \\"Anchorman\\" and \\"Blades of Glory.\\"  So when I heard he was turning to a more dramatic, less slapstick role in this film, I was skeptical.  Not every comedic actor makes a successful transition to drama, after all.<br /><br />It turns out I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Will Ferrell delivers a surprisingly restrained performance in this movie, one that takes a tired clich&eacute; of a plot -- what would you do if you found out your days are numbered? -- and finds a fresh new twist to it.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is Harold Crick, an IRS auditor living a bland existence and who prefers his life orderly and structured... and who begins to hear a strange voice in his head, narrating his life as he lives it.  At first he's merely weirded out (and rightfully so), but when the \\"narrator\\" drops a hint that his death is right around the corner, he freaks out and tries to find help to deal with his unconventional problem.  Eventually he finds aid in a renowned literary professor, who tries to help him find out who's writing his tale and what genre of story he's currently inhabiting, that they might learn of his ultimate fate.  Along the way Harold starts to loosen up, trying to truly live life in his last days and even romancing a semi-rebellious bakery owner who he's been assigned to audit.  Meanwhile, reclusive and sarcastic author Karen Eiffel is struggling with a bad case of writer's block, and with the help of an assistant tries to puzzle out the right means of killing off her current novel's protagonist... Harold Crick.<br /><br />As stated before, this type of plot has been done to death, and often with overly sappy results.  But the \\"narrative of life\\" angle gives it a fresh twist, and the quirky and believable characters help further the story along.  In a day and age when most films are populated by caricatures instead of real people, it's nice to find a film made up of actual people, characters who you might easily recognize from your own circle of friends and acquaintances.  And while the film is quite funny, making it more of a comedy-drama than a straight drama, it doesn't fall back on slapstick or gross-out/shocker humor to get a laugh, but instead finds humor in the situation and character interactions -- the best kind of comedy, in my opinion.<br /><br />The actors do a marvelous job of carrying the film and portraying the characters as well.  Will Ferrell delivers a surprisingly nuanced and restrained role as Harold, the lead character, and while the film provides him a few chances to cut loose and be over the top (such as loudly telling his inner voice to shut up or beating his bed with a lamp -- it makes sense on context), the film works best when he's quieter and more reserved.  Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Ana, a punkish bakery owner who at first lives to make Harold's life miserable (he IS auditing her, after all) but eventually softens toward him when she sees he's not a bad man, just a slightly nerdy guy doing his job.  Emma Thompson is darkly delightful as a snarky author trying to decide how best to off her main character, while Queen Latifah -- primarily known for comedy much like Ferrell -- is remarkably quiet and reserved as her assistant.  Dustin Hoffman plays the literary professor who seems to be enjoying Ferrell's unique predicament a little too much, and while he did a good job in his role it's probably one of the less notable performances in the film.<br /><br />A quirky and different take on an old idea, this is a thoughtful comedy-drama that's well worth a look.  Even if you're not a Will Ferrell fan, you'll most likely enjoy this film, as it's an atypical role for Ferrell and a comedy that doesn't rely on shock value or mindless slapstick to work.  Recommended., you'll most likely enjoy this film, as it's an atypical role for Ferrell and a comedy that doesn't rely on shock value or mindless slapstick to work.  Recommended.

B002WV5A9G|4.0|While some fans have problems with alternate timeline stories in the Star Trek universe, I'm OK with it. For the most part, it solves certain problems for writers who have the challenge of staying 100% consistent with 30 years worth of story-telling. Now I've watched this movie maybe ten times, which might be a little obsessive, but mostly I watch it for the score, which is terrific, the incredible deep space f/x, and the interplay between Spock, Kirk and McCoy. J.J.A's take on the crew of the original series is inspired, and the actors do a terrific job channeling testosterone out of my all-time favorite space adventure characters. Yes, there are a few logic holes -- and planet killer scenarios have gotten a bit blase, but this isn't so much a scifi movie with a great story as it is a vehicle for establishing the starting point for the franchise's next three to six movies. Hopefully, stories will be more important in the future, and less emphasis will be placed on OCD terrorists or revenge seekers. Abrams and others need to look at how the Borg resuscitated the Generations franchise and maybe find something other than an evil, twisted antagonist to hang their hats on.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|hello,<br />  we are fans of the show on local tv.  the characters all seem to fit together.  but, after the first episode, the characters get better and their presentations have come alive.  each show allows all of us to follow the great plot and conclusion at the end.  we started to watch this show on regular tv when it came out and followed it for a while.  then we decided that waiting until the dvd came out was more fun as there are no commercials or having to fast forward via the dvr through all of the zillions of commercials to continue the plot.  every time one scene ended, out of habit, i reached for the fast forward button.  now, this is the way to watch any intense plot or fun show.  castle is a must on watching one of the most fun shows still on tv.  great family ties...

193700788X|2.0|Spoilers!!!!!<br /><br />I knew that Sookie would not end up with Eric but it was still a hard pill to swallow. I have to agree with the other reviews that it didn't make any sense for her to end up with Sam. Instead of seeing a romantic relationship build between them all we've known is how Sookie thought of him as an older brother and friend. Now all of a sudden she's madly in love.<br /><br />Also she threw a fit book after book about how she thought the blood bond between her and Eric was the only reason she may have loved him. Yet she gives no qualms over how the Cluviel Dor may have changed how she felt about Sam.<br /><br />I didn't get Copley, Johan, Newlin, and Claude trying to kill her either. It's like Harris ran out of enemies to try to kill Sookie. Claude was the only one that made a little sense.<br /><br />I was very upset with how everyone's favorite vampires story went. Eric's suppose to be this powerful Viking yet he gave up everything he loved so easily.<br /><br />I use to be a fan of the series but now I will be seeking my books. Big Disappointment.
B0053FANT0|5.0|hello,<br />  it took us a while to get back into watching this chapter in the whole series.  after watching the first one, this one seemed lacking at the beginning and we could not finish it.  then one day, after watching the first fast and furious again, this movie just happen to be available, so we watched it and liked what we saw.  it still is not as good as the first one, the acting is a little over the top, but it was fun and enjoyable after the second try.  after all, it is a fantasy action movie.  but, the whole series is vin diesel and paul walker.  we just added it to our collection.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|Probably the best of the trilogy after what was a slightly disappointing 2nd film.  After a few watchings with IM2, I grew to enjoy it a bit but I didn't feel that Don Cheadle was the best Rhoades until I saw IM3.  This was a good move to kind of jolt the franchise a bit and despite some bad attempts at humor (especially Happy who seems unnecessary at this point)...  this was a much better film than IM3 and even in a way a step up from IM1 which was quite good also.<br /><br />Now, my question is.... why hasn't this been available for pre-order in 3D?  Or is this a 3D release?  The 3D was actually quite good for this film....

I bate being limited to playing at home and since I don't eat fast food or buy expensive coffee those places with free wick are a no. At the very least make harvesting and basic plants and corals available.
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|\\"What About Now\\" is the follow-up to \\"The Circle\\" and it's really what you can expect from a follow-up : no real surprise. The songs sound similar to the last decade they have recorded. You can't feel a real update to the 2010 sound. \\"Keep The Faith\\" was the update for the nineties so was \\"It's My Life\\" to the new millunium. Plus you can hear this new album is really Jon's project without a lot of Sambora's input. Richie has done an album sounding so much more passionnate in 2012 (\\"Aftermath Of The Lodwdown\\"), with a lot of rock inside, paying tribute to The Beatles or Jimi Hendrix. \\"What About Now\\" sounds so much pop sometimes (\\"What About Now\\", \\"Because We Can\\" and two or three other songs) that it feels embarassing : where has gone the Bon Jovi we used to love? It's not that the songs are not good but you can live without them once you have heard them once! You find first-class material with \\"Pictures Of You\\", \\"Amen\\" or \\"What's Left Of me\\" but the best song is the US bonus \\"Into The Echo\\", a crossover between the 2005 outtake \\"Nothing\\" and the 1995 \\"Open All Night\\" song from the boxset. It has always been a problem - Bon Jovi has many outtakes sometimes far better than the 12 tracks for all the pressings. You have bonus songs here too but to get all the extra material, buy the Japanese import.<br />\\"What About Now\\" is good pop album with a bit of rock but not what Bon Jovi can do at his best. I'm sure that's why Richie Sambora left the camp for the tour : he's fed uo with the way Jon wants the band to sound and it's legitimating his solo career with a very good record in his pocket. Don't be surprised if the guitarist leaves for good soon or late!<br />\\"What About Now\\" shows a positive BJ looking for a better world with positive lyrics, positive music but it's not the best we can expect!
B0089BSM70|4.0|If you're like me, you wouldn't put Halloween II on the same level as the original Halloween. That doesn't mean that Halloween II isn't a good follow up. In truth, I've always liked Halloween II(I am always fond of sequels that take up right where the original left off)  and view it as a worthy sequel to John Carpenter's classic. The fact that Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance reprise their roles from the first film and that Carpenter still has his finger prints on this movie despite not being the director help to at least keep it in the same league as the original.<br /> This Blu Ray/DVD pack comes with alternate artwork cover(very nice) and and very good HD transfer. The DVD is of the Halloween II TV version and contains some footage not in the theatrical cut. In addition, there is a Halloween II featurette that has some great interviews and back story. Truthfully, Halloween II has never looked better and this edition belongs in any true fan's collection of the Halloween series.
B000PMG16U|3.0|Firstly I was surprised to have to pay €15.50 in excise duty on receipt of the item in the post.<br />Two of the discs froze when I put them in the bluray player to play them and i had to jump to the next scene to view the remainder of the movies.<br />I have not played a bluray disc before on my new bluray player but i was not overly impressed with the picture quality of star wars,
B000FC1LOC|2.0|This book would have been great if I liked the author's writing style. The story is structured from the perspective of each character...chapter by chapter. This approach is classic Creative Writing 101 and leads to over development of the characters. By the last third of the book I found myself skimming little bits and pieces. On the positive side, I thought ending rocked.
B0045XICB2|5.0|My husband, who is NOT a Twilight fan, loves this movie. Fighting, big dogs, killings, with some romantic tension thrown in.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|I rented this movie because of the unusual name and was intrigued after I read the blurb about it. Loved it and have recommended it to my friends.
193700788X|1.0|I don't give flaming reviews. I find them tacky and classless. If you don't like a book, don't read it. That's always been my motto. If there are technical issues or things you don't agree with from a reader's standpoint, feel free to point them out but understand that the power is always going to lie with the writer. Respect that, and respect them. If you don't like it, write your own book. This has been what I've said to countless angry readers for well over 20 years.<br /><br />Now, I say screw that.<br /><br />If it were possible to give \\"Dead Ever After\\" negative stars, I would certainly do so. Not only does it bring an implausible and ridiculous end to a 13-book saga, but it manages to eviscerate and bastardize not only everything we have ever adored about this series, but also one of the most beloved heroes in literature this side of Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Harris' handiwork, not only in this novel, but in the series as a whole, has been as sloppy and shoddy as a used car salesman attaching a bumper with crazy glue. She blatantly thumbs her nose at important concepts such as consistency, plotting, foreshadowing, realism, and pacing. But this novel ... it's just plain crap. If I were her publisher, I would have given it back and said, \\"Nope. Try again.\\"<br /><br />I am not just angry as a former fan of the series, I am angry at her as a writer. What is this? Is it some kind of joke? It must be. You've broken every rule in literature and your only reason is because that's how you wanted it to be? Really? What are you, a fourteen-year-old writing your first fanfiction? Because that's how this book reads. (On second thought, I take that back. I wouldn't want to offend the fourteen-year-old fanfiction writers. They could do infinitely better than this.) There is no way one can slog through the first 12 books and get to the 13th and actually think any of what happens in \\"Dead Ever After\\" could really happen. What was the point of all this except to make money? What were you smoking, Charlaine? Can I have some so I can maybe enjoy the story, too?<br /><br />Like Harris' main character, Sookie Stackhouse, I, as a reader, feel raped, abused, and betrayed. Not only am I never reading this novel again, it is going to take everything I have not to douse it in lighter fluid, set it on fire, and dance around it naked in effigy. THAT is how angry I am. No, not angry. Livid, irate, murderous ...<br /><br />Seriously. Don't just stay away from this book and this series ... stay away from Charlaine Harris. I know I will be.ere you smoking, Charlaine?

B006YXTRHY|5.0|Okay, seriously, who would rent this movie without having seen all the others so no review would be a big surprise. I still loved the movie. Finally they are married and moving on.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is possibly the best book I have ever read! The way he worded things was so amazing and beautiful. Even though I cried fir the last twenty percent of this book it was worth it! I will forever recommend this to anyone. Augustus was a beautiful human being with a great sense of humor, and Hazel was just the perfect character to be with him. I love this book, but I should warn you, you will cry for hours-days-weeks (yeah it's that sad-good).
B00BAVQGS8|5.0|I still don't understand why the Circle Pad Pro isn't on U.S. shelves...really dumb...but this Japanese version works PERFECTLY with my U.S. 3DS XL. Amazon's shipping service is awesome...keeping me informed on my packages' whereabouts every step of the way. It was worth thw extra $ to import this item. LOVE IT!!!!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|this CD gets played all the time. I never get tired of her husky soulful voice and the lyrics are so perfect. I feel like she wrote them for me. she has been hurt and those songs are so relate-able.. she is fantastic and this is probably going to be her best CD ever.

193700788X|5.0|I think the ending fits. I read all the books back to back to back with no breaks and you could see it leading that way.  I do hope the book she is releasing in October will even give more closer to it.

B00A80SHFM|5.0|Better than expected, great choices from the movie, The songs bring back the movie images.  We love it and will purchase the movie next.
0785814531|5.0|When i saw this book for the price i thought it would be crap. but i bought it anyways because i thought i wouldn't need it for long. But when i got it, it was amazing. My main concern was that a hardcover book that price would probably fall apart, however it is very nice.The print is a vary good size i have bad eyes but i can still read it easily. If you are looking for this book i would recommend this one. Great price and quality
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|We like it, there are some songs that are too modern for us, but overall its a pretty good cd.

I have all of his later CDs and never thought to give &#34;Gold&#34; a listen until I watched him perform some of the songs from this CD on Youtube.  This is one of his very best.  Much variety with an eclectic touch (fairly typical of him).  This is a lovely CD.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|Loved this film.  Have watched it now several times and i see something new every time.  Thhis will be one of my all-time favorites.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a bunch of nonsense!  To think that this book has achieved Number One status does not speak well of our reading community. We're just a bunch of voyeurs, I included.  Did the writer go on the Web and research sex rooms and paraphilia??  I can't believe she is touted as an author!  Contrived and worthless.  Save your money, and don't bother with the other two books.  My friends told me how it all ends, which makes it even more phony!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As we started watching when Season 3 was almost over on regular TV this was an essential way to get caught up.  Don't start watching unless you have lots of time.
B0009VPFSW|5.0|Purchasing the Transcend 512MB Flash Card was just purely by chance that it might work in my Hewlett-Packard digital camera.  It was a trial step-up from the largest Flash Cards that I previously own (128MB).  My camera is now 14 years old.  At the time it was manufactured, it was the very latest state-of-the art in digital technology.  Way back then, the largest Flash Card (16MB) one could buy, would hold 12 large size (16&#34; x 20&#34;) digital photographs.  Previously, I tried an upgrade to a 1GB Flash Card, but had to return it.  Like old computers, when hard drives loaded with programs, with capacity of only 20MB, my camera failed to accept a GB capacity.<br /><br />Not knowing if my camera would accept this Flash Card, it turned out that the purchase of this 512MB Flash Card was an extremely excellent option.  The Transcend Flash Card was accepted by my camera and has worked with excellent performance.  There is no loss of digital photograph quality in any way or showing absolutely no sign of any camera &#34;slow-down&#34;.  This Flash Card's maximum capacity allows 505 large size photographs.<br /><br />Current Flash Card technology is great.  Same dimensions as the very first Flash Cards that were produced but just imagine how many 16MB Flash Cards that this single Flash Card replaces.  I now presently own two.  On vacations, I take a lot of photographs.  No room for a computer when travelling on motorcycle or by air, so it is next to impossible to empty a full Card to a CD or DVD.  I now have loads of vacant space in my camera bag now.<br /><br />Just try to purchase a MB size Flash Card in electronic or camera stores now.  One gets blank stares from shop personnel when you ask for this size of Flash Card.  They are absolutely non-existent.  Thanks to Amazon and to companies that manufacture them, for making these sizes still available.<br /><br />In short, don't throw away perfectly working but older digital cameras.  Buy a Transcend Compact 512MB Flash Card with confidence.
B00005NQCB|5.0|Loved this album when it was released in the 80's and listened to it all the time (on cassette!).  I searched for it when the cassette was long gone and finally found a copy on CD.  I STILL listen to it (am right now) and love it every time.  Just great uplifting music that never gets old.
B009O07NDY|2.0|The music of the Hobbit: An unexpected Journey is the type of music that one hears during large sections of an opera - the music accents the events.  There are almost no memorable melodies except for its theme song.  To be fair, Howard Shore described the music for the Hobbit as operatic.  I loved all of Shore's music for Lord of the Rings but this album does not lend itself to stirring one's imagination because the music is to non-de-script.
193700788X|5.0|From the first book, dead until dark, I was hoping sookie would end up with Sam.  I think she can live a happy and peaceful life with him.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|The movie had wonderful special effects, though sometimes was slow. I would recommend the movie to those fans of Lord of the Ring.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Movie ok, varies from the story in the book. To bad had to put the movie in to three parts
B00APJLX8E|5.0|I have a teen and a 1st grader.  It's not easy finding middle ground to watch something that's appropriate for everyone, but this one was perfect.  Funny, exciting, and fun to watch.

B002ZG974M|4.0|Originally bought this because our son is serving in the Peace Corps in Namibia, the home of Ponijao.  Watched it several times.  So interesting to see the similarities among the babies even though they're raised in completely different environments.  Wonder if the San Francisco baby's upbringing is &#34;typical&#34; of a U. S. baby's?
B002ZG98UA|5.0|The last good one of the series, in my honest opinion. The CG borders on cheesy at times, but all-in-all it's still an enjoyable movie.
B005KELQEU|3.0|Purchased this item because of the priice. hoped it would be a little better. will purchaae  COVER Rther than the sleeve case at a later date. its just okay.

B003102JDM|4.0|\\"Kafkaesque ...is when you enter a surreal world in which all your control patterns, all your plans, the whole way in which you have configured your own behavior, begins to fall to pieces, when you find yourself against a force that does not lend itself to the way you perceive the world. You don't give up, you don't lie down and die. What you do is struggle against this with all of your equipment, with whatever you have. But of course you don't stand a chance. That's Kafkaesque.\\"--Frederick Karl<br /><br />The Coens philosophical universe is an empty one, a meaningless one, they have no nuggets of wisdom or insights to offer, they have no coping strategy. To them, religion and philosophy and mathematics offer no real assistance, and even art is no real consolation.<br /><br />When Larry Gopnik's life problems/stresses (unsatisifed wife whose met someone new, wife's new man who has the gall to offer him life advice, kids he doesn't understand, disgruntled S. Korean student sending letters to his dept chair undermining his shot at tenure, unstable brother whose own problems/stresses far outweigh his own) become too much for him to bear, he aks a young rabbi for advice, the rabbi just looks out the window at the parking lot and tells him what he needs is a new perspective, a perspective that will allow him to see the world differently but its completely up to Larry Gopnik to figure out how to adjust his perspective/his own perceptual antenna.<br /><br />When Larry Gopnik asks an older rabbi for advice, the rabbi just tells him a long story about the futility of looking for answers or meaning.

B0074MZSWW|4.0|It was like Janis Joplin's long lost soul sister came to life.  Brittany Howard is the most un-Brittany Brittany I have ever heard.  I have hope that this chick never touched a Cheerleading uniform.  Great lyrics, great sound!
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Really good quality of this classic! There is a 20+ minute documentary on the making of the movie which has a lot of insight for fans. There are only 3 deleted scenes, but 1 of them is the alternate ending, a must for any First Blood fan.
0060936223|5.0|Patti Smith rocks!  She navigates a difficult friendship and love affair with Robert while learning to find her voice.  I love the idea that grilled cheese and chocolate milk can be the height of nutrition.  I also can identify with finding stuff on the street to furnish my apartment.  Great book.  Inspires me to continue to write poetry.

B004ZJZQFG|4.0|A very intriguing movie set during WWII and displays a very sound strategy, and then<br />everything seems to literally fall apart.  All the well planned edges disappear. and the<br />new captain really has to think on his feet and hit the ground running.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of the best movies I have enjoyed in years.  The story line was great and the acting superb.  For those over sixty this is a must see.....
B00709GTGS|5.0|This movie handles the time travel by use of a Time Portal, with apparently two fixed points in<br />time.  When the 20th Century man follows the 21st Century time-traveler  thru the time portal,<br />he quickly adapts to his new surroundings.  His romantic techniques seem very effective.<br />I recommend watching this movie at least a couple of times.  It's really well done and doesn't<br />appear to have any irregularity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app has many capabilities. There are several things to do on this app. I have this for pc and my ipod. When i got my kindle, i went straight to the app store and bought this app right away. I realized it has a small interval in ipod and kindle version for updating, but that doesn't matter. This app is very good with soo many blocks and mob added each update. I love this app.

1476734941|3.0|I read through this book and found that the basic idea of a two day fast (or more) is very workable.<br />I found missing was the menu planning, salt/no salt oil/no oils.  I keep track of calories, but not everyone will be aware of what the key to menu planning is without help.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book as it does not cover enough important information to follow through on the diet.
B00A2BTCXI|5.0|&#34;2112&#34; is an essential release in the Rush cannon for too many reasons to list here.  Suffice it to say, it upped the ante in a way that North American prog hadn't ever truly experienced up until that point.  The 5.1 blu-ray audio treatment really allows this classic album to come alive in a way I had never experienced though I've played this album about 2000 times in my life thereabouts.  WOW.
B001ER4CNY|5.0|The packaging is wonderful.  I like the idea of the discs in the bottle!  It arrived on time, and was a little hard to get into, but the discs are in excellent. condition, because I both mine used-like new.  For all I Dream Of Jeannie fans.

B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I use this app on my Samsung Galaxy S3 all the time, been using it for about 6 months. This is the only app I have ever caved on and decided to pay for. What makes this app great?<br /><br />1) Being able to categorize the scanned items.<br />2) Being able to select multiple scans and upload/delete/whatever all at once.<br />3) How well the app adjusts the contrast and \\"senses\\" the document being scanned. It does great even in bad light or with documents that have background watermarks with very light text.<br />4) How easy it is to adjust the boundaries on the scan and the app stretching/adjusting the bounded area to be rectangular -- no need to try and keep the camera as straight and aligned as humanly possible when taking the photo of the document.<br />5) It's actually much faster for me to scan a document and email it with CamScanner than with my all-in-one home office printer. And the app auto-adjusting the contrast makes for a more legible, clearer-text scan than my home office printer.<br /><br />This has got to be my all-time favorite productivity app. It's a must for anyone who routinely scans in receipts or paperwork.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Great adventurous read. Never a dull moment, hard to put it own. Can't wait to read the next one in the series.
B000050HTO|5.0|This CD set is not only a testimony to an extraordinary talented and unique musician but also to the capabilities of digital media technology.  If you are a Dylan fan, you won't be disappointed.
B008XBHBX2|5.0|It really is just an awesome movie.  The acting, directing, shots etc.  It looks great refreshed as an HD resolution.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We saw them on Tv and ordered the CD. The only negative is that one of the songs we saw on tv wasn't on the CD but I can't remember which one at the moment since we bought it a few months ago.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good game. I like the progression in the game. In resume a good game for travel time, entertaining and fun. keep it up.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|What can't Peter Jackson do with Tolkien's wonderful children's book.<br />It has been raised into the realms of adult fare but retains it's roots.<br />The visuals and characters alone are enough to keep everyone happy.<br />Some of the dwarfs, like Thorin,Kili and Fili are definitely eye candy and the others are fun<br />Loved it.
B00CFOGCAG|5.0|Great game<br />It's fun. It's fast.  The art is awesome. Highly recommended this game.  The music is also really good.
0765325950|5.0|After waiting over 20 long years for the conclusion of this series, we've finally arrived. Thank you Brandon Sanderson finishing out Robert Jordan's dream.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I normally don't like tear-jerkers and I rarely like love stories, but I loved this novel that was both. The charaters are sympathetic and the plot-line is unpredictable enough to keep you surprised. I highly recommend this book.
B001TH16DI|4.0|This is an excellent set - the movies look and sound amazing, just wish the special features (which are pretty good) were a little bit better.  Personally I would love to see more about the model making and the special effects done before everything went CGI and maybe even a gag reel, but overall this is a very enjoyable set with a lot of extras.
1742200206|5.0|You can always depend on Lonely Planet to strike the right balance between breeziness and depth as they guide you through the intricacies of major cities. This guide to New York City is no exception. It starts with information for those who may be time-constrained by listing the \\"Top 15\\" attractions of the city, which include everything from the skyscrapers to the art museums to the eateries of Queens. For your convenience they also provide a suggested four-day itinerary, with lunch and dinner ideas. If you're a veteran New York visitor, you probably have your own favorite places, but there is also a helpful \\"What's New\\" page with a few featured restaurants, hotels, and attractions.<br /><br />More detailed information is included on a neighborhood basis, with sights, eateries, and other features highlighted for eight sections of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. There is also a feature for day-trips from the city which has a very high degree of detail.<br /><br />It's now required that guides provide items of interest to the LGBT community, and this guide provides a couple of pages of ideas for gays and references sprinkled throughout the listings. There is even a timeline of LGBT history in the city.<br /><br />Of course one of the major attractions of NYC is the shopping, and the guide's shopping listings are quite comprehensive. As a photographer, I went looking in the index and sure enough found B&H Photo-Video listed with a brief description.<br /><br />The maps are good, including a pull-out one, and the book is supplemented by LP's sleek and well-organized website for the latest updates. Lonely Planet still rules in the world of travel guides.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game. Very good game for the price. It's a long game and will keep you busy for days depending on how much time you play daily.  Would be a great game for a long car ride or flight. Creepy, exciting, and a great mystery. I highly recommend it!

B00005R87Q|3.0|Fast and the Furious is one of the best examples of vicarious entertainment in the movie industry. Anyone who likes action, nice cars, racing, women etc. will find enjoyment from this movie and this franchise in one way or another. This film is a basic popcorn flic. There is not deep plot or deep characters here. So people looking for those elements in this film will be disappointed. However, most people probably knew not to expect such elements from a movie like this anyway, from the title to the trailers. I knew what I was getting when I watched this. So I enjoyed this film mostly.<br /><br />The characters are not great, though the characters are not what people are looking for in this movie anyway. The film stars Brian O'Conner, played by Paul Walker, who is an FBI agent. He is investigating hijackings caused by a street gang being led by Dominic Toretto, played by Vin Diesel. Paul Walker does fine overall in the film. His character I rooted for. However, I do not by for one second that this guy is an FBI agent. Nothing about his character makes be believe he would qualify for the FBI. When he tries to sound professional, it's not believable.<br /><br />Vin Diesel goes good in the film as well. I am a fan of Vin Diesel as an actor. He is one of my favorite aspects of the film. Michelle Rodriguez is also in the film, but does not have that much to do. The side cast are fine. I did not really care for them, but I never found them annoying.<br /><br />The action and racing is the highlight of the film and it's done well. The races are fun, and the action ( mainly car chases) will have you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film. It's not a deep movie, but it's not supposed to be. It's a popcorn flick meant to appeal to guys, and especially teenage guys. That's why I call it vicarious entertainment. Every guy secretly dreams about being an action hero, driving a nice car, getting all the women. So many guys secretly would envision themselvesas Paul Walker or Vin Diesel's character, or one of the other character in the film. That's why I say this is vicarious entertainment.
B001DM1VXE|5.0|Enjoyed every scene in the move. Recommend it for thrill seekers. Climax part is the part and liked the way director handled the scenes.
B00008G7UJ|2.0|The Leonardo DiCaprio version of Romeo and Juliet, at the end of the day, is a poor attempt of modernizing a Shakesperean classic. I'm not a big fan of romances. However, I do respect Romeo and Juiet as a classic story. There are other problems that I had with the film other than the romance.The cast is not the greatest.<br /><br />The side cast do alright overall. However, DiCaprio and Claire Danes as Romeo and Juliet, do not sell it in my opinion. DiCaprio and Danes, in my opinion, do not sell that Shakesperean dialog. Their performances felt forced.The production values are great from a technical level. However, I'm not a fan of the modern setting.<br /><br />The director, Baz Luhrmann, who also directed Moulin Rouge, has a tendency to take a classic tale and try to modernize it, which does not work in my opinion. It's not as bad as Moulin Rouge where the setting is the 1800s but the music is from the late 1900s, where here everything is modernized. However, I still feel something is off. This is probably because I'm comparing this to the 1968 film. I did like the film okay. I felt that film capured the setting and the feel of the tale much better than this film.<br /><br />Overall if you want a faithful adaptation of the classic Shakesperean play, watch the 1968 movie. Give this a skip.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I started yesterday and can't put it down.  Some levels,are extremely challenging.  Lots of fun.  Even my kids like it.
159420411X|5.0|The Signal and the Noise- Why so many predictions fail but some don't is a great overview of statistical reasoning and examples of where statistical reasoning is needed.  It is well written has a host of topics, always tries to be honest in its reflection on events and focuses on process over outcome consistently.  It is refreshing reminder about how biases impact our ability to reason correctly and get int the way of remembering the world is probabilistic.  The book is split into lots of small chapters.<br /><br />The Signal and the Noise is split into 13 chapters each mostly self-contained but the chapters build the case of why one should reason probabilistically and use bayesian inference.  It starts with the financial crisis and how the financial meltdown in 2008 was incorrectly described as a once in a lifetime event.  The author describes quite accurately that the modelling of house price correlations was incorrectly assumed and how small changes in correlation assumption had very large impacts on loss likelihoods of CDOs.  He goes on to show that the sample space and history used to reason was too myopic and the overconfidence in the dataset is an example of not using practical reasoning.  The author then goes into experts opinions and shows how wrong they often are and goes into the study on how there are two primary types of people who make predictions- foxes and hedghogs.  Where the fox makes bold unlikely predictions that reward the predictor with much fame when correct but such predictions rarely prove accurate vs hedghogs which know the world is riddled with uncertainty and caveat predictions on the basis of that uncertainty.  This is a very valuable chapter in why looking broadly and remembering information is imperfect is so important for thinking about distributional properties rather than focusing on predicting outcomes that one has almost no chance of achieving.  The author discusses his work on baseball and goes through Moneyball and statistics vsscouts, he is very humble about the value of each and how scouts do and always have used statistics implicity.  He discusses the weather and the modelling of nonlinear dynamical systems.  He also discusses the prediction of rare-events like earthquakes that follow power laws.  The author discusses Katrina and biological outbreaks.  He goes into the poker craze that consumed the US last decade and the distribution of profits of the poker game amongst the group.  He also discusses the markets and rational bubbles and herding as well as the truth and failures of efficient markets.  He discusses the climate as another non-linear dynamical system in which many predictions are made.  Finally he goes into our knowledge and what our knowledge base allows us to predict.<br /><br />There are many great examples in this of statistical reasoning and how, when properly applied, provides much insight about best process.  It is well written and very well researched.  The ideas in the book are fairly repetitive but the re-articulation in several examples reinforce the point.  I think this is a great combination of popular math/science/economics/behavioural science and is enjoyable and insightful.  Definitely a great overview of how statistics should be applied more often when thinking about most of the problems we face.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These books are action-packed yet heart-jerking as Suzanne Collins takes you through the life of a hard-headed girl surviving through poverty while trying to protect the ones she love. Absolutely BRILLIANT!!!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Well done. We've seen the live show five times and loved this movie. We really looked forward to getting this.

B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Nice graphics, cute and familiar characters, some fun facts...but you really can't get anywhere without spending money on it...which I am not willing to do. Disney makes enough money, and this game is cute and had me excited for the Nemo sequel. Isn't that enough of a benefit to the company? Is it really necessary to charge money in the game?
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game 3d is so cool without the glasses I play this all the time on my grandmother's kindle it's so amazing.

B003L77FYS|1.0|I ordered and received this item awhile ago.  I love the show, one of my favorites, but the dvd's themselves aren't so wonderful.  They came packaged and looking great, but when I got to the 5th and last disk of the set it would not play.  Not on my laptop, nor the dvd player to my tv and not on the dvd at my parent's house either.  I once got it to play on my mom's desktop, but only once.  Since then, it doesn't play at all.  Tonite I happened to be working on something and wanted some background sound to drown out other noises, put in the 1st desk of the set... would not play.  Tried the second disk, it skipped and jumped and stalled so much I got annoyed and took it out. So much for background noise while I worked.  Now, I'm going to have to repurchase the set from another seller just so that I can still have all the seasons on dvd.  I paid $20 for it but will now have to pay another $20 because it has stopped working.  The disks are clean, not scratched up, but still does not play.  Weird and very annoying.
B005GSVFAK|5.0|I purchased this dvd because I bought a 3d tv and needed a movie to try it out, although I saw this movie a long time ago when it came out, I think it is a very good movie .The 3d worked well and the price paid was fair, it is harder to find 3d movies than I expected and I was looking for a used one that wouldn't cost $35 or so.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I originally had the E5 version, and didn't consider the all metal design to be a big plus.  This was until I ordered the E6 and it arrived damaged, and looked like it was run over by a USPS vehicle.  The plastic case didn't stand a chance.  Likely, it was machine stamped, and that was what damaged it.  The E5 would have probably survived without damage.  Other than that, I have to agree with most reviewers that the sound quality is improved in the E6, as compared to the E5.  I use this to boost the signal of my Samsung Note 2 in my car, since it doesn't have a high enough headphone output.  Depending on the source, the E5 sometimes didn't have enough juice, even when adjusting the car radio to &#34;10&#34;.  The E6 does the job.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Ok I was totally addicted  then in survival mode it won't even let me pick up my blocks. It only affected stuff I had recently made at first but it just now it has officially affected EVERYTHING!!!! Totally  not worth 7 bucks.

B00BV9Y8B6|5.0|Nice edition of the movie Hobbit With the 64 page collectible books it's a very nice edition of à great movie!
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|This movie is about a capella.  A capella is people performing songs purely by their voices.  No musical instruments are involved.  It takes a high level of singing skills, because you have to sing your notes right, sing at the same volume, harmonize, and be on beat with your band mates.  Sounds difficult.  But thanks to Autotune!  You can sing it anyway you want, and the Autotune programmer will produce \\"perfect\\" sounding a capella tunes sung by you and your mates!  Anybody can do a capella!  Yeah! ... But, wait a minute: Is autotuned, computer-manipulated a capella still a capella?<br /><br />You'll like this movie if you<br />(1) consider heavily Autotuned a capella still a capella;<br />(2) find exaggerated vomiting and a girl lying on the vomits fun to watch; and<br />(3) can take Anna Kendrick's \\"I-hate-everybody\\" look and \\"I-call-the-shots\\" behavior.<br /><br />I'm giving it two stars mainly for the reasonably good picture quality.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book had all the greatness you would expect from the Ice and Fire series. Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Honestly what's not to like.  Magnentic charger which seems to charge much faster than on USB connection.  This is not a data connection - it's for charging only.
0231161166|5.0|Our understanding of the workings of our genetic code keeps changing. The big advance a decade ago was evodevo (evolutionary developmental biology) which explained the role of HOX and Sonic Hedgehog genes.  Now comes epigenetics which explains the external factors which turn on and/or suppress  gene expression at critical junctures in the fate of cells.  For a layperson who wants to keep up with the latest in genetics, Nessa Carey's book is essential reading.  For years, I (like many others) have talked about the non-protein coding component of our genome as &#34;junk DNA.&#34; No more.  Ms. Carey's exposition has added enormously to my understanding of this field.  Tough going at times, but well written, and compelling.
193700788X|1.0|Honestly, I can't figure out what CH is thinking......or what happened to her ability to write.  As an author, you write novels in the hope that people will read them and enjoy them.  Why on earth would you put out this horrible, badly written atrocity.  Where were her editors?  I can't tell if CH had written these characters for so long that she came to hate them, or if she has come to hate the fans who made her so popular.  And, lady.....it was the fans that put you where you are.  Maybe she thought it was like the HBO show True Blood, and she could just throw continuity out the window and to heck with anything that made any sense.<br /><br />This is one of the saddest things I've ever read, and I have no way to get back those wasted hours of my life.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|A very good and sad film, you have to sit and pay attention to be able to understand waht goes on.

B00BF2RTO2|3.0|Yes, people wanted to have the Seventh Son concert, but the other main reason, and for some people THE MAIN REASON for buying this is to have part 3 of the History of the Band. The first two were quite good, with part 1 being stellar. They are both of feature film length, but this one isn't even an hour long. What gives Steve? Didn't quite up the irons, now did ya?<br /><br />Also, the people who are going to buy this are die-hard fans. They want Somewhere in Time concert footage, and if you explain why there is little professional quality footage, but that there is a fair amount of bootleg quality, then they'll curse Rod for nixing the concert film in 86, and then thank the lord for what is available. So don't leave it out because it's not up to snuff. Hell, the fifteen-year old target audience frame around the documentary isn't up to snuff but we still watch it.<br /><br />Also, just to clarify, putting 12 Wasted Years in the package in no way makes for a shortened documentary. Also, it does not create a space problem because The Early Years and Live After Death are both packed with extras, especially the Early Years.<br /><br />So here's incentive for ya, Steve. If you go back and fix this product by extending the documentary and adding in at least one hours worth of additional Somewhere in Time footage, then I would buy the amended product, effectively buying it twice. I also might buy some of the more recent albums just to be nice. (Though, &#34;These Colours Don't Run&#34; is awesome).
B0042RUMIW|4.0|I chose this rating because the dvd has a slight defect. There is a small pause in the picture and sound about halfway through the program. I have used this product for approximately two months.
0316228532|3.0|Okay. Well, this was interesting. Not Harry Potter of course though I noticed a few phrases that were reminiscent. \\"Geroff me\\" for example. There is an interesting interplay between the youth and the adults too. As usual the youth out smart their elders. Some magic involved too - though computers this time instead of wands, but this still means ghosts speak to the living. It seems we still get the same mix of kids too. Fats instead of Big D. Kids lie that they have strange diseases that scared people away from them. Kids break lots of rules. They moon other teams and win medals for it. But there is much more drinking and many more words that could not have been appropriate in the HP books - at least up until 7. But I agree with two of the three main phrases in the reviews gathered so far that:<br />\\"After reading the Harry Potter series, I expected a bit more from J.K. Rowling in The Casual Vacancy. \\"<br />\\"Like a bad movie that you just want to end so you can say you know how it ends. \\"<br /><br />I am not so sure there were too many characters. We were dealing with a whole town. Might have been too few actually. By comparison though I think of C. P. Snow's \\"The Masters\\". There we have all this sort of back fighting over an election. No kids involved there of course, and the language is much nicer. So I would recommend that book over this one if you like this sort of thing. Of course, here we have the kids and sordid acts, some in bushes, and that I suppose is supposed to introduce us to the sorts of abuse many children in poor conditions are experiencing, and Lumos is aimed at helping such conditions I guess. All in all, this is not a keeper. I am glad I read it so I know what it is about. This is JKR after all.
B00632HWOG|1.0|This app does not work well. Several times it deleted part or all of the text I'd typed in the body of an email. It locked up often. Using it was very frustrating. I finally uninstalled it.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I was hesitant to pay for this and have never paid this price before. I have to say now I have finished it - I am glad that I bit the bullet. This game was all that it promised and more. Being limited on funds I can't say that I would pay full price again but I LOVED it. Thanks to the makers.
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I originally rated this one very low because I guess I had to get used to their new approach. This album is different from their previous three albums. Regardless, it still has the things Lady Antebellum fans expect- great songs with great vocals and instrumentation. Best songs are: \\"Better Off Now,\\" \\"Golden,\\" and \\"It Ain't Pretty.\\"
B003G4W49C|5.0|Is just as good as everyone said it would be. I should have read this book a long time ago.
B00AZKCU7G|3.0|Amazing acting and plot. Did anyone else struggle with getting the blu-ray to work on their player? I have a nice Samsung model and it just hangs. Thankfully I purchased the combo pack and the DVD works (but I really wanted to see the blu-ray).
0689877692|1.0|I bought this book for my son and I to read together. It was supposed to be in \\"good\\" condition, but it arrived at a weak \\"poor\\". There are entire sections missing from the book, and I can't even count the shapes because most of them are missing. I bought from More Than Words bookstore, because I wanted to support the non profit. This book was destroyed when I received it, and my son was very disappointed.
156224003X|5.0|It will change the way you think about music and maby life!!!!<br />I recomment it to all musicians and also none musicians who like to play music!
B00AIBZM40|5.0|This is a great horror film especially for being only PG rated. There is almost no blood (save a few spots on a collar early on there is none), but this is a ghost story not a gore fest. This movie is designed to creep you out not gross you out. The ghost is extremely well designed (a real actor not a goofy CG project) and the story really pulls the viewer out of their comfort zone. You can feel the anxiety in the characters and what they are dealing with. This film will have to you talking to the TV - you will get involved with the characters and emotionally attached.<br /><br />Yes the ending is not what you expect to happen but it makes sense and completes the story, this is not left open for a part two.<br /><br />So sit back, turn off the lights, and turn up the volume. You will enjoy this one.<br /><br />\\"What's under the bed?\\"
0385342071|5.0|Sam is having a really bad day when she loses her engagement ring, which is a family heirloom, but on top of that her phone gets stolen. Luckily she happens to find a new one right in a trashcan and after helping the owner of the phone, they make a deal so she gets to keep it. But Sam, the owner of said phone, might regret that decision. Before he knows it Poppy is medling in his professional and even personal life, throwing everything upside down. Poppy believes she is just helping him to learn proper messaging etiquette.<br /><br />Meanwhile she is still looking for her ring and planning a wedding with her fianc&eacute; Magnus. Trying to hide she lost his ring to him and his family ends up with some hilarious reindeer mittens, gauze complications and even calling in the help of her new-found friend Sam. Too bad it all doesn't matter, 'cause nothing she does will make her welcome to Magnus family of geniuses. Feeling dumber by the minute in their presence, she can't wait for the wedding to be over.<br /><br />Poppy gets more and more involved in Sam's life. Before she knows it they are not just talking through the phone, but meeting in person and what a pleasant surprise that is. Of course at some point it all has to go wrong and Poppy has to make some tough decisions, but luckily she has her text buddy to help her.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's stand alone novels (Shopaholic somehow doesn't do it for me) and with her latest book \\"I've Got Your Number\\" she doesn't disappoint. Like always it's fast paced and keeps you on the edge of the seat. Strange situations you could have never imagined, but she makes it believable. Mixing some typical British humor in there and I'm completely sold. Sophie has got you rooting for Poppy and wishing for more. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone! Even though I just finished reading the book, I have to hold myself back to not start from the top again. What can I say, I am a book addict :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns! Page turner is an understatement. I would recommend this book and can't wait to read more Gillian Flynn novels.
B006ELF6AI|4.0|I love this show and couldn't wait to get it for my Kindle.  It is a great way to watch a video.  My only complaint (and why it was rated 4 stars) is that when you buy it on Cloud, they do not include the extras that are on the discs that you purchase directly from the store.  I do not see why this is the case.  I love watching all the bloopers, deleted scenes and commentaries that are included on the boxed sets.
B005PK1G76|5.0|This fits really well on our city mini.  It works well for keys, pacifiers, burp clothes, sunglasses, toys and a soda for mom.  The holder we had on our old stroller always caused the liquid to spill.  This seems to work much better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A friend introduced me to Nicolas Sparks with Message in A Bottle and I loved it so have purchase more of his books
193700788X|4.0|I think the last book in a series is almost always going to disappoint some people but satisfy others. For those who were disappointed, I might suggest you go back and read some of the short stories Harris wrote within the series.  They supplied information and background that would make some of the results in Dead Ever After more logical. No, this is not the strongest book in the series, but it did point Sookie to a more normal future.  Harris tied up some questions neatly but left others in question. Sort of like life.<br /><br /> I think maybe the best thing she could have done (and hopefully still will consider doing) are short stories or novels with different character viewpoints.  Let Sookie move to the background a while.  I think the way Kelley Armstrong changes up main characters to give different viewpoints might work here.
193700788X|1.0|As a loyal reader of this series I could not believe how sloppy this final book was. It was as if Ms. Harris HAD to write it like a child forced to write an essay. Some of the best characters were in and out faster than you could turn the page. It was a train wreck. For closures sake, I gave it one star. If there was a 1/2 star I would have used that instead. In any case I no longer have any desire to read any other books from this author. Overall: Sloppy, Predictable, and Disappointing. I hope that Alan Ball does not follow this course with True Blood because it would honestly lose its fan base.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Great movie huge Norman Reddus fan. Action packed, lots of excitement. Worth watching more than one time. Cult classic always
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I'd rather my daughter have Bella from Twilight as a role model than my son having Augustus Waters as one. Putting an unlit cigarette in your mouth and calling it a metaphor, seriously? If the main characters were 60 year old retired professors they'd still be annoyingly pretentious, not to mention completely unbelievable. I checked out John Green's youtube videos after trying this book, and I can tell you that the author really put himself into his work.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is the best Les Mis concert ever.  There is not a better Val Jean than Colm Wilkerson.  Javert, sung by Phillip Quast, is  masterful. The entire ensemble work well together, and the orchestra and choir are impressive.  This is Les Mis at its best, and I have enjoyed hearing and seeing this DVD several times already.
B009G78EE2|5.0|Its about time someone put out some meaningful lyrics. I can listen to this whole album without having to skip songs, which makes me happy.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|'The Help' is my all-time favorite movie.  Got a great price and have already watched it twice (in addition to the other 3 times).
B008CRC506|4.0|I like this item very much.  I love the tv show and enjoy being able to watch the first season again and again.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|well it is super fun but I really wish I had more time. I wish I had an hour and thirty minutes.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Great game! Challenging at times, but overall a fun game.Great way to pass the day or hours. Get it today!
1594202842|1.0|amy \\"chua\\" is one of those asians that are actually more white but trying to be more asian cus she married a white guy and attempts at implementing what she \\"thinks\\" is asian through her own warped sense of what her own parents did to her.. ultimately -- she sounds like an NPD to me with identity issues and rich-white-people problems (top 3%, but boo-boo they are upper middle class only)...for god sakes my mother was more worried about feeding us than teaching us piano lessons.. and the evidence is clear -- she wrote a book about it.. when's the last time a real tiger mom freaking had time to write a freaking book?! lol
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|like the just wish u didn't have to spend so much real money on the game. other then that the game is really cool and I love playing it..
B005LAIH4A|3.0|Unfortunatly this ended up being on NetFlix a few weeks later.  Did not want to purchase the DVD as my kids do not take care of them.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|First pinball game that I bought. I've had a really fun time playing this. I've enjoyed the sounds and action, I will keep this game to play for a long time.
B005BCE7FQ|1.0|I bought a new 4 disc Rio 3D.The 3D was very choppy and hert my eyes. So I checked for updates on my 3D dvd player. Know new updates. Ihave 12 3D movies that work fine and I took the 3D movie to a freinds and it was very bad. I'm sure it was know fault of yours but I wanted to let you know. Thank you for your time  Sue .
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I read this for 2nd time and I love it again, first time was in Spanish, Paulo cohelo is simply amazing
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I finished this book in one day. MY NEW FAVORITE! Already preordered the sequel! Can't wait until 2014 for it to come out!
B00BYOEZTI|5.0|This was so good can't wait to watch it again, maybe on a newer and bigger television from Amazon.com. Hobbit's are the a close relative of my short family.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book is even better than the first one. I cannot wait to read the next book. I am going to read the book I found on Amazon that is called, Dream Dark: A Beautiful Creatures Story. It said that you don't have to read it, but it helps give more to the story in the next book. I cannot wait to read the rest of the saga. Very entertaining.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid and it is even better in HD and on a Big Screen TV compared to a little tv when I was a kid.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|We can't use the auto-off feature with the car in the driveway because the range goes into the house and it never shuts off.  I wish these things came with a squelch control to limit the distance they transmit. The longer distance is more of an inconvenience than a plus feature. The sound is good and clear. The magnetic mount is very convenient. It is definitely a lot better than the Motorola Roadster I just returned. I had to re-pair that one every time time I used it which was downright rediculous.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|My wife and I are hooked on Dexter.  great story line and characters.  Wish there was someone like that in  real life.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Why not change the title to &#34;Simpy Sookie&#34; because there really weren't any other of the interesting characters in this book. I felt like I was reading a teenager's diary ~Boring~  Next time try killing them off. I am but a simple reader, but It was obvious to me that this Author lost her zeal two books ago.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Even though the movie is a bit vulgar, it set the movie perfect.  It had its regular Tarantino craziness, which I like and the comedy is great.  I would defintly recommend
B00A83075M|5.0|I've seen this movie twice now, it's very funny and creative. Animation and storyline are great! I liked it a lot better than I thought I would and it kept me laughing though the entire movie with it's funny game and/or candy references. Watch this movie, it's bound to turn into a classic!
B00006I53S|4.0|PROS:<br />Nice texture, good quality and price, great pictures with no aberration<br /><br />CONS:<br />A bit heavy, 28 mm is not the best for panoramic pics<br /><br />I recommend it anyhow, but along with other lenses to cover the full range
B0060MYM7O|4.0|The second season continues the story of the first. It brings in a little magic as well as some of the living dead for those that like that series. I can't wait until I get season 3.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I got the first book in this series sent to me 7 years ago by accident; read it, and was instantly smitten with the characters.I have, since then, preordered every book and waited patiently for Sookies story to continue; she is, by far, my favorite person to read about. I realize that all things must end, but I'm sure gonna miss Skokie Stackhouse.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Book was better than the movie...better character development. An entertaining movie that allows the reader a glimpse into another's thoughts and reasonings.
0345529057|5.0|I received this book set very quickly. Love this series! I am very happy with this purchase. Typset is very legible, no torn or ripped pages.
B004XZ99LO|3.0|I've been a Cirque fan all my life.  This video offers a small glimpse at what Cirque is, but you won't get much for your time, which is probably why it's low priced.  There's only about four acts of acrobatics/gymnastics to look forward to.  I would rate it lower, but for the price, it's OK.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I'm not all the way finished.  However, does anyone else think that someone else wrote this book?  It's so different . I assumed that since she's made her big bucks that she could care less.  If you haven't purchased this book then don't waste your money = just read the reviews .  I wish I had .  Go to the library and check it out.....I felt like a royally got screwed......Thanks for listening
0525478817|3.0|The book was OK. It showed the life of teenagers with cancer - not a common theme for teen books. I read it and have no desire to re-read it unlike other books. Average book
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Not worth the time loading....can't do anything but make the cat purr and knock him out. I would recommend you pay for this one so he will do more than two things. I was disappointed.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|It is a little heavy so I often find myself using it in the landscape position or resting it on something to tilt it slightly but great protection for the kindle
B00992CF6W|5.0|The kids absolutely LOVE this game. I do not have to worry about content and it works great on the Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this game.
1451673442|3.0|I don't like that it is not made like the other ones with the hard cover and fun shiny paper inside. I am more of that visual-type of person, therefore if the presentation and texture of the book does not feel right and just looks boring, then for sure I won't finish reading it before I am done with it.
B005HSL626|5.0|My children love this game (and so do I) , it gets played a lot! Would recommend this game for ALL ages.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|Have been listening for three weeks, it keeps getting better. I would love to have a singing voice like that, so deep, so warm, so good.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I can't think of one good thing to say about this book.  I have suggested this series to friends and family for years ans was really looking forward to seeing how it ended. Now I just want my time and the money I wasted back. Awful!
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|This is a  feel good series that that you can sit down with the family and watch together. There is comedy, drama, action, and magic.  Merlin, of course, was a wizard. However, there are some actions scenes, which may be too  intense for the very youngest, but it is not at all the blood and gore that some shows feel they most have.  The only down side I see to this series is that this is the last season.  I just hope something resurrects in it's place. I loved all the characters, and will miss them.  I would not hesitate to recommend this show
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love it.definately 5 stars here His voice has never change over his entire career. He will out last everyone throughout the years.<br /><br />Looking forward to his next album
193700788X|5.0|After all the controversy with this book I feel compelled to write a review. It was a very good book, very entertaining and hard to put down, it kept me interested in the story till the end and it had some excellent twists. These are above all mysteries and adventure with some romance thrown in. I found the ending satisfying, Sookie showed growth. She knows she is where she is where she belongs. That she will flourish with or without a man. And she decided to give a good man, who is her best friend , partner and someone who could give her what she wants in life, a chance.
B007W8S2MG|3.0|Originally meant for the PS2 console, Persona 4's day based gameplay cycle is quite suited to handheld gaming.  The whole game is broken up into days on a calendar, and each day can be managed by the player to last anywhere from 10 minutes or more than an hour.  It just depends on how many activities the player engages in before returning to his bedroom.  Similarly the 2D art in the graphics really make the Vita's OLED colors pop.  On the down side, the game's 3D graphics are somewhat dated, given it was originally a PS2 game---and a not so impressive one at that.  Unlike say, Uncharted Golden Abyss, this isn't the title to get that \\"Portable PS3\\" experience.<br /><br />The game itself is a refreshing JRPG.  It's unique in it's own genre, but more importantly totally unlike 99% of the brown-grey dreck of gaming right now.  Persona 4 has a fun youthful attitude.  The soundtrack is made up of original pop music.  The gameplay leverages resource management and character building as much as level grinding.  The combat system is never dull either.  Even regular enemies offer thoughtfully balanced and strategic challenges, and collecting personas is addicting.<br /><br />The story while interesting at first, and well localized, becomes tiresome.  Based on a super natural murder mystery, it relies on a formula where you rescue characters to build out your party.  While the new characters have entertaining peppy personalities, they all mysteriously suffer from amnesia, which halts story progression making many dungeons feel redundant.  The amount of high quality voice acting is impressive in a game of this scope.  And the tone makes for a nice balance of intrigue and humor---somewhat like a Scooby Doo or a Joss Whedon show set in a Japanese high school.<br /><br />All in all Person 4 is very playable and charming, but its hurt by a repetitive dungeon structure.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Ironic title to give this book.  If you read the story you would see why.  I really liked the premise of the book and how a society could become our worst enemy.  &#34;The Giver&#34; is a story to share with children everywhere so they appreciate all that they have in life and their freedoms.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I haven't watched them all yet.....love the ones that I have. I am a huge Columbo fan and I thought this was a good pric e for the whole collection.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|like the game but it is way too hard to get pearls. everything else is good though. I recommend it to anyone. reminds me of farmville.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I purchased this stylus mainly for drawing, with the hopes of being able to achieve fine detailing, however this was not the case, even with the 3 different size tips. I do love it for pretty much everything else though. It is lightweight and easy to grip, just like an ink pen. It also seems to be very durable, haven't had any problems with the tips coming off like a former stylus I had. Overall I was happy with my purchase, just don't know if the different size tips are even needed, because I seem to have the same results regardless of which tip I use.
0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games was like a bag of warm chocolate chip cookies to me!  I literally devoured it like I was starving.  I saw the movie first and really loved it but then my 12 year old grandson (that's right, I am about as far from being a Young Adult Reader as you can get) told me that I simply had to read the book...it's GREAT, Nana, he said!  And he was oh so right.  The story is simply gripping, the characters and settings are so real but deliciously fantastical at the same time!  All the time I was reading it I was completely immersed in the story but at the same time marveling at the creative genius of Susan Collins.  I mean how many authors can write with such skill that they can make you cry out, gasp, even weep when you already know exactly what is going to happen on every single page! Absolutely the best read I have had in a long time...cannot wait to start Catching Fire and then Mockingjay!  Susan Collins and Katniss Everdeen...I LOVE YOU!!!
193700788X|1.0|I have loved reading this series.  In fact I had not been introduced to it until February and read the entire series in two months.  Then I waited for this to come out.  I read it in one night and while the writing and story line from the get go was forced and contrived, I pushed through in the hopes that it would miraculously turn around.  It only got worse.  Harris you owe your finds and your character more.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Very very fun game I highly recommend this game! I play it all the time but the cost of new games is very high which is unfortunate.
1451695195|5.0|Well done book that weaves the doctors experience of his journey to the afterlife and back. His scientific knowledge as a physician makes it all the more fascinating!
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|This mic was a great addition to my bag of tricks. I can studio a capella groups and large events with ease as well as interviews all from a d 3100. This is great for a photographer who dables in a bit of videography.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Interesting to see the different lives of the characters in their daily interaction with each other and how the ruling family conducted themselves.
0385360177|5.0|5/5 cuz it was fast and on time  works good love  it<br />ty so much well be buying from u more
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The game has enough quests to be interesting. Really like the the number and types of plants and animals. No ads is a plus.
0385360185|5.0|5/5 cuz it was fast and on time  works good love  it<br />ty so much well be buying from u more
0142421715|1.0|I really thought this book was going to be good since Matched was excellent. I'm half way through this book and I seriously can NOT take it anymore. Like every other review says, NOTHING happens. Absolutely nothing. There are way too many symbols, too much talk about poetry, that I find it completely boring. The writing for this book just makes me want to go to sleep. Everytime I start reading this book, I have to force myself to read it because I have the trilogy that I got for a present. I can not get attach to the characters, like I was in Matched. They are all boring and do not express emotion. The book tries to, but i am just not feeling it. The characters are too mature. I'm going to continue reading the book, but I am more tempted to skip to the end. I HOPE the third book is good because it is a big book.<br /><br />UPDATE.....<br />I absolutely hate this book. It was such a let down from the first book. NOTHING happens. Nothing surprising at the ending. I am surprised this book got 3, 4, or 5 stars. It is terrible! All the characters annoy me except for Indie. She was the only character that was interesting with how sneaky she was and how she always tried to get what she wanted. Cassia was annoying and was so strung over about Ky. I'm sick of both of them. Eli was annoying and asked way too many questions. There was no real point for him to be in this book. I usually do not mind switching characters for each chapter. I like to know both characters perspective, but in this book it did not work out. Like other reviews, they sound exactly the same. There were times where I was confused on whose perspective I was reading. Also, I hate the writing for this book. The author tries to make each page worded like poetry or one of the characters have to talk about poetry. Its annoying and I lost interest in it. Everything had to have a deep meaning or a symbolism in it.I was so happy when I finished this book even though it felt like two weeks of life just disappeared.This book could have been summed up in a chapter or the author could have added more danger or something in it. I am left with more questions than answers. Who is the enemy? Why is the Rising similar to the Society when they are suppose to rebel and be different? What exactly is sorting? I never understood that. I couldn't tell if Cassia was sorting Ky's personality or what. I neve quite understood what sorting was. The author could've took the canyon to a whole knew level but she didnt. I am already reading Reached and its a little improvement on writing skils than this book was. It better be good because its over 500 pages.
B00BWDJILG|3.0|I was excited for this release, but after a few listens I haven't found any songs (originals or covers) that were particularly memorable. Redman's tone is amazing and there's tons of subtle nuance in the whole ensemble's playing, but unless you're really focusing on the  interplay of the band members, the music comes across pretty watered down. It's a great album if you like jazz to relax to, but isn't one that will make you a lifelong fan (which Redman's [[ASIN:B00002DEIX Beyond]] did for me.)
1476734941|4.0|The book arrived very fast.  Really easy to work with. I would recommend this book as a great gift for anyone who wants to easily lose weight.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app.  I don't use it at home because I have an electric ambient noise maker, but I use it at work to drown out my noisy co-workers.  Any time they get a little rambunctious I turn on the sounds of ocean waves or birds chirping and all my stress melts away.<br /><br />One of the best features of this app is that different sounds can be combined or layered.  Ocean + Birds Chirping + Gentle Wind is very relaxing.  You can play with different combinations, and when you find one you like you can save it as a favorite.  Cool.<br /><br />The only feature I would like to see added to the app is the ability to play the sounds in the background while using a different app, reading a book, or surfing the web.  Currently when you switch away from the app, the melody shuts off.<br /><br />I initially downloaded the free version, but it is well worth paying for the premium version.  This is an awesome app.
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|I like the songs he picks and the way he sings them.  He is definitely one of my favorites - right up there with  Toby Keith
B00881VLCE|4.0|Very enjoyable game. Just like doing actual jigsaw puzzles without cluttering up a table. Can choose number of pieces depending on your mood
B00992CF6W|5.0|Poptropica and mine craft are the first time in the first place of the kindle lite version from your computer and mine craft of the first time to<br />Free download and install the kindle
1400069742|5.0|Even though I knew that this was a different time with different attitudes toward the races, I didn't realize that Lindbergh was actually a believer in eugenics, advocated for Nazis in the US, and retained those views even after the war, Compelling and intriguing book!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I downloaded the free app first to try it out, and had to get the full version. Many great features like current temp, lots of alarms, choosing military hours or two twelve hour segments per day. I use the app on my Kindle Fire HD.
B009X01FJS|4.0|This cover is really good if your not needing to charge it. There isn't a space or room for it to charge and use at the same time. Some images need to a certain way, and the stand can't be used.
1423101499|3.0|Wounded deep in battle, he stands stuffed like some soldier undaunted. To her Cheshire smile, he'll stand on file, she's all he ever wanted.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|The picture and sound are great on this Blu-ray and find it's zone free, good to play anywhere ! I love it
B0000026DJ|5.0|Maybe so. Smooth and subtle song stylist Peter Garrett croons his way through pointed and meaningful lyrics written mostly by the drummer, Rob Hirst. Silly love songs? Nary a one, pet.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|It was love at first site for my 12 month grandchild.  She is so happy to hold it and snuggle it to her.  Perfect size and weight and feel for a baby.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|The visual experience is a WOW factor!  I was very disappointed that the movie didn't have the tiger speaking telepathically, as in the novel.  That took away from the story.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Awesome, but it really shows that jane austen was 21 when she wrote this. It is slightly cliche, although it the term may not be applicable considering tat this was what started that cliche.
0425269205|5.0|[[ASIN:193700788X Dead Ever After: A Sookie Stackhouse Novel (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood)]] was far better than I expected, especially after everyone's reviews crucified it. I don't see why everyone is so upset with the ending. It tied up all of the loose ends, everyone stayed true to their characters, and the plot was interesting. The last few books lacked the earlier quality of the beginning of the series. I was glad that she was ending it before it completely crashed and burned. In my opinion Charlaine Harris completely redeemed the series with this last book!<br />Warning small spoilers ahead...<br />Don't get me wrong I really wished she would have ended up with Eric. What woman in her right mind wouldn't like to be his consort for awhile. Seriously, based on his character does anyone see him as a settle down with one woman type of guy. That would be a no. That's part of his charm and allure. Charlaine has been hinting since the first book that Sam and Sookie would be together, so that's not a big surprise. Sookie will get her happily ever after with a mostly normal life, kids, and the whole nine yards. Sam gets his happily ever after. Eric gets more money and power, which is what he strives for. So he gets his happy ending. Everyone gets exactly what they want. Even Bill, much to my detriment. I've never been a fan of Bill. So again, I don't see why everyone was so cranky with their reviews.<br />End of spoilers....<br />It was a great ending to a great series. The fourth book, [[ASIN:0441020445 Dead To The World (Sookie Stackhouse/True Blood, Book 4)]], will forever be my favorite in the series.<br />Thank you Charlaine for sharing Sookie's world with us. Now I'm looking forward to the follow up book [[ASIN:0425269515 After Dead: What Came Next in the World of Sookie Stackhouse]] to see what happened to everyone.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|It was extremely good... A good new introduction back into classics. Very smooth, quiet, and relaxing tempo. I really liked it!
193700788X|2.0|I love this world Charlaine has created and I have been entertained by her but these last two books didn't do it for me. I know this is how she planned it to end all along and great for her but I was not feeling it.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|this is a new classic scary movie. it's a unique story (which is rare these days), there are some great surprise screams, and even the children were good actors. the only downside is that the scary monster looks like a ridiculous cartoon. they should have either NOT shown the monster, so that your imagination runs away with you), or they should have made it a very realistic-looking dead lady. because seeing a ridic monster in the middle of the movie makes you think, oh, what's everyone so afraid of?
0316044695|5.0|Awesome book great shape. These men are American Heroes. The description is written well enough that you can feel like your there.
B00BHU261S|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I really did not go how i expected it to go, but it gave me a lot of background on Hitchcock.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Love the book. The narration is well-written. An eye-opener to what North Korean's ordinary life. A communist country is Nothing to Envy!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Good show I really want to watch the rest of the shows.  I could see getting addicted to this show.
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|For a long time we didn't watch something that genuine funny. No stupid jokes , just everyday family life and we could see ourself in them
B00APUQPX6|4.0|This movie was great for my daughter.  She really enjoyed this movie as she has the rest of the move that have come out.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Ice age is for all generations. This is a third version I believe but nothing less excellent then the first one. That's normally not the case. Love the humor, the story and acting !
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I actually went out and bought this movie.  It is a good movie about older moonshine businesses.  There is a lot of action.
193700788X|1.0|Well this book was an absolute disappointment. I knew all along that Sookie and Eric would never be forever, but SAM? I saw it coming last book when she used the Cluviel Dor to save him, but this book he was acting like a brat. Honestly. So I don't buy into that whole Sookie and Sam love. It's ridiculous. I would much rather her be alone then with him. She's back to the beginning. Charlaine Harris let us all down with this ending. It just proves that she sold out. She wrote three more books that she wasn't inspired to write. All for the money. I hope she's happy with the reputation she has gotten. I wish she would have cared more for her characters. We stuck with her to the end, and this is the crap we get? Bringing back old villans, and then have her stay with the boss? Be called Crazy Sookie for her whole life then suddenly everyone is there for her? & ERIC? A slave for 200 years? She ended their relationship so carelessly, that it seemed such a waste all the books dedicated to her putting them together, getting their issues resolved. I am just really dissapointed at this point. I cannot believe that I rooted for this character for so long and in the end I forgot why.
B005Q1W10A|4.0|It was still very good and loved watching it but felt that the war portion made it a little depressing.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|This a wonderful life-affirming film that will resonant with young and old alike and encourages the notion that life is a journey with many roads,stellar performances beautifully shot,uplifting soundtrack. A encouraging lovely film that will have the audience laughing and crying and loving every minute. Highly recommended!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|I started out loving this but then was depressed over the younger sisters death but soon forgot about that and was so happy that there was another baby to be born soon.  Then I could have given up and never seen anymore with the way this one ended so I hope I will recover before there is a season 4.
B00BOXZAJ8|5.0|My son and I saw this at a sneak preview.  It only showed at a more independent theatre.  Too bad!  Never even saw it advertised.  Both my 11 year old son and I loved this movie.  Good story with the most Increadable eye candy.  Was looking to see if it was released to own yet.  Looks like we'll have to wait.  Can't wait to watch it again.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|When I first started this book, it was very difficult getting through the first 50 pages.  The author dips in and out of different dialects, and time periods, tying 6 distinct stories together into a sort of compilation.  I wouldn't call it one large story.  Each character and section of the book is distinct, even though they are connected in some way.  The overall theme is humanity's impending doom, based on our natural instinct to destroy ourselves and everything around us.  The book makes you think, not something you can read casually, you need to dive into it.  My least favorite story was Sloosha's Crossing, although absolutely necessary for the story, was just difficult to read.  The dialect was almost illegible, you had to get used to it.  Took a few pages.  The second half of Adam Ewing's Pacific journal was better than the first.  These were my least favorite parts of the book.  Overall, it is quite the artistic achievement and definitely worth reading.  Kind of a saga in many ways.  Highly recommended despite my earlier complaints.
B00004RJ71|5.0|why arent these  movies better appreciated  in our culture.i loved it  from the  moment it opened till the  end.suspenseful and exciting
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|it has awesome graphics. but its not the real game,its subway surfers pretty much. and it deleted itself from my kindle fire. I WAS SO FAR IN THE GAME! IT REALLY SSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|Futuristic blast from the past.  Young Michael York, Jennie Agutter and Roscoe Lee Browne were great & just as I remember them.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A beautiful and colorful display of fun and excitement under the sea.<br /><br />Hours of fun!<br /><br />Will recommend this for anyone with a Nemo fan in their family ...

B00846WWVM|3.0|this app is just OK.  It's fun for a day or two but it's no angry birds.  Some of the levels are hard enough I just quit thinking I had better things to do.
B00005NPWA|5.0|The first time realized the eye piece was missing on my X pro 1 was the first time i realized that the x pro 1 had an eye piece. For some reason it had a tendency to screw off. This Nikon eye piece though a bit pricey for what you are buying works great and has not unscrewed off by itself even once.  It fits perfectly and works great.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|this is way better than the stock phone calculator.  It does so much more and I love it. (two words)
B009DA74ES|5.0|Even when you think this show is going dull or getting too predictable, it changes up on you. A great cast, great scripts, and a really great cliff hanger to go into next season. Very rarely do I wish a show or a season wouldn't end, but haing to wait a year to see what happens to Hank is going to be torture.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This 4-part version is energetic, faithful to the book, visually beautiful, and wonderfully acted.  Jonny Lee Miller is perfect as Mr. Knightly.
193700788X|2.0|I'm reluctant to say I'm disappointed in the novel because it has some of the charm the others possess, this book falls short of my expectations. A writer should never have to input a preemptive warning that her work will most likely disappoint her fans, however CH felt the need to do so and thus acknowledged the lacklustre and underwhelming outcome of a 13 book series. As a fan I will be they first to admit that I wanted CH to write DEA with my favoured ending in mind.  However, it seems as though CH didn't even write this book. Her characters seemed oddly out of character and the plot drags on without truly evolving. It seems as if you've read one Sookie Stackhouse novel you've read them all.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book! I read it in about 40 hours! I couldn't put it down because I thought this would be the end of the series. I hated the ending because of the cliffhanger! But I cannot wait to read the next one!! Great read! I HIGHLY recommend.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Very intense and quick 20 min workout. best for mommies to loose the flab and tone up. I recommend getting this!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have not experienced NDE but am grateful for people like the author who made a life-changing decision to go public with their experience at the risk of being called \\"crazy\\" by their peers.  You don't have to believe in God or spirituality/religion to listen to others and hear their experience.  If there is no brain function, where did these experiences and memories come from?  I enjoyed this book as I am curious about the human experience aside from my own, and no one knows everything about life and death, including doctors and scientists, we can only rely on the experiences of others.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Kids enjoy reading it..just wish my kindle wasn't just black and white, it makes it hard for some of my kids to read.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This book was definitely well done and memorable.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I do that only once every 5 years or so.  Very detailed and quite believable.  If you are technically inclined, you will enjoy this McGuyver type story
B009IUH1N2|4.0|I haven't heard my kids complain about it so it must be alright. I don't play it. Just my<br />kids.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Such a good movie!T om Hanks and Daryl Hannah are great in this movie...its a classic, a must own! Love it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I absolutely love this book. it w as written so well and was m made into a fantastic movie. Murray.
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Gina's awesome..glad she does all her own stunts in this movie..watch the special features...you will definitely become a fan of her after this movie.
B002UZXJA6|4.0|I love Celtic Woman, but this CD just doesn't seem up to the quality of previous concerts.  I still enjoy listening to it, though.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|All I can say is that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. If your looking for non-stop action you will be disappointed; but I enjoy the &#34;behind the scenes&#34; drama that this movie provides. But at the end the action scenes are pretty darn good too.
B005Z28M58|5.0|My absolutely favorite series of all time.  My only complaint is that I expected more closure on the switched-at-birth story.  That's a disappointment.  Otherwise hilarious and fun.
B007EECSFA|4.0|Another tightly woven tale by Morton of exploding relationships from WWII London to present that carefully unravels delicious character identities into captivating revelations.
B008Y7N7JW|1.0|How it won a single award is amazing to me.  The story-line was horrible.  The acting was, at best, was ok.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
B00B1CGD5M|5.0|As a long time Soilwork fan I have to say this is a great album. If you are new to Soilwork or a long time fan, either way you will dig this album.
1476734941|5.0|Already losing weight with a different plan but after reading this book, I decided to implement this technique for the long term benefits.  Even my husband, who is not overweight, is doing this for the health benefits.<br /><br />Thanks to Dr. Mosley and Ms. Spencer for a great book!
B009AMAK54|3.0|I had high hopes for this one. I had assumed this had been directed by Eastwood, but instead, it was only financed by his production company. To be honest, I'm surprised he associated himself with this project at all. As a big fan of Eastwood and Adams, I expected a lot. Add Goodman and Timberlake, and on paper you would think it couldn't miss. It did. I'm making it sound worse than it is, because I actually DID like the film!  I just didn't love it - and seriously - it could have easily been so much better. Some strong performances, and a very good story were marred by a sappy ending that will insult your intelligence. Obviously, I'm not going to ruin it here, but Eastwood should be ashamed that the finished product was not rewritten and shot over. It felt to me like a junior high school girl was given a decent screenplay and asked to write an ending. It's that juvenile. So if you're asking me if you'll enjoy this movie, I'd have to say probably yes - for the first 100 minutes.  After that, don't say I didn't warn you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks! I recommend that you buy this for your little ones and your big ones. BY THIS GAME!!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have tried Several Mahjong game. This is the best I have played. Nice designs and colors make it very easy on the eyes. Most importantly, I like the classic game which is not as nerve wracking as the timed versions. Who needs the stress?
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Other than not getting my daily bonous, this game rocks! I recommend you buy this for your little ones. Big kids like it too!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|More like a Harlequin Romance with more explicit sex.  It was a predictable end to the trilogy.  Might be difficult for people not used to the very explicit nature of the Fifty Shades books.
0062059963|4.0|Short and Sweet:<br />The Elite is a fast paced worthy sequel to The Selection that I had to read from beginning to end in one day. Although the 'love triangle' left me a little frustrated at times, I am dying to read the untitled 3rd in this series.<br /><br />To Elaborate....<br /><br />The Elite begins where The Selection left off. America Singer is now in the 'Elite,' but continues to feel conflicted over her feelings for both Aspen and Maxon, even as the stakes are constantly being raised. The Rebels are more terrorizing than ever and seem to be searching for something specific. We also get a major peak into this world America lives in and it isn't pretty. The castle is being regularly attacked and a real danger exists in being part of the Selection and ultimately in being Maxon's princess.<br /><br />So, serious talk. This book frustrated me a ton. Not because it was bad, but because every time I thought I knew exactly where it was headed Ms. Cass pulled out another little twist and left me all conflicted and emotional along with America. ;)  Plus, I don't know about you guys, but I don't super love Aspen, and I have concerns about what's going to happen to these two when Maxon finds out who Aspen is. Because he's gonna. That being said, I loved this book. 4.5 stars because I think America is smarter than she comes across in this book, but I am hopeful that she is really going to come into herself in the 3rd. I &lt;3 you Kiera Cass, but you are killing me!
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Another chapter in the journey of this wonderful group. They continue to make beautiful music to past and current pieces and some of there own. If you are buying this you must have already bought there first album, so there is no need to explain any further about the Piano Guys. If this is your first purchase I suggest you get there first album.... then repeat !
B000SJJCX4|4.0|thing works fine... easy to understand settings ..sturdy enough.. lights nice an bright. i like it..use with power supply and not batteries..works best
B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read all of the Sookie books from the start and loved all but the last couple. I do not normally write bad reviews, because I feel there had to be something redeeming in the book to keep me reading. The somethings that kept me reading this book were the fact that I felt obligated because I bought the book and I thought maybe the other reviews were wrong and those people had not read it correctly. It made me sad to think that my favorite character was a side thought, that being said most of the normal characters were a side thought. I really hope that the book coming out in October is better and maybe Eric will come back. Please Ms. Harris can you get a do-over and write this last book differently?
B00B2PHSIY|4.0|I think it helps in may color control for my different immersions. It should come with something than can be clean.
B0018M6J90|5.0|This is a wonderful movie--funny, subtle, meaningful and romantic. It is Amy Adams best performance. Frances McDormand is  always amazing.
B00AA0TZTW|4.0|The pioneering soind that transcends continually onto the frets of our new guitar Gods(Bonamassa, KW Shepherd, Jonny Lang). The sound, tone, inflections and style still puts me into the stratosphere of guitar bliss. The horn section diminishes the songs a little for me. This was another great purchase of Hendrix material.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|Have been playing this game for a couple of days now. It is fun and the controls are simple to use. My one complaint is your ability to earn points and unlock suits. After the initial upgrades to the iron man suit building credits towards more is slow going. Unless you want to spend fifteen to twenty dollars I highly doubt you will see any other suit upgrades soon. Still a fun game though.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! You get to just be creative and build what your heart desires in creative mode, and try to survive and mine in survival mode, which can sometimes be a challenge but it's super fun and the graphics are really cute!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|While I'm not a big fan of The Sound Of Music I am a big big fan of this bluray release.  The picture and sound are flawless and jaw-dropping.  This movie was made in the 60's and 45 years later we have this on an exceptional bluray transfer.  If you read any major reviews on this they all score top scores for audio and video - and for good reason.  For any movie fan this release should definitely be in your library.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the whole set! I think this one was more about thier love story. It was great! Would recommend to all my lady friends
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Wow, what can be said that hasn't already been said? This show was wonderfully entertaining fifteen years ago, and it still holds up. Looking back on it, the removal of the original music gives it the benefit of not dating itself to the late '90s, as the general ideas of being an outsider that's okay with being an outside is timeless. They kept the original theme song (easily the most identifiable song of the entire show) and while I don't remember if this was the original song at the end of season four, it certainly fit with the events that transpired.<br /><br />The creators of the show do not treat the audience as idiots, which is ironic given Daria's humble beginnings in \\"Beavis and Butthead\\" and the sharp nosedive of MTV programming shortly after \\"Daria\\"'s cancellation. Everyone gets called out for pretentiousness and shallowness and self-deluded BS, including Daria herself. It's also never glossed over that she does things to isolate herself from others and that she's not an innocent victim of the cruel high school life--in fact, this is the only example of teen fare in the '90s that doesn't have an antagonist.<br /><br />Overall, a worthwhile addition to any collection.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Very good adaptation of Sherlock Holmes, doesn't try to be hollywood-ish like Robert Downey's, and the performance of Cumberbatch is just amazing
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I love this item.  I use it daily and now that I have my Kindle Fire I don't know what I would have done without it.  It is convenient to taking on trips and just sitting around and reading.  Great idea!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Second season didn't disappoint us in the least, perhaps even hooked us more! We were so anxious to start season 3.

B0009VSB06|5.0|i am injoying the 150 very much, it is my first metal detector and i find it very easy to use and very affordable.<br /><br /> i wish that it came with some accesorys tho, i needed to buy head phones and a pin pointer, i seen that simular modoles gave these when you bought theres ,and of coarse i didint see that till after.<br /><br />over all for first timers like me i dont think anyone whould go wrong with this unit.
0800141660|5.0|Although this movie is not absolutely true to the book, the changes made are wonderful and add greatly to the enjoyment of the movie. I believe that Ms Thompson caught the emotion of the story very well and enhanced it with both her writing of the script and her acting in it. Her character is the driving force of the story and her portrayal is perfect. I know she was a bit old for the role but she looked lovely and fit the role perfectly. She can say more with silence than any actress I've ever seen. This is a wonderful cast with every single person \\"spot on\\" in their performance. It is beautifully filmed. I've looked at it many times and it makes every other production of this book just seem boring. I was a little perplexed by the way  Hugh Grant seemed to creep around on his toes sort of bent forward in most scenes but I assume that is what he was directed to do. He certainly made a charming and believable Eward Ferrars and that is what is important. I thought Alan Rickman was wonderful as Col. Brandon and I've never seen Marianne portrayed better than Kate Winslet did it. She gave it just the correct touch of young love out of control and unable to help her behavior. The difference in the way she took heartbreak and the way her sister handled her own was, thankfully, brought out in one of the last scenes when Marianne compares her behavior to her sisters. Just a beautifully done film.
B005PK57IK|4.0|having it available is a good move on your part becauseit is a good program, still waiting on Blue Bloods
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|An easy app that anyone can use i would recommend to anyone.<br />I use for paying bills and when I work from home.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Ok I'll assume we are set up for Chronicles #4, I hope so. I hate to be left hanging.<br />This was a quick & easy read. A few new twists & turns for the Barringtons are dealt with here.<br />All I can say without giving too much away is, &#34;What happens next?&#34;
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I love it. The picture was amazing and I enjoyed the movie. While it could probably be a little shorter I want to soak up as much of th LoTR world as I can.
B004T5K3OK|2.0|use to work. Bought the license., but it doesn't work. Update: 5/20/13: I discovered this version of the app in the Amazon marketplace is old.  I went to Google Play and found a newer version, which works really well.  Please update the Amazon market to have the latest version of CamScanner!
B0012TWRAO|3.0|The black comes off easily but the mount works well. Easy to install, I'd recommend it but know that it will get scratched up.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|.challenging game.Good for adults and children. Good for teaching hand eye coordination. Would also be great for a challenge game.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|Plex has changed my media system for ever. I can run the server on my pc and stream all my content to any device.  I currently use it on my Roku, Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD, and iPad. It works perfect and offers features I've never seen from any other media server.  And you can use your Kindle as a remote for the roku.

B000FC1MM8|5.0|This time Harry sits in the hot seat and keeps you reading to find out who actually killed his mother.  This novel is for all who have to appreciate Bosch.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|We need this app optimized for Tablets and newer phones.  It couldn't hurt to get updates every other month if it causes too much work. I will give more stars if we get a new update soon :-)
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Although I am aware of the length of KF's books, I could not resist this one.  I had finished Fall of the Giants and was astonished at the difference in price!  But I could not do without following the characters into WWII and see how things turned out for them.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun but I didn't play it for like 2 weeks then it lost all my memory including, my high score which was 97,000 I lost tricky bot  and Jake so I had to start over great game but lost my stuff which is not cool
B001ANSS5K|5.0|This book is absolutely breath taking. It's captivating and beautiful and truly portrays the cracked emotions of a teenager.  Simply amazing and by far one of the best books I've read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I think everyone should read this book! I was so sorry to come to the end. I will be reading every thing by this author.

B003YNFYCO|5.0|I am enjoying listening to all the old Beatles tunes.<br />Good price for the number of songs on the two CD's.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Love P!nk and to hear her starting out music is great!  Can't wait to see her in concert this year!
B000244FDW|4.0|I enjoyed watching this BBC Miniseries of Pride and Prejudice.<br />It was more comprehensive than the one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle,<br />but I still am partial to that one.<br />My only complaint was the high price I had to pay for it.<br />The version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier is enjoyable too,  just more Hollywood.
B008J34466|5.0|She has some amazing music on this CD/tour!!  Happy to say I'm seeing her in December and can't wait to see her do what only she does and does it best!!!  She is one hot chick with excellent discipline and it shows in her performances!!  Love seeing her with Willz at her shows too!!  That is one lucky baby girl to have her as a momma!!  Love to put these CDs on shuffle and just jam out!!  Great for my long rides to the shore instead of radio stations going in and out of signals!  Great investment!
193799418X|5.0|Read and enjoyed  the first story and look forward to enjoying the rest.<br />The book is a little heavy to lug around,  but it is nicely done.

B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book!  This book has three great concepts that will facilitate SUCCESSFUL change. I 'll be looking for bright spots and focusing on small wins the next time I launch a process improvement initiative.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love, love, love Bruno Mars and he doesn't disappoint!!im in my own little world when I'm shopping or cruising with the top down in this beautiful weather!!  He's got such a range of different music, and none disappoint!
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|The cating was great, the singing was great.  Altogether a very enjoyable piece of music. The story was just about her final days so wish they would do one of her whole reign as Queen.
1935597760|3.0|I'm a little schizoid about this book; probably would have given it 3-1/2 stars, if that were an option.  First, it was a hard book to get into; I didn't immediately respond to the main character, Jamie.  Perhaps it was the dialect that the author conveyed when Jamie and those around him spoke; it got very tiresome.  I especially got bored with the conversations between Jamie and Rose-- not sure why the author felt it necessary to go on at length with some of them.  Also, the denouement was telegraphed about halfway through (I won't say how here), so it was really a matter of finding out how the revelation would come to light.  The scenes of the orphanage and farm were disturbing in the extreme, and in the end, I felt that the main storyline was thin and was used simply as a vehicle for the author to be able to write about and expose the conditions and operations of the infamous Irish orphanages.  Through the course of the book, however, I did come to appreciate the main characters, Jamie and Lydia, so I'm glad I stuck with it.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I would not even consider watching this movie.  If anyone reads the Jack Reacher novels, they would know that an integral part of the books, of every book, of every plot is the immense size of Reacher, that he always says that he isn't swift of foot, but perserveres with his assailants due to his size, weight and muscle.  To have a teeny tiny like Tom Cruise take on the role negates the whole image of Jack Reacher.<br />I bet Cruise put up his money to make this film, otherwise who would have bankrolled it with a star who is so completely different physically than the Reacher in the book?  Did Lee Child have a say so in who could play Reacher?
B00CJVZB5W|5.0|After listening to Rod make music since the early 70's, I have to say that this new record, \\"Time\\" is the best album he has made in 20 years. The early wisdom he possessed when writing his early hits like \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"You Wear It Well\\" has evolved to a more mature Rod Stewart, who is not afraid to write about failed relationships about himself or his children.<br /><br />He has grown up, but then again, so have we.<br /><br />Chip
B00BVVA138|5.0|This album kicks total a$$.  I've been a huge fan since their breakthrough album Alive and Just Breathing.  This album picks up right where they left off.  They haven't missed a beat without Howard Jones on vocals.  If you like KsE, you won't be disappointed with this latest effort.  More diversity than their recent albums in terms of tempos and grooves...this has some thrash and punk elements along with their traditional sound.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|This is by far the best CD I have heard in a long time. The artist (who is a teenager!) writes songs that are original, tender, jaded, and always disarming and impressive. You can hear influences of folk music, Dylan, various artists of the 60's/70's, eras that I have always loved. I hope to hear a lot from him in the future. This CD is definitely a keeper!
B00AF6B22E|5.0|Loved every min of it.<br />Denzel gives another great performance, even when the story is not all true it makes you think.
B007SGM084|2.0|This is the bastard child of a porn book and a romance novel. Still read it all... sick right? For some reason I wanted to know how it ended.
0670033693|2.0|I'm sorry, but I really tried to finish this. I wanted to, but it was horribly tedious. I just couldn't get through another 150 pages of dreary boring descriptions of everything from the road Walt was driving on to the simplest detail of what Vonnie was wearing every time he ran into her. In the 111 pages I read the only thing that happened was a boy was killed and a few other minor details that pretty much seemed useless. I love the A&E Series, Longmire, which these books are based on, but the books, not so much. I think I will stick to the series.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|being able to view all four versions of bladerunner enabled this viewer to tie together all aspects of what was cut from one version and what was moved around from the others. also I might add ,the color clarity and depth was magnificent even though this was the standard widescreen dvd version. TREMENDOUS.....
1451695195|3.0|Eben Alexander is a great writer and speaker, but he's been proven less than truthful about his experiences.
B005EVVESM|5.0|This is the only Maroon 5 album where I like almost every song!  I don't like the &#34;techy&#34; music of subsequent albums, and this one is great that it's not.

B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|I've loved this series but the last couple of books have tailed off a bit in my enthusiassm. Still - can't miss the final one could i? Actually for what it revealed i could have. Eric - in the last book he was barely there, and in this one - well frankly he's been emasculated, had his balls chopped from the way he behaves... From being the over-the-top, fun-loving but selfish, sensual, virile, sexual Aplha vampire we knew from early books, he's become simply a poor sahdow in the last two books - I'd never have recognizes the Eric we knew and loved as the same man in this book. I mean would he have behanved like this? No, Eric is always Eric first, yet had a soft (and hard!) spot for sookie from the early books so he'd have found some way out. that man could get hhis way out of anything - he's resourvcful, and cunning to the Nth degree, no way would he have ended up like this. Then there the connundrum of for all that he was going to be consort to a powerful queen, would he really want to be a second in command, answering to a female? Nah - not our Eric, no way , he's always been Top Dog (or vamp!) Then there's Bill, my number one from the start :)  He seemed to have been brought back in much more - for a reason i was hoping - over the last few books, and he and Sookie were mending fences and yet he was barely there in ths book either, just popping in and out occasionally. To have, as another reviewer said - built up these two strong powerful vampires only to drop them at the final fence seemed just wrong :( There wasn't any of the excitment of the early books, no drama, no wondering \\"whats going to happen next? how will this end\\" It all seemed horrribly dull and predicatbale and after the ending of the last book i wasn't suprised at how this finished - saddened as i thought it deserved better but not surprised. The early books I just couldn't put down and have devored them time after time and yet this one - well, i actually got almost bored with it and put it aside to do other things twice while reading it - my family know how hard it is usually to drag me from a book so thats a measure of how disappointed I was - and its a very expensive disappointment too. I almost gave it just two stars but finally got to three, not sure why really, maybe just loyalty and the feeling that maybe I'll get used to the ending - won't like it still but its done so. On for another sereis. I see there's several spin off books from the sereis planned, after the disappointemnt of the last two books I'm not sure I want to read them - at the early books i'd have looked forward to them but feel the whole storyline has really just petered out :( and maybe my pennies - pounds!! are better spent elsewhere.to do other things twice while reading it - my family know how hard it is usually to drag me from a book so thats a measure of how disappointed I was - and its a very expensive disappointment too.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings Play Book is one of those books that you start reading and you don't stop until it's done.  I defiantly recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I never want to watch a horror movie 2 times in a row, but this movie I wanted to watch it again and again. It has a great story, and some pretty freaky moments. \\"Mama\\" is based off of CGI, and personally I didnt find her all that frightening.On the other hand the two little girls in this movie are very horrifying when they are making the adjustment back to reality. I suggest this movie strongly to those who love a thriller with a solid story.

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have read all of Tolkein's works several times over. The Hobbit possibly a dozen times. When I watched this movie it was as though Tolkein himself was telling the tale in video. I absolutely adored this work and cannot wait for the next one (The story is too voluminous for one movie so there will be three total, I understand).
B0019NB9A2|5.0|The quality that this is in is much better than the original and I love it. Plus it is loaded with tons of features.
B00B5HQL50|3.0|It wasn't clear to me that I was buying the rights to watch the movie via streaming on the PC. I thought I was buying the DVD.<br />Very disappointed in that. I suppose it was my bad for not reading the description well enough, but I paid more for the streaming video from Amazon than I did to go the theater and watch it on the large screen.
B0058SNI58|5.0|I have wide feet, and this croc flat adjusts and doesn't makes my toes feel too cramped or squashed. Both this shoe Jayna and the Kadee (very similar, Jayna just has open heel with strap) offer terrific foot and arch support, and are pliable and soft.<br />My first pair of dress crocs didn't have very much give, because they used a painted texture (which looks great, but makes the shoe much less pliable and comfortable).<br />These shoes are cute, offer great support, and of course easy to clean. You won't go wrong with this shoe. It is a casual shoe, but can work with dressier outfits because they have a more narrow profile than of course traditional crocs.

Save yourself some time and don't even bother with this app.

B00BETX5PS|5.0|Seems to meld well with the current Bond Episodes.  If you Like Daniel Craig, you will like this movie.  Not as good as the first two however.  Mostly spoiled by the evil character role played by a goof ball.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I was a little hesitant about getting this one. I didn't want to spend more money on another USB audio interface that would only bring latency when recording... well, after downloading the update on their website... it was like magic. I can record with virtually zero latency. I can focus on the music when I'm recording. Very good sound quality. You get the basics: 2 great mic preamps, Monitor and Headphone control, Stereo out, Phantom power and at this price to me it was a no brainer. Stress-Latency free recording and good sound.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of my favorite games. The only problem is that I play it too much! The sceans change often so it keeps it new-ish.
B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Movie was very good. Since 10 years+ were compressed to 2 hours, not sure what was actual Vs. composite to get this to movie length.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have loved all of the books this was an amazing book happy to see Sookie found peace. Little sad to see that she didn't end up with Eric.
B007P7UF0G|4.0|Nostalgia. Well told. Well acted. The sad result of adultery dealt with in an honest manner. Unusual for the film industry. But most viewers who are not Christian would not catch this.
B002SR2PKG|1.0|I didn't want to tarnish the novel by giving it fewer than 5 stars but maybe someone will read this and fix it.<br /><br />This is the worst kindle conversion I've ever seen and I read some of the free books, which can be ugly. There is a space between every period and quotation mark, which often leaves quotation marks on a subsequent line. The scan often substitutes r and n for m since they look alike. Other clear scanning errors abound and detract from the book. Hard to believe such a top notch book would get such a slipshod kindle adaptation.
B008JFLWLE|3.0|the program works really well, and seeing the equations the way I would set them up on paper is really helpful, but the handwriting recognition is a bit quirky and takes some getting used to.  I like it and use it for most things but a push button version is easier for quick calculations.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes you desire more of the Word. I find myself wanting to read more lessons and this app makes it easier to enroll in programs geared toward more knowledge in specific areas of your life. I have shared the app and and the Word with more friends than i ever would have. I would have actually bought it, but since it was free, i emailed a donation to help the app spread the Word to those who maybe couldnt afford it down the road.
B009R659L8|2.0|Many of Ms. Clark's books have entertained me even though they are easily figured out long before the ending. This book, I have only gotten 25 % into it and I am bored with all the extra characters and bad editing. I also already have figured out the ending as I always do in every book I read.  I rated this two stars due to my admiration for this author's writing. Hopefully, she will get back on track. This book had the potential without all the side characters in attempt to steer the reader away from the actual killer. The additional missing girls and death added dimension and would have been brilliant if the additional characters and plot tying them together wasn't so comber some. I will finish this book but I will not recommend it.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I had the same product for about 7 months when it no longer worked - this prompted me to order a replacement. When the replacement arrived, it did not work. Product had to be returned. I was never able to contact the manufacturer to try and troubleshoot the problem. Very disappointed this time around.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this is a great game. I think that you would love it. I sure did. I liked it more than I like pie.<br />So you should buy think game now. It is free. So buy it. Now. Please.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|It's a great mouse, very accurate and plenty of customizable buttons. Only downfall is that even with the weight maxed out, it's not heavy enough. Still too light.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I have tried several different products like this and I find this one the best. Batteries last a long time and gives just enough light to see. I use this at the top of the stairs as I come home at night to help light the way.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is hands down the best mouse for your money. It's got great features for you to customize to your personal needs. Would definitely recommend to anyone. I was using the Razer products prior and kept having issues with the scroll roller dying on me.

B002FRNCG0|5.0|I chose this rating because I am a heavy Paramore follower. I love their music and it never gets old to me. This is one of their best albums and I think it's music for all ages (then again all of them are amazing so there's really no way for me to just pick one album!). I would recommend this band to anyone who listens to alternative and pop-punk type music.
B003MC5N28|3.0|Many of my friends read The Giver in elementary school, but somehow I missed that boat, so I decided to read it now (freshman in college). I really enjoyed it. Though harshly realistic at times, this dystopian novel is entertaining. The concept of a utopian community causes readers to really evaluate their philosophies and what is truly valuable in our own societies. When I was younger, I really enjoyed the Shadow Children series which I think can be compared with The Giver. Thinking I had 7% left in the book, I was very surprised when I turned the page and it was over. The remaining 7% was the first chapter or two of the next book in the series. I understand why the author leaves the reader hanging and how it's supposed to cause the reader to think a little more in depth, but I was left feeling empty with this conclusion. I just felt like Lowry had so much to build upon and so many loose ends to tie that the end deserved a little more resolution. I've received hints that the sequels are much the same, so I think I won't finish the series. Overall, I believe it to be well-written and thought-out, and I'm glad that so many elementary school teachers read this to their students.

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I have loved Paramore since I first heard All We Know Is Falling. I have been listening to them for over 5 years now and I adore them. The CD is wonderful. The front cover image is cool, and the CD itself is a beautiful matte black. As for the music, if you are a fan and would like to know another fan's take on the album, this is mine:<br />I personally love every song. Some people are saying that they don't like it because it's more upbeat than they are used to, but I like this touch of Paramore. A lot of their songs are very sad or very serious, and a lot of the songs on this album are very cute and upbeat. Especially their new hit, Still Into You. I love this song. I think it's cute and honestly, I don't think saying it's cute is a bad thing. I think that with the loss of the Farro brothers in the bad, a change was necessary and inevitable.<br />When people complain that they &#34;miss how the band used to be&#34; I don't really understand that. Bands, just like all people on this planet, need to be able to grow, explore, and change. If any band were to stay the same through their whole career, there would be no career because no one would listen to their music due to the fact that it would be repetitive. Paramore has gone through a change, and I think it's a wonderful one. I cannot wait until they release more albums so I can collect all of those too (:
B0000714BP|5.0|These 3 are hilarious!  If you want  a night of laughter and not pay much, pop this in the DVD and break out the wine and cheese or a bucket of Chicken wings :-) Enjoy the movie!!

B00BHO70L0|3.0|Only with 4.44 will we know if it was truly worthwhile to diverge this much not only from the original series' plot but the plot of Rebuild up to here.<br /><br />As it is the movie's pacing is overall very slow and dull with a spike at the beginning and towards the end. In between felt depressing just for the sake of having a depressing aesthetic -- that is to say the sadness looked pretty but meant little in the context of the films that preceded it. I understand it may be tricky to convey much when you shift the story so many years into the future, but it is almost as if that concern was ignored and they intentionally kept the pace at a snails crawl for most of the film.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you are a fan of the story, I would say you are likely better off waiting till 4.44 before watching this. Personally, I still only have a copy of 1.11 due to my doubts after viewing this film. Otherwise, if you are more a fan of great animation this has all the top talent behind it.<br /><br />For the sake of discussion, take a look at the original trailer for this film. Look exciting? Well, almost none of those clips are in this film. Also, to feed the Anno itch - if you haven't seen his film Ritual that should do'er. It even has a few spots of animation. Otherwise Kare-Kano is very good up to the point Anno quit (around episode 15 iirc).
B009SQOGZ2|1.0|my mom and i watched this on netflix because it was free. If it would been longer then it was it would of been shut off because it was boring and we were hoping it would get better. Save your money this is not worth it.
193700788X|5.0|I'm giving this book five stars because it is a good ending to a long series, and it does right by its main character. The rating isn't for quality of the writing or the depth of plot and character development, which are no better than the previous books. The last three books have been chores to read, and clearly chores for Charlaine Harris to write. However, this final installment harkens back to the earlier stories - there is more action, intrigue and some great old characters. Intermittent portions of the story take place without Sookie in omniscient narration - this really moves the story along and adds layers to the mystery. The lone sex scene is a disappointment, but at least Sookie enjoyed herself ;)<br /><br />What makes Sookie Stackhouse so relatable and unforgettable is how, aside from her telepathy, she is an average woman with simple ambitions in life - to be happy and fulfilled. This series followed Sookie through a two year period during which she matured by gaining self-confidence, embracing her telepathy, and opening up to accept the support and love of her family and community. I love that Charlaine's ending potentially pairs Sookie up with the only character who shared her values and understood her \\"disability,\\" but also leaves Sookie confident enough to find happiness if that relationship doesn't work out. What could be a better farewell to this young woman?

0316223239|4.0|May 6th, 2013 - Amanda Berry was rescued from captivity.  She and two other women were kidnapped and held captive in a house in Cleveland, Ohio for 10 years.  Amanda has a 6 year old daughter who was borne into captivity.  Between the three women, there were at least 5 other pregnancies that did not come to term.  Police are searching the back yard of the home.  A 52 year old man was arrested for the crime.<br /><br />As I read this novel, the same thing is unraveling \\"in television\\" as Jack would say.<br /><br />To say I enjoyed the book would be odd but I was engrossed by the story. I must admit that the poor grammar used by Jack was distracting.  He was a very smart little boy.  I just kept thinking that if Ma had the time to teach him to read and if they played Parrot and other games, watched tv, etc,  WHY was Jack's grammar so bad?  I think the author did the kid an injustice by making him a little dumb instead of just childish.<br /><br />(and don't bother pointing out my grammar mistakes, I didn't say I was an English Teacher)  It is a good book, give it a read!<br /><br />I pray Amanda Barry, her daughter and the other two women: Gina deJesus and Michelle Knight, will find peace like Jack did.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I have read every book and was excited to see how this would wrap up.  What a boring, predictable ride...At times I felt like I was watching the last Seinfeld episode when they bring EVERYONE back for a cameo?  And I don't want to ruin it for anyone but I can't believe who Sookie ended up with??  It seemed forced and awkward..
B0058YPGL6|5.0|She loves the characters and we love the story line. It gives her and I something we can talk about.

B00BEJ5O6Q|4.0|Blake sings about everyday emotions extremely well. I would recommend this to any Blake Shelton fan.  I enjoyed his ballads.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I write this not because I had any particular favorite in the \\"what will happen to Sookie stakes?\\". I am not a romance fan and I don't particularly care for Happily Ever After. I really enjoyed this book. I feel that it moved along at a good pace and wrapped up the series in a satisfactory way. By satisfactory I don't mean that the lead character made the choices I wanted, I mean that it all held together and just like real life, it wasn't always the choices I would have made for them which is the mark of good book as opposed to fan fiction.<br /><br />The plots are clearly well thought out, the story moves along and all the main story lines get wrapped up.<br /><br />And not to be a pot stirrer or a bee hive poker but I think a lot of the negative reviews are because some people had their own ideas of how the series should end. I want to be surprised. If a writer panders to only what their readers want there is no suspense. A book should retain the possibility of surprising you and the characters making choices you would not pick<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure the choices Sookie made were not the ones I was hoping for and the way it all ended up was not what I wanted. But it all held together and was consistent. It was well thought out and well written. A good ending for the series.<br /><br />I have spent the last few days rereading the books and wondering why there were so many low reviews and I think it has to do with people who were so vested in their vision of how Sookie should end up \\"Team Bill\\" or \\"Team Eric\\" or \\"Team Quinn\\" that they can't separate their hope for the character from how the book ended.
1612191290|4.0|Do you know why we have debt? Why we need debt?...and how debt is used as a political, economic and sociological tool for good as well as for evil...read this book. The evil part is particularly interesting...well...that all depends on your definition of evil. The most fascinating explanation of how a country - how a population of an entire country - can be turned into 'indentured servants' servicing the debt incurred by their no long gone rulers...read this. On the other hand, debt is a good things...but mostly it is ...well...you need to read the book to understand the definition of exactly what this author thinks debt is. For most of us...for you and I...I suspect it is what our creditors believe we owe in money...which is of course...debt by another name.
B000FC1QQU|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Alexander McCall Smith writes with such feeling for Botswana and the people there.  His books paint a picture of this land and people that he so obviously loves. His story lines  entertain  and hold the reader's attention. Another winner!
B000059ZLH|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying I am a HUGE DT fan, I am now going to follow that by saying I can't get into this show. It saddens me because I am such a fan, but I could not get into this. I have watched it repeatedly but found myself not paying a lot of attention when doing so out of disinterest. I LOVE Score and Budokan but can't muster up the same enthusiasm for this. DT, I think, is one of the most talented bands I have ever heard. I will continue to try and prove myself wrong, and would love to do so, but can't sing the same praise as some of their other live show dvd's.
B0000029AP|3.0|I have to say at the outset that I have never been a big fan of Aerosmith, or much over-produced American rock for that matter. When this was released in 1975 Aerosmith did not have a big profile in the UK, after all we had Deep Purple, Black Sabbath,Judas Priest and UFO; no contest, hence I never heard this album when it first came out, only becoming familiar with Aerosmith when Run DMC resurrected their career for them, and then we had such nonsense as \\"Going Down on the Up Escalator\\" and other such juvenile double entendre songs which did not endear me to them so I passed them by. I recently was informed that this was the album that started making them big, their third and most accomplished up to this point, and so for £3.86 I thought you can not go far wrong.<br /><br />Three stars is about right for my rating of it, it is ok, foot tappy and air guitar worthy but ultimately unfulfilling. It has three outstanding tracks: the title track is a blistering opener, \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is a very well put together song and of course, the now eponymous \\"Walk This Way\\", all three I have put on my phone, but as for the rest, well, farly forgetable really. \\"Uncle Salty\\" has had it's riff nicked by Shania Twain, now that can not be a good thing, and unfortunately to listen to it now will be forever reminded of the queen of pop country and not seen as a good riff which was probably the belief when it first came out. \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" is just too juvenile for words, I might have liked it when I was 15 when it first came out but I would have quickly outgrown it, and that my friends is my opinion of Aerosmith, they never outgrew the teen age double meaning stage of life.<br /><br />It is not a bad record but it is also not a great one, listennable and chirpy, if you like that sort of thing.
0812993845|1.0|I normally enjoy Sophie Kinsella books (favorites are Can You Keep a Secret? and I've Got Your Number), but this one was very disappointing.  Definitely not one of her better books.  I found the main character annoying and overly dramatic.  And the alternating first-person perspectives was really confusing.<br /><br />I skipped ahead to the end to see if it would at least redeem the book.  It did not.  I found it cheesy and offensive.<br /><br />Overall, the story failed to hold my attention and I put this one down pretty early on.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|THIS ONE IS SO SIMPLE ANYONE CAN DO THIS. IT ALSO HELPS YOU THINK AND RELAX AT THE SAME TIME
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I choose a rating of four stars as it was a very interesting read but a little elementary. I guess I am getting little prejudice on this regard, wishing for a more challenging narrative. Still, I very glad to have read this tale and recommend it to anyone who wants a good story with many twists and turns.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|The music to this movie is awesome! I love listening to it on my headphones getting homework done. Give it a try!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I have dropped my phone several times and spilled water on it and it has been protected very well. This is a great buy especially if you tend to be like me and drop your phone every now and then. My last phone cracked and messed up so I knew when I got my new one I would order a LifeProof case. It's easy to carry and not too heavy or bulky. I would recommend this product to anyone, worth every penny!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you are looking for a good Dream Theater album, I would highly recommend this album. &#34;Honor Thy Father&#34; is one of my favorite songs. I would have to say that their first album &#34;Images and Words&#34; is the best, but this is still an amazing album. Buy it!
B000KIPT30|5.0|My HDTV didn't have a headphone out. I combined this with an optical-to-RCA-stereo converter (also from Amazon) plus an RCA-to-miniplug cable and female-miniplug-to-1/4&#34; adapter, plugged the 1/4&#34; into the &#34;input&#34; and another 1/4&#34;-to-miniplug-female adapter in one of the &#34;outputs&#34;. Presto, a place to plug in mini-plug headphones. I needed the amp because the optical-to-RCA converter didn't put out but a very quiet signal to my headphones. This boosted it up so I can listen evem when my wife is banging pots in our open-plan kitchen-LR.  Nice little unit,VERY well made as you'd expect from Behringer.
B00000DGUY|5.0|I was curious about Dire Straits and this provided a good sample of their work. Just beware, &#34;Money for Nothing&#34; is the radio edit version (I don't mind it personally).
0062059963|4.0|A friend gave me a copy of this book for my birthday, knowing how much I had enjoyed the first book in the series.  The second book is definitely as good as the first, but it is driving me crazy how wishy-washy the main character is coming across.  First she wants this guy, then she wants the other, and then she starts bouncing back and forth between the two.  It's nerve-racking waiting for her to make a decision but the back and forth does keep the drama high in the novel, so it does serve a purpose.<br />In the first novel you get a taste for where the story in based, but in the second there is more information to be had about the history of the country.  Makes a big difference in understanding why some things are the way that they are.<br />All things considered, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and hope to see the next in the series at some point in the near future, as I would like to know how the main character's story will end.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game.  It's my favorite and it's wonderful on an HD fire.  Hours of fun. The only downside is none of my friends play so I can't access the social part of the game.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My daughter has recently been introduced to lego friends. This is a great starter kit that is not that expensive, and not too many pieces to get overwhelmed. It also combines with some of the other smaller kits to make bigger structures. Directions are on lego.com
B00BYKIKJS|3.0|I really looked forward to seeing this film.  When I finally did see it at home, I found it really tiring and somewhat burdensome and irritating.  I actually - hate to say it - even fell asleep in a few parts.  Too much action or talking tends to do that to me!  This film consists of nonstop bantering dialogue.  There are hardly any moments of calm.<br /><br />More on this later...
B001QWBM62|5.0|Excellent sounding unit - easily usable in a studio or live, and for video shooting. Works well as an audio interface as well (tested with Cubase).  Only downside is the LCD interface - a little laggy and awkward. This device screams the need for a touch screen!
1609611543|5.0|The government and every bit of advertising tells us to consume 'whole grains'.  Dr Davis disputes this with irrefutable proof.  Eliminating wheat is a difficult endeavor but the results promise to be life and health promoting.  This book could turn the food industry on its head!
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Not only do you learn where countries are and what climate they may have, you could get excited talking about it to others.  I enjoy seeing the reaction someone may have to hearing about how you're trying to ruin the planet (global warming be damned).
B005RYF5JA|5.0|I saw the performance live, and wanted the DVD to later enjoy.  I have viewed it several times, as I enjoy Celtic music. I find it a step above excellence.  Lloyd
B00280LYIC|5.0|This whole series is the best against any other one it beats any other author by far i love Rick Riordan.
B009I2UH2W|3.0|It works fine but the cord is too long!  It's just a car charger so the phone sits right beside the outlet and the excess cord is really in the way.
1401923127|4.0|Having been a biology major in college this book is surprisingly simple for a lay person. Dr Lipton follows a simple logical path to prove his points. Though many of his claims seem too fantastic at first; his scientific evidence is unshakeable.I will most certainly read his other books. He presents the facts of his research to the universities which hired him and is then fired.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I have never read a Harlequin romance before. But this story was so cute and fun that I can't wait to read another one
0141337427|5.0|I first discovered Peepo! when I was living in England after the birth of my son in 1980.  I believe that Peepo! has now celebrated its 30th anniversary, and justly so. It is an absoutely charming baby book--I suspect one reason for its continued success is that it works both at the Peek a Boo stage and at what I call the 'pointy' stage:  &#34;Where's the Mummy?&#34;  &#34;Where's the Daddy?&#34;<br />Ahlberg illustrations are always wonderful, and I also appreciate their interest in fairy tales and nursery rhymes, and would cheerfully recommend &#34;Each Peach Pear Plum,&#34; and &#34;Ten in a Bed,&#34; but only after your child recognizes the original motifs [ie Cinderella, The Three Bears, Tom Thumb, etc.]

B00B4VXQC8|5.0|If you like Bon Jovi, he did it again! I listened to it while traveling across country and enjoyed every minute of it.
B0092D1V5Y|1.0|totally useless. I can't believe I even downloaded this useless thing. I guess I was bored or something. Who knows!
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Fabulous in every way.<br />Happily teaching us to embrace the weird and wonderful and very funny too.<br />I think all of us should read this great book.<br />Asbergers rock.
B003BWERF8|4.0|It worked as expected. No problems. Slight delay when using controls via Bluetooth, but it could be the receiver. Overall, pleased. No instructions or web site provided.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|the transmit is very fast, almost as soon as I comleting the ordering.<br />i can read the book well in the kindle.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|When it first came out it did not get great reviews ,However, we thought it was wonderful.Saw  the movie at a theater and  enjoyed it so much that we bought our own to keep forever.
1455869929|5.0|This book depicts life, love, loss with wit and humor, superb characterization, effective metaphors, and a pitch perfect tone in the dialogue. The first person narrative point of view brings the reader right into the heart and mind of the characters. I rate it among my all time favorite books
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Been enjoying every minute.<br />Though it would be nice to be able to more than 3 potions at a time -_-
193700788X|5.0|I really enjoyed Charlane Harris's final entry to the Stackhouse series, there was alot of resolution among characters, and it ended exactly, exactly like I wanted to.  Thanks Charlane, looking forward to season 6 of True Blood.<br /><br />Louise
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|since I picked this book and started reading it. I loved because it teaches you lesson. I really recommend this book to everyone.
B006R4H5FG|4.0|Presentation Zen provides numerous ways to enhance presentations and delivery of presentations. Garr discusses the many things that most of us hate about many presentations but we still continue to see them used almost on a daily basis.<br /><br />My own company is bent on developing \\"slidumentation.\\" Like Garr, I agree this is poor approach to providing process documentation. Even before reading this book, I mentioned several times to senior management how the context of the documentation is lost the moment the information session about that process documentation is completed. Garr provides several tips to overcome this problem.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed the techniques shared about simplifying visuals to enhance the presentation rather than visuals that compete for the focus on the information the speaker provides. I am thankful for my mentors who have shared some techniques with me in the past and I look forward to implementing some of the techniques presented in this book.<br /><br />I recommend this book to those that regularly present information. The techniques, when implemented, will improve your capabilities as a presenter.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A glorious end to an epic saga. Brandon Sanderson did a fine job concluding Robert Jordan`s legacy. Well worth the wait :)
193700788X|1.0|Shame on you Charlaine Harris. I can't even properly review this \\"book\\" as it's more outline than developed story. What an insult to those of us who've spent time and lined your pockets following Sookie's adventures. You leave us with a book that took me just barely two hours to read and a story that unfolds like you were checking off loose ends and saying, \\"Good riddance.\\"  An expensive short story without the actual story. If I'm ever so foolish as to purchase another book by Harris I'll have no one to blame but myself.
B004MERJOK|4.0|I received this book on time and it was in good shape.  It was placed in the military section of my library.
B00BS1VVIU|5.0|Great album! Very mellow music with good lyrics.  You get lost in trance and then before you know it, you're at the end of the album ready to do it all over again.  Support good music, support good artists, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It actually brought me to tears twice.<br />This book also scared me and me aware of this disease.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Enjoyed the series.  It is relatively faithful to the books and the characters are pretty much spot on.  Very enjoyable escape.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is exactly the cord we needed after our dog chewed the original one. It is exactly like the one we had.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Very addicting and fun game but it glitches sometimes and its pretty difficult to get the shadow cards overall I really enjoy the game though
B009GQ57ES|3.0|For $2 it was worth the download.  Macklemore's style is interesting but not the best.  Probably will be played little on my music list.
0684824906|5.0|This book is amazing, Doris Kearns Goodwin is such a gifted historian and author. Goodwin seamlessly pieces together some of the most important events in American history. She portrays these events in such a way it feels like you were there yourself watching Lincoln work through the country's darkest hours and at the same time dealing with great family tragedy.
B00C2VGAW2|1.0|I'm sorry--this movie takes place in the 1920's--there was no hip hop then or anything remotely resembling it.  Shouldn't they have at least tried to do some type of update or idea based on music from the 1920's??  Bad enough that we have to have crappy hip hop music forced on us at every turn--and it doesn't seem to be going anywhere, despite people trying to say that hip hop is dying--HA!! What else do you ever hear? I was eager to hear the soundtrack of this movie,thinking it might contain something akin to say, I don't know---Jazz?? Considering that's what would've been played during this era. At least some kind of actual MUSIC. This is just one more appeal to the youth market, with no concern for authenticity or taste. There's no escaping this crap these days. Depressing and SAD.
0066620996|5.0|Im a quick service restaurant manager and im looking forward in taking our very good company and making it great. its hard work but its well worth it. a MUST BUY for any serious manager/business owner

B00BSW6F26|3.0|Some interesting concepts and good graphics. No annoying hidden object searches...exept for the invisible  puzzle pieces ...had to touch everything to find them. Still worth a buck but it's  kind of short.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great Vince Flynn - AS ALWAYS!!!  This guy is amazing.  I will read every book he writes.  Perfect attention to detail without boring you with details.  GREAT writer!
0800141660|5.0|what a wonderful movie from the Jane Austin novel very romantic fun enjoyable full of emotion  happy with the dvd
B004SOR4H6|5.0|get it get it get it if u have a twitter it is awesome and it works great I think everyone that has a kindle should get one!!
B002NY731U|3.0|The album has a few great songs, but it also has a few forgettable ones. At least it's pretty heavy, with plenty of dual bass and aggressive riffing. But that alone doesn't make an album great.  Still a good album though.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|no bugs or anything I think u should get this app it is almost like the ipod and iphone won but with some other updates but everything else works very good I really think that every one should get this app to use facebook on
B0059F7I24|4.0|This is a really good metal album; just short of great. All the songs are good, but none are future classics, so that's why I can't give it 5 stars.  They still haven't matched their Ascendency album, but no one else has either, so I can't hold that against them.  Well worth your time, and money. I just wish it came with a digital booklet since I did pay for the album.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a great game. My children and I play this daily. My only complaint is that on my Kindle it takes over a week to update to the latest version. We love doing the challenges but missed the first one due to the delayed update.
B0062CTYRA|5.0|Oh my goodness!  This book has multiple stories going on all at the same time, but they are all related and easy to follow.  It was hard to put the book down!  The story stayed with me and had me thinking about it constantly.  I stayed up late reading it thinking I could figure out where the story was headed and how all the different stories were going to somehow be brought together in the end.  I was very surprised, and satisfied, with the ending.  I do recommend this book, and plan to read it again (something I usually do NOT do since my wish list is so long).  I read the hardcover version, which I picked up in a second-hand shop.  The book jacket describes the book perfectly:<br /><br />\\"'All children mythologize their birth'...So begins the prologue of reclusive author Vida Winter's collection of stories, which are as famous for the mystery of the missing thirteenth tale as they are for the delight and enchantment of the twelve that do exist. The enigmatic Winter has spent six decades creating various outlandish life histories for herself--all of them inventions that have brought her fame and fortune but have kept her violent and tragic past a secret.  Now old and ailing, she at last wants to tell the truth about her extraordinary life.  She summons biographer Margaret Lea, a young woman for whom the secret of her own birth, hidden by those who loved her most, remains an ever-present pain.  Struck by a curious parallel between Miss Winter's story and her own, Margaret takes on the commission.  As Vida disinters the life she meant to bury for good, Margaret is mesmerized.  It is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family, including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.  Margaret succumbs to the power of Vida's storytelling but remains suspicious of the author's sincerity.  She demands the truth from Vida, and together they confront the ghosts thathave haunted them while becoming, finally, transformed by the truth themselves.  \\"The Thirteenth Tale' is a love letter to reading, a book for the feral reader in all of us, a return to that rich vein of storytelling that our parents loved and that we loved as children.  Diane Setterfield will keep you guessing, make you wonder, move you to tears and laughter and, in the end, deposit you breathless yet satisfied back upon the shore of your everyday life.\\"
B005HGZV6U|5.0|good buy, this movie was destined for blu ray and what a awesome flick it was. love animation blu rays
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter and she just loves watching it.  Sometimes she will watch it two or three times in a row.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I ordered this adapter because most laptops don't have an RS-232 port anymore. I work in the Precision Ag field and a lot of the components still require RS-232. I have tried 3 other big box house brand adapters and none of them have worked. This adapter worked first try and is half the price. I highly recommend this company and product. I am using it with a HP Elitebook 8530P running Windows 7.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Basically, it is the COMPLETE series, every Columbo (Peter Falk) show, all 69. What more can I say. If you are a Columbo fan, it's for you. You also get 3 episodes of Mrs. Columbo  The DVDs offer high quality picture and sound, and even though you know the plots, and have seen them several times before, it is great to see how people looked, what they drove, and wore, and the state of the art electronics, or lack of, that they used in their daily life or to commit their crime or to provide their alibis. Of course, Columbo was never fooled for long!
B00973902K|5.0|Of course, tastes vary - but, in my opinion, this is a lively, well-orchestrated song that falls in the \\"feel good\\" music category.  The mix of orchestral music is superb and, of course, the tempo and voice inflections are very good.  I'd only hope that she does not turn out to be a 'one hit wonder' - as she has a lot of potential.
B009T8XBBO|5.0|As a longtime player of all 3 &quot;My Kingdom for the Princess&quot; games on PC, I was thrilled to find this as the faotd, I hadn't even thought to see if it had been ported to Android before this. I found no sign of iap as mentioned in the comments. If you have not played with an app, don't judge the iap that may or may not be there. my guess it's that the description was simply copied (or the people commenting about iap commented on the &quot;iap&quot; in the lite version, the iap that it's ONLY for upgrading from lite to the full version...on all Nevosqoft games with a lite and paid version.<br /><br />At this time, I see no mention in the description regarding iap on any of the paid Nevosoft games in the app store, only on the lite versions, and the iap is not for in game perks, but is for the purpose of upgrading to the fully unlocked version of the game. Maybe it was there before, I didn't really notice, I saw the developer and the game title of a longtime PC favorite casual TM game and hit the buy button without hesitation.<br /><br />I have so far played this today on my My Touch 4g slide (no internet connection available from it at the time, so it doesn't appear to need a 'net connection) and on my Nexus7 with no issues. There was a bit of load lag black screen on the My Touch phone (understandable, it isn't the newest/fastest phone out there these days), but no black screen load lag on the Nexus7
B001RNO7BC|5.0|I really like these shoes. Very comfortable.  This shoe seems to match my foot perfectly.  Great looking shoe to wear with khakis or jeans.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|The name refers to thirty minutes past midnight, the darkest period of the night and the<br />most desirable time for an incursion. Loved the movie. It was done with style and class<br />and was more detail oriented than others of it's kind. Highly recommend this movie.<br />Watched it back to back and the extra features were excellent.
0425264351|5.0|my mom and dad are big readers they told me to start with this series.  i am half way through the book and love it.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Was'nt sure how I was going to like this film but so happy I bought the<br />Blu-ray. It was wonderful and beautifully done. Should be part of a<br />history class in school. Once again in special features of the making of the<br />movie were so much appreciated. Highly recommend this classic.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Bought this app because I had it on my Iphone.  Unfortunately on an android phone, if you buy the app through amazon, you have to keep the amazon app store running on your phone in order to use the app.  What a rip off, who wants to have an app they are not using running on their phone using memory and battery life, a warning would have been nice before I spent $9.99.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This collection was more impressive than I imagined. It's something I have<br />decided to repack and date not to open again for fifty years. This item will<br />become a valuable collectible because of it's wonderful design and packaging.<br />Besides that, Jurassic is a classic and enjoyed once more before filing away.<br />Recommend this product to everyone and it will make a special gift for anyone.
B002VWNID6|5.0|Got this for a friend who loves Kevin Costner so she had to have this for her collection. So enjoy Lois!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This series is really well done and can't wait for the next season and<br />hope they continue for some time. It's so well done and really keeps<br />you on the edge of your seat with anticipation. Do highly recommend<br />this series to one and all.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I loved the movie and the book was ten times better!  Wow couldnt put it down!  Now what to read??
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Jaws is a classic. No question about that. Even before I saw the movie in<br />the 70's I read the book; the making of Jaws, and was so impressed by how<br />badly the people of Nantucket had treated the movie crew, with theft of<br />equipment among other things. That's why Spielberg had them tear down<br />the Shark Shack at the end of production, even though the city wanted<br />them to leave it up. This special feature does'nt go into that part of the<br />production but I'm glad I knew the true story.<br />Recommend the movie and this product very highly.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was great for many reasons: the descriptions were so good that the scenes jumped clearly to mind, the feelings that each of the characters experienced were heartbreakingly real, and this depiction of actual historical time is so very important for us to remember.  It is hard to believe that the last orphanage of this kind closed as recently as 1996.  Survivors with any semblance of a life are heroic.  Great book.....could make a great movie if done correctly.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|A wonderful fantasy movie. Excellent in it's adaptation of the book and a<br />masterful and visual wonderland of beauty. Highly recommend this move<br />and the special features were great too.
B00846WWVM|3.0|Not crazy about the game.  But I'm not one that plays alot of these games so others  may love it.  Give it a try.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|It may not be of everyone's taste as the movie is a video game but its entertaining and very fun. One of my faves!
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I really was enjoying this game until it constantly kept messing up on my Kindle HD refuses to load and now constantly telling me internal error even after I've uninstalled and reinstalled still same thing i will not be spending anymore money on this game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Growing up with these horse games, I have to say this one is really good. You don't have to constantly play it, and the mini games are a lot of fun. I would recommend it to any horse lover!
B000NDIAWY|5.0|really good. This is the kind of music that really relaxes me. Brandi has a beautiful voice. Love to listen to her.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Purchased this CD as a birthday gift for my sister...she absolutely loves it and listens to it daily! I would recommend it for any of his die-hard fans!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Beautiful voice, Bold, honest, classy lyrics. Hope she does more albums. Well worth the time to listen too. Two more words
0385342071|3.0|For a kinsella chick novel, it was okay. The main character is likeable, especially in how she grows. I did not like the premise though-- a man loses his phone and a woman refuses to give it back. I would be mad if it were my phone.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall is fun. I enjoyed it as much as the early Sean Connery Bonds. Unlike them the characters have more depth in this one and their relationships are fleshed out more fully than in any other Bond film.  I'm almost convinced that this is the best of the Bond films.
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|I was looking for something different as a teacher. I was expecting real classrooms and real teachable ideas. Instead, there was a lot of nitty gritty history of different researchers. Oh well.
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|I bought this for Grace Kelly and the fact that I love old movies but I am bowled over by the incredible image quality of the bluray.  Some bluray transfers are full of artifacts and not so great color, but not this one.  It looks mastered from a 70mm original- the sharpness and color balance are referrance quality.  This transfer pushes the limits of 1080p imaging- the hair and fabric rendering are incredible.  Cary Grant's striped shirt in the movie has absolutely no moire' at all- lesser quality transfers would have shown this.  When I play this on my Panasonic PT-AR100U projector and 120-inch FAVI screen, it looks as if I am in the theater when this originally played; the colors just pop off the screen.  I will watch this movie just to see the visual quailty.

B009NY43NY|1.0|I loved the fact vampires were part of community apart of sookie life but now everything seem to get sookie back normal life and stay with sam. Like she forgot she loved Erick... it just seems like the book was rushed and erick was almost and everybody else that were Vamp disappear from the storyline. I should have waited to buy it cause i feel ruined with that story.
B008J34466|3.0|There is only two songs on the cd that i really like to listen to on this cd the other ones i have never heard of
0143038419|5.0|this book is just wonderful...you should also watch the movie but there is just nothing like reading a book.  this one should be read by all!
B009NY43NY|5.0|An amazing book filled with all my favorite characters. While I was extremely sad that Eric and Sookie parted ways so coldly and quickly, I appreciated the turn this storyline took and was taken aback (in a good way) more times than I can count by the twists and turns in the plot. I tried to read slowly but still finished this book in less than a day. The best of Sookie`s strange and turbulent life was saved for this last book. Thank you Charlaine Harris for a truly memorable and exciting ride, and for sharing Sookie and all her adventures with us.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I like Bruno Mars, I think he is very talented.  I especially liked him on &#34;Saturday Night Live.&#34;  I did not like this CD as much as I thought I would I probably should have ordered a different one, but still it is a very good CD, I recommend it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This is a fun game for kids and adults alike..wish they would come down on some of the prices..maybe have a &quot;select all&quot; so you can collect coins at the same time.....graphics are beautiful.....<br />Have trailer plants would be another nice add
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I bought this for the free MP3 download.  I would definitely recommend this album for those who love great oldies.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Not much to really say about The Piano Guys other than they are one of the most talented and dynamic instrumentalist out there today. If you like good, quality music no matter what your age is then you will enjoy their albums greatly. Between them, Lindsey Stirling and Taylor Davis I've been hooked on contemporary classical musicians. Perfect listen for kids and grandparents alike.
0345803485|1.0|I heard so much hipe about this book and it absolutely sucked.  It was boring and I am so glad I did not buy the set.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have loved this series from day one.  Not so thrilled when Alan Ball raped the stories and made them so unbelievable that even a die hard Sookie fan like me is seriously rethinking even watching anymore.  However this last supposed to be EPIC finale of a long great series had an anti-climatic ending.  Looked like just throwing a few odds and ends in and trying to make a story out of it.  I was hoping more for a fireworks show when everything just kind of faded and the characters I love were not even really there just in passing.  The personalities of the vampires didnt even show as Eric supposed to be a fighting viking was boring and not even really there.  I loved this series for how it tried to top itself over and over but this last ending was just disappointing and kind of sucked.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|this game is a game you want to download to pass time at work. I can play this game and like hour's have gone by&quot;)
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Like this first installment and ready for more. The detail and color are great gotta love HD........ That is until 4K gets here.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game. Made you really think. Try not to use the hints or you will finish the game a lot faster. Can't wait for the 2nd one.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|I like the DVD, it is somewhat scarce, I could not find it in local stores which are very well stocked.  The service was excellent and I am happy.<br /><br />Bob J.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|!!!!!SPOILER ALERTS!!!!!!!!!  At the end of reading City of Bones I was so horrified that Clary and Jace were &#34;brother and sister&#34;  that I immediately had to go on Amazon to read reviews for the other books because I wasn't going to keep reading if they really were.  Happily, as it turns out (not until City of Glass of course)  that they aren't so you can read this book with a sigh of relief that even though they haven't discovered it yet, you are not rooting for incest.  The series is addicting and are very fast reads.  The plot can be a bit predictable but it's YA lit, it's not meant to be Nietzsche.  It's a good series, and I am eagerly awaiting the next in line!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|It's Blake Shelton....Does more need to be said??? It is a GREAT CD! Evidently more needs to be said, because it wouldn't let me post without puting more words....
B001NLL93W|5.0|When I read City of Bones I was so grossed out by the fact that she had made Jace and Clary siblings that I had to check the reviews for the next 2 books to make sure they fixed that plot line before I kept reading them, so I knew before reading this book that they eventually found out that they weren't related.  I figured once her mother woke up she would be able to clear it up, and thankfully I was right.  I'm definitely a fan, the plot line is a little easy to figure out, but overall they are good fun books for a Saturday afternoon.
B009CS0VNW|5.0|Harper Lee's, To Kill a Mockingbird, is an American Classic. It takes place in a small town in Alabama named Maycomb during the Great Depression. It's based over a three year period of eight year old girl's life. Scout is the narrator of the story. She lives with her father Atticus, her older brother Jem, and their African American cook Calpurnia.<br /> The book begins with Jem and Scout meeting Dill for the first time. He had come to stay with his aunt during the summer until school had started again. The children have many adventures together but their biggest is their obsession with mysterious neighbor Boo Radley. Everyone was afraid of the Radley house so the children would make games of it. After Atticus would sternly suggest that they leave him alone they became more secretive about their attempts to get Boo to come out. While the children are engulfed in their own activities and adventures, Atticus is assigned to defend Tom Robinson in his case. Tom Robinson was and African American being accused of raping Mayella Ewell a young white woman.<br /> As the trial goes on the children seem to forget about Boo for awhile and focus more on the Tom Robinson Case. Once the jury had made their verdict on the case Jem and Scout realized that no everyone had been raised with the same morals as them. After the trial everything seems to go back to normal accept for the constant threats to Atticus for defending and African American. The story ends with Jem and Scout being attacked by the same man that had been threatening Atticus. Boo Radley save the children's lives and all was well again.<br /> My opinion of the story is that it is a must read novel. There are a lot of life lessons to be learned by this novel as well as self morals. If you have to be snatched up by a book in the first paragraph or chapter to be able to read it keep in mind when you start reading because for me it took a few chapters until it got interesting. All in all it was a fantastic book and I enjoyed the whole thing.<br />Side note: I'm a junior in high school and I hate reading (that's how good of a book it was)

1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is a real-life experience by a reknowned neurosurgeon.  It is believable and very encouraging.  I highly recommend this book for those seeking more information about after-life and a scientists perspective of his own experience.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game love it's great has cool things awesome great for kids at any age and parents/adults and it has nice characters in the game to.
B0031QUTBA|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Friends series. I originally owned the big box set, but the discs were wearing out and I needed to replace them. This was the perfect replacement. The cases are nice and slim, so they fit on the shelf easier and I received the package in 2 days in perfect condition. (I have free 2 day shipping). Very pleased with both product and seller. Would definitely recommend!
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I have no problems with this app what so ever. I love this game and graphics. I<br />have both in to hide on my device so let them snoop away. For all those that were complaining  about privacy then delete and move on. Great game!!! I got this game when it was the FREE app of the day but it is worth 99 cents. Won't be a waste of money.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|Well written book. A lot of suspense . Kathy Reich's books always keeps one guessing and interested in the outcome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game subway surfer is such a excellent game. It's addictive once I pick up my kindle fire its subway surfer for at least 1 1/2 hours of playing.

In my home of 4 we all love subway surfer, please keep this game and keep giving us cool places to visit.  THANKS, THE HILTON-DAVIS FAMILY

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Sucks you in and pulls you around and around and rings so many emotions in you.  I read this book in what felt like minutes. Couldn't put it down. I have read all three of these books in two days. I honestly didn't want to start reading them after reading hopeless in a matter of hours. I was proved right yet again. I got sucked in and couldn't stop reading. Love love love this author. Thank you Collen.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had not seen the first two season on PBS, but got hooked on it when I saw Season Three.  It's is a wondeful series and very entertaining.
B005HP2J66|5.0|If you've ever read any of Jean Aurels books, especially the last (The Land of Painted Caves), this is what she was writing about.<br />From what I remember her writing, she had visited one of these caves in France.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book series was excellent. Kept Me guessing the whole time. Recommend it for preteen age and up. I can't believe it's over
B00COHAUD4|5.0|What a horrifically fanciful story. I was enthralled with this film from start to finish. What makes \\"Mama\\" so great is the entertaining story and raw emotion. The story is basically about 2 little girls who disappear into the wood and are found 5 years later with a new set of feral skills. The question on everyone's mind is how did they survive? The answer is simple - mama protected them.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A fantastic book. Mitch Albom touches the soul and makes you rethink life as you know it. I will never look at time the same way, nor will I take for granted the time I have left.
B004W2V254|5.0|This was a great movie.  It was well done for sure.  I do not usually like foreign language movies with subtitles, but with this one I cold barely even tell I was reading them.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Special effects were very good.  Unknown actors were good.  Seems that Bollywood is catching on to good movies for the United States.

0307346617|5.0|I recommend this book for anybody who like Zombies. This is maybe the bible of the Zombies stories. I saw the trailer of the film and from there I got to know the book. Things in imagination looks better than films. Specifically when dealing with millions of Zombies and chaos
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|Miley Cyrus did such a great job acting in this movie. She really pulls off the rebellious, resentful teenager well!
B009NY43NY|1.0|I absolutely loved the first  books about Sookie Stackhouse and her adventures in the vampire-were world.  But in my opinion, the last 3 books steadily went downhill in both the story line and the writing. I guess the author just became burned out with her heroine.  In spite of many reservations, I purchased this book and was again, let down with the story line.  Ms. Harris has shown herself to be an exceptional writer in the past, maybe she needs a break.  In conclusion, a great disappointment and I would not recommend Sookie fans to buy this book.
B000B8QG22|4.0|Excellent movie that says a lot about why we had problems with all third world incursions.  Excellent performance by Robin.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|This is new music from the Doobie Bros. and they haven't lost a beat since their<br />music in the 70's. If you liked them then you will enjoy both the CD & DVD, if you<br />didn't know them then you will learn what everybody liked about them.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|To understand this CD you have to understand the sound of the Moody Blues.<br />They put creation to music. I bought this album when it first came out in 1970<br />and had to have as a CD. Highly recommended
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It is a wonderful story of perseverance in dire circumstances. Martel introduces religion in a subtle unobtrusive way and uses it as a way describe the character's mindset, rather than forcing it upon the reader. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an interesting and uplifting story of survival.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As said in the \\"required\\" title, this book is great. Although i think the directors will butcher any movie about it, especially since they took it Maislee Donnar. Yep. Movie will suck, but the book puts an interesting skin on things.
B0052FG750|5.0|I can't believe the crisp sound on these trax! It sounds so clear! I want to also get this in vinyl.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really enjoyed Day One and was eager to get started on Day Two. Rothfuss didn't disappoint with another engaging tale continuing to follow Kvothe's exploits. I did feel that the second half of the book may have taken a bit too much time detailing some of his fantastical exploits. But overall it was always hard to put the book down each time I picked it up since I was always getting so wrapped up in the story.
0393317552|4.0|A good book for a history nut. I read about a third of the book but became over whelm with the history details.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Now I know why this smart series has been so popular.<br />I will certainly continue to watch  the rest of the series.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|now I am going to buy it... Love me some Bradley Cooper! Watch it.  It is awesome and a half!
