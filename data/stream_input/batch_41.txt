B00NJ903MY|4|very nice easy to use. Fairly bright but not as bright as halogens.
B00DI94B82|5|I actually use 3 of these for moving my Harley Tri - Glide ( trike ) around in my garage so the wife can pull her crv in the garage i the winter
B00NJ9MZH0|3|dull white. Not bright as you may think based on their images. Halogen originals are definitely better light but LED's should last longer.<br /><br />Problem with using on Hyundia Elantra is you lose your high beams because they are no AC current compatible.
B01463WLBW|5|I have been waiting forever to get these seat covers.  I have been thinking about trying them for several months.  Amazon shows that it is not a fit for my Dodge Neon so I was hesitant to order them.  When I got the opportunity to receive them at a discount for my honest review, I knew I had to get them.  First, I want to say that it took me about 20 minutes to put them on.  I had never put seat covers on before so I was surprised at how easy it was.  The material is pretty thin but they look great on the front seats.  The bottom part of the back seat just pops right out so that was very easy to put on and pop back in.  The only part that did not fit my car was the back part of the back seat. It actually stays on and doesn't look bad but it doesn't fit snugly like the rest of the seats. It looks much better than before so I am happy.  I will try to post a picture later so you can see.  My old seat cover for my driver's seat was just a generic fit and was always very loose.  The cover often came off or bunched up and was uncomfortable.  These seat covers stay in place and do not move around at all.  I cannot express how pleased I am with these seat covers.  My car looks very nice now.  It is a 2004 and has went through my children growing up so the seats had stains and looked terrible before.  I think this is a great deal even if you can only use the front seat covers.  It really is very easy to install.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B00I36L2AA|5|Good product and value.
B00GSAUHB8|5|I ordered this for a 2003 Sienna van and received it yesterday.  Its easy to use and fits without an issue.  It covers just about the entire window, much better that the folding shade I had previously used.  Its easy to put up and take down.<br /><br />I liked it so much I ordered two more for my Corollas.  I found that you can overlap the center part between the wire loop and it fits perfectly, and the center fold goes behind the mirror to hold up the center.
B000CQFQ7E|5|Exact fit for Walker 40001 Flexible Exhaust Pipe
B00XPL88NC|5|Good, nicely marked, quick shipping.
B00SCBHPVG|5|Very satisfied with these led bulbs. They are really bright and look nice on my car.
B00A7ZSXPM|1|This did not fit my 2004 XC90 T6. It looked the same as my old one. The threaded part fit fine but the hose end diameter was too small. There was just no way for it to work.<br /><br />In addition this part was very poorly cast. There was a hole in the casting. I don't know if the hole would have caused a leak as it was on the hose end. Either way it should never have made it past quality control.<br /><br />I tired to modify it to make it work for me and it broke. I don't hold the manufacturer responsible for this but for this reason I could not just return it.<br /><br />As it turned out I made some brass fittings and tubing work for me.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Saved so many dropped items. Well worth the money for simple safety!!
B00RVZ0PPC|5|Its Toyota genuine product. What you've to say about this.
B000ALDQDC|5|Very Easy Install - works well
B000IZ4P3U|4|work fine but I received one with a broken wiring connector.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Shade from the sun. Works.
B00I5SMLMY|5|Awesome, a great addition to the rest of the package.
B0015DMNIS|5|This tool is a lifesaver. So many different uses.<br />I have used it to remove CV joints, though I bought a set of longer arms.<br />I have used it to remove hub bearings.<br />I have used it to remove axles.<br />Its very well made and will last me lifetime of diy mechanic jobs.
B00QXU9BG0|5|Love it! Her lips are even red on a black and white picture of her! I would buy more lucy merchandise.  Janet H.
B0009ZEVJC|5|best air filter you can buy and at a very reasonable price
B00R9F49Z6|4|A little bit pricey compared to the strut alone.  But after getting a complete kit of all new hardware installed, it's nice to know it's done.  Replacing everything at once made the job go a lot smoother, but also gave us piece of mind knowing all of the hardware along with the strut is new too.  Fairly straight forward to install.
B00SI9HFLW|5|Perfect match, and while expensive, considerably cheaper than having someone else do it, and you have the option of fixing chips as they happen.  This doesn't seem like a lot but it will do a lot of chip repairs.  Take your time and read the instructions and you will get a repair that is invisible when all is said and done.
B000CB7DG6|5|OEM, what else to say!
B000GBBP8O|5|Should have ordered this a long time ago.  So easy to install and works perfectly!
B002UD0GIG|1|I bought this kit thinking it coyld help take out some minor scratches in some of the DVDs I own, but it didn't do anything but cause more scratches on the discs.
B007H2SBSM|1|Horrible--looks great but the motor is defective, I will try to return it
B000E28MSG|5|High quality
B000Y5AGS2|5|good
B0002MAFR4|5|Sturdy and fit as expected
B0006MTRJ2|5|it works
B00MEE5LDG|5|Verny good
B00ZX93FUA|5|Stunning!!!! This is such a beauitful product that there are not enough words to describe how beautifu this thing is!!<br /><br />It looks amazing on my car!!!
B000CMHTU0|5|They don't have the hole to catch the hook on the floor board of my 2003 tundra but they don't move around - they are still nice mats
B004S3I8S6|5|I broke the old handle and was starting to get annoyed of reaching around on the inside to open it. This handle installed and worked perfectly. It is also much cheaper than getting a replacement from a toyota dealer.
B005N76KH2|1|These boy shorts run seriously small. I got a medium (which is what I wear in everything), and attempted to put them on. I couldn't even get my legs in. They fit more like petite/xtra small
B00DX89NC2|3|The stator was the wrong one for the intended motorcycle.  However, it will fit my other bike if ever needed.  Essentially, I ordered the wrong part.
B001P6GONU|3|It works ok for my fiancé, but it is not sturdy enough & it started to tear.
B00TED0J0U|1|It's not original and won´t fit my Mazda CX-5  2016.<br />Waste of money.
B000BZLJKE|5|Perfect part.Seems to be working fine after 3 weeks.
B001EBFVS0|5|Looks great.  Fits great.
B0049E4VJO|5|Once I figured out the proper way to use this tool it worked well.I use it to rivet on power window motor regulators.
B003E26FW8|5|Pads fit perfectly on my 2010 Honda Accord Ex-L. The stock rear pads on this year Accord wear out way to quickly. I had 27k miles before they needed replacement. I combined these pads with Centric premium rotors which also fit perfect on the rear of my 2010. I've never had a problem with Centric rotors or Akebono ProACT pads so this will continue to be my go to combination for brakes.
B004QEF970|5|I have a hitch safe that rusted in my receiver due to moisture coming in from the back side. Cut out the old safe. Coated the new one with grease and put this in to plug the other end of the receiver to keep water and whatever else out. Fits nice and tight
B004I0VK16|5|Great buy!
B000CLSPWW|4|Shipping was free, all parts were correct and fit.
B00042KG3A|4|I like it, but the paint is chipping and cracking (it's on a hood mount) after less than a month. It hasn't even been used - just mounted.
B000C55MQK|5|all good
B008OYZWFW|5|Great replacement, good fit.
B008G2YBV8|5|Items arrived fast and in great condition. Very easy to install and look great on the car. Make the car look new. Already recommended seller to my father-in-law
B00OHGU1P2|1|The magnet snapped in half.
B0085XO2QM|5|Seller was awesome to deal with. Kept me informed and got me the bracket very quickly. Great fit too, direct bolt on. 0 modifications needed to bolt up my new seat.
B00BSWMTRG|3|horrible customer service , good product , misleading pictures which they changed now for the best
B001BS9VR8|5|After a few steamy VA months now, this valve is still functioning in a 2007 Chrysler T&C. Easy replacement...there's just enough room to remove the valve w/o having to move the alternator. I can replace it in about 10 minutes.
B00LEBLI82|4|Not as bright as you would like. But you can turn them all on and not worry about your battery
B001M0XR3Y|5|Enhancer plate is very nice but had to use a different double sided tape because the 3m tape that was sent with product would not hold
B00F91QIZ6|5|Easy to hook up super bright
B0044PN612|5|Bought this for my husband's Harley; it is VERY WELL made and double sided (which is what we were looking for).  It is well worth the price....it was packaged well and shipped on time.  I highly recommend.
B0040Z7X10|4|fit exactly,  little thin,  more fragile than expensive ones.
B008HZK7G2|4|Good product.
B0093AAZEE|5|The Shade is great
B0016I604K|5|Perfect!  Our mechanic was impressed!
B00SC1054K|5|I have been meaning to get replacement remotes for years but couldn't afford over a hundred dollars each plus Programming.  These came in and I was able to go to the Website and find the programming instructions very easily and get them working right away.
B00757IGYS|4|I noticed a slight loss of reception especially around the mountains but otherwise works like a charm. No more worrying about a snapped antenna at the car wash. Looks good too
B00KZ3MPR8|5|Excelent product.
B000C57XFI|4|CAME LATE
B0053P69IO|5|Quality construction. Fair price. Made in USA.
B00GJK4X8U|5|Shipping was fast. Steppers and soldering tools worked great. My only problem was soldering the small pieces. It all depends on your abilities.
B00OG6M3EA|1|No instructions or specs.
B005N73WNW|5|Very nice, great quality. Fits a little bigger than expected, not huge.
B008DIZ1S2|4|Didn't come with 4 screw covers only 2
B0052YDXRQ|5|Fits my Sorento perfect.
B00OUSQVI8|4|It fit my JDM Headlights for my 92 Civic EG Hatch without conflict. I received the order within the expected delivery date and the packaging was more than acceptable. These Carbon Fiber 'Eye Lashes' or 'Eye Lids' (depending on weather you see your car as a male or female personality) help to prevent the headlights from shining into other drivers eyes at night, especially if you've done a HID (HUD?) Conversion kit on the bulbs...all while looking pretty awesome.<br />Everything attaches using double sided 3M heavy duty tape which was provided by the seller at no extra charge. and the Carbon fiber is the usual crisscross fashion matching my other carbon fiber items quite nicely.<br />The Carbon Fiber itself was thin and flimsy and I don't expect it to last more than a few years, which is the reason for the 4 star rating, but overall I am happy with this purchase. I mean...it's not like anyone else is making a better version of these, that I was able to find and they look siiiiiiiick.
B000LNY1MY|5|This stuff is great!! I'm using the infamous $100 paint job method, i.e. a roller brush and a can of rustoleum enamel + paint thinner, to paint my old pickup truck. And when I add this Enamel Hardener the rustoleum dries much harder and faster. I didn't think the difference in using this vs. not would be obvious at all, but it is. And it says that it helps with UV protection too which is awesome. I'm also adding a small amount of Penetrol but it's not needed really. This enamel hardener IS needed though. A must.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B007X74ZTK|5|IT WORKED AWSOME
B004JY6AVQ|5|Cheap n was perfect
B007P73J3Q|5|Great seller. Prompt and merchandise as advertised.
B00XO2CZL8|5|Looks great in my BMW 328i.
B000CM3IAA|5|Great price, fast delivery, worked perfectly.
B004RFKBEO|5|We put this on the back of our class c motor home for 2 adult bikes and 2 kids bikes and it holds them secure. If we don't take the bikes it's nice to throw campfire wood on also. Well made and easy to assemble.
B00MX77Q5K|5|Just installed these struts and love them.  Nice ride and the install was not difficult.
B000COC0GQ|5|Great - don't really notice a difference in MPG but I know it's definitely better than the OEM filter since now I don't have to replace it with a new one since this one is reusable.  I have always used K&N in my vehicles and its currently installed in my 2015 Subaru WRX Premium Edition.  Was one of the first things I did to my subie.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00GEZ3CZK|5|Works great! Have had them in for a month, and no flickering. Put in the relay (which was very easy to install) with no issues.
B002KOBTFO|5|Beautiful chrome fit and finish, super easy install, fast shipping, and great seller! Thanks Amazon!!
B007OW6M0Y|4|i only needed one, but the 5 pack is cheep and now i have a lot for the future.
B00QQUCU7O|5|Fits good for my 2015 Honda Pilot. Easy to install.  Keeps my butt from sweating in the leather seats and my legs sticking to them.  :)  Like that it is just the bottom with no back.
B000EQUVWW|5|Looks Great, solid material, went on with no issues. The screw covers do take some force to snap on, but one you do you're solid and good to go.
B000COCRJ6|5|as advertised
B00KOTGPV0|5|Good
B0002L78CU|5|Fit excellent on my murano 2007, very happy with the product
B00M0CQQAY|4|Love them
B00BLAG3D6|5|better than expected
B002UC6PY6|1|Came scratched.  Not good for Show Jeep.
B00B2A2HWQ|5|Great product, works like it's supposed too
B0014JN68O|4|Nice grill
B00FJUZY8Y|1|The first time I used this product, the wheel broke within 10 feet of moving it, cause it not to move with less than 100 pounds.  I was very not impressed and disappointed.  It was difficult to piece together based on material quality and impossible to take apart to ship back for exchange.  Not at all what I expected.
B007WR66QQ|5|Perfect replacement for my OEM Bosch spark plugs for my 2009 Audi A4 Avant with 2.0T engine B8 gen.  In fact, my dealer has informed me that certified audi service depts now use NGK instead of Bosch for spark plug replacement service.  Engine is running very smoothly, with better power and performance.  Have not had ability to evaluate any MPG improvement in gas efficiency, but I expect that will improve now as well.
B000UUMM6K|4|Item functions well.  Had to replace similiar item which was in black.  The black cover eliminated too much daylight from the vent it covered.  This white one allows sufficient light to enter the vent.
B00ZTNZIPA|5|Awesome product and I will be buying from TAYLOR33 again!
B00GQC3TKO|5|Love this helmet! Perfect!  i've been riding harleys for 15 years and i went from a peanut to a half to a modular (bell rogue) helmets to this nolan full face.  I have been using this helmet for 2 months now and it has improved my riding experience greatly to the point i'll never use anything else. no more dust or bugs or rocks or road debris of any kind in my face. no more dust in my eyes.  when the sun is bright i just flip down the sunvisor, air vents are sufficient enough. when my faceshield starts to fog i just flip up the clear visor a notch.  the View is the best and most vision i've ever had wearing a helmet (as per other reviews) i can see more clearly than ever, which is more safe!  plus i feel more safe with this on than any other helmet i've had before, and it looks awesome also. the fit is snug but not tight (i wear a large, same as i had in the bell rogue). years ago i tried on a full face at the harley dealer and it felt confining and i said no way to full face helmets, until this helmet. it's no where near like the other one i tried on. Nolan n44 is awesome!
B0002JMDC2|5|Worked great for a leather chair in the house.
B00CZD7QOS|5|SuperB
B000OZSA80|4|This is a nice product. It fit well on my Polaris ranger, except when I traveled a bit faster the center of the top would come up with the breeze. So I taped a 4 inch manifold bolt inside the center of the top with clear gorilla glue tape and that seems to hold it down nicely. No complaints, I really like it because it keeps the sun off me.<br />  I believe this is a good product and would recommend it to others.<br />  Nick Charest
B00T8HPJNY|5|Great product at this time.  A better review would include more time & use of product.<br />Great customer support.  Twist apart the base and bulb assembly. Mount base 1st. Then mount bulb assembly w/ car's original rubber water proof seal. They give you blue, amber & clear lens covers to choose from.
B000AM8BF4|4|Work's great
B006RUJ2D8|5|Stuff is great. Removed RV decals very well.
B005JCL3X2|3|Probably best suited to the base Impreza but not better than worn shocks on a WRX or STI. My struts and shocks were shot. leaking on the pistons and elsewhere and I wanted a decent replacement set since I might be trading the car sooner than later. Packaging was good and the shocks were pretty easy to install for a first timer with air tools and a QUALITY spring compressor.<br /><br />I notice less bounce than the blown set but I wouldn't call these performance rated as these don't seem firm enough for the performance side of things. I would have gone the Koni route, but the cost and modification necessary drove me away.<br /><br />*** I would NOT try these with aftermarket springs with a higher rate than the WRX comes with.
B001U7GVKK|5|These are great! I was really worried about the ride quality since they are compressing the stock spring, but my ride quality is actually better! The truck seems to handle better and way less body roll but still absorbs road conditions just like OEM height. I used these on my 2009 F150 to lower it 2&#34; in the front to match the 2&#34; lowering shackle in the rear. They took about 2.5 hours to install. The installation is pretty straight forward, I would recommend using thread lock when putting bolts back together though. Don't forget to get an alignment once all is back together. They look and perform great. At the same time I installed Belltech 2216EE in the rear. I am very happy with both.
B006BDGDXI|4|I purchased three for my Pontiac G6. All three were easily programed by my car dealer for a minimal charge.<br />Very pleased!
B000C9QTK4|5|This filter fit my Mazda 6 perfectly.  I did not see any degradation in performance so I guess its working as it should.  Would recommend.
B000BUOSGG|5|fix great in the trailer sink
B00029WRH8|5|The same boot that you could get directly from B&M.  What's not to like?
B0024GIWDK|4|Haventtwent on a ride yet to test. Bacatcha on this
B00363D9Y2|5|It looks good brand new, hope it holds up on my car.
B000IYY7S4|5|These were OEM replacements.  Installation was a breeze and they work great.
B00BEX76R2|5|Looks great! Easy to install and would recommend to anyone!
B00EFFX94U|5|exact color
B00DVRY03M|5|Worked perfect
B0085IK0P4|1|I bought one of these (although not here) and I would not do so again.I used it on the back of my travel trailer because it was advertised for use on a vehicle or motorhome. Technically my RV is a fifth wheel and not a motorhome so maybe it bounces more than a motorhome. However after only 1 1/2 trips between Oklahoma and Colorado the main tube that fits in the receiver fatigued and broke. I used a hitch clamp B0068D9L6W to keep the thing from shifting and rattling to minimize any movements.<br /><br />The problem appears to me to have been caused from the fact that the main tube is made out of fairly thin steel. If I was to use an off the shelf carrier again I would make sure that the tube was 1/4&#34; wall or even solid bar like some of the hitch parts Curt MFG sells. My motorcycle lists as weighing 270lbs (2012 Yamaha wr450f) so I was way under the load capacity for the thing.<br /><br />I decided none of these type of carriers is very good for an RV (most say don't use on an RV). I am having my RV hitch modified by welding on an additional 2 Curt mfg. part #49120 receivers towards the ends and having a custom carrier built that slides into at least 2 of the available receivers and probably all 3 to distribute the weight and keep the thing from flopping around. I would maybe use this style of carrier on a car or 1/2 ton truck, but probably not on a 3/4 or 1 ton one where the suspension is much firmer. But no matter what I would make sure the main carrier tube is better than this one.<br /><br />The good news is my carrier broke before I pulled out of the campsite when I was leaving the campground. I forgot to take one of the yellow plastic wheel chocks out from in front of the trailer wheel and when the RV rolled over the top of it and came down it snapped the carrier. Way better than being on the highway going 65 and hitting a pothole!<br /><br />Anyway I included a picture of the fix a welder did for me in Creede CO because I could not locate a replacement oneand didn't want to haul a utility trailer behind my RV. My only other option was to rent a storage unit or leave the bike somewhere until I could get back and pick it up. I watched it with my RV backup camera all the way back home and had the whole mess tied to the RV ladder just in case. What a disaster.
B00EFH8OX4|2|Fits well.. But started rusting in two months
B0000UUU6E|5|Good job
B00843WOEA|4|Good quality, nice & easy on the feet. The Black Tip emblem didn't stick very well & had to trim just a bit on a couple pads. Like the color & quality.
B000XY2YIY|5|They work fine, and fit my 2013 Fat Bob even though your web site said they wouldn't. Kuryakyn site said they would fit fine and they did. A lot bigger platform for my feet.
B00H6XPZN6|5|These are perfect sizes to cover 80% of an average back seat window or a 4 door car. My dogs are no longer roasting in the sun! It keeps the car much cooler during the day. A must have for summer, especially Florida summer!
B00RC9NH2K|3|FITS PRETTY GOOD
B00DFPVN5S|5|Perfect for our new driver!
B00Q6EXNVW|5|They worked great for me and have had no problems.
B000E81VN8|5|Awesome trunk organizer.  Fits perfectly in my 20006 4Runner.
B000IYYTUK|1|listed to fit 2006 landrover hse<br />let it be known that its not even close.
B00TXVNZQI|1|Case was too big for the key. Definitely NOT a good fit.
B00QJSES7I|5|easy to apply, looks like itll be tough to remove, which is a good thing imo
B000UOFJVG|5|Always  great product.
B000C41HDS|5|It doesn't squeal like the one I replaced, and it works just fine.
B00Y09N8T2|4|Wired a switch so the status light doesn't drain the battery.
B00X5EO716|5|Really good code reader. I have used many different ones and this one is in the top 10.
B006EGAIII|5|Nice design, I love it.
B00BT1GNCI|4|work fine
B005G0X1D2|1|Does not fit Europe models of wrx sti 2006 and 2007. Could not use it and I was pushed to reuse the old seal.
B00UL3E0MU|5|Arrived quickly and easy to install. Working great. No problems
B00OX2GLAY|5|Thru God, all things are possible!
B00RDUWM9C|4|came intact, but haven't put it on yet.
B00UIPWAP0|5|Looks great on the back of the truck.
B0075A0CT2|5|Fit perfect
B00C9OFGKY|5|This new board was perfect.  Perfect fit and worked flawlessly.
B00EA0ZB7I|1|After installation one killed over on me i had them wired and ready to go i turned them on i got maybe 10 minutes out of one before it blew on me it took me a week or soo to figure out the issue i was having but it blew up on me i posted a picture of the blown light
B00IY3YLCI|3|Well made and excellent for the price. The only problem I see on it is the inlet for the wires into the housing doesn't appear to be sealed up. Nothing some clear or black RTV sealer won't fix though!.
B0052FRT2A|5|Order came promptly and fit my toyota without any issues
B00T2GT9L4|5|Other than the fact that the jaws are made of plastic this is a really good compact car jumper and portable as you can get..
B00AECG828|5|I highly recommend this net. It worked great for me every time I used it. I wish I would of bought a spare and plan on ordering another soon.
B000C2GG72|5|IF YOU HAVE PAST EXPERIENCE  WITH SMALL BLOCK OIL PANS  I AM SURE AT TIMES YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE HAS BEEN HIGH . THIS  HIGH QUALITY GASKET PUTS ALL OTHERS TO  SHAME IN EASE OF INSTALLATION AND THE QUALITY TO PERFORM
B000AOMQ80|5|Does the job.
B002E2WMVW|4|Exactly as advertised. We'll see what type of life they have this winter when the sun goes down at 4:30.
B00N3VYMJ8|4|Great power handle, it isn't that stylish but  works well and feels comfortable in my hand does not slip like others I had before
B002MH1W42|5|Beatifull excellent
B003S5XCDQ|4|It would have been a five star rating but I had to modify it a bit.  The nipple where the heater hose connects was about an inch and 3/4 too long.  I did notice it but I didn't think much about it.  I mounted the tank and noticed the extra length cause the hose to bend sharply and kink.<br /><br />I trimmed it down with a hacksaw,  reinstalled it and it has been perfect.  Very high quality part.  Like I said,  should have been a 5 star.
B00G85J02K|5|Don't have to worry about someone stealing them as happened to previous caps.
B00IITPGMC|5|Really like the brakes and rotors
B00AQ8H2NE|4|These floor mats fit my 2008 Toyota Sienna like a glove. My only wish was that it came in gray instead of black.
B007XY3R42|5|Fixed my blinds right up, lol took four of us but we did it
B000Q754E4|5|We had one of these many years ago and loved and wore it out. used it for the first time this weekend and it worked even better than I remembered. The food stayed cold and it was so much better than packing a cooler with ice or those freezer blocks. I think the food was more uniformly cool than when using a traditional cooler. It is the right size for us. Not so huge that it is a struggle to carry, yet big enough for taking food from vacation back home. Very glad I bought it.
B000BRF38Q|5|Quality made. Easy to install.
B006C86G4S|5|No more cold face!
B00GKTZAHS|3|put sticker on cell phone case. lost color within days! kinda cheapo!
B004G6Z9YQ|5|This is good stuff, I have a road trip plan in a few weeks and this will be in my saddlebags.
B00Z2RCCE8|4|It is a good product for the price I paid. I wish it were a little louder. But overall I am very satisfied.
B003IS3HV0|2|not the best leather product.
B00N9A8NU2|5|The item was delivered as described
B00HJ15922|5|I love these - add's more bling to my 2005 Black PT cruiser...  I would definatley purchase these again if need be or for a friend!
B00QZ8YK16|5|Love it. Got a custom cutout for my Tundra to mount it in. Took 10 minutes.  I got some thick foam tape to wrap around the loose wires behind the panel. Very satisfied.  Better than factory stuff.
B006QXN2W8|4|Keeps my grandson's Drifter going.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Works great. Better than original BMW cardboard sun protector
B0010E0VZE|5|Exact replacement for my '08 Camry.
B00FOKOKKC|4|I was going to give this product 5 Stars, but when I started to buff the balm with a clean cloth, as recommended, some of the dye started to come off. I waited in excess of 5 minutes before buffing.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about this product, was when I opened the jar, it was full right up to the top.  This surprised me.<br /><br />I was able to do two love seats (one large and one medium) and two ordimens and still have have some of the product remaining.
B001H2468C|5|My OEM Ford clutch is currently at 127k miles and it is just starting to wear out. I ordered this clutch and anticiapte that it will take me over a quarter of a million miles.
B001KM5IZO|5|Always  great product.
B000B68V9K|5|This stuff is magic.  You've got to understand basic prep procedures, once you get it on it levels and finishes with the best satin paints out there.  Very easy to apply.<br /><br />Great adjustable spray nozzle too. I used it on primered metal and scuff sanded plastic, they both took it well.
B002WC12U6|5|Makes the exaust sound a lot deeper and so easy to install
B004K9I25C|4|I used this on my 1995 Suzuki DR650 to replace the the vacuum controlled valve. As others have noted, the reserve capacity is greatly reduced. Despite that, it fit perfectly and was a very reasonable solution.
B00UXM6F22|4|I receive the power inverter with not polarized plug, can I have this replaced with polarized plug. Some of the review says this issue was suppose to be taken care off and here I received one that is non polarized.<br />Thank you<br /><br />Follow up note: A representative from krieger called me up and offered replacement or polarized outlet right after I wrote the review. I would just like to say that customer service from this company has been great, I would update my star into 4 star.<br />Thank you !!!
B00PSPUKIO|5|Someone told me I could use this to clean the stains off a steel door leading into my restaurant...wow they were right.  Thanks!!!
B000GKEZ1E|1|Bought from autozone.<br />Followed instructions to the word.<br />Fell off when trying to attach mirror.<br />I see that even the 5 star reviewer edited his review to say that it fell off in few days.
B00COYNZJ8|1|When I ordered this through Amazon last year, I thought I was getting a great deal.  The Star Wars sunshade is an excellent idea, and everything proceeded as I had foreseen...for about six months, at which point the flaking and disintegration mentioned in so many other reviews began.  I still use it on occasion, but it's an absolute mess.  I will keep it long enough to use in the parking lot when we go see Episode VII in December...even if it's raining, but after that, it will be disposed of and not replaced.  Too bad the quality is &#34;Solo&#34;
B00MC6H0AI|5|Look great and are very bright.
B007WUQUU0|3|Really thing flimsy
B005992QKO|5|Not worried anymore that they won't be there when I need it...lock seem to work very well
B001VMS2ME|4|Fit like OEM, sounds OK.
B009DJOXKM|5|Perfect replacement for my broken tail light. After I installed it though I had to take it back apart to wiggle the bulbs back into the harness a few times. It worked fine after that though so make sure you check the bulbs are properly seated before you install.
B00B51VF5W|4|As I mentioned to them but never heard back. The paint was a perfect match shipping was fast and packing was great. But the black plastic sticks that I was suppose to tape to the trunk of the car to drill holes with 2 of them did not come all the way across the back of the wing, so I was only able to tape one side of which is not a good thing when you need the stick placement to be accurate to drill holes.
B002KCWWFC|2|As others shave mentioned, I have liquefied grease all mover my garage floor.  I haven't touched my grease gun it since I bought it and loaded it with RP grease in Dec 2012.  This weekend I grabbed the gun to grease ball joints and liquefied grease squirted out the bottom.  If it's true that the heat is the cause, it makes you wonder what happens to the grease after it is put into use.  I emailed the manufacture and will post their answer.
B00FBL2XSA|5|A bit hard to put on, but once its on it looks great. Makes the interior look better and has a good feel to it.
B005PZMKZI|1|Did not like the car seat covers. They didn't fit my Hyundai Accent at all. The driver side car seat cover ripped while I was putting it on. The covers were too big and I couldn't even figure out how to put the back seat cover on. I tried and it just didn't work out. Very disappointed, and now I'm going to be stuck buying me covers elsewhere.
B00ZOT9NNW|5|Great
B00DP5KQAG|2|The stickers looked great when I first put them on but after a month of use, one side faded to the point where it changed colors.<br /><br />This is the first time i have had that issue with stiffie  #s. Outside of the discoloration, everything is good with the stickers.
B001ABPKUS|5|These fit my 2013 Tahoe perfectly ! Very easy to install and remove ,no tools required.  No scratches or any damage to my paint .
B000ALDYPM|5|A+
B00B01MI76|5|Fit my 07 dodge charger 2.7 liter V6. No issues
B000KGZNS8|5|fit as expected.
B00LCFHMNU|5|This item works as well as the technical documents claim.  The unit cannot spill, and will handle moderate loads just fine.  More economical than other brands out there
B000CSGXBA|5|Just what it is supposed to be. Shipped fast. No damage.
B00J040MS2|5|Alarm is loud and when connected to 12V battery life is very impressive, lasted 1 month & 1 week on 12V 3AH battery while being activated every day & trough out the night. Battery was installed separately (it wasn't charged via scooter) if your scooter charges battery automatically you probably won't even have to charge it separately. Alarm is very sensitive even if you bump your moped/scooter slightly or try to take the cover off while it's armed, it will go off.
B000CITK8S|5|Great item. I have several. This was a gift to my dad.
B00068XCQU|5|Works well
B001IOLYBQ|5|I got this for my husband and he loves it.
B007NNGZAG|4|Fits perfect works good
B0016KABFC|5|works great
B00XS04T8S|5|I am totally satisfied and would recommend others to buy these.
B0002Z9L8K|3|Does what it says but it isn't heavy duty so if you had to put on vehicle and tow anywhere wouldn't stay but other than that it is as described and works
B006OE1AUK|5|Fit perfectly on my 2012 pilot but was not easy to install.
B00267PZUK|5|Makes the job on a Ford Expedition so much easier and is a great tool to have.
B00LFQD4W4|5|I love this product would recommend to anyone
B005JQAGSG|3|I wish it had better snaps on the corner It has already ripped on the corner where because I had to unzip it when I had to get something from underneath . the first one I had was made better and I had it for a long time I can see that this one is not going to last very long. I need to looking into getting a different skirting next time I need a new one if anyone has any Ideas please forward them to me because this one is not going to last
B0014JBYTC|5|Just what I needed to mount an RV-Q., so glad it works, much cheaper than the Vitco mount.very Happy.
B0042Z0E6E|5|Love this! Super easy to clean and love the bag it stores in. Great way to keep the porch area clean. Stays cool in hot sun. Really happy with this purchase
B00CPN0BB8|5|SERIOUSLY BEAUTIFUL!!! When light bounces off of it, it's just amazing. I've used it for so many things and have so much left over still! (I bought ithis about a year ago) my favorite is my wrapped longboard (picture connected) the carbon fiber wrap is pretty strong and is easy to clean when it gets dirty. It's easy to wrap with this stuff! I got hardly no bubbles! I recommend and have fun!
B00TJCGA90|4|Product is great. Easy to install  by myself.  Only hick up was delivery time. But after notifying the seller it was at my door few days later..
B005G8CYHS|1|The proportions were off and the star looked as though it was &#34;stretched&#34;
B0026PI4A0|4|A decent plain cover.
B00PGCD8WY|4|Fits perfectly on a 2015 Ram Crew Cab 1500!!  Good fit and feels very sturdy.  Fitment of the hardware was fine which is contrary to what others state. Key is proper orientation.  Obviously, as with any product like this there will be some fine tuning in the fitment which is designed to accommodate both product and vehicle manufacturing variation.  # 1 rule - loose fit everything and then adjust and tighten as necessary.  Shouldn't take more than an hour to an hour and a half using ratchets and metric sized sockets.  You do need to be aware that the bars can be installed in a manner that sets them into a more forward or more rearward position based on how you flip the bars from side to side.  The rearward position is the correct one - the rear bar ends should extend slightly aft of the cab/box split line.  The cons of this set is the bars are not marked or stickered to show with is Left/Right and forward/rear.  Directions provided are also a bit shoddy since they are very vague with poor images.  My previous install experience helped me so hopefully some of my images can help others in the future.  All in all its a good purchase and I would recommend it for anyone with an average mechanical aptitude and hand tools.  Beats the heck out of my experiences with Ebay sets!!!
B002V1MZTA|5|Fits perfectly
B007Y544SS|5|Fits great.  Snug in the window, don't need the visor to keep it up.  A small part of the windshield is uncovered on either side but not enough to matter.  If you on the fence about it, get it.  The version I got rolls up.
B002GRXDLI|5|Looks really good, easy to put on. Would recommend for any fan of the anime.
B00CZ4C1EM|3|it is a good product but the TSX is actually a sticker, not engraved like they made me think
B000HTQQWU|3|They are ok, but not really as nice as I expected.  They were represented to be Bully branded but actually are generic.  The finish is not as nice as I expected either.  Shipping was fast and they will serve the purpose and the price was competitive.
B00W4F1U9O|5|This light produces a great beam.  It also seems to be very well made.
B00CHSTGKI|5|Easy to install, adjust, and remove as necessary.
B003VDX5D2|5|Just As Described
B00BGH0EAC|4|Fairly easy to use
B00D5O71WS|5|Delivered  as promised.  Perfect  fit.  Best of materials. Even a Email from the manufacturer, thanking for the purchase. I am very well pleased.  Do it again in a New York minute. A 6 star rating!
B000TYQB2S|2|Maybe I read it wrong, but it didnt come with the latch.....
B005JCL29W|3|Probably best suited to the base Impreza but not better than worn shocks on a WRX or STI. My struts and shocks were shot. leaking on the pistons and elsewhere and I wanted a decent replacement set since I might be trading the car sooner than later. Packaging was good and the shocks were pretty easy to install for a first timer with air tools and a QUALITY spring compressor.<br /><br />I notice less bounce than the blown set but I wouldn't call these performance rated as these don't seem firm enough for the performance side of things. I would have gone the Koni route, but the cost and modification necessary drove me away.<br /><br />*** I would NOT try these with aftermarket springs with a higher rate than the WRX comes with.
B00FGXENSQ|4|switch works fine, but it is NOT backlit..  If the LED comes on and stays on with ignition off, you have a wire backwards...
B004UL5V40|2|Works, but has some quality and design issues.<br />First arrived, light did not work.  When second arrived, I discovered some design issues:<br />1: Button presses on too easily and is not at all protected/recessed.  I keep seeing my keys in my pocket with a glow of the light.<br />2: the thing is really a bit too large for reasonable use on a keychain<br />3: Eyelet for the keychain is small and thick, forcing you to use larger rings (making it bigger) or carve up the hole for smaller rings.
B000C9IRWW|5|Good product.
B00K8E0WAG|5|I am very happy with the Battery.
B004A6DSG8|5|just got them installed today so still didnt use them that much , BUT perfect fit , freakishly quiet and a beautiful addition to my X5 2009 3.0
B0031ZDU62|2|I bought these to fix a studdering problem with my 06 F150 5.4. It fixed the problem indicating that I had a bad factory coil. However, in less than 200 miles of operation, I have had one of the NEW ones fail. I am not t0o upset about it however. On the bright side, I was able to troubleshoot a problem that I have had for quite some time for a relatively cheap cost. Much less than if I had taken it to a shop. I will give a try with the MSD model and see how reliable they are.
B004P20FGI|4|Very nice Tonneau Cover for my Dodge Ram 1500 Eco Diesel. I really like the way it is put together and folds simply back for getting to the bed of the truck. I gave it four stars for a couple of reasons<br />PROS:<br />  Easy to fold up and away<br />  Very nice durable material<br />  Extremely good looking when folded out<br />CONS:<br />  The fit was a little hard to make sure it completely covered the bed. It took me quite a while to line it up correctly to prevent rain from getting in.  I've found the spots to lineup on, but I still have to be careful.<br />  The locking levers feel like they may break after time.<br /><br />Overall, I like the look and feel of the cover. I'm hoping that the pecking levers will last and not break.
B001AM8KAO|5|I was skeptical about purchasing these, but the reviews convinced me. Easy installation & easy to adjust air pressure. Half the time is running the air lines & valve. I would recommend running a plastic conduit to house the air lines. Needed these becasue the rear end would squat w/trailer or with weight in the bed.
B005Y149KW|5|Excellent product, very fast delivery, easy fit and style.  Would recommend highly
B004VG0N38|5|Excellent pads to use with the Meguiar's DA microfiber program.
B0093AA1CK|5|This fit my Town & country perfectly. So happy to have this.  I would recommend this.
B00H6XTKSW|5|Thanks, item is as described and works good
B002E387BU|5|Part worked perfectly. I installed it in my son's 2000 Monte Carlo SS, those cars are known for having an issue with the turn signals not flashing correctly. This part fixes that, because the flasher relay is built inside the Hazard switch. This sells at a great price compared to the auto parts store. Very pleased customer.
B004S3M0TE|4|Great fit and function
B00RJQKPR6|5|Works as described, shipped on time
B00BCRM9RM|2|Amazon said that these seat covers would fit my car (2015 Chevy Cruze) but they are way too big despite not being the right shape.
B010MUEQ48|5|Everything about this order was outstanding!
B00CC301GG|5|Fantastic product! Very high quality parts; you can tell. I ran into some problems, but their customer service took care of me very kindly and promptly. I recommend this product to anyone looking to upgrade.
B00BHT7AT2|3|Does not come with a USB cord so you can register on the Garmin website.  I couldn't tell that from the description on Amazon, but it is in the packaging.  I purchased for upcoming trip to Europe, so can't comment on how it works yet, but once I charged it, it was easy to set up and looks pretty straight forward.  I have had trouble getting a USB cord that is compatable.  Called Garmin, they advised me just to go to Walmart, but the cord that Walmart sold me as a data cord would only charge, my PC did not recognize that I had the Garmin plugged in, so I have ordered a second cord from Garmin.  if this one doesn't work I will be returning the unit because it isn't useful if I can't register it or purchase updated maps.  I think this may be somewhat intention on Garmin's part - the Garmin person I spoke to was incredulous that I hadn't purchased the 52LM (which does come with the cord).  I may have to return the unit and buy the more expensive LM in order to get a product that I can actually use more than once. I only intend on using the unit once a year in Europe so I didn't mind paying for the updates once a year, but that might not actually be an option.
B002P8IHIM|2|It shakes too much.
B008N8ILQG|5|Good strap!
B004R32TG4|5|Went on truck as it said, maybe 25 minutes, I'm not as fast as I used to be.  Made putting it on easy, I liked that.
B000R593AG|5|Best bike cover yet....hands down
B001LA1912|5|funny
B002G5DLMQ|5|I love these decals! They are very good at keeping its look. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
B007WQQGYY|5|great
B00E5OUOCQ|1|seems cheap compared to my previous shade
B009J7P45G|4|Works well.
B009LAV3Y2|5|Works well was exactly what was expected
B000JILNAY|4|This product is very  useful for theft deterrence.<br />I've used this product before and they are dependable.  Just don't lose the keys on the club.  That would give you a tremendous challenge to get that out from your wheel  handle.l
B001HM6JBO|5|Fits perfectly.
B00LQ04N2Y|1|Bad never buy this company opt7 is no good
B00877SL2M|5|Nice
B0131VS1G4|3|Fairly high quality vinyl, it went on great and it holds very well to the weather. Too bad it's not white. It's actually black, so it's very hard to see on my rear window. That's kinda my fault, but hey, I think it should be specified that it won't look like it does in the picture.
B000CPAVKW|5|Used it on the ashtray cover in my car.Works great
B00N2XD6PS|5|Cool!
B003SS62PS|3|Could move a little more air this was a disappointment.
B0012ETPUE|1|Installed mid-April 2015, burned out mid-Aug 2015.  I am super disappointed.  These were great in terms of visibility and brightness but I can t spend $100 a year on headlights that only last 4 months.
B00EGXUSKY|4|Nice quality decorative plate. Just wish it came with mounting screws.
B007Q1K6EQ|5|Perfect fit for my 2001 Silverado!
B001I7EOCE|5|I recently purchased a 2011 Honda Accord EX-L and wanted a Genuine Honda trunk liner to protect the factory carpet. I ordered this last week and it arrived today!!! Happy to report that it fits the contours of the trunk perfectly! Constructed of a nice rubberized material, it has a tall lip that runs all the way around the edge to contain spills and sand. It's also light and flexible enough so that it can be easily removed for cleaning. Item came rolled up in a clear plastic bag w/ a Honda parts sticker on it inside a large cardboard box. Very happy with this purchase.
B00HFRLXU2|5|Very nice looking faucet, works great in my camper.  Received quickly
B009FREAGO|3|Great idea, but the opening of the bag collapses too easily and turns inside out rather easily too.
B00KTJ8K54|5|Works fine on my 04 Titan.
B00E0LH8I2|2|I haven't turned these lights on, yet, but am already truly disappointed in the mounting hardware.  The little screw that comes with them to mount the bracket to the light is very small - and stripped before it even got tight.  If the lights work really well, and DON'T fall off, I'll come back and update my review.  UPDATE: I've now received four of these lights, because the bracket and mating surface that it mounts to on the body are extremely inferior for off-road use.  By off-road, I mean dirtbike riding on aggressive trails.  The lights put out spectacular light at night, and none of them has stopped emitting.  If you need a great light for a non-vibrating application, I absolutely recommend this one.  However, if you plan to mount it to a vehicle, or anything that will jar the housing, keep looking.  I've actually used JB Weld to attempt to lock a brand new light housing to the mounting bracket, plus red Locktite.  The bolt eventually strips, the thin mating surface snaps, and it wiggles or falls off.
B003UWQFKY|5|the best
B004PC5GTO|3|a little smaller than expected
B003MJAAYW|5|Great service product worked  perfectly
B001AWFP02|1|Does Not fit 2006 WR250F as Listed.. Seller Just quit responding
B004UPZXQM|5|another great product from chemical guys
B00UTV4IOO|5|well made, exactly what i was looking for! Thanks, WDBA soon!
B000HACYNY|5|Great quality. Feels very sturdy in your hand.
B001CI6TZY|5|Always  great product.
B001EOV4NS|5|Solid steel, weighs 25 lbs, good looking welds on gusset, nice paint, Anvil tough!
B0070Y363C|1|product arrived folded up and cracked at folds, piece of junk half of the lights worked, don&#34;t buy this item it is a waste of time and money.
B00SWGPT14|5|Bought for 67 Mustang;  best fitting car cover I have ever bought.
B004ZF3G7A|5|Absolutely stunning!!!11/10 very nice. Just need a little common sense to install. Also you'll need some 3m double sided automotive tape for the ballasts. These headlights are awesome I got the 12k for my 05 crown vic and they were basically plug and play other than attaching the positive wire to the battery. Otherwise I love these new headlights!!!
B0041MTABS|5|They work great. Can't beat the price
B002VISHL8|5|great price & as always fast delivery
B00IMQ4XDE|5|Awesome
B003EMEX6I|1|These covers are not custom fit and should not be sold as such. The quality of the fabric and the stitching is also poor. Not worth the money paid.
B000CMFULU|5|Outstanding Product.
B007YAEVIG|5|As described
B000GZNA0Q|5|Fast delivery.  New product as expected.  Just had to play with the wire a little as the original had solid blue, white lined blue and red.  The new one had solid black, white lined black and red.  The solid black and lined black are inverted.
B004JBOXJU|5|Fit my 2014 Sonata SE perfectly.
B002DZJQ0A|1|You can get it for FREE with E-Zpass
B00PL4HRA6|5|Excellent seat cover.
B00GOFO7L8|5|exactly as described
B000BO6PUY|5|showed up quickly and is a s described.
B000CACMMM|1|I was very excited to finally find a Waterproof Car Top Carrier and it had the well known and trusted Rain-X Brand behind it.... when I went to zip the carrier closed after loading it the zipper handle broke.  I then tried to use the second zipper handle and the same thing happened??  The carrier has such great potential and it failed completely at the zippers.  I had to use needle nose plyers to close the carrier because I was going on a planned vacation.  I would not recommend this unless they completely strengthen the zippers and their handles.
B000760FWU|5|they are great and useful for my camping trailer
B00WP2FXTE|5|as advertised
B00D568AN0|5|Fits perfect on my Dodge Nitro 2007 Model.  Very easy to install and replaces the original antenna that crumbled on me.  Great price too.  If you need a replacement antenna for your Dodge Nitro, you can't beat this product and price.
B00NPQV06O|1|Lens is crooked. After use the lens yellowed. It finally quit working after i would guess abbout 10 hours of actual use.  The cheap of brand pod has held up better, is brighter, and hasnt yellowed
B001B4ROD0|5|great price
B000CMJ2QE|4|Product functioned as described. Anti-Wheel Theft.
B0009NUG66|5|Installed on my FJ Cruiser.  Fit perfectly.  Did not run into rain so no test on the waterproofing.  the four straps worked well and I retightened them after a hundred miles.  I think the four straps would have held fine, but I also used a set of the Soft Loops Tie-down Straps (4pack) from Power Sports US and some bungee cords.
B00KLKIZIS|5|popped right into my '84 Honda and started up immediately without messing with it at all. I adjusted the idle speed a hair and has been running strong all month long.
B001CW4JO8|5|replacement bag fits good no problems
B004A6OCPY|5|Great fit and function
B00O0OPBNI|4|Supports were slightly off from original but minor modification and fit great. Will be buying another late fall to replace second leg for peace of mind
B0024E6ZRW|5|I waited too long and now my steps are broken. But!! I put a bolt threw the hole and this little sugar underneath. Works fine.
B000MYDUQK|5|This stuff is amazing, and after trying it I refuse to use anything else.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Great product! Compact and it has many uses to charge gadgets and the starter feature is so cool!! Like it a lot!
B00LN0H0O0|5|Just as described. worked perfect in the 2001 Jeep we are upgrading.
B00FLFX1QO|3|Could've ordered at store and received it faster for the same price.
B000BR3BF8|4|I installed this filter into my 2014 Tacoma with no issues.  I frequently drive through very dusty conditions so I thought it best to get a K&N because I'd be buying paper filters every other oil change.  The biggest difference I notice is the throttle response is way better than what it was with the paper filter and after driving 10K miles with it, the throttle response is still as good as it was when I installed the filter.  As far as mpg, I might get 1 or 2 mpg better on a long highway trip but I don't really see a difference when doing my normal routine.<br /><br />A con is that you have to remember to clean it.  I'll be cleaning mine every 15K (twice a year for me) due to the conditions I drive in.
B000EQ8VKQ|5|Just what I  needed for an excellent price,  thanks!
B0049E88U2|5|worked great. did have to switch the drive gear out, no problem at all.
B008AYWXIA|1|as usual,v twin doesn`t get it right,part should be zinc,or at least be given the option of chrome,and i have to alter this plain and simple part to meet specifacation  just to get the proper fit.
B000N321MO|5|Used it to check the polarity of my headlights and taillights when upgrading on my lights to LED with my 2009 Honda Pilot.  The Wilma volt tester worked as described.  At this price point and fulfilled and shipped by Amazon, you won't get a better deal based on my research.  Also you'll pay 2 to 3 times as much at your local automotive store for lesser quality.
B00TG3QCEA|1|It didn't work because had a line in the middle and I couldn't get it out !!!!
B00CDAFT6K|5|These are great little sun shades.  They work well.
B00PQZPMYI|1|Very bad quality.
B008L5J5G6|5|better than the original plastic one.. and way cheaper than local stores
B000WEOSNY|5|Awesome, easy install. No more double sided tape failure and flopping. I would recommend this product.
B00BT0KJVK|5|GREAT lights!  No heat and brilliant light.
B00VBODKQU|5|Real nice mirrors
B00AUZ2P80|5|It was a perfect fit on my Euro M635CSi from 1984. No more service interval and oil change warning lights. Even the OBC started to get the correct data (speed, range, consumption). Expensive but makes wonders.
B009VOQ05U|1|More junk under my porch.Too expensive to return due to shipping weight! I'm stuck with it.Use clamps(not included)not the hardware in the kit you will mess up your truck.
B00CXVZZHM|4|Very cute! Gave as a prize and the recipient loved it!
B00JA80PEO|4|Install and setup was easy.  Volume is pretty good when listening to music, but phone calls are nearly impossible when traveling at highway speeds as words are difficult to hear.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase because I bought this to listen to music while I'm riding, and this Bluetooth does that well.
B00CX8JJ4K|5|Bought the real GENUINE emblems from EMPIRE RACING PARTS for my 2015 civic Si sedan. They fit perfectly and look amazing. Definitely worth the price. You get what you pay for!
B00HYJFU96|2|I put it on my jetta, and it work well for a while, then the right fan came of, and two week letter the other fan came of too, it seem like the bolts were not real thight and came off, need to contact the seller to see if I have some kind of guarantee
B00IRWFQUW|5|Me and my boyfriend both love these cute key chains :) 9/10
B00XZ70V5O|5|Purchased these for my 2015 Platinum F150.  They fit really well, much easier to install than the ones I had on the previous generation.  Great thing with these is you don't have to go between the fender and the flare.  No need to take a tire off, just put the clips on, slide in place and screw the fastener into the clips.  One hole on each side won't line up well, but you can add another hole or like me, just skip it, these things are so snug when installed, they'd probably stay with no fasteners, but I put the 3 in that lined up.  Looks awesome, clean!  Price has gone up since I ordered, but still great accessory and must have.
B00CFM9QLA|4|I had another one that was similar and this one was better.
B00A93TL4E|5|Beautifully made with a slick mirror finish.
B00NXP8II0|5|Excellent
B001AJKRNA|3|Fits well; vibrates to much sometimes to the point it's unusable.
B002FVPS22|4|havent used it yet,but it looks to be fine for application.
B00480BWCI|3|These blocks worked decently well for propping up the wheels but they do not hold the weight of the jack stands especially on soft earth.
B005NB19SS|5|I like it so much I bought the mirror image for the opposite side
B00IDSIBLG|5|The lights look just like the ad and are very bright, you cant go wrong for the price.
B003VAUMWM|1|Didn't fit. They should provide better product description.
B00JOY6U7U|5|No problems even at 117 degrees in the desert sun.
B00DSO9JXE|5|Great for new passes!
B00X9IL5RW|5|Truly 1 minute installation
B00CPGQ1GO|5|Perfect
B00IPS4APU|1|It will either fill in a crack, but still noticable, or crack your winshi8eld if you have a star type crack.
B000AA4RWM|5|very useful, quality is good. I like it
B00A740VQM|5|better than expected.Very useful.
B00U2SQ2D4|1|I cleaned my rims properly these fell off while I was driving Not Good Love my money back JPD
B001PJS4LW|5|very pleased
B010H33WLS|2|The item is very good but it is the wrong size for my 2004 Toyota Sienna.  Not sure why they had it listed to fit but it does not.
B00N6DAKF8|5|New part. Performs as expected
B000COCTXA|1|Everyone has had a different view of this product and mine was horrible I just installed them on my 05 Ford Taurus and all they did was gurgle not spray but come out like a water hose all over my hood. Went to junk yard got a replacement from a Taurus and they work fine I can't stand after market crap because every time I use something after market it fails. Stick to manufactur.
B00262BBZ8|5|raised my jeep up 1&#34; in the rear. but the shocks do hold the weight very well!
B00JF5FAHO|5|I work vw and I find these useful for removing 1 bolt on the front motor mount on ccta  engines. Like how it also has a hexadecimal drive near internal 3/8 drive.
B00NLR4O10|5|My grandson loved it and it was exactly what he wanted.
B00LH3NU5G|3|For a light glove it's ok. But not for that price.
B00585FD0Y|5|too cute
B00590WYN2|5|Perfect bolt on installation on my 2014 FJ Cruiser.  It takes maybe 10 minutes per side to swap them out.<br />The best part is they cost HALF what the Trail Teams mirrors cost. These are NOT heated, but my remote mirror controls work and the lights as well.
B00D6AHVNK|2|Sunshade looks great but can not get it to stay up on the window.  Always falls down no matter what I try
B004MDEVBU|5|Hitch was exactly as described.  Key to install is making sure the bolt holes are clean.  this was installed on a 2013 Kia sorento EX.  Hitch came with good instructions and trimming the muffler heat shield was easy with pair of tin snips.  Install took a bit longer than suggested since I don't do this every day.  Also helpful if a second person is available to help lift hitch up during attachment but I was able to improvise.
B002PQQBRS|5|Delivered on time, fit perfect, looks good, works well. Fairly difficult to install because of limited space .limited space
B0077HB9SQ|4|Months later they are still strong and powerful.
B00HJEUUKU|3|OK for tail lights but, to me, not near bright enough for brake lights. Brake lights need to catch your eye even in bright sun light.
B00D2QL0DU|5|Did exactly what I needed; to occasionally pump water out of downspout drainage tubes I placed underground.  The kinks in the tubing do not matter, although if you pump to hard it pops off the pump.
B00CA5PJ5O|5|Was  ery pleased with this object not to mention  the very good price.
B00KIJ1VGA|5|Good instructions, easy install, works well.
B000UKI17Y|5|Fit and works great on my Tao Tao 250 atv.
B00KZD8JV4|5|A+
B008ZCEFFG|5|All right, very good fit
B002IZBNAQ|5|Worked exactly as planned
B000CFME2A|5|Its a spark plug. It works
B00CJUW3HW|5|Every whovian needs this!
B00K007R6U|5|I keep purchasing these so they must be good.
B000VU51C6|4|This horn would get 5 stars if it was a little louder.  The frequency seems to work better than the original horn on a Nissan Extera.
B0006IX85K|1|The male in came off as soon as I turned the water on. I'll see if the replacement is any better.
B0057Y53B0|5|A perfect fit.
B011AY32UO|5|Very respect seller and good<br />I'm interested with him
B000EH0ORI|5|Does what it does and it does it well
B001QXWBWK|3|I only had it on my car for  a week and is already coming off
B000CB7GF4|5|Fixed all my problems.
B00029KC2K|5|Great product. The adheisive is good quality and sticks great to a clean surface. Maluable so you can form it to fit into uneven spaces. I would buy agian.
B00FW1DRZC|5|Oem mats perfect fit.
B000C9MI4K|5|Item fits great and is one of the best independently tested air filter brands for both air-flow and filtration. Will purchase again
B000W0RQCI|5|Sturdy and portable! Love it!
B008G2ZLV2|3|Not bad, but not awesome.  The fit to the doors is great, but the glass is low quality (concave/convex areas of the mirrors that distort the image if you look close enough) and it is situated flush with the front of the housing, unlike the factory parts which are set back a centimeter or two inside the metal.
B00BMTZJS6|3|The box is functional although the workmanship (welding) was not as professional as I would like to see.
B00HRGUSW0|2|Received this and chrome coating was damaged.  Would have been really nice if not for that.
B00T2IC0DQ|4|Just got done installing them and they look ok not very bright as I thought they would be but they are just fine ( haven't drove it out doors yet I'm inside the shop) BTW I didn't use the relay just because it looked really cheap,extra work 2 put it on and I like my bike to flash quick so yeah I will update if they go out or what ever
B00WYCHNES|1|Tiny stickers, not worth the money. I kinda felt ripped off. But delivered timely so deserving of the one star.
B00EDQ19EI|1|Very poor quality.<br />Had to replace it after 2 months.
B00YP53KP8|2|The fog and DRL are internally wired not to work at the same time.  The fog lights and DRL have separate 12V inputs which is great.  The issue I have is that with12V to both the fog and DRL, the DRL is automatically disabled when the fog light is on.  The only way to get the DRL to come on is to shut off the fog light.  This is disappointing.
B00Y4JUMR4|2|came damaged returning to FedEx, does not fit right window returns to open position will return this item for a refund.
B007GMQG1W|5|Fits her 2012 Camry perfectly. Better than I thought it would by a good margin. Better than the silver-coated bubble-wrap universal floppy thing she was using. Overall a BIG improvement.
B00RH3AMIS|5|Well made, strong and functional.
B00J5EYT4K|3|Gets tear and wear in one month.
B00LR1NTQI|5|Awesome Tag !!!
B00UIVRQOE|5|Gave as an anniversary gift and they loved them. Nicely made.
B00D4522AY|3|I put the battery on its not working but I think it's the remote
B000C3F3CA|5|Great fit and function
B0119KLL6Q|5|Excelent product at tge right price
B0009V1WSE|5|works.
B00HOJRGPW|5|As stated.
B00YNKDTWO|5|These license plate frames are amazing. You can feel the quality of them. They don't bend they're a good quality stainless steel. The bezel is small enough to that it doesn't interfere with the tabs either. The look is super sleek and clean and I love the anti theft tabs that cover up the screws (which are included). Overall very nice looking and well made license plate frames. Note, I received this product at a discounted price for my honest and unbiased review, however if your in the market I highly recommend giving these a try.
B005HMJIIQ|5|Great product, easy installation. Looks great!
B000CR1RVM|5|brighter than the g.e. bulb
B00480KOMW|1|horrible bulbs that only last a few months
B005NLQAHS|5|Awesome! Works perfectly on my VW Mk4 Golf.
B00FP2FAI0|5|Great license plate frame, good quality. Doesn't fit my license plate exactly, but it still works,out just doesn't snap into place.
B000GOG3FG|1|Less then 3 months and there is now a loud ticking noise with an unbearable squeak. Only has a 30 day warranty. It is black and made of cheaper plastic compared to the OEM blower. Noticeably louder than the OEM when it actually worked.
B000BO8YVM|5|Big Funnel. Good Funnel. Does the job. What else to say about a funnel
B000FIY08U|5|Works great
B00KPRRC9U|5|Cool design.
B00NLP6KDW|5|Great Product !!
B00K1C1WC2|5|They are wheel chocks what else is there to say? We use them in the driveway and in the gravel area.
B00BD6SSK4|4|A little flimsy, but it looks good.
B00WW4UX4U|5|just as described worked well no complaints
B00YDLV86M|5|Worked perfect and blows cold
B0084GI90U|1|Not much difference between no antenna and Stubby. I can't get most radio stations and this is San Francisco Bay Area where there are a lot of radio stations.
B00NKOSDH0|4|Perfect color matching. cheapie kit to apply
B003XU6B0C|5|I am familiar with the Olympia products. These gloves are exactly what I wanted. Good fit and they allow your hands to &#34;breathe&#34;.
B000CFSB7C|2|Needs massive work for mount to fit hits oil cooler on 1994 Cobra. Mount is taller cannot use throws blower inlet out of alignment
B004GCE04A|5|Perfect fit,  easy to install,  good qualify,  it looks just like the original
B000CMJ62E|5|Excellent system! Awesome sound! Well worth the money. Very well made. Almost bought a cheaper system but I'm glad I didn't. Highly recommend the gibson brand.
B000PTKONY|5|just what I ordered at a very good price.
B002SZSOBM|4|I hooked them up to a battery to test them and they were definitely bright enough. My only complaint is that they seem like a fragil plastic. But they also aren't the most expensive option either so you get what you pay for. I'd reccomend them.
B00LO0M918|5|very little heat and lots of light. yes, it is a little blue-ish but I have seen worse on Christmas lights. No flickering, no big battery drain. Good stead light. We were planning to replace our fixtures in one area but with these low heat output lights, we can modify the fixture by lightly covering them to be able to make them more task lighting. Also we are replacing the bulbs that are in the storage area under the travel trailer too!
B00AC6SAZE|4|Has problems connecting to phone at times., otherwise it's a good unit, no background sound.
B000C2U7M2|5|Direct replacement great product
B00N7ZPJC4|5|On time and product fits perfectly.
B00QL0Z3QO|5|Great product. Now my car even gets better mpg than before!
B0036V1LH6|5|Exactly what I needed, perfect fit for my 2007 328i sedan
B000EQ3EC6|5|Fits. Works. What more could I ask for?
B00MQC2N3M|5|Always keep this one to the right of all others and always above the rest, its the best!
B0062FODBO|5|A bit difficult to install because of a very tight fit, but these pieces do the job well. Hopefully they last as long as what they've replaced!
B008LTJ6UM|3|worked great as a way to see my toddler but broke in half one day when I tried to adjust it.
B00W31VMYC|5|Product did not work. Seller got 5 stars for quick response to item malfunction issue.
B00BCRMBSO|4|Fits great on my car!! I have a civic and they look great on the seats! Easy to put on, no hassle. Great material. And great value.
B009AKCUCC|4|just what I wanted
B0073WEZU4|2|Installed in just a couple mins but the radio reception got extremely bad. Immediately replaced with oem antenna.
B00E5KKGF0|2|It does a good job of holding the ez-pass in place. Unfortunately it's made of very thin plastic, and easily melts and deformed when left mounted on windshield for a few days.
B000AMW0NS|5|Well made and perfect for my CAPONE license plate.
B006EGAIII|5|Great
B0031ZDU62|5|About to get rid of my explorer because of the price to replace things but good product for excellent price. So far so good
B00T6JEMCS|4|Quality product, well designed and fit for purpose
B007TKFY9Q|5|GREAT
B002RXQMF0|5|Perfect. I currently hang mine in the rear view of my car.  The colors are-bright and visable. Iv even washed the flag after some oil spilled on it and the colors and wording are perfectly intact. Will be purchasing again
B001PWA0IO|4|I read the reviews saying that it would be hard to install this but I had it done in about 10 minutes. Now, I do have the right tools to install it with so I didn't have to use the wreck that came with it.  That might have been an issue because its a cheat tool, like something that you use one time and throw away. The Tailgate jack works wonderful.  Does just what it says it does which is all I can ask from it. I gave it four stars because I want to see how it lasts because I open my tailgate everyday.
B00DD27KPK|5|Really happy to have the security of a spare tire!
B000S2U49W|4|works good
B000E28EL6|5|Nice hitch at a good price. Towed a trailer 1600 miles days after install. Worked great and installation was easy.
B004C444R0|5|good quality, nice soft leather, Large is a little tight, but being leather they will stretch and be just right.
B0090Q9D0I|5|Good product
B000GZNA1K|5|Fast delivery.  New product as expected.  Just had to play with the wire a little as the original had solid blue, white lined blue and red.  The new one had solid black, white lined black and red.  The solid black and lined black are inverted.
B002OP5E5A|5|Put these on my 2014 Triumph scrambler.. They feel great ..not so wide and spread out as the stock handlebars. But a word of warning the crossbar with the padding will sit very high on these bars, covering at least the bottom  view of the gauges. I just kept mine off and it has a nice clean look.
B0079QRRRM|4|I like it - it's a little larger outside and smaller inside than I thought it would be. It fits really well, is comfortable... Good product.
B001C96IYA|5|Worked great on my 1998 Nissan Frontier, however I didn't need the included 9 washer\gaskets.  Over a month and no oil leaks.  Recommended!
B008LOK5SO|5|It's great. Makes people think.
B000VKTULY|5|fit good
B001AMA8JU|5|I don't think you'll find a better shock at this price point.  I have these on a 1999 GMC Sonoma and they really helped stiffen up the ride without being harsh.
B00XNF7MEQ|2|The concept is a good one, but the gap filler does not hold it's place in the car.  It falls to the bottom of the seat, just like everything else.
B00842A7F4|1|Product is wrong size,would not fit in fender holes - item does not fit what it was designed for!
B004BTAJ2A|5|Nicely fit for my Honda Accord 2001.
B007Q1DQHK|5|Replaced my broken one on my 2005 Chevrolet, V8 (4.8) work truck perfectly.  Very easy, only needed to remove two bolts.  Taking off and replacing the clip with two wires was a little tricky.  The whole process took me about 15-20  minutes.  Several good UTUBE videos that show how to do it that I reviewed before doing the work.
B00BCRMBGQ|1|I would give it no starts nothing fit on my car!!! & I out specifically what I had horrible I waste of my money
B00GHT7SQ2|5|I was satisfy with the product ebay is a good place to.shop at
B0009IQZH0|5|Cheap high quality microfiber towels, I use these around the house but if you want to use them on your car make sure the car is old or you don't really care about the paint because you can spend about 50% more and get a better brand
B0090QLOM8|5|Perfect size for my use
B00US4DK1Y|5|Love it!!!!!#
B009Y06H3Q|4|Ordered this faucet when the one in my 2015 Jayco travel trailer started to leak water at the kitchen sink.  Apparently I did not 'winterize' the faucet nozzel itself causing it to crack inside the faucet nozzle assembly allowing water to leak at the joint of the faucet nozzle to the hose.  Ooops.  There were no markings at all on the Jayco faucet to indicate a brand, so when I ordered this DF model it was something of a shot in the dark as the male part of the faucet measurement in the listing was different than the faucet in my trailer.  Lacking other options, I went ahead and ordered it.  On arrival I took it out to the trailer, unscrewed the original faucet, put this DF replacement on and held my breath ... it did not leak!  So bottom line, for a replacement for the Jayco 2015 travel trailer it worked just fine and installation was as simple as unscrewing the old one and screwing the new one in place.  Finished matched exactly, and the replacement looks exactly the same as the Jayco faucet.  By the way...this winter I will also remove the faucet nozzle from the hose :)
B0017KOPPS|5|Quick and easy install, hold water bottles perfectly.
B002ZRQ4B0|3|This item said it would fit a 2013 sportage, but it didn't, however we were able to pull the actual blade off and fit it to the old wiper.
B00LSSAEF4|5|Perfect fit!
B00553SMKM|5|It works.
B00K58WO8I|5|Perfect fit!  already had to remove the drivers side floor liner to wash out the mud left from my boots.  Removed washed, dried and re installed in about two min.  SOOOOOOO glad i decided to go with these floor liners!
B00K74STWK|5|Perfectly fits 2015 Honda Accord.
B000J38SGG|5|Worked great was able to do it by myself.
B009T9O99G|5|SuperBly extraordinaire
B000C9QRCY|4|It was a good fit
B00QVLQHAO|5|Pump works very well
B00OQRH3DK|1|Terrible product. Came with no directions making it pretty much impossible to install. Waste of money.
B00NGKFD08|5|I just love my chrome door handle, they make my car looks so much better
B00BAZCBVK|1|You get what you pay for. Or you get less, which is what happened this case. Both bulbs arrived and as soon as I opened the package I knew they wouldn't work- the glass was cloudy as if the bulbs were already burnt out. Sure enough, I installed both and neither worked. HID Warehouse had good enough reviews but I won't be ordering from them again.
B007Q1F4LQ|5|This mast has a M7 X 1.0-7H female thread and I put it on an AC Delco 15829166 antenna base.  The recommended mast for that base (AC Delco 15087886) was the wrong size and did not fit. I had to return it.
B000CFS028|4|Installation was easy and product works great, really firms up the rear suspension for traveling with a load of people or gear.
B00COOTUK6|5|Excellent product. I've used many HID kits and Opt7 has been the best quality thus far! I have them in my low beams and some in my fog lights as well. Will buy again in future for my other vehicles.
B00NF1S120|5|It's on, it fits my 2006 4cyl Ford Fusion SE. It's a great piece.
B00C4B1F7U|5|This hitch was easy to install and works fine! I used it on a 2014 Rav4 Limited with no issues, currently have a heavy bike rack installed.
B000E35UV2|5|Works as intended.
B00171ZH2C|5|easy to install and looks cool!
B001C88UK6|5|GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - THANKS
B0147GT2CY|5|Superior to The Hillary and The Trump in every way. Got 'em!
B00L4TF32G|4|Not sure if this product is really worth the money only time will tell.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Great
B003CMIH2Q|5|awesome decal
B008CA7SKA|5|Product was as described 58&#34; X 28&#34; in a trapezoid shape. This fit my Lexus LS 460 perfectly. Good quality and was promptly delivered.<br />Great transaction!
B00T94V1QK|4|They do smell a bit at first. It only took a few hours or so to air out. But I took a razor blade and removed 3m tape that came on these and bought wider and stronger 3m tape from Walmart. Works alot better. Overall, great product.
B000I33YDO|5|Nice impact set
B007ZLL4NE|5|Direct fit replacement for Dodge Caliber.  No problems at all.
B000CIQL9Y|4|a good product.......too large for bike tires..........good for everything else.
B00MYCXUD6|5|Just what I wanted.
B001EP0GFO|5|This does require drilling 2 holes through the &#34;bumper&#34;.  After using the hitch to pull the ATV's I am happy with the product.  It took me about 30 min to install
B00DI3DV6G|5|good to have aboard your SUV if you want more space and organization.
B004YEJ7KC|5|Very pleased with this product
B00L4FP2Q2|5|The best. Plain and simple.
B00LMYSMLC|4|Great value
B009DJJQ1I|5|My old blower motor was worn out, and my AC was not blowing at all.  With this, my AC blows full blast now.  Quick and easy fix.
B000CNB31A|4|Alot better than the old worn out ones. I have yet to drive the truck so i cannot say if they squeek or are any better. But i think they will make a big difference.
B00UHD4HJA|4|For 5 bucks or whatever it was well worth it. Sure there are some throwaway stickers, but the majority were ok, if not downright cool. Quality varies from &#34;totally acceptable&#34; to &#34;kill it with fire&#34; (some very blatant, low-res, literal photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy image quality). All are thin vinyl, no paper.<br /><br />Came way quicker than expected as well.
B002G3OG6S|5|They  fit perfectly
B00ID1FW7O|1|It was a nightmare trying to get the right mounting hardware and now the volume button does not work well at all.  It was a bad experience.
B000GU3K7Y|5|I love it holding up very well so fare
B009WQ3K7I|5|Very robust floor liners. They fit perfectly and are very substantial.
B002UC4XP4|5|Well built item. Easy to install.
B000BWE3UU|5|Good quality accurate description
B0002KKTT0|4|IF I LOST A SCREW I WOULD HAVE RATED IT 'I HATE IT'
B009BBB6JS|4|Great product. Well made and works as advertised.
B00GXRG64I|5|WOW!!!!!! is all i can say
B00DPJ3RDA|4|All speeds work and fan is fairly quiet. I do not have a fantastic fan to compare it to. Easy install...had to move crank knob to inner hole, to line up with original lid lifter. Moves much more air at any speed compared to original bathroom fan. The noise it makes is lower in pitch than the little bathroom fan. My wife is bothered by noise, she complains about the fanless computer I built for her. I think she hears a slight coil whine lol, but she say this fan does not bother her.
B0046BWUWA|4|Great product. Made from quality 3M reflective vinyl
B007A3K7G2|2|Its not the perfect fit like it shows on the picture and doesn't come with any tips on making it easier or fit better.
B003YCEMUA|1|Cheat made products will never order this again
B001O7PNNM|5|Great stuff to polish the surface scuffs out of the clear coat of your car. I recently purchased a Vette that had some surface clear coat scuffs on it, this stuff safely removed the scuffs for me. It is an extremely fine grit polishing compound. I was very pleased with the results and I  would recommend you give it a try. - No way could this stuff remove a deep scratch.
B00CJ36DYI|5|OEM trans fluid for my BMW X5 4.8... I changed the fluid and filter on my X5 with no problem at all. Great stuff that's very hard to get locally.  Transmission shifts better then ever.
B00R98DL1G|1|its not original product<br />its Made in chaina !
B00RYXO304|3|not the best fit but it fits ok. I did not like the velcro straps.
B0010E1LYY|4|Can't really tell if it is making a difference or not, but it seemed like a good idea to change it - I have had the car for 7 years and never knew there was such a thing!
B000EARXEW|4|This works pretty well.  It's a good product and it really cleaned up my rims well.
B004I0H86C|5|All was as advertised.
B007PKDN3E|5|excellent tool, did the job with ease also used it for removing spark plug boots
B000HBI9UK|5|What you expect
B000OUUG8M|3|some washers with less material
B00B0CPPC0|1|Not even close to the right part. Will not fit 81 Honda ATC 110.
B00P2D3VT2|5|Installed in about 30 seconds.  2015 Toyota Tacoma dome light.  A huge improvement over the factory bulb, not too bright as to blind you, but a brighter and much much cleaner light.
B00PCNIPBG|3|The kit arrived and was exactly as described. The two orange straps are pretty short though and<br />were of no help attaching to the sedan we were using to transport the kayak. We used other straps<br />we already had that were plenty long. The foam pieces are a nice size and the black straps long<br />and secured the kayak decently with the additional straps we provided.
B000KQ4J1U|2|Fit nice, they were scuffed up out of the box....and the back of my head still gets wet when its raining with the window cracked .  Not worth the weather tech hype in my opinion.
B0070YZUU4|5|Great keychain, now all I need is the Vegeta one :)
B00HWI6O5I|1|This does not fit a Honda cb125
B0010Z4MDK|5|great product
B00O6ROZFE|5|Looks amazing. Very bring. Easy to install as long as you take the rear tire off
B00FRHOMNM|5|great product
B000BQWLE6|1|Very small need to read sizes more
B000PGXP5G|5|Much easier than toting the big 25 foot 50 amp around when I don't need it.
B00JJ6DN1O|5|I've put them on all sides of the house -- they are very noticeable.<br /><br />Gives me some peace of mind -- would hate to lose my house --- but we HATE to think of our furbabies being in there and not able to get out.
B00BCRMA9Y|5|I was very happy with the item
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great! Took care of both vehicles foreign n domestic...cleared codes immediately...
B007N916I6|5|Fast service! Great quality!
B00BYF8KO8|5|If you are building a NP246 you need to have one of these.  There are fancier units on the market that you can spend more money on that will not get you any better results than this simple fix.  Save your money for more meaningful modifications and just use this tried and tested wear plate.
B000CO9UZU|5|Installed on 2003 Civic Si.  Replaced stock system that was used as a depository for nuts by squirrels. Love the way the red looks.  Love the sound.  It can only help performance.  It did in my previous installation in my truck.
B0016HURK4|1|Did not fit the radio volume dial as advertised in my 2002 suburban. Wasted $10.
B000IG20RM|5|Great oil... use it with viper bore snake, after the bristle does its &#34;scrubbing&#34;, allowing it to slide through tight baŕrels
B001B5GA0C|5|Feels great, holds power, everything you need in the kit. Got for a great price, thanks.
B0009V1WRU|5|Finally!!!!! No more need for broken knuckles using a kotter pin!  Great buy!
B00ITNLD4W|1|Another piece of junk made in China.  Was ok until about the 4th use when the metal inside poked through a hole in the seam and scratched my wheel!
B00VFF0PDG|5|This decal helps warn Wastelanders that my laptop is off limits.<br /><br />Note that this is a white decal, not black as in the image.
B000BGOI92|5|Great product
B006QZ4BUS|5|Nothing but the best!  Nitrous Outlet does it again with an awesome product!
B00U3O7PCO|5|I'M WALKING TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS ARMOR!!<br />Edit update: I went down.. hard. Took a hard hit to the back and head. Back armor took all of it, and saved my bacon. A little sore, but jacket was mangled, and helmet was rendered unusable/write-off. I hit a patch of gravel at 40ish mph in a chicane and was high sided into a curb. My spine taking the hardest hit. I walked away from the crash with a fractured rib, a headache, some minor road rash, and sore joints... but freaking WALKING!!!! . I highly recommend this armor!!!! Though, I also highly recommend not riding like an noobish idiot. Lesson learned.<br /><br />An excellent upgrade for my AlpineStars T-GP Plus R Air Jacket. It's much more rigid, but still moves as much air as the stock cheap foam back pad. This upgrade is also slightly smaller than the stock foam (by one or two cm) but still fits excellent. Highly recommend this if you value your spinal chord.<br /><br />Notes: The white part is a harder plastic, and the black part is a rubbery foam. It covers 90% of my spine, with more coverage near the base of my neck. The small of you back will still be exposed, so you may need armored shorts to make up the gap.
B004SEVSCS|5|fast service and great price
B00CS56WLG|4|Works great
B00LBP43FG|5|I needed some lights that I wanted to put in the back hatch of my Jeep Cherokee, to light up the ground when you lifted it up. Looking at the space I had, I thought these would be perfect, especially w/ the thin depth as an option.<br /><br />Once I received these, they were bigger than I expected, evidently I should have taken the dimensions shown and created a cardboard template in advance. They are sturdy and well built though. Deciding that they were too big for what I wanted, I hooked them up to the battery to test the brightness so I could figure out where to put them..... this test is what blew my mind. These are SO BRIGHT. Wow. I was hitting trees all over the neighborhood to see how bright they'd be.<br /><br />Glad that I didn't just try to custom mount them then test the brightness because I'm sure with that level of brightness, I'd only need one up there anyway. Now I need to figure out where to put these because they will be extremely useful offroad.
B002NAQPEK|4|Excellent, service and price
B009PJJWYM|1|Same as everyone else. One side the rubber was destroyed within 6 months which ended up breaking the bearing as well making loud clunk noises over every little shift in the road. The other side still has one after two years in but is slowly getting louder and louder clunks (not nearly as bad as the other though). Either way, not a very good success rate. I'd recommend getting Monroe or something, they've worked out for me after I had to replace this mount with Monroe's.
B00Z515O5K|5|Looks to be good quality cables. Nice package and arrived quickly. Have not had to use them yet but I did inspect the cables and they look to be perfect for my Emergency pack in my truck. Would buy again.
B00TABVE4G|5|My 2011 Subaru 3.6R was &#34;using&#34; about a quart of oil at 2,500 miles and again at 3,500. I use Mobile 1 full synthetic. After adding my first MOA treatment I went through a quart of oil at 3,500 miles. It's been 5,112 miles since my last oil change and I'm down less than half a quart. Terrific product!
B0098B4RUQ|5|Love this product fast shipping and protects they fob really good
B004QM7OTI|5|fit was excellent & comfortable
B001B9SL50|4|Good bulbs
B00BITJZUI|5|Fit perfect,,
B000C543BK|5|PERFECT
B00EJZ7XZC|5|Love it!
B00G9WA0C6|4|Great bag.  Holds lots of stuff.  Used rain cover in a major rain storm and nothing got wet.  Well worth the money.  Would definitely buy again.
B001L9XSKI|1|Not good it has bubbles and it does not look like the one on the pictures
B004GC7A24|2|Inexpensive replacement for Ford part - not the quality of the original, but it worked.  The right plastic &#34;ear&#34; was bowed out so we had to file off some of the plastic to stop it from rubbing and it was too deformed to work with the Pop & Lock 2310 aftermarket lock.  In short, we could get it to work with the ranger tailgate, but not the Pop & Lock.  As a result, I ordered a  Diften 170-A0312-X01 (also all plastic, but molded to higher quality standards) which is a few dollars more.  The Diften handle is much better made than this one..  It installed with the Pop & Lock right out of the package.<br /><br />I've replaced several of these handles.  I'd recommend the Diften or the pricier Ford OEM for use with aftermarket locks.  Were it not for the lock, I would have probably ordered a metal handle as these plastic handles tend to break at inconvenient times.
B00E63TI32|2|Perhaps this is poisonous. I decieded to go with this bottle because it was much cheaper that the hydro flask version, the specs were the same on paper. When I received this bottle I noticed a strong metal odor when washing it in hot water for the first time. I did not notice a sharp metal odor with my Stanley water bottle I had previously.<br /><br />I tasted metal in the water when I drank it but I just kept using it thinking that it would get better. After a few weeks I stopped noticing any metal taste, but then I started having a sour stomach, I started eating antacids frequently but I did not put two and two together until I started having acid reflux at night (basically vomiting in my sleep) I was feel ill and I knew something was wrong. I drank out of the lifeline 7508 for 3 months and experienced increasingly worsening symptoms of acid/sour stomach so I stopped using the lifeline 7508 and ordered the 64 oz Hydro Flask. Within 2 days my stomach stopped hurting and I returned to normal.<br /><br />I threw the lifeline 7508 away, I believe that it was dangerous to drink from. If I had the money I would have had it tested.
B00JIEX722|4|I had these installed/replaced the current 194 type LED but not as bright as these bulbs. I really liked these bright white light unfortunately only a couple of days installed and one of the bulb started to go on and off. I thought it could be the way i installed it so i reopened the cover and made sure i had in installed correctly. Tested and worked again but the next evening, i checked and that same bulb is totally off. Checked again, reinserted and light came back on. I tried and investigate why such behavior but when i pulled the bulbs out of the socket, i almost dropped it and my fingers got burned with the LED's. The bulbs were heated up to the point that its not safe to touch. It was only less than a minute ON.<br />Called Amazon and asked for a replacement. Hopefully i get  a better pair.
B0012V11SQ|1|I tried to install these, they didn't properly fit my Ford Escape and you could see white tape between the black visor and my black window trim.  Returning them.
B00J0K1WG2|5|Fits great
B00XZ9PEL8|5|Works Perfectly 2015 Ford F350 Platinum.  Remote start, lock/unlock & start all work for me.<br />1. I programmed it myself (both remote & key).<br />2. I had ACE hardware cut the key for me for $2.00.<br />3. I had both the original keys in my possession (you must - or go to the dealer).<br />NOTE: You must have a competent key cutter do the cut - or you may not get the key to fit properly in your ignition.  Don't use someone who has little experience.  I'd recommend a locksmith.  In my case, I had a great ACE hardware store that I knew was good at it.  Also, during programming the remote - make sure you turn the ignition on and off quickly.  I tried it twice & wasn't doing it fast enough.  Third time, I did it quickly and it worked.
B00696Y74O|5|Just as described
B001FLKO3Q|5|Perfect fit 2007 Mazdaspeed3.
B00K0TA7WW|4|Used all 3 cans on 3 different vehicles and they all running  better.
B002UBLSO4|5|keeps my shoes dry for 5-6 hours
B0101U6OVW|5|As advertised
B000CSQBQM|5|Very good!
B00NQ8FCYM|5|Nice
B008CE0R40|5|These are perfect for my '67 Ford while I work on it.  I even ran over them once already and they bounced back like a champ.  Only drawback is these things stink, very badly.  I keep them stored in a trash bag.
B009S94NX4|4|Look great and work as good as factory. Crack easy but cheap enough to replace.
B00KSXW26O|5|Delivered on time, works well.. No problems yet. Make sure you get the right kind of light for your car.
B00GBQ73ZM|5|Vehicle: 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid<br /><br />Awesome. KN are the best filters for any car. Would recommend and buy again. Increased performance.
B00EE56UAG|5|I bought this helmet lock to keep casual thieves from taking my helmet. It's perfect for that. If someone wanted to break it open with heavy tools, they could, but that's not what this is designed for.
B00029WRKU|1|These mirrors do not work well with my Nidsan Frontier.  They continuously slide down while driving and are more trouble than they are worth.
B00192KZQ2|5|not much ya can say about this other than it works how its supposed to ... lol
B002LNI8GW|5|Love them.
B00D8ZFDTM|5|Fit like a glove and easy to install. Looks great....what more can you ask for?
B00TMFB8KU|5|Just as described. Very good wuality
B001NZZMCW|5|These were OEM replacements.  Installation was a breeze and they work great.
B003K5S4NW|4|its ok, I have another one that is better than this one. The one I have breaks down into two pieces and its built better than this one. However this one works ok
B00LND59PO|5|better than OEM
B00PXNC7K0|4|Has no red reflectors included like in the picture.  Tightened one bolt too much and dented the rack.  Easy to put togther.  Box was all beat up when it arrived.
B000QUXWZE|5|excelente
B007GCY1UU|5|Installed under the bed of a 2012 Tundra in 15 minutes using factory holes. No real loss of ground clearance and allows easier access to the tailgate.
B005VYOUAG|5|Easy install, great value!<br />Installed on a 2010 Ford Escape with no problems.
B00JXMMBOY|5|👍
B00U2CDJV8|5|Great product! Great Deal!
B0007UAXJQ|5|I use this on all plastics that I have to spray paint. It always helps. Without it, the paint will not bond to the plastic!
B00AYA3Q0M|4|I like these a lot.  They are a little cheap looking at first glance but the quality is there.  They fit perfectly and I would recommend them to anyone looking to upgrade their interior.  I hardly know they are there until it is time to clean the inside of my truck and there is not need to vacuum all dirt is contained in this very well fitted product.  Less than weathtech but the quality is the same.  BTW there is no strong rubber smell which is a plus.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Works great! A must have, IMO.
B004WOH4G8|5|Great product! I am using these to mount my Autohome Maggiolina roof top tent and a Foxwing awning. Excellent fit and finish! An order of magnitude better than the Yakima heavy duty bars they replaced. I'm a customer for life.
B003UM42RC|5|Awesome jackstand.  You want a quality product rated over what you really need.  This 4 ton is more than adequate and you've got complete piece of mind while you're under your vehicle doing work.  Great purchase, quick delivery.
B00N58VRYC|5|Idle problem fixed!
B0091YWA22|5|Works just as advertised!!!<br />Nothing more to say
B0073MEB6C|5|Radiator was a perfect fit in my old Eldorado. An exact replacement for the failed factory unit. It was a nightmare to extract the original, but that is the fault of the GM engineers, not this radiator. It's been in the car for over a year with no issues to date.
B0012RN3A4|5|This makes it so easy to set up the lights for your trailer. The only problem I had was with finding the connector that it attaches to on my car. It's location is behind the drivers side tail light housing. The only way to reach it on my vehicle (2000 Chevy Tracker) is through an access panel that houses the car's jack. The connector was stuck, just out of reach, under some adhesive foam that is used to cover a speaker that is mounted next to the compartment. It took a long time to find it (the foam covered it) Once I found it, it was really difficult to reach in and grab hold enough to free it from the adhesive. If my hand were 1 millimeter larger I would never have gotten it. Moral of the story is: Don't give up, the connector is in there. Take away the time spent in frustration looking for and getting hold of the connector, it only took a few minutes to install.
B000BUU5Z4|5|This has worked out great! We have not had any issues with it falling off the wall and it keeps the toothbrushes away from getting hair or anything else on them.
B005NMV2PW|5|Great value. They are as good as my ski gloves that cost 5 times as much.
B00KLELWFM|4|Good
B00VQNV8CY|4|I got this for my husband - he has a collection of keychains at work, and I thought this would be a nice gifty for our 7 year anniversary.  It's nothing to write home about, but it'd cute and thoughtful.
B000C9S9YS|5|Original equipment cabin air filter fit perfectly and was a snap to install on my 2005 Saturn Vue.  Just remove the fasteners on the RH cowl panel and remove the filter... took no more the five minutes start to finish
B005ZK48TE|5|Perfect fit in my 2015 Jeep Willys Wheeler Wrangler Unlimited!  Quality product!
B004A33JRO|5|Great Quality and Perfect fit for my 1964 Ford Fairlane 500 , 4-door sedan.<br />If you need to change tie rods I recommend to change the inner tie rods too.<br />Because its much easyer to replace and the other tie rods will be werry soon gone bad like this one.<br />I discovered that 2 other tie rods were gone bad as well after removing the wole tie rod assembly.<br />After realignment with all new tie rods ,Awesome driving and cornering experience, feels like driving a new car now !
B001LHVOVK|5|Several cars and  friends with MIL lights, works everytime.
B004P23VQO|5|Love this top! Very versatile and easy to remove sides.  I put this on in Texas while it was about 65 degrees and still had no problems with fit.  Most people recommend laying the pieces out in the sun to loosen for easier install.  I had no trouble even though it wasn't a hot day and very little sun when I performed my install.  I've left this top on for most of the year so I have not experienced how difficult it would be to remove to put the hard top back on.  Will write more when I do.
B001P4CYBI|5|I change oil for my entire family's fleet of cars.  Most of the time people have no idea when they are due if you don't have one of these fancy stickers on their window.  These make it easy to know at a glance if it's time to service again.  Great product for the do-it-yourself type like me!
B000RLPNLI|5|Exactly what I needed.
B004X2B9II|4|Good product
B0059P7N2E|4|Good quality bag, just wish they had sent installation instructions
B00OGNJFEY|5|Looks great but doesn't fit my Pontiac sunfire like I want it too.
B00JSXICNC|5|I've used Final Detail for years, and it's the best thing I've ever found to polish and protect my vehicles. I've recommended it to several people, and they are very happy. I was concerned about some of the negative reviews here concerning the difference between this product and the original. I cannot tell the difference. I used the original on my 2002 Grand Cherokee and loved how dirt and bugs easily washed off. I now have a 2012 Outback with a protective overcoat on the paint. I still use Final Detail to keep dirt and bugs from sticking, and this new version behaves the same as the original for me. I used some about a week ago, and went to the car wash tonight. All I had to do is use water to rinse the dirt and bugs off. A whopping $1.50 to clean my car. How can you beat that?
B000FA91DC|5|ok
B000A0EJD4|4|Worked in a 2005 Honda Accord EX V6.  Did not notice any fitment issues, however, there are less pleats than OEM.  Supposedly this allows more airflow and more holding capacity.
B00AZODGZM|5|Good design
B00QSNVU48|5|Great item, great price
B00T5DJBYY|4|It's a great texture material, universal it is not quite but you can certainly make it work, I am using this in my Mitsubishi Outlander that I use for Uber in and in about a month it is now showing considerable wear and light tearing. Time to try something more expensive?
B00BTLEIIY|4|The seats look great and really make my car look sleek.  The reason this is a 4 star review is because the material is fairly cheap.  I was tightening one of the straps, and it just broke off.  Other than that, I'll be keeping this.
B00IPQP8Y4|5|Really helps support back while driving!<br />Have purchased 2<br />1 fora friends for they love it!!
B00JHLN2RG|5|Put this on my 2015 Toyota Tundra Platinum Edition. It is LOUD! Really loud. It has a nice deep rumble, and I haven't noticed any CIS sounds. Install took about 1.5 hours using a lift. There was a small exhaust leak that needed some attention, but overall it was pretty straight forward. I haven't noticed any low end loss. Probably the loudest out of the box exhaust on the market, but not in an annoying way. My wife approved it and she hates loud jackass trucks and motorcycles.
B00BYCO9XW|3|Soft aluminum can strip, &#34;anodized finish&#34; chips/scratches with first installation. Have gone through 4 because of 2 being slightly over-torqued and the other 2 catching a small burr on the stud and having the threads ground to nothing.
B00993O4YC|3|Looks good, but won't work with the locking mechanism which was recommended with it(?) Taking my chances in style!
B0007LZI8G|5|Excellent price for a hitch ball cover; better than an old tennis ball.
B00PXD3N2G|1|This thing fried as soon as I put it on my scooter.
B013B49RPA|5|very good product, the setting is as expected for my 2014 Jetta MK6, excellent treatment
9539751047|5|installed today on front bumper!
B00VNBDVOC|5|I got these for my pickup and they are very bright. These are much nicer than hids, because they instantly turn on and off without having to warm up. I've had them for half a year now and I haven't had any problems with them. They work great in projector lights, which are my low beams, but they are still bright in my high beams.
B00EAOIRDO|5|Stock C6 Corvette filter. Does filter stuff.
B00159Q0OU|5|Works great
B008JYXYNY|3|They worked very well for a couple of weeks, then they lost their tight grip.
B00SXUXXT4|5|A perfect replacement for my 2007 S60R.  It looks and fits just like the official Volvo part I removed.
B000BLNTQU|5|What can I say?  I plugged them in and they worked.  They are much brighter than the 916 (I think that's the number) they replaced.
B001CF1A6U|5|Nice
B005UZTV8M|1|Junk.. Flag gets seperated from the base to easily,
B0019COQ6C|4|Only problem is getting the rod pulled back to insert new grease twice snapped back and mashed a knuckle.
B00G2KIC34|5|Had to line up the pins a little. Worked fine.
B004ME11FS|5|Arrived on time works as stated
B00MQ5Z5F2|1|Second one is defected also !  Could you send me another one that has been tested?
B000KL4G3Q|5|Worked great, wires labeled so just hooked up to the new radio plug and bam done. Thanks
B00HM3OEIM|5|I love this tail lights, makes my frs more aggressive and unique because of the blinking turn signals, easy installation, great quality, been using it for 7 months and no leak noted.
B00FFAZF28|5|great product
B000C2QM1M|1|Part came late.Sent it back.
B012BER23K|5|loved it!
B00FK7AUYE|2|Not sure what kind of swirls this is supposed to fill, but it didn't do much for my very light swirls, neither did it enhance the gloss noticeably. From now on I am just claying, polishing, then JetSeal (now that's a great Chemical Guys product!)
B009FOG6XM|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B0002JN2EU|5|Added a can to the oil in my 2005 5.7L Hemi Ram, ran the truck a few miles, drained oil and replaced with Royal Purple, and it stopped the ticking sound in the engine. The truck has over 100k miles and runs like it did brand new. I have found this cheaper at  Walmart than online (almost half the cost).
B000GZP4MS|5|good all around tire,, more than a 50 / 50 more like a 70/30<br />wear seems to be good to,, have 1500km on it,, no sign of wearing,,<br />KLR 650
B00NOA1STA|5|I have a fairly large SUV and this sunscreen covers the entire windshield. I do need to keep the end sections folded, but that doesn't take away from using it. The visors need to be used to keep the sunscreen in place, and it is well worth it.
B00D329B8Y|4|I live in the New England area and my old car mats were really dirty from all the snow over the years. I was looking for mats that would fit better so that the salt and dirt doesn't transfer to the car carpets. These mats are very sturdy and fit my Lexus 350 perfectly. There are no gaps and they are very easy to clean. These mats are heavy so they don't shift once placed. They had a very strong rubbery smell initially but it went away in a few days.
B001IGEJA2|3|The bungee cord works well, The carabiners however do not.  The spring in the carabiner broke on first use, Switched it out with one I had and all is well.
B000BZAERI|5|No problems replacing the original one in my 03 Cavalier with 160k miles.
B007WGEFHO|3|Mirrors installed and working out okay. However, one will not stay put. I am constantly having to correct it back in place as I am riding.
B001IH2T4E|5|Looks good and strong
B00LKVB86S|1|To small for Camry .
B009LOO1DS|4|I would buy again
B000C9KG8K|5|Good product.
B00F7NEREU|5|Somehow this thing works! I do notice a pleasant difference. After a long commute to work (2hrs) my back does not feel soggy, in fact it feels like I had a short session of massage.<br /><br />I like this product very much.
B007Y63FPA|5|all the parts fit perfectly
B000BZJ9Q0|5|Worked perfect on my '96 Blazer.
B0002SRGXY|5|PERFECT
B003JXU0JQ|1|This Is Junk Do Not Buy!
B00NQNJNE2|5|Quick service, good product
B0002Z9R4S|5|These are great wipers and worth every penny of cost!
B003JBJVFM|5|A little disappointing in how it had to be mounted but love it otherwise.
B00DU924X4|5|Did as described but having a noise issue
B00T9Y5XBO|5|Nice
B00HCROOR4|5|Fits perfectly, great value!  My new go to for lifts.
B008RMXLWM|1|2 of the bulbs had defect which make them flicker, very annoying. Probably made in china.
B001V8U12M|4|It fits, It works.  What more can you say?
B00092893E|5|looks good
B00DP5L0J2|5|Excellent quality and packaging.  I was impressed with the results
B0040CYWX0|5|Got these for my 03 Silverado 2500HD when I was replacing the fenders wells. They matched the OEM ones and fit nicely.
B0042L41J4|5|Love them! Quick shipping!
B008I7R5EG|5|It took me a long time to find the mirror I needed for my truck as I have the auto dimming function but it turns out it is only the Drivers side that dims. These mirrors are great and I haven't had any issue with them issues with them at all in the time I have owned them.
B00JNEAQIA|5|Great product, high quality, great price.  Had a dimensional problem fitting my vehicle, so they were returned for a no-hassle refund.
B00MMUS81O|2|Small light. Turn signal can't be seen  stop light not bright
B000H4LT3Q|5|Very nice. My recommendation is buy 2 sets for even lighting on both sides of your bike. Great price
B00YYU6N2Q|3|its a magnet......
B00LU2KUMK|5|Exactly as advertised.
B003177JMG|5|plug and play easy to use
B00IMUES4O|5|Fit like it was supposed to and arrived in good condition
B00IOU1BPQ|5|I've had k&ns on every vehicle and even my yfz450.  First actual CAI KIT. Super easy install, took 35 min max.  Just don't torque plastic nuts too hard.  Great sound in new 2015 GMC Sierra.  Going on trip in 4 days will update with mileage changed if I can keep my foot out of it.  Update- got  close to 23mpg on Highway.  Around 16-17 city.  Normal driving.  So all in all maybe a little better highway, but it's hard to drive like a pussy.... Stock exhaust so maybe aftermarket might help out.
B008G1ZDUW|5|Working and are great
B005OY87ZW|5|Really easy to apply
B0050ANIK4|5|guud
B000OR18BE|4|Great product just as described.

B0050E3SK0|5|NOW THAT'S A REMBRANDT TO A MECHANIC ,  BEAUTY AND BRAWN MIXED TOGETHER A HIGH QUALITY PIECE THAT FITS , AND FUNCTIONS.  AS  ADVERTISED
B002SRVX9U|4|As described
B009OQ3YOK|5|beautiful on nose of car - doesn't rust
B008SV10VQ|4|I have nto used them yet but the point is not as fine as I had hoped.
B00OPMIR2M|5|Great purchase!
B001V8U12M|5|Hey, if you have an rv you absolutely have to get one of these. Put it on a cheap cordless drill and you are set!
B00K72C1T4|5|Nice charger.
B004LFCFSK|5|only bad thing about this hose is that it does not compress like all the others
B001S8F2V0|5|Worked great on my 2008 GMC yukon
B005LLL5IO|5|I love these wipers. They are the best and longest lasting I have had.
B0010GG7YG|5|Worked great on my 07 new body style perfect fit
B0002YTJDI|5|Perfect match for an old Ford 542 baler.
B00MVQPPFQ|5|Bright light, well built and really tuff.
B000PEPCGI|3|good product
B002VE3VHW|5|Super fit and perfct protection.
B00JURCVCY|4|Would be 5 stars if you didn't have to remove the clips (which I assume are used in the Korean version).
B00LU5GQ52|5|I purchased the red version of these goggles and I like them so much that I ordered a black one. Quality is very good and they work great. Very comfortable and fit well. Fog does not form. Once again with Fox products I did not go wrong
B006H6L4SI|5|The carpet looks good n good here in just a few days
B00LO20530|5|great product
B00PBKFRV6|5|Love it!
B000P17NXQ|4|Works well, mounting was a challenge since it requires being screwed together from both sides and I didn't have enough clearance on the interior side to put where I wanted it, so I had to move it out to a less convenient, but secured, location.  The device itself is excellent, easy to use and, well, it's a Tekonsha! Just wish the bracket was easier to use in tight spaces.
B00CPL8PSG|1|Waste of money, didn't do anything significant enough to talk about it. I guess you get the same effect using Gas with Techtron protection already inside. I tried it on my 2001 Honda Civic but haven't noticed either better gas mileage nor better overall performance or noise so I say keep your money!
B002DPTQX2|4|it works ok
B001D27444|5|Fit like OEM!!! no issues
B000COXGTQ|5|It has always been a great product! makes the car shine!
B00U3DJ5NM|5|large Alien flashing the LLAP sign!  I love it!!
B005GFCOXU|5|Fantastic part! Quick shipping and fit on my bike perfectly. Seems pretty strong too for how lightweight a part it is. They even threw in a free key chain!
B0116MIP70|4|I bought these headlights to replace the factory ones on my 07 Tacoma which had become pretty cloudy over the years. I wanted the original style because the stock headlights threw a very good and even beam of light even without them being projectors. These lights look pretty cool on my tan Tacoma and the install was relatively easy. I did have a couple issues however, one of which was the fact that I broke part of the clip on the passenger side headlight garnish (beneath the headlight) while removing it. I managed to fix it with loctite before reinstalling it. The other issue being a gap between the headlight and the grille on the drivers side. That was because I forgot to transfer clips from the old assemblies to the new ones, but even then I had to really work to put the grille back in place. That might the aftermarket grille I have.<br /><br />The light that these produce is good, but not as good as the stock ones, not good for me because I do a lot of late night/early morning driving. No matter how you adjust the beams(they adjust just like stock) there is a sizable gap of light immediately on either side of the truck. There is a good bit of room for animals to sneak out on the road, not good for where I live. However, the gap is almost all filled in when I turn my fog lights on, which I can deal with.<br /><br />I sealed the headlights with a permatex brand silicone automotive sealant when I got them due to the unevenness of the factory sealant. So far they haven't leaked at all through several storms and a automatic car wash today.<br /><br />The clarity of the lens is good<br />The projection of light is decent<br />The pattern of light is tolerable with fog lights<br />Adjustment is good<br /><br />I probably wouldn't buy them again, but for the price I believe they are a good buy. I may post pictures in the future
B0066T9NLQ|5|Solidly built, looks like it stands the pressures of time and the V70R's tendency to crash over bumps!
B00KTIYXLU|5|Worked perfectly no complaints!
B001LHVOVK|3|It doesnt find all the problems.
B0006N63VG|5|Worked perfect. quick shipping was welcomed. Looks strong & will for years.
B00BG922UA|5|Awesome looking especially with my Raptor grille. Though instructions would have been nice, they did end up being plug and play.
B00D1YP8FE|4|They are easy to install and give a good amount of light
B00HJAMBI8|3|Like the slim wiring but the heads stuck out to much.
B004U9B8O4|3|Thought I was buying a bike lock. This thing is ridiculously huge and heavy. Super heavy duty. Would make sense if my bike cost me hundreds of dollars, but for the casual bike rider, this is overkill.
B001G9KC5C|5|Good price and turnaround. The detail mist is easy to apply and buff out. Love it!
B00IEB0AAW|5|Outstanding Product. Put them on my dad's commander 1000.
B005K66QZ2|2|The mirror will not stay adjusted, keeps falling like the pivot is loose but not able to tighten
B00CPYFOW8|5|Came with supplemental screws. Operates as described. Perfect for DIY fixes
B00WY8CR0M|5|I like it! I wish it were bigger but oh well....... Love my bison!
B00HSFAR80|5|Much thicker/stiffer than the OEM filter.  Easy to install after watching online videos.
B0013OFIJA|3|Very thin I figured being plastic it would be a little thick but just another crappy plastic license plate. This would be good for a kids big wheel or something similar.
B00GBFWSKI|2|It's a white background, not transparent, and the quality of the black seems to be low. It isn't solid black, it has light and dark spots that make it possible to see where the printer passed over each time. The lines on the ink are also not very strong, instead seeming to be slightly blurry up close.
B00K5OHZFY|5|This is a great little tool to add to the tool box. It done everything I needed it to do. I personally can't stand check engine light, this little box took care of it.
B00VW0BAVU|5|It definitely doesn't get as good of reception as the stock antenna, but you can't ding the product rating for that. Nothing this short could possibly match the 3-foot stock antenna. That's not how radio waves work. That said - it gets good enough reception for me here in Denver. I spend so little time listening to radio that I don't care. I'd rather have the shorter profile any day.
B00JD1SK7C|5|Love it! Very nice.
B000TCCWS2|5|just what I expected & got.  thank you.
B00A8MZ7EY|5|Received quickly and works as advertised
B0095TC6I6|5|Best towing mirrors ever.
B001F0MO8A|5|Nice product....
B003BQLZ36|3|As expected
B00BD4YFO4|4|fit was good but useing the little little hooks to sucure it almost impoissble
B00CPSXPUW|5|Absolutely adorable. This decal is my personality in a nutshell.
B00K889FCI|5|work as a magic product. turn my light back to live
B00230JTTS|5|It's a filter. Does not come with replacement o ring. Used on my 2009 klx250sf.
B0067PUMXW|5|I added these to my Bike and My helmet. The hands are a little small but big enough to not return. They look very nice.
B005JU5YCU|5|Perfect
B0016IL0GS|5|I got the wrong part. I will try to sell it on my own.
B0033YECEK|3|This is priced just right. It works but if you pressed the lock button and the unlock buttons in row they unlock by themselves. I wished the buttons were recessed because when they are in my pocket, they get pressed easy. I installed them on my 1986 F350 4 door. But overall it works just fine and worth the money.
B00YY7M4AO|4|Easy to use
B00ZQXSSQY|5|these are really nice. work great for adding switches
B0012INT98|4|roomy and easy to use. The straps used when going through the car should be designed better, hard to get tighten and the left over straps get in the way of driving.
B0006BFR2O|5|Works like a charm, cleaned off boot marks on muffler of bike and made them look new again.
B002JR949K|5|Use these daily, I'm photosensitive.  Great
B000X2533Y|4|Done its job like it was a professional.
B009XFDYNS|5|The item was as described and shipping was fast. When IO received he battery I took it out of the box and placed in my Honda ATV. I proceeded to crank the ATV up and it did with no issues.
B00AWN6DYM|5|Loved them
B00DMEFI7Q|5|Reasonably priced. Look fresh and perky. Good fit.
B00I5FCYHE|5|all was good
B000CN4XWQ|4|I've used the adjustable ones in the past and they seem to last about a year.  I went with this one instead.  It works.  I hope it lasts for a few years.
B008JEF4LO|4|Fit well, even on skinny youth arms. Straps work well. Adequate padding.
B00WOY33EA|5|I own an automotive repair shop and many customers have balked at the price of repairing their back doors because of the cost of parts from Ford as they normally cost over $200. The ends are very easy to install and it is permanent repair not just a patch. Since I have found these I have called several customers that declined repairs and they are very willing to repair their vehicles now because of the significantly lower bill. I will keep several sets in stock for now on.
B0074FQKDA|5|Slim fit for tight locations, and seal-proof. Sleek design not bulky.
B000EBMLIY|3|By extra, they don't last long...
B00J9Y23SU|5|bought these for my son's truck, they fit perfect. He loves them
B00KWETZS2|5|Exact replacement for 2014 Mazda 6. Fits perfectly and performs as expected.
B008K6I1RU|5|Was as advertised.  Had great reviews and all were accurate.
B00FJIT9BO|5|Easy to apply deep dark color to old plastic trim and more.
B00PQWCG6S|4|I use these for paintballing. I do not feel them while running. They seem like it is made from good material. They do not smell yet. Good Velcro; it creates a very strong hold. They look very sleek and intimidating. However, they do move up and down my leg a little as during paintball I am constantly moving, running, kneeling, etc.
B004GE0W7C|5|Great
B0081SBSRC|5|the sm6000 worked perfect
B002DMZA2G|4|This pump is a good buy, but you have to accept that it is slower than the more expensive pumps.  That said, it works great if you are willing to give it a little time.  For most automotive applications, it is more than adequate.
B00LHUI4XM|5|Great quality and easy to install. Fits our Fodge Durango nicely!
B005VNVERE|5|fit great, had it on in 20 minutes,money well spent
B00OGN87DY|5|Fit well and went right in
B00159Q0E0|5|Great Deal. Love It.
B003YCINNM|1|washed one time and they all freyed and are already falling apart. I would like to mail back. I threw away box so what do you sugjest?
B00GU8YZ1Q|5|This part snapped right into place with very little effort. It looks great
B00J5KYSTA|4|good
B0000AXMDP|4|Very easy to use works Awesome
B004VGAJOG|5|cheap and best
B00B7LVSHK|5|Super fast shipping and great prices!
B001LHVOVK|5|Item worked as described! Easy plug and diagnos! The book is extremely helpful with understanding what the codes mean.
B00P0B3G2I|5|Good, tight fit. Looks like it was installed at the factory.
B001DYUKWK|5|Amazing simply to install. . . .The principle of downward pressure as needed works perfectly.  Reasonable price.  I ordered white.  some marina sent black Smart Tabs.  I used them because I didn't want to wait!
B00EJPYMKG|1|I purchased this battery back in April 2015 I had to jump it twice it lets me down every time I go for ride the only time I can depend on it is when I have it on trickle charge it's the end of the summer and it still does not hold its charge.
B0002Z9R5W|5|These are great wipers and worth every penny of cost!
B00CO1XJP6|4|Good product<br />quite larger than the original shifter. Dont know what that other small screw is for though. Overall it does what its suppost to. Would recomend
B010UXWVZS|5|Love it, thanks!
B00NGOT5NK|5|Great product, easy to install, and from a courteous supplier, who shipped fast!
B00DGRQKA8|5|Excellent braking power great kit
B007LIBQ3O|5|fits well
B000P17NXQ|5|This product is great. If you order the plug and play wiring harness with it the install takes less than 15 minutes. Everything should be made like this.
B007GBFUI8|5|Great airflow. feels strong and sturdy and not to heavy.
B00RJN6J5Q|5|MUST HAVE TWO MORE. CHRISTMAS IS NEAR. WORKS WELL AND IN HANDY.
B0002SQYF0|5|Good buy on a quality brand name commodity item. It's always worthwhile to buy in bulk if you use this kind of item frequently.
B00G2U0LHY|5|Very bright!
B00JMZG2JC|2|Didn't work on my 2004 Nissan Titan out of the box. Male end on truck has 1/4-20 threads. This part has female M6 x 1 threads. I hand tapped 1/4-20 threads into this part. Works now. Signal strength seems good.
B000FN2W3U|5|This is a must have for adjusting the tensioner bearing. It is a professional quality tool
B00LGKHIGM|5|Working as described
B0001CMUV4|5|Used it for the 1st time and had to go through some construction with an empty trailer behind and didn't hear the entire time...awesome! Highly recommended for silencing that noisy hitch assembly.
B000CB42EM|4|all was good
B007WR25KW|4|Worked well
B008E32NJ6|2|Still my car computer give Chek engine after changing 8 coils.????I'm not sure maybe they not efficient
B000CQFPYI|4|I have not installed these but the quality looks good.
B005BNG1U4|5|nice, bit thin but nice
B005B0SC0O|5|I bought these for my 2008 Mini Cooper Convertible and I love it!! Looks so great with the car :)
B00D1CQVIY|5|Used this to wire up my LED bar on top of my Subaru. More than enough wiring for what I needed it for and all top quality wires. Would recommend.
B000NTNASW|5|A BETTER QUALITY AND FIT THEN THE OEM ORIGINAL
B000WK4EC8|5|This product is great for removing grease.  I just sprayed this on my lawn mower and sprayed it off with the hose.  Cleans very well
B00MBURW6M|5|very good product
B00LHB08C6|5|LOOKING CUTE.
B0049E4VJO|5|Used this to install exterior door handles on a 1992 Mustang.  Worked great, caused no scratches to the door. Love the catch-bottle!
B00HPTLO0O|5|perfect
B0106QM9UG|1|Cheaply made, not as described!
B004CID21U|5|good
B000KIVPME|5|Awesome creeper, and I was shopping on a budget.  It might not be the cheapest but it isn't the most expensive and this this is comfortable.  The yellow shows how dirty I get and the texture of the plastic allows grime to get in to it and makes it hard to clean up really well but hey, it looks like I have been working harder than I really have.  It rolls around fairly well and the tires are a bit soft so it seems to handle the little things that might make a regular creeper stop or skid.  I have been on about 10 different styles/brands of creepers in the last 10 years and I can honestly say this is probably the most comfortable and easy to use out of all of them.
B00391FOSK|5|Cant beat the price... Its not an easy job on the acadia to replace but if your a little mechanicaly incline can be done and will save you $$$
B00C0CI4AE|5|Good quality
B002XLHUQG|5|Work great for our travel trailer and easy to use
B000BZIFV0|5|Pretty easy to install in my 2003 Honda Civic EX, and performs just fine, no difference from the previous filter whatsoever and very normal/standard vehicle operation since.  Would highly recommend, especially at the price you can find these at here on Amazon.
B000CCZ5ME|1|Did not fit my 2001 Silverado as it stated it would.
B002KS4V5A|5|Works great
B00J527ZUC|1|Can't really recommend this product, unfortunately.  I watched their YouTube video, and followed the instructions exactly. I am not a car painter....I understand that. But the paint didn't apply evenly and did not have a consistent color (black with tiny blue sparkles) that I needed. It came out somewhat flat, rough feeling and looks like the sun faded it kind of.<br />The clear coat didn't seem to help much. I admit I may not be the ideal person to attempt to fix a bumper cover that got scuffed. But ScratchWizard insist anyone can do this and save hundreds by doing it themselves. Well, I can tell you it isn't as easy as they claim. Not happy at all. Went to 2 body shops, and both laughed and said aerosol spray paint is a joke for automobiles.
B00K72C1T4|1|Terrible quality. Unit feels cheaply made. Purchased 2 of these at the same time and one of them stopped working within the first week. Finally got around to returning it only to find out I was one day late on the return policy. Will correct/adjust this review if seller decides to make good on the defective unit. Until then I cannot recommend these for reliable usage.  Update: After a little over one month, the second charger I purchased has also stopped working. Absolute Junk!
B00MWIOW2K|5|Great comfortable spring,  fall and summer gloves. Durable hey soft.  Small pocket on the back of them I like to put my bike key in. Awesome
B00V5005P4|5|Got them 2 days after ordering, wired them up and they work great. I use them as headlights, other drivers don't like that! Lol. But I can see any sign from a good mile away. Lights up the trees above me when I go under them. They work great!
B004I9KGJY|5|Perfect!!!!
B005FNKSMW|4|Bought it plugged it in and worked just fine.
B005JZOKO8|5|Looks great and has a quality o-ring seal on the inside.
B0115Q1BPU|3|Had my license plate stolen. Bought this as they took the frame and screws too. The caps are inset to the base , which sits on top of the frame. Personally don't care too much how it looks as long as a thief selects another vehicle. That said it wasn't too much of a mess filing the police report, changing my tag info in a few registered places, and getting a new tag. Hope that thief gets what they deserve. Also, this plate comes with screws. Nothing to really keep a thief from yanking on the bottom and prying the whole thing off my truck, as the screws go into a plastic part of the bumper.  That happens, I'll buy this again, but install panhead bolts, use large washers, thread-lock, a castle-nut, cotter pin, and a jamnut on top of that. Good luck getting that off!  ---  Update, bought two more. Got one for her Camry, and I had sold my truck for a Sequoia. Both of those have machine-thread bolts, so I had to reuse those. Hers went on just as expected. Mine went on and the little caps that cover the screws (the whole point) - just went in with no resistance. Grabbed some duct tape and they came right out with no resistance as well. Pointless there. So, grabbed some caulk I had handy, and filled the cap with caulk and stuck it on there again. Seems to sit on there now. Would have returned, but thought maybe if I smack the cap with a hammer it might expand a bit and fit tight. Nope. Meh. 66% success rate observed with this &#34;system&#34;.
B00GMRM3KA|5|Awesome 7&#34; LED headlight that's made in the USA, quality built and looks to be a solid performer thus far, the closes headlight I can compare it to, is the HD Daymaker at double the price, you will need HD wiring harness part # 69200897 for $20 at your HD parts or here on Amazon to make this headlight work on a 2015 Street Glide, the harness eliminates the H9/H11 bulb plugs and converts to H4 connect to make this bulb work on your HD, it does have low/high beam, if your running the OEM halogen bulbs give this a try, I promise you will love it!
B0019C17H8|5|Fit my 98 Civic DX perfect. Now I look like a bad mofo when driving down the road. The rest of my car is kinda dulled over time, but I'm pretty sure this makes it look at least 6 months newer.
B00FSC427W|5|I don't know what for :)
B0091Q3NCG|5|it worked........a great price........a good basic unit
B00378K6LU|5|Good product
B00K5TWTZK|5|It fit perfectly.
B00D7HN0LE|1|Harness was supposed to be for a ZL1 Camaro. But is for a regular camaro because they only ha 1 set of DRL's.  ZL1's have DRL's and a set of fog lights on the front bumper. I installed it today and only my DRL'S would come on with my Halo's. My fog light wouldn't even come on with harness installed. So I took harness  off and fogs lights and DRL would come on like they do from the factory. The reason I ordered this part is for all 3 to come on at the same time. This product was not listed correctly. Don't buy if your buying for a ZL1 Camaro. Very mad.
B00NIV7OB6|3|The paint matched perfectly.  you really have to follow directions. Be prepared and have plenty of 900-1000-1500 grit sandpaper. you will have to apply the paint in layers then be ready to sand and wet sand paint to smoothness. Gotta follow directions and take your time. I didn't and ended up doing it twice. The only issue I had was with the clear coat. It was just a little &#34;chalky? &#34;  colored and wanted to orange peel. But in the end it all worked out ok and I saved my $ 500 deductible. Gotta take your time and if your are masking don't use cheap masking tape get painters tape and mask by  making a soft line ...the product will then work...I would have gone to a better star rating but I wasn't as pleased with the clear coat as I was the colored paint.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Fits great on 2015 Prius and super easy to install.
B0052FRY3E|5|Just like the original good buy  good product
B000CRBRV2|5|Always  great product.
B00D21JIWK|5|We installed these on our 1984 Catalina 36 sailboat to freshen things up. They work and look great!
B000Q6SG4A|5|Excellent quality
B008XNZZ7O|4|Works as expected. Eliminated most of the odors.
B0071N6WDI|5|worked great!
B00W8U8T1W|5|just as described worked well no complaints
B009AP37XI|5|gives a little more noise, easy clean horse power gain is probably little if any, but i bought it more for te reuseablitlity.  NOTE: this fits only non-turbo models it seems this filter does not fit a 2012 mini Countryman S ( turbo model) , maybe it fits the non-turbo, but amazon does not have a way to differenciate the 2. I suggest looking up the part number on AFE's website, before ordering on amazon, ( amazon has better price) and ignore the car selection tool .
B000BUU5XQ|4|Nice set, colorful and easy to see (don't want to forget these at the campsite). Time will tell how well they hold up.
B00AFVF0XG|5|not a problem
B002DU3TTO|5|A+
B003YK69NA|5|Having used the same set of Sparco Torino's for almost ten years in two different cars, one of them was getting pretty beat up and I had to replace them. I wanted something with red and the style of these seats caught my eye, as did the price. While I haven't recently, I've tracked my car before (350z) so I know what I wanted out of a seat, but I still mostly daily drive so it needed to be diverse in its capability.<br /><br />The seats were shipped in big Sparco boxes, if you were like me you saw them and got giddy like a kid on Christmas. I read several of the reviews prior to buying these and I had concerns about how they were shipped, but both my seats arrived 100% perfect. The handles on the sides of the chair now have Styrofoam covers so they don't break (common complaint). Seats we're well wrapped up in plastic, so there was no visible marks or damage on either of them (ordered a pair).<br /><br />Install is reasonably simple, well it was for me anyway. I already had the mounting hardware in my car from the previous Sparcos I was replacing. If you didn't buy those, you're going to have to because its not likely these seats will fit your OEM equipment.<br /><br />Initial impressions of the seat were the fabric was nice, seats were well stitched, and seemed to be a good overall value for the price. I will say there are some big differences between my previous Torino's and these R100's. For one, the R100's are bigger. I'm 5'7 and about 155 lbs, so about average size for my height. While I don't really slide around in the R100s, there is a bit more wiggle room than in my previous Torino's, particularly in the legs. Speaking up, the hip bolster is much less going from the Torino's to the R100. The big difference for me was the side bolsters, which do a pretty good job of keeping me in place. The seats themselves are much taller and sit higher than my previous Torino's, which was an odd sensation at first while driving. Going from the Torino's to the R100's, I'd say they site 1.5-2.5&#34; higher than the Torino's. I don't like that, so if I decide to keep these sets, I will likely look for other options to mount them on that helps them sit lower. I do enjoy driving them and love how they look in the car though, longest trips I've done is about 90 minutes one way and I had no strain or fatigue. They aren't the comfiest seats I've sat in (I feel my Torino's had better padding) but they also don't feel like sitting on wood planks either.<br /><br />Overall, I think they are a great seat for the price. I think they are designed for someone a bit taller and heftier than me (again, around 5'7&#34; and 155 lbs). The look, fit, and finish is great for the price and I think anyone looking to just spruce up their car a bit or get a more sportier seat should consider it, but my suggestion is to find a local Sparco retailer, if possible, and sit in it first to see if you measure up.
B0049MKQD6|5|It works as intended. Connect with wire nuts so you can bring it inside over the winter. This is my 3rd one in 12 years so I guess I must like it.
B00AWDKB2W|4|Very effective on long flights. I may even use it at the office ;-)
B000P70R1U|2|The one I received doesn't seem to work.
B000UNKGKG|3|Hard to putt on in mud
B00GSAUHB8|4|Good, solid product.  Easy to install.
B004XRXWLA|4|Satisfied!
B0030DIURE|5|strong arm is a great company and so is lift depot that sold these to me
B00LAYO628|5|The switches work very well and look great,would not have a problem ordering again. Quick shipping
B00B2AFPRA|5|I got these after my 2007 Jeep JK's rear driver's side shock mount broke.  I bought a new set of shocks for the rear because the shock was dragging in the road and got some serious road rash.  These installed with no issues my mechanic said and it looks like the rear is a little higher so with the upgraded shocks for my Skyjacker lift kit I may get getting the full advantage of the lift kit.  This setup is a lot better than the factory shock mount.  I would recommend these to all my Jeep buddies.
B00KHUQAY8|4|Great quality but it smells awful.
B00TG8C8PW|5|Perfect...
B005NLQAHS|1|The blue-tooth connection is taking to long and sometimes it's not even connected.
B00PHW8F9E|4|stick well don't leak!
B000MUVCXM|5|I use this on my Cub Cadet M48 as a cheaper alternative to the factory brand.  They work the same and are significantly cheaper.
B00514BU6I|4|Works very well.  Has PLENTY of cabling, which is a plus.  Significantly more than I needed.  But you can cut cable; stretching it or soldering on new cable is a bit more complicated.  Happy to have more.<br /><br />My beefs, if any, with this are that the Relays are not replaceable.  Instead of a relay socket, this is a relay with the wiring soldered and sealed in.  This means if one of these relays fails, the entire harness will need to be replaced.  That's a bummer.  But I'm not anticipating a failure.<br /><br />Along with the 5-to-4 converter (which is plug-n-play with this unit) from Kuryakyn, I have a great trailer wiring setup for the long haul!
B0042Z0E6E|5|Love the mat.  Feels good on bare feet.  Just hose it off to clean, and it dries fast.  Great product.
B00EF3YOZ0|3|Looks great, install went easy. Ive noticed that my bug problem (I live out near a swamp) went almost away.  But, as others have stated.. it changed the air flow around the Jeep too much. Increased noise (even with hard top). And, when I take off a freedom panel it makes odd changes of pressure so I have to open the windows to equalize.  I take it off during long freeway trips because I feel its actually causing drag, and as a result could be lowering the already 'great' MPG in the jeep.<br /><br />I would love to see a wind tunnel test on this to see what happens.  If I had the tech means Id attach a smoke bomb to the front of the jeep and drive down the road with someone recording it.
B00F6DAK92|5|great lights
B000OO2Q86|5|Good price, works perfectly.
B00NID5MDG|5|I have been looking for a good VAG com tool for a while without busting my budget.  This is it.  I can reset oil and service lights with no issues
B000MD4YKM|4|it works, quality look and feel<br /><br />one of the cheaper ones ive found, but i wonder how it compares to the harbor freight one. shortly after buying this one harbor freight had theirs on sale for about 7-8 dollars cheaper. my dad has one and it works as well<br /><br />but if i spent $20 and it lasts 10 years or more you cant expect much more than that
B00J52R3AE|5|works good
B00VB4TDZC|5|On time and exact fit.
B003CIQDNA|5|easy to put on
B00J7RB72M|5|What I expected.
B002X6VXL4|5|This all in one device is amazing, i have used the air to fill my tires when i dont want to go to the gas station.. i have recharged a few peoples batteries who needed a jump .. its a great buy well worth the money it will help you when your stranded!!!
B00KYDAILE|5|Outstanding Product and very bright.
B006YVTL04|5|Arrived on time and of good quality
B000GKAZFE|5|Painted good
B006WBLMOO|5|Just what the Doctor ordered Ha Ha great works well ........
B00B9IVRCW|5|works like a charm.  easy to install and  easy to use.  I have it on my my 32' koala travel trailer and it works great. mine also didnt have the issue with the ground not being connected like a few others have stated.  worked right out of the box for me :-)
B00DVE0KRU|5|Just as listed, fits and operates as should.
B00NRDHTVA|5|Can't go wrong with this purchase. Especially w/ this hot hot summer we've had.
B00AQAQI6E|5|They came in as expected and are bright.  They come in as two five-part break-away form.  You separate them individually by carefully breaking at the score line.
B003CKFP5K|5|Good buy, saved a trip to Auto stores
B003YJNY9I|5|This works better than I thought.  It is great.
B001C9E4LY|5|here is how to install<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8j7KCWhbzs
B003RXU4DU|4|They went on fairly easily, just had to tug and adjust so that the cushion & backrest sections &#34;matched up&#34;.  They look very nice in my 1961 Studebaker Lark!
B009WD84MM|5|Fits my 2014 Kawasaki Vulcan 900 Classic LT perfectly. Very easy to install, took about 10 minutes to do.
B000C9QH3S|3|Raybestos 505-1243 Professional  looks exactly as ACDelco 45D2243 Professional. The boot seems to be removable. Overall good quality.  Reason for 3 stars because Raybestos 505-1243 Professional  is about $10 cheaper.
B00R1LTARK|5|these switches work great
B00COYNTNK|5|Love this!
B000BRJOVI|4|thin ?  ?
B000CB6D0S|5|Great filter, went with the charcoal filter from recommendations on here. 30 seconds to install and half the price for the same item else where.
B000NCOKZQ|4|Needed a new one. I love the Tender. Now my bike batteries last a long time.
B001EWQ0ZC|1|Didnt fit
B000ZMI596|5|Just arrived and just looks great!
B004RCUPP2|5|Work out great
B00D8TWSTQ|1|Putting this on your car would seem like your are for Hillary because for Prison is so small you can barely read it.  I was disappointed in this purchase.
B00BGZ1VJC|5|I just saved 200 bucks from Toyota. Who cares about lint!
B008XNZZ7O|3|Meh. Wears off really quickly, doesn't really help much with odor neutralization. this was a real disappointment for me, all around. The odor it uses to mask other smells is not unpleasant, so it has that much going for it.
B00RV417XM|5|These are the best switchbacks I have used... Very bright in every way... I like how they are white then when you use the blinker it blinks straight orange then the wight comes back on... Will buy then for all my rides from now on!!!
B00E3YIYQ6|5|Loved up to its advertisement. Saved a lot of maney and would definitely use this supplier again.
B00DM9S8NM|1|its made in chaina , they did not mention that in amazon!!
B004RNOVTM|5|perfect size
B0040CTU82|5|just as described worked well no complaints
B004A30UHG|5|Easy to install and works great.
B0054RG6B6|5|This will work on the 2015 wrx/ 2015 forester xt but you have to use the large bolts and put them thpugh the gaps in the pulley. Wont damage anything and works great
B0002TDUW4|5|I was skeptical ordering this to put on my brand new 2015 F150 to say the least. I started the process on Friday night with the enclosed sanding pad and also purchased a packet of sandpaper after reading the other reviews. I probably spent about two to three hours sanding to make sure I didn't miss any spots, see picture below. I continued the project on Saturday morning with a little touch up sanding and wiping down everything with the recommended thinner.  I put the first coat on and was amazed how well it covered for the first coat, see second picture. I still had about 2/3 of the gallon left and thought I had way too much for this project. I let it dry for about three hours and started the second coat, this went on quite a bit thicker than the first.  It gave the thickness and texture I was hoping for in a bed liner. It's really a pretty amazing product. It's been in for about 24 hours so I haven't tested it's durability yet but I have walked on it and really like the skid resistance.  I can say that so far I am very pleased with my decision so far. I hope to report back with positive results a year or two into the future.
B00XK4PTOK|5|fits perfectly on my 2007 kia sorento
B00FF1K7BQ|2|Does not smell like new car at all. It has a bad chemically smell. I wish I had returned it
B008NA5DLU|5|very please !!!
B004FSEJZA|5|This cleaner is amazing.  Bug guts and finger prints are no match.  Plastic helmet shields and windshields looks better than new after I use this stuff on them.
B000TYTSPK|4|WORKS AS IT SHOULD.
B000CCZ5M4|1|Did not fit my 2001 Silverado as it stated it would.
B0128D4I7W|5|I ordered this item because so often we drop our phone in to the middle part only to dig to find it again later.  I saw this and knew it filled a need we desperately had.  It is small enough to not be in the way but big enough to toss your phone keep pens and other misc. items handy if you need them.  It is very sturdy. The pockets have very sturdy stitching and the netted pocket has the netting very well applied.  It easily attached to the side of our seat and stayed very well. I was very impressed with this item for storage in our car and for the quality overall. I highly recommend.  I honestly haven't seen something like this available anywhere else and this price is very reasonable for the quality of the product.<br /><br />I did receive a discount in exchange for an honest review.  However, this not affect my reviews. I order things that I need or am already in the market for.  I before accepting any discount for an item I do research it as well as other similar items for pricing and reviews.
B00GHPAC1O|5|Hose is soft but overall great product
B0091DGUK6|5|Easy installation looks great
B00NLQOW3G|5|Lightweight relatively quiet and flows great air when in 3/4 to upright riding position
B011VNB75Q|5|This is to help my mother get in and out of her car.  I bought a second Handybar for my truck for anyone that would have difficulty getting into my truck.
B000C2SC24|5|all good
B0010GK3SM|5|Fit my hummer 3 perfect!
B00AM3EJUW|5|I backed into my moms car with my boyfriends moms car and broke her headlight so I had to get a new one. I live in a rural part of Utah so it's hard to get to a place to get a new one. Napa wanted $130.00  for it so THANK GOD AND AMAZON for making this way easier for me.  and yes the Headlight was a perfect fit for her car, now to find someone to put it on for us. Thank you
B00FDQPCR2|5|Surprisingly bright and very easy to install.  I like that the solar panel and light can be mounted some distance apart, this allows you to place the light somewhere that doesn't get much sun like under a patio, and still have the panel mounted somewhere else so it can charge.  Will probably get a couple more of these to use around outbuildings where I'm too lazy to run wires for real lights.
B00068YAPW|5|These floor mats are a perfect fit for my 2003 Subaru Baja.
B004UIUIGO|4|lights work great
B00366GYFU|1|it is not a really brand!!!!!!  I am very very ungry with this cause i want to buy it for a gift.f**k!!!!!!!!
B000EQ7A9O|3|WARNING:  The clutch received was not the Hayden brand as advertised, the box showed it as a Murray, and there were no distinguishable markings on the actual fan clutch.  I could have purchased a Murray clutch from the local automotive store the same day for a couple dollars cheaper, so I was disappointed.  I was looking for a Hayden, as this was the brand recommended by my mechanic.  However, I went ahead and had the Murray clutch I received installed, as I could not go without my vehicle for 4 more days, or however long it would have taken to get the correct clutch shipped.  The clutch is performing as intended with no issues so far (a few weeks).
B00LAF3LZ0|5|Great look and fit on my 05 f150
B000JZSPBM|4|Works...
B00F7S77G0|1|Stickers for the logos?!?!  Wtf. This s#it sucks!!
B000GZPGYE|4|these work really well but ALL require a custom made bracket or mounting arrangement.
B0039XSROG|4|The are ok
B0006HLEQQ|5|Excellent quality.  I bought this to use on a 2005 Subaru Impreza and the pipe measured 1.9&#34; but this 2&#34; clamp had enough leeway that I could have been tightened on an even slightly smaller size than the 1.9&#34; if needed.  My best guess it that this would tighten adequately down to 1-11/16&#34; but not any smaller than that.  It might not tighten enough to be used on 1-3/4&#34; pipe.  Overall this is a great clamp and I like that it is stainless steel and the bolts are grade 8 (the bolts are not stainless).
B00H8DM3G6|5|great prduct
B00NHBYOA6|4|My husband loved it but unfortunately, in these hot summer days, (90's) it just didn't cut it.  We use it mostly for food travel from the grocery store and it wasn't cold enough to withstand a long time between the grocery and home.  I'm sure it would be amazing in less severe weather.
B000PGVZ30|5|Great plug, great price. The blades are individually removable too.
B008EG66BO|5|High Quality<br />Works Great<br />No Problems<br />Fit Perfectly
B0058KYUWQ|5|Got exactly what I wanted, part was delivered BEFORE out was expected! Very pleased with my order
B000LQ78YY|5|as described would purchase again.
B007RHX1YG|5|Not much else to say; it's a genuine BMW part at the best price I could find.  It arrived, I popped it in and now my car won't roll away or put undo stress on my transmission.
B008ET2Y7Q|5|Fit my 2015 jeep wrangler.  Works great.
B00D1CQVIY|5|Outstanding Product works well on my Polaris rzr.
B0028CBQWY|4|looking good
B00XK4NA8M|5|Love them
B00HJEXEF8|3|Not really all that bright, when compeared to modern LED brake lights
B00STXAXJ8|4|The rear seat mats are a little smaller than they should but all others worked well.
B00X04JRMU|5|I'm not a car fanatic by any means but a mother with 2 young children who does not have much time to clean the car on a frequent basis.  This kit has everything I need to give my car a quick wipe down to restore its paint to a shine.  I have a red car and I take really good care of my car.  I've used this waterless car wash kit twice since I've received it.  It came super fast and well packaged.  The 4 microfiber towels are soft and absorbent.  The solution is slick and easy to spray.  The instruction that came with the kit was easy to understand as well.  My car (a SUV) is garaged except when I park it at work but there were bugs and road tar because of my long commute.  The instruction said to dampen the cloth and wipe it first before spraying the waterless solution and use the soft microfiber cloth to dry.  The whole process took me about 1 hour (from front to back, top to bottom).  My car is shiny and water beads off nicely in the rain.  I only used about 1/3 of the solution in the spray bottle each time I clean the car.  With winter coming, I will use this product more after each snow storm to help keep my car's paint clean.  Beats having to hose my car down in the bitter cold winter!!!  I highly recommend this product.
B005FKMOWM|5|Fits perfectly a 2003 Honda Accord EX (4 cyl). Smoother breaking, improved performance both at low and high speeds (as compared to the cheap rotors and break pads installed by the dealer).
B00Q0C8G4Y|4|Looks great have yet to take on the trails but seems to be solid, only concern is the clamps holding it to the roll bar. How long they will last.
B0009IK6SE|3|This kit was recommended to go along with the Dorman Winshield washer hose, and the Dorman washer nozzle kit, but the two hoses provided are too small in diameter
B00BXLO3H6|1|Very pretty, but the top button fell out the same day I purchased it. Lost of course and now I am unable to use the ring for more than a holder for my keys. Can't attach it to anything.
B000NMDFNY|5|Got rid of a bad scuff (scuff that didn't go down tot he paint) in a few minutes.  Great product!  Thank you!
B000AP6RFM|5|Excellent price !!!
B004BCLBJM|5|Bulbs Work great.
B001447VB2|5|Seriously shines and cleans your metals.  Best metal polish I've ever seen!
B00F5IG15K|5|excellent
B000RXNLK6|5|Bought a new 2015 Ford Mustang with ruby red clear coat. Between washes and for smudge touch ups, this product makes the car glow in the sun. Not an all the time substitute for a good wax but it will definitely keep you longer between waxes and leave a gleaming shine to boot. In fact, I didn't believe the shine was going to be that good. Follow the instructions and you'll be thrilled with the results.
B0009IQXFO|4|works well
B00FX3SVL4|5|Bought this for an older Honda Valkyrie (still spiffing); first, for the ability to charge my cell phone; and second, as a way to connect a battery tender/charger. I ended up replacing the fuse in the [12V Fused Replacement Cigarette Lighter Plug with Leads] with a strand of electrical wire because even set to 2W the fuse would blow. But that's not this Outlet Socket's fault and, anyway, it works perfectly now. Since then, also purchased a small compressor/ flat tire solution, whose use is much simpler with the Outlet Socket vs digging down to the battery for hookup. It's compact, functional, and water tight. And that's just what I was looking for.
B00C6MVPH2|5|satisfied
B002P8EMGI|4|Gray plastic caps, with an interior red gasket. Basically, they cover the valve stem from dirt & grime. The valve pin in the tire/wheel stem should seal it properly, and not rely on a cap.<br />Sealed bag of 50 caps (although I didn't count). Medium length -- if the cap is too long/tall or the stem is short, the cap will not seat on stem top - - these should seat on most stems.<br />Would have preferred short metal caps, but they retail for $1/each and inevitably get lost or stolen.  A bag of 50 of these should last a lifetime.<br />Made in China.
B00B5FLRQA|5|Wonderful gift for new drivers, a well as old!!!!
B00COYNZJ8|3|It's great and really funny but mine arrived damaged so I'm definitely not thrilled by that.
B00IJ7Y2DW|5|Great lights for the price.
B004ZF43Y0|5|Got the kit on very good time. Took no more then 15-20 minutes to do the install from start to finish. Color was bang on what I wanted. Night driving is much nicer now and after I aimed them, haven't been flashed once. Great buy, will be doing my fog lights and high beams too in the near future.
B005VUQC7Y|5|Arrived very quickly and was an exact match to our other door handles.  Installation was very smooth.
B003YMCPNQ|1|I was really sad to write this review, however this battery left my stranded.  I received this battery from Amazon, and was really excited to use it for my upcoming ride.  I put the battery on a trickle charger for most of the night, and when the morning came it was ready to go.  I then put the battery in my motorcycle and took of on an amazing ride.  However, I had to use the bathroom in the worse way.  The Mexican food that I had consumed the prior night was producing a brown trout, which was not good.  After I released the brown trout, my motorcycle wouldn't start.  I was stranded 2 hours away from my home.  Luckily I had some help me push start my motorcycle.  After $200.00 later (i thought it was my starter on my motorcycle), they came and told me it was the damn battery.  DONT BUY THIS BATTERY.
B000CICYZ4|5|It was an exact fit for a 2001 Wrangler Sport.  Came with a full metal throw out bearing too.
B00KB47G9I|3|air compressor works for now..but gauge way off calibration and very slow to move. Holds a charge for now..we will see how this holds up..I will give a follow up review in the future.
B00B3UYBQU|5|Can't speak to the high temp rating yet, but it looks good.
B00GMT1G38|5|We love the design and comfort of these seat covers. They were easy to place on and they look great in our 1977 retro looking motor home. 😀
B00BOFETFC|5|Once you figure  out how they come out go in pretty easily. They are much brighter than the factory ones the truck came with.
B005BTNFVQ|1|Not flexible at all. Tears really easily if you just apply some sidway force when you're applying it to your surface. Also really lousy durability.
B007ZDDUCK|3|Worked as expected, brought purse back to life. Although for something you use daily this doesn't seem to &#34;protect&#34; as much as I would have thought it would.
B005BHCEOW|5|First  trip with bag,went to Glacier and got caught in storm with wind and snow everything inside was dry and bag stayed in place.
B00081UX08|5|When I received this hitch the box was in tatters however I could not find one scratch and all the hardware was there. That was my first surprise. Then I installed it in about thirty minutes using the advise from a previous review on Amazon and use two five gallon buckets to hold it in place while I installed the bolt. Second surprise. The third was the great and clear instructions that accompanied the product which is sorely missing from of products now days. Great purchase and product.
B0016KG77S|3|Not as reflective as old school reflectors, but you get what you pay for, I suppose.
B000C9H44O|2|Wrong parts, vehicle match said it was correct, returned.
B00NPIUFMM|5|very nice and very bright
B008YGLJI4|5|Item as described - NIB. Would buy from again. Thx!
