B00G32QIEG|1|It was just alright. I like some of the comedy but the characters just didn't spark that hdry umor or comical laughter that was expected in the movie.
B000P0J024|5|In my opinion, this is one of the greatest bands of all time, just good people and a unique style.

B000K7VHQ4|5|One could call it a period film, perhaps a gothic romance, and old-fashioned, and all these would be compliments for The Illusionist, which gives the idea of \\"great film storytelling\\" meaning. Director Neil Burger makes The Illusionist more than just a story though, taking on an artistic quality that transcends typical filmmaking. Brilliant atmosphere, authentic characters, a great script, beautiful scenery, and a wonderful music score make this one a gem.<br /><br />One of the film's interesting aspects is just the allegorical quality that emerges. It's much more than a thriller, mystery, or period film about love and magic. Eisenheim's crushed hopes of love in childhood are given a second chance, and this plays into the theme of rekindling lost love, giving the film a parable-like quality.  Illusion-- the subject of what is real and what is not--is a central idea in not only the story's premise, but the film's d&eacute;nouement at the finish. For this reason, you can't take everything at \\"face value\\" - supernatural and mystery play a major role in the building of Eisenheim as a character.<br /><br />The characterization and script are superb, and this really keeps the plot's flow at a steady pace. Edward Norton brings the character of Eisenheim to life, giving a mysterious yet charismatic aspect to the role. He makes this idea of creating illusion an art form on the big screen, as he dazzles many in the audience with his shows. It is later on in life when, while doing a show, he meets up with childhood friend and sweetheart Sophie, who is now engaged to the Crown Prince, a villainous man who reportedly abuses his lovers. This meeting sets into motion the conflict between Eisenheim and the Crown Prince, archrivals for Sophie's love. Another important role is that of the Inspector, who is both suspicious and in awe of Eisenheim's illusionary feats, but must ultimately answer to the Crown Prince. While the Crown Prince wants Eisenheim shut down for blasphemy and heresy, the Inspector has no real proof to charge him with.<br /><br />Mythical elements, a great music score, and clever imagination make this feel like we are transported to Vienna circa 1900 to watch the story unfold. There is magic and illusion, and the suspense builds after Eisenheim's shows take on a much darker feel, in which he can reach into the \\"other world\\" to find out information about lost loved ones.<br /><br />Over all, there is a great job of filmmaking and storytelling here. There is definitely an art-like quality to The Illusionist, and there is more than meets the eye!s no real proof to charge him with.

B00SNVHGJQ|4|This cd has alot of beautiful songs but only two songs that rock. Just alittle too much of ballads for one album.
B00000IL67|4|If you saw \\"Welcome to My Nightmare\\" in concert and you remember buy \\"School's Out\\" when it was a new release then you might want to rethink buying this collection. A lot of the song that made Alice Cooper the Alice Cooper we know and love are missing. Even a few of the ol standards are missing. Where's Hallowed Be My Name,\\" \\"Second Coming,\\" \\"Halo of Flies,\\" \\"Luney Tune,\\" \\"My Stars,\\" \\"Cold Turk,\\" \\"Black Widow,\\" \\"Nurse Rozetta\\" \\" and \\"Sick Things\\" just to name a few?<br />For a lot of those with a closet full of vinyl we look at them and say man those would be nice on CD or MP3 so we learn how to transfer them and realize through real eyes that it will take forever get finished before we die. So the bright idea of buying a box set pops into our aging minds. Only to find out that the box set is missing much of what made that group the group there are. That you've been short changed and the real body of the work is just not there.<br />Well anyway, if you are an ol school fan then buy the ablum titles as opposed to the box set, if you are new fan this will be a nice introduction to the world of Cooper. But be advised you are missing a lot of classic work with this collection, to truely understand most of the song and the work you need to hear the entire album. Take \\"Welcome to My Nightmare,\\" and \\"From the Inside\\" they are story albums you just can't pull one chapter out and say you've read the book. It doesn't work. Even \\"Under My Wheels\\" is not the original release is a much later remake.<br />So if you remember when the old stuff was new, buy the old stuff on CD and don't expect to get your fill on this BOX SET it is missing far to many song. If you are the passing listener, the fly-by-fan then this might work for you. It's a nice collection just missing far to many classics and obscure gems. I was going to add a list but it's far to long.<br />I'm giving it 4 stars because it does have a lot of great songs on it, but I'm holding one back because it's missing a lot of others. I'd really give it 3 1/2 if I could. This collection really should have been an 5 or 6 disc, you just can't do justice to 35 years worth of work in 4 disc, in my opinion. Buy it if you must, but I'd rather have the individual title from '65-'80, pretty much most stuff after that is hit and miss at best. As for me I'm getting full disc from he early days, just to much missing here. I good collection that could have been better, the quality is good and selection is nice for those just starting out on Alice, ol schoolers might feel shorted.ally give it 3 1/2 if I could.

B004SBS8LA|5|Best Angry Birds yet, very \\"3D\\" feel to it, a nice evolution to the experience with the game.  The 1-star reviews are people that either don't know how to work their phone or are feeling entitled, like the Amazon Appstore is a god-given right, regardless of the fact this is exclusive to North America for now.  Give it a rest.
B00005JPCD|5|Despite the ending where it gets very, very political, I loved. Heck, I even loved the ending and all of it's political environmentalist \\"subtleness.\\"<br /><br />(A Few spoilers lay ahead, but won't make much sense unless you see it)<br /><br />It was a cute story, lovable, and great. I also loved the social statements that WERE subtle within the Penguin colony (the singing is viewed as a religion). And it cracked me up when they fought so hard to keep singing and only singing as the sole pillar of the social structure, and dropped it like a lead weight when they realized dancing would save them.<br /><br />It doesn't necessarily show men as PURELY evil. I mean, for goodness sakes, why would they put in the trackers as comical relief if they were EVIL?<br /><br />The seal made me laugh, even if it was all \\"evil,\\" looking. In any penguin animated movie, all of the seals will look evil and scary. Why? Because that's how they're viewed to penguins. I'm PRETTY sure less seals will be killed because of this movie than the sting rays that have been slaughtered because of the death Steve Irwin, bless his heart (and I must mention, this movie was also made in DEDICATION to him). And I'm sure there will be some baby seal movie that will be made eventually to counteract this \\"evil\\" look. Wolves get this tagged on them ALL the time in animated movies, and then they made Balto.<br /><br />Anyways, enough rambling, it was a great movie. I HIGHLY recommend it. Don't be put off by ANY of the negative reviews you see here; my entire family went to see it; my parents who are 50+ enjoyed it immensely, my brother and his wife (mid/late 20s) enjoyed it, and my other brother and I enjoyed it (teens/early 20s).<br /><br />Political and social undertones need to be taken lightly, they may detract a little and seem random, and to me the ending was a little cheap, but overall, it was a great movie.

B00FVVR2ZO|3|I really enjoy the characters and the graphics are real cool. But eventually you'll need to start spending too much money to continue play. Wish it was really a &quot;Free&quot; game.

B00CO4GO7I|5|Outstanding read!  Touching memorials for a Great American!
B00000IOSU|5|I cant believe, that most people here in Europe dont even know Sarah. She is great and this CD  is excellent. I was searching for more than 1 year for this CD. And at the end I went back to the States and got it there  - this was before I got my Internet.... All I can say: GET YOURSELF THIS CD
B003XF1XOQ|4|...but it kind of bogged down in the middle. I did like her final choices, and the epilogue. But, the middle just didn't move as fast as the first two books in the series. Thus, four stars.
B005HE5J7I|4|Excellent story . It really is a history book told through the eyes of the people living it at the time. I have been to London a number of times and have always enjoyed the walks through its history. This book gives the city a life of its own and weaves its story through the centuries.
B002PNDEXK|5|Enjoyed every minute, I have seen this movie before and would gladly watch it again and again. The characters are well played
B000000H4V|5|Clerity! , This cd stands outdo to the fact that Max has cleaned up his vocals and the band has cleaned up their over all sound. They still have thier death metal edge(even though there is less double bass)and have added  a tribal sound to thier music, They still have the thick and heavey sound  but the music is more understandible.
B00BAWEGPW|4|This book is pretty good.It has almost the right combo of the exciting-keep-you-at-the-edge-of-your-seat element and the really-funny element. It's a bit too short,though.
B007ZRZF8I|5|great app. gameplay is simple but fast enough to entertain for hours highly recommend it definitely a dollar well spent
B000002GLV|5|I remember first listening to this album about 35 years ago and loving it then. I recently purchased it and have found it every bit as good as my memory. A terrific collection of musicians with the guitar play of Freddie Robinson outstanding.
B006Y5EDRG|5|Very enjoyable.
B00AQIZRLS|1|too boring for my little granddaughters.  deleted it off my kindle.  bummer, they are 5 years old and like more of a challenge.  this may be best for 3 year olds.
B008Y6RGFE|4|cute movie
B00BGZ8OLA|5|Points congruency with the mind stretching novel combine with a stunningly realistic rendering of this improbable situation.  I was only disappointed by the pandering logical character mapping in the at the conclusion of the climax.  This destroyed sone of the power and majesty of imagination so carefully cultivated through the novel.  Great purchase experience on Amazon, smooth playback on Wii.
B00006690F|5|Excellent cd.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Loved this book. Hard to put down. Would recommend to all my friends. Can't wait to read more by this author.
B00O0MBHR4|1|For better or worst, Aretha will be forever known as the woman who transformed Otis Redding's #2 R&B self-penned \\"Respect\\" into a signature #1 song. Throughout her entire career, she has always tackled her own versions of contemporary classics to varying degrees of success.  Here she is directed to recreate an entire album of well known classics by some of the greatest female singers and their songs of all time. The title within itself spells a yellow caution sign.  The use of contemporary producers from Andre 3000 (Outkast), Babyface to Harvey Mason adds an interesting element except anything that these producers have achieved is hard to hear here. The most imaginative factor on this by the numbers covers album is the employ of mashups from \\"I'm Every Woman\\" mashed with \\"Respect\\", the tired \\"I Will Survive\\" with Destiny's Child's \\"Survivor\\" to \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" mashed with Diana's version of \\"Ain'tNo Mountain High Enough\\". This is a great idea with varying results.  When Whitney tackled \\"I'm Every Woman\\" she truly honored the original Chaka Khan version and made it her own. There is not one of these covers and mash-ups that reach such levels of musical ecstasy.  Sonically, she sings most songs in a chesty soprano that sounds like a friend of mine who would sing a long to her songs in an atrocious style that was excruciating, it was actually kind of funny. Aretha sounds like a drag queen lip syncing these songs whose microphone mistakenly is turned on. It's not pretty.  Just because she has the machine of a major label again behind her, this mess of an album has done better commercially than her last studio album (supposedly took 5 years to find a distributor) and now the overwrought heritage artists Christmas album. It already has earned her first #1 R&B album in 32 years. But the actual numbers tell a little different story. Diana's similarly themed \\"ILoveYou\\" sold essentially the same first week's units in 2007 but only ranked #16 R&B and #32 pop.  She did agreat boost for the album by giving a rousing performance of \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" on Letterman, only upstaged by a despondent Cissy Houston looking like she is understandably still mourning.  Aretha already covered The Supremes classic, \\"You Keep Me Hanging On\\", so why another version. The inclusion of the oh so tired \\"I Will Survive\\" already condemns this to today's version of cutout bins which is probably slashed Mp3 album prices.  Davis should have resisted posting samples early because the negative reviews came pouring in except from the diehard Aretha fans. Davis has repeated this covers concept with Manilow, Santana, Rod Stewart and Harry Connick Jr., with only the first 2 Manilow cover albums exceeding commercial expectations.  Great artists like Diana Ross, Patti Labelle and Aretha should have lifetime recording contracts for whenever they are moved to record. That is not the case as the new jack label heads weren't even able to garner a single platinum album so far in 2014. Sure heritage artists may be passed their commercial prime or relegated to covers albums, duet albums and/or Christmas albums which these 3 ladies have all been directed to do. Only Diana Ross rose above the norm with two beautiful Christmas albums, \\"Christmas in Vienna\\" and \\"A Very Special Season\\" that were well received internationally though didn't get the same reaction here. Touring is where these ladies seem to still be vibrant. Why not a sizzling live album instead of massacring \\"Nothing Compares to U\\" or \\"Last Dance\\".

B00I2TW0UO|5|The second installment of Hunger Games, it's once again time for the reaping. In hopes of squashing Catniss' growing popularity with the districts, the president is once again sending Catniss and Peta to battle against one another. Of course, this time around each competitor knows who the true enemy is. Loved this movie. It's action-packed and heartbreaking.
B009RI4FRU|1|Man, did I get taken on this one.  This is absolutely one of the dumbest movies I've ever seen.  I am glad to know now to avoid all &#34;Wes Anderson&#34; movies.
B0064X7FVE|5|Every week I wait to see what new videos have been posted.  I always enjoy browsing through.  Keep up the good work and I will continue to be a regular at the Weather Channel.
B00E8S2JZ4|4|I really like the extended editions when it comes to Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit.  Trying to identify this missing scenes makes watching it more enjoyable.  The only knock I have to this is that it doesn't come with a digital copy.  I would have paid a little more to get a copy of the extended edition 3D and with a digital copy.
B00992CF6W|5|This is the best game in the world I really recommend this game  and if  like the game try it on pc or Mac!
B0081KZ20E|5|The movie of same name (original one, not the one with Bruce Willis) is pretty good too. Now onto the French Connection!
B001NLKZUA|4|This was an easy and fun read.  The story line is creative and makes a perfect transition from the first book in the series. The characters are well developed and easy to identify with.
B00GT35G9C|5|Great acting, witty one liners, engaging characters, good story line. This is an all around top production with heart.
B0091LRZZW|4|I too saw the abbreviated version of \\"Live Kisses\\" on PBS and, while it was enjoyable I thought the complete, unedited version of the performance which was previously available on I-Tunes was superior. I thought Paul's difficulty in whistling his part in \\"My Very Good Friend The Milkman\\" was endearing and was sorry to see it cut from the PBS show. I was hoping that the complete, uncut performance would be part of the bonus material but, alas, it appears it is not. That is a shame. I will purchase this DVD because the collection of musicians on the album are amazing. To see them perform these, sometimes unknown classics with such professional perfection is more than worth the price. If I had one other complaint it is that these songs get in to your head and you find yourself singing or whistling them all day long.
B009GXHOW4|2|I used to love this - before the update. It always crashes when i try to use this app :( plewse fix this
B002JVWRAO|5|This movie came three days early :  the box was slightly damaged, but the discs were in great shape. I would recomend this to anybody
B001GKJ2DY|5|This is a great show, and the first season was excellent. The DVD came  in new condition as I expected, and shipping was quick.
B00CISAPJS|4|It was a better movie than I expected! I thought the price was too much vs red box would have been 1.59
B0017I1FO4|1|Man, if you want some dirty, soulful hard rock - go get \\"Urban Coyote\\" from Unida, \\"Exam Room\\" by Hermano, \\"Beyond Good & Evil\\" by The Cult, \\"Killing Joke (2003)\\" by Killing Joke...  These guys are just trying too hard to straddle the line between rocking and radio friendly.
B005GFPZYK|5|Good read
B00000269M|5|I swear, if Michael had released every song on this album, each and everyone of them would be a hit. But all the ones he did release will forever remain classics. 'I Just can't Stop loving you' should be on a list for the greatest love songs of all time. It's just great. After listening to 'just good friends', another part of me', 'bad', 'smooth criminal',etc., you'll know why they call him the king of pop. His music is just a testimony to his genius and talent. His lyrics speak to you like no one can. It's one of those rare albums where you don't need to skip a track. It's really worth your money. Overall, this album should be a mandatory requirement in CD players everywhere. It's an album that doesn't age with time and sounds better each time you listen to it.
B00SCEET1M|5|I love it
B0058YPLA2|1|Show is great but case was severly broken when it arrived.
B00EGMQIJ0|5|First of all...where the he'll are the chapter markers in the digital kindle addition. Jesus really??  How annoying. But the book was riveting. Love the characters and the settings...reminded me a movie that came out in 2000 called Antitrust. Can't wait for The Circle to become a movie. And for the young internet generation to see what the world looks like when privacy doesn't exist, and see it displayed in a format they, with some hope can grasp. Oh how we are so screwed.
B00EGMQIJ0|4|When I first started working for a large corporation, my manager at the time told me it was like being in a fish bowl.  Now, with social media being what it is, and recalling those words from my manager, this was a disturbing read.  I see a lot of reviews saying how the characters were undeveloped and shallow.  I will play devil's advocate here and propose that perhaps that was intentional.  For me, the premise of the story doesn't allow for deep thinking and emotional gratification - quite the opposite actually.  I enjoyed this book, in spite of getting creeped out by the prospect that this is closer to reality than we'd like to think.
B00BAXFECK|4|I suffered through reading the protagonists childhood experiences, because I'm sure somehow someone could relate to him. The relationship are realistic yet sad.
B00402FGEE|5|I'm going to try to address the many issues swirling about this series without spoiling the plot:<br /><br />1) Similarities to other shows: There has been a great deal of speculation that the show is a 'ripoff' of Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, or even Lost. While I certainly don't disagree that it bears a striking similarity to Battlestar Galactica, I don't count that as a strike against it.<br /><br />Prior shows are always going to have an impact on future shows. Film-making (whether it be TV or Feature) is an art that builds upon itself, and stands on the shoulders of those who came before it. The fact is the Battlestar Galactica, Firefly, and Lost are all GOOD shows, regardless of your impression of it or whether or not it struck you the right way, they were the best of their genres at the time, and even bent their genres into something new.<br /><br />That being said, to call this show a 'rip-off' or 'carbon copy' of any of those shows is grossly over simplifying things and intentionally misleading. Perhaps we should just create a new genre name, like 'Adult Sci-Fi', so we can get over all these intellectual property theft allegations.<br /><br />2) Dissimilarities to other Stargate franchises: This review will probably take a lot of heat for this, but - past Stargate shows actually weren't very good. Don't get me wrong, I've watched every episode of SG1, and most of Atlantis (still working on that), and enjoy just about all of it, but even while enjoying it, I was fully recognizant of the fact that it wasn't actually good. It's campy. The acting is sub-par, even when there are good actors in the shows. The sets are generic and bland, reminiscent of the original series of Star Trek, the scripting is packed with fromage, and the plots, no matter how original, were all clearly predictable.<br /><br />But to a niche crowd (myself included) they were thoroughly enjoyable through a mixture of silly humour, sci-fi gratification, and a unique self-aware self-deprecation. But even so, the cinematography was regularly lackluster, the effects unconvincing, and the ratings carried along by loyal fans.<br /><br />SGU lacks most of these shortcomings. There is the occasional campy humour, though typically coming from the same character. In that way this one character, Eli, has come to be the only vestige of the old Stargate franchises. This is made believable, though, because this character is quite similar to the people (like myself) who enjoyed the camp of previous Stargate in real life.<br /><br />3) The mood: Many would say it's much too dark, both in production design and in mood. I say that it's about time. In past Stargate series', no matter how far gone a situation was, no matter how much danger they were in, the show was never EVER tense. It never mattered. Nothing ever really mattered. The characters were always too happy and fun and funny and confident and amicable to be capable of expressing any kind of peril. As such, the plots were always completely hollow. Nothing mattered, because it would all be fine in the end.<br /><br />The only episode in both original Stargate series' that managed to capture any kind of deep emotional commitment or tension was Heroes, which just happened to be filmed in the documentary style similar to that of SGU. I don't solely blame the cinematography for this effect, though, but instead, for just once, the characters were encouraged to be vulnerable and hurt, like real human beings.<br /><br />When people are in a serious situation, they get serious (mostly), and their flaws become more apparent. This is evident in this series, as it should be in such situations.<br /><br />4) The set/production design: As for the dark set design, it makes some sense, as the ship is very old, and trying to save power. In past Stargate, no matter how old something was, it always looked like it was cobbled together the day before. The ancient city of Atlantis looking like it was maintained by a team of maid-bots and carpenters right up until the team's arrival. I will admit that the purposeful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.<br /><br />SGU is simply a great show. Yes, it shrugs off its past franchise for the sake of its artistic intent, but it does so with wonderful results. The acting is largely superb, and even the episodes that in other shows would be considered 'in betweeners' come off as being some of the best episodes on television (like the episode Human).<br /><br />I definitely recommend this show to anyone, and I absolutely recommend that past Stargate fans try to leave their preconceptions at the door, and respect it as its own show.<br /><br />UPDATE: You will no doubt notice a massive spree of negative reviews on top of the 'helpful' pile on IMDb. Please take these with a grain of salt, as they are largely spam generated by a select few alienated Stargate fans who are working very, very hard to get this show cancelled. Rest assured, I myself have yet to meet a single classic Stargate fan who doesn't LOVE SGU, and I sure do know a lot of them!oseful gloom goes a bit too far at times, but as far as I'm concerned, that's better than skirting the edge of cardboard box grade production.

B000007S5B|5|This is definatley the best Doors album ever from the beginning of Hello I Love You to the end of Five to One. Jim Morrison's lyrics are amazing while Ray Manzarek and John Densmore's playing set the mood for the album and  Robby Krieger's guitar playing is great as usual. The best songs on this  album are Love Street,Not to Touch the Earth,Summer's Almost Gone,The  Unknown Soldier,Five to One,andMy Wild Love. This is the best album by the  best band ever.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|it is a very good game. Yes, it might be frustraiting at first, but you will obviously come to love it. 5 stars.
B00PTB7B34|5|Really fun
B00005JKCH|5|While many critics complained that the CGI effects made the movie seem more like a video game, I found the effects jawdropping, awesome and quite fun.  Sam Raimi's fast-paced, lively direction perfectly propels the comic book hero onto the big screen.  Tobey Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker, showing his immense range (see &quot;Seabiscuit,&quot; &quot;Pleasantville&quot;), and Kirsten Dunst radiates not only a beautiful physical presence, but the quite seductive beauty of a girl becoming a woman.  Willem Dafoe is the perfect archvillain, although it seems at times he gets too much the best of our hero, but in the end, spidey prevails.  Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris do nicely as Parker's aunt and uncle, and James Franco gives a moody James Dean turn (he played him in a TV movie) as Harry, Dafoe's neglected son.<br />The whole production works mainly because of the heart the cast puts in, and the amazing effects.  Looking forward to catching the sequel.

B0021L8UPS|2|Sometimes a film will impress the heck out of me upon a first viewing, but then when I view it again later, it seems to fall flat and I find myself questioning what ever made me like it in the first place.<br /><br />I just rewatched this last night, and I must say that I am so surprised that I ever liked it. Ok, sure, it is well acted, well lit, and well shot, but the story is so preposterous it isn't even funny. Plus, it's edited very poorly, and has an entirely wrong feel for the story that is being told here.<br /><br />Yes, everything good about it, like the good lighting, color schemes, acting, etc etc, all work against the mere simplistic evil child storyline here. And nothing is ever really established as to any of the main character's motives. Yes, it shows that the mother suffered a miscarriage (in the over the top gory opening scene), but that doesn't really explain to me why they would want to adopt a child (who is almost fully grown, mind you), when they already have children. ?<br /><br />I could understand if they were childless, but they already have two children. Plus, if they really wanted another child, why not adopt a newborn baby? ? Anyways, enough about that lapse in logic.<br /><br />And, as for things not ever been really clearly established, well, that also goes for a lot of other scenes in the film. Namely, it is never explained (or fully explored) why the children react the way they do around Esther at school. Plus, the early scenes of little orphan Esther at school had me rooting for her, because it was the other children that came across as the bad seeds, and she was just some innocent outsider. And the whole scene in the playground, I found myself way too distracted wondering why the little girl was so afraid of the orphan girl, that it robbed the film of any form of suspense that it was trying to build in the moment.<br /><br />And the entire \\"bad seed\\" plot is kind of well forgotten by the third act, because the tone of the entire picture has shifted so dramatically that it in no way no longer really resembles what it was when it started. Plus, this was such a confused story. I don't mean confusing, but confused, in that it didn't really know what it wanted to be: Was it a thriller, or a horror movie, or was it an erotic thriller that happened to have the \\"good child is really evil\\" subplot? (Oh, yes, did I mention that this had way too many over-the-top erotic scenes in it that served absolutely no purpose what-so-ever.)<br /><br />And the entire thing was so way way way over the top it isn't even funny. Ok, well, maybe it is, but not in the way the filmmaker would want it to be. I found myself laughing at the movie so many times I lost count. And I was laughing at them, not with them!<br /><br />Everything is handled in such a heavy handed way, it robs the film of any genuine thrills it should have. There were some scenes that were shot so well, and so well lit, I could watch them over and over, if they were in another film. This may have been better serviced if maybe shot on a lower budget. ? But, as it is, there are way too many well crafted shots wasted on this kind of story.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the father in this. He is possibly the most irritatingly stupidest character in all horror film history. And especially when he actually broke down and cried in front of the orphan girl, LMAO, how pathetic was that! I wanted to kill him myself!<br /><br />And that leads me to yet another problem I have with this movie (matter of fact, I had this problem the first time I saw it): The extremely over-the-top, gory, gruesome murder of his character. The way it was filmed made me feel like I was inside a snuff film, because it was just too gritty, and again, completely out of tone with the rest of the film.<br /><br />Plus, I almost felt like by that time in the movie, no more characters really needed to be killed off. It was such a blatantly bad decision in plotting in my opinion. And, then, this leads me to the extremely bad, over the top (notice a theme here, lol) ending. Wow, could \\"Halloween's\\" ending be ripped off anymore??? You know, the thing that would not die, no matter what you do to it, you know, like, stab it, set it on fire, stab it some more, shoot it, drown it, stab it some more, and IT STILL KEEPS COMING BACK FOR MORE!<br /><br />This is definitely a \\"shut your brain off at the start\\" kind of movie, and even kind of good for a first time viewing, if all you're out for is some kind of cheap, dumbed down quick thrill, but if you're like me, and like your movies to be a little bit more cerebral and challenging, then you may wanna skip this one. I sure wish I did! Thank you. :>). And, then, this leads me to the extremely bad, over the top (notice a theme here, lol) ending. Wow, could \\"Halloween's\\" ending be ripped off anymore???

B00004CWO8|5|Finally, Matthew Bourne's innovative production of Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE is available on DVD. This is not a camp send-up of the balletic war horse,  but a modern, freshly imagined telling of a tale of enchantment, betrayal,  disenchantment, and release. What most people already know about this  production is that the swans and cygnets are performed by male dancers,  that the choreography emphasizes the aggressive rather than the graceful  movements in swans' repertoire, and that the story is heavily freighted  with Freudian implications as it shows a young prince's efforts to break  free of his mother's hold (she's part Merry Widow and part Cruella deVil).  The viewer who tries to analyze plot points too carefully is heading toward  frustration and confusion. (For those who just can't let it alone, there's  a helpful on-screen synopsis you can jump to whenever you need it.) The  best way to enjoy this production is by focusing on the choreography and  the dancing itself. Adam Cooper's nameless Swan is powerful, persistent,  and unapologetic. He could be the prince's alter ego, his embodied desires,  the id, or just about anything else you'd want to ascribe to him. He woos  son and mother with equal conviction. Besides the moments when Cooper is on  stage/screen, the choreographic hightlight of this production for me was  the dance of the cygnets (pas de quatre). This is a moment of levity in  every production of SWAN LAKE, but more so here where the mischievous  antics and curiosity of the cygnets are played for all they're worth.<br />The  other thing worth commenting on is the quality of the filming of this live  performance. I have usually been disappointed by ballets on  film--presentation is often static, or feet and hands get cut out of the  picture, or the camera goes in for a close-up at a point when something  significant is happening in the choreography. Given the trade-offs,  Adventures in Motion Pictures has done an excellent job of capturing all  the key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and  montages. The colors are rich and expressive (the dance of the swans by the  lake is bathed in a haunting nocturnal blue). And best of all, the film is  completely free of the annoying halos and bizarre shimmerings that always  seem to make their way into filmed stage productions.key choreography while creatively managing close-ups, transitions, and  montages.

0767803434|5|I really like this film and will watch it again and again.  Harrison Ford plays a very determined President.  He's determined no to sit by and do nothing when terrorists destroy other countries; he is determined not to negotiate with terrorists; he is determined to save his family and other hostages when terrorists take over Air Force One; and very determined to get their leader off his ship and tells him so.  After that, he's determined to send as many as possible to safety before the ship breaks apart upon impact with the ocean.  He does accomplish his goals with the help of his cabinet via phone calls or fax machine when he is not dodging bullets in various parts of the plane.  Glen Close plays an equally determined Vice President trying to get all the hostages free and save President and his family.  Gary Oldman plays a terrorist leader who is determined to lead Russia into a new Golden Age of power and glory and plans to undermine the President's new policy of not negotiating with terrorists by threatening to kill his family.<br />  I have always liked Harrison Ford movies and this is a definite keeper to be watched over and over again.  I liked the fact that I could choose to watch it either wide-screen or full-screen.  This is a movie that needs to be seen in wide-screen. All fans of Harrison Ford will undoubtedly like this film of a man determined to live by his convictions, only to be challenged to dig deep to find the strength and courage to do so when the unthinkable happens.  Those who like a good action adventure will like it as well because it is full of action with fights in a plane being wildly flown, bullets flying everywhere, people either parachuting or falling out said plan, and other adrenaline rush scenes.  You too will want those terrorists off the President's plane.

B0081336FO|5|Okay I admit I wasn't a big fan of this show at the beginning - still pining for Game of Thrones to come back on and sad to have to settle for something else but it started to grow on me. The music is brilliant - music is a big deal in a show for me and it sets the mood and the tone of what's to come - the characters certainly started to grow on me - Sherlock, Watson, Mycroft and even Moriarti. Love the dry English humor and the problem solving mode Sherlock gets into and you know what? I don't think he's as big a jerk as people make him out to be. Geniuses have to put up with mediocre minds, and unless we know what that's like, we can't judge. He's still a wonderful human being and I'm rating this show a high 5 stars. Can't wait until Season 3!!!

B0071XO8RA|5|If there's one rule in the silo: never ask to go outside.<br /><br />Now you're probably wondering, what's outside, right? And also, who the hell is Hugh Howey? This is good; this is normal, these are good questions. Let's begin by answering the last question first. Howey is many things: an ex-yacht captain, a master story-teller and probably, the internet's best kept secret. But WOOL isn't Howey's first book, and book might not be the right word, since WOOL is actually Howey's second series. He's self-published (for the most part) and this, quite possibly, is what makes WOOL so brilliant. With no publisher, no advertising whatsoever, no budget and no famous-author blurbs, Howey managed to single-handedly create his most successful (and one of Amazon's best-selling Kindle sci-fi) series to date.<br /><br />Briefly, WOOL is one of the best science fiction books I have ever read. And it's actually addicting! The formula? Howey never (ever) offers straight-up explanations to anything, even to the most important questions like: what is outside, how did the world blow up, did the world blow up and why are these people all living underground in a silo? Howey takes his time--almost like he is flaunting his ability to tell a damn good story--and lets the book do all the work, through meticulous character development and engaging dialogue.<br /><br />But to answer the first question: WOOL is an unorthodox tale about survival and post-apocalyptic wellness in a dystopian world where reality and the very notion of survival have devolved into a state of underground existence. In principle, it's definitely a science fiction text but don't fret--Howey abstains from using age-old science fiction clich&eacute;s or boring us with already-been-done end-of-the-world scenarios. And don't expect this to be a tale about aliens from distant planets with shrink rays from the future; there's nothing about time-travel here. The world of WOOL is anchored in a reality that seems much too real and plausible.<br /><br />The exposition is rather speedy: something bad happened and the outside is no longer safe. All survivors now live underground. And again, forget clich&eacute;s, these people don't live in giant vaults or covered bunkers; they live in one giant silo but there's more to it... On the first level of the silo (the top,) there are these giant wallscreens connected to cameras that are mounted to the exterior wall of the silo and these cameras allow the inhabitants to see the outside, which really isn't that much. On the wallscreens, it's the same loop: a brown desert and hills with a gray sky. Pretty straightforward, see, but note that these wallscreens are central to the entire WOOL universe. The world went to crap a long time ago and these people have been living in a silo for quite some time--several decades it seems--so after a while, a (somewhat unique) justice system, contingent of the wallscreens and outside cameras, was created. If you ask to go outside, you are considered a traitor and are treated like a criminal and criminals are punished by being sent outside, for \\"cleaning.\\"<br /><br />In one of the early chapters--and these chapters go by fast, the longest being something like six or seven pages--Howey goes into great detail about the outside, basically affirming that what the inhabitants see on the wallscreens is indeed real. The outside is nothing but desert. Obviously, an environment like this is terrible for cameras, as bits of sand, dust and grime quickly collect onto the surface lenses. This is why someone is required to clean, routinely. And if there is no one to send outside, the sheriff chooses one of the inhabitants for cleaning. Pretty sick, right? Oh, and also, no one has ever refused to clean.<br /><br />If anything, WOOL is like a (very) good soap-opera that reads like a mystery novel (at times) with obvious elements of science fiction and the occasional (spectacularly-written) action sequence. Each chapter (generally) leaves the reader in a daze, with a mini-cliffhanger, the sort you would come to expect from a serialized novel like WOOL, and this, actually, is what makes WOOL so addicting and ultimately, so satisfying. Oh, and did I mention? WOOL features one of the most-accomplished and satisfying villains in recent years. The kind who does the obligatory explanation-of-dastardly-plans speech but then actually goes through with the plan!<br /><br />Go read the Amazon reviews; WOOL has the sort of characters and chapter endings that will leave you lying awake at night, wondering: my goodness, what could possibly be next? How is this character ever going to overcome this great torment? It's a drama, a thriller, a mystery, a science fiction text. It's WOOL, and I promise: it will infect your life.aves the reader in a daze, with a mini-cliffhanger, the sort you would come to expect from a serialized novel like WOOL, and this, actually, is what makes WOOL so addicting and ultimately, so satisfying.

B007J4T2G8|1|I had heard several people discussing this book and I decided to review a sample.  I am so glad I did not buy it. I am not interested in S & M and I really did not like the vibe of the main character. I read the 1st few chapters and then deleted this book. What is so great about someone being manipulated and changed into someone they no longer recognize, so someone guess can get their jolly's off.

B00ELP1U6S|1|The two ce fanntral characters in this novel are dissipants who do not deserve much admiration. I do not consider this one of the Fitzgeralds better novels. The writing is excellent, but the characters lack of moral fiber is discouraging  The fact that many critics consider F.Scott and his wife Zelda to be the models for these two central characters is insulting.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who is not an avid Fitzgerald
B0071XO8RA|5|Very well written.  Very smart premise and clever ideas.  The author made me like and care about the characters.  Would like to read more in this vein from this author.  I hope he's got more of this in him.
B00SH04286|1|Not what I hoped for.  Disappointed that it wasn't a better film.
031606792X|1|This series went from being fun, mindless entertainment to simultaneously reminding me of Rosemary's Baby and Pulp Fiction (seriously, that birth scene was potentially the least romantic way possible to become a vampire).     It seems that Meyer has substituted Bella being a parent for Bella actually becoming responsible. These things do not automatically go hand in hand, and it ends up making Bella an even worse role model.    Also, I have taken issue with the werewolves imprinting on infants before, and this book just adds even more creepy to an already creepy topic. Jacob falls in love with the daughter of the girl he professed to love just months before, when the kid is barely out of the womb.    The \\"sex\\" in the book is a victim of bad editing. It's hard to write something age-appropriate on this topic, I understand. But it comes across like Meyers wrote actual sex scenes, with the not-PG parts sloppily cropped out, either by her or her editor.    I could go on and on about all the things that this book just got wrong, but suffice to say, I wish I had just stopped reading the series before this book came out. I almost wish I had never become interested in the books at all.

One side has little color and the audio is flat such as it was not recorded correctly..non electrified. The other side is fine. Same concert on both sides.

I first read about this book in a magazine (I cannot recall which one) and it sounded pretty good, so I bought it. Then it was on Oprah's Book Club. Then it was a movie. I cannot express enough my love for this story and how I somehow feel connected to Cheryl, even though I'm on the East Coast and have never taken such a journey.<br /><br />The book is extremely well written and flows nicely, making it a quick read. Cherly delves into her drugged past, her mother's death, her divorce, and most of all- her strength to overcome it all... even if that strength does come a little slow.

B008KZVNLC|4|I anxiously awaited the movie I had ordered from Amazon.on line. Anticipating the highly advertised PARADES END because my favorite actor was assuming a comedic role in the film , something very unusual for him to do. I had seen many screen clips of his performances and they were very amusing. He was to appear in several scenes according to the advertisements.  To my dismay the film I received only had a three second appearance in one scene. Not at all what was in the ads. This is just a bare bones synopsis of the movie, Parades End takes place at the end of World War 1, creating, in this story, a London populated by aristocrats and high society. The plot is very intricate and involved, it moves slowly and can be confusing at times. We are introduced to a shrewish wife who has been unfaithful and her husband who finds himself amazingly attracted to a vivacious young woman. Sub-plots involving supporting players adds depth to the movie. I recommend PARADES END to those who prefer long , intricate and slightly opaque films full of a variety of interesting charactes. I can only say I missed the reverend  so very much!

6305603847|3|First off, let me say that this movie DOES have a plot. It shocks me that so many Pink Floyd fans would think that the movie is plotless. I would have thought that more Floyd fans would have either caught on or listened to other fans when they explain the plot. The movie is about a rock star named Pink who lost his father to the war while he was only a small child, dealt with an over protective mother all his life, had a failed marraige (mostly his own fault) and was also a rock star who abused the power he had over his audience, still a nice statement for the mindless sheep who follow a band blindly and become obsessed to the point of losing their own individuality. Pink began his career as a rock star to escape the every day Hell that he had to live with, one that haunted him for years.<br />That said, Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" was a ground breaking album and a step in rock and roll that HAD to be taken. A band like Pink Floyd had to exist so that they could inspire other bands (Tool and A Perfect Circle come to mind) to produce honest to God, good rock and roll with a heart and something real to say, rather then the mindless soulless corporate crap that clutters up the radio today. The character here builds up an emotional wall around him to guard his vulnerability, something that we've almost all been through at one point or another in our lives. Pink Floyd by all acounts were a revolutionary band, the first band to go the extra mile with their art and were wildly successful with it. Of course, this is just one reviewer's opinion, I've always understood a person's reason for not liking Pink Floyd. The band is not for everyone. Some don't want to be dragged along for over an hour, following a story with music. Some just want good tunes to blast in their car or headphones and that's understandable.<br />Down to the movie. It's more or less over an hour of music videos, before there were such a thing. The dialogue is the music which is more of a narration which couldturn some people off. I personally would have loved to see a real movie with real dialogue because everything about The Wall is theatric. From the album to the stage show. Here, the music is the film and the scenes are the background. Reverse the rolls and you would have one Hell of a movie, in my opinion. Which is not to say that this movie is without it's good points. For instance, \\"Another Brick in the Wall pt. 2\\" is a great point in the movie. The maze to represent a school is brilliant and so are the kids being lead into a meat grinder. A great social commentary on crooked education, with teachers that revel in taking out their own problems on the kids they're paid to teach. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is also another high point. There's too many videos to run through, so I'll just say that they vary from being great (Goodbye Blue Sky, The Trial, When the Tigers Broke Free), to just being ok (Young Lust).<br />The real shining star of this movie is Gerald Scarfe. His animations are AMAZING. \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" is really the high point of the movie, hands down. The symbolism is great and on point and gets the point across beautifully, more so then the regular scenes with actual acting. \\"The Trial\\" is also everything it should have been and more. (The judge is a butt with a face on it. How true is that?)<br />All in all (no pun intended), you should get this if you're a real Pink Floyd fan, who hasn't just heard a few songs here and there on the radio. You should also buy this if you've read all the reviews on here and have a good grasp on what you'll be spending your money on. This film is not for everyone. This is the type of movie where if you don't get it, you'll most likely just watch it once and never again. Maybe twice if you're thinking that you missed something that you should be getting. And if you do get it, it's a great experience that you'll dig out every now and than for a fun time. As depressing as the movie is, there is much positivity that lies beneath the surface. So many of us have the emotional wall around us that we really do need to break down in order to enjoy life, love and all the other adventures that the world has instore for us. You have to dig beneath the surface with this movie like much of Pink Floyd's work to get the concept. If nothing else, you can enjoy the music as it sounds better on this DVD than the album. There's also two new songs. The bonus features are rather plentiful, featuring the original documentary on the movie, a two part retrospective, the music video for \\"Another Brick on the Wall pt. 2\\", the \\"Hey You\\" scene (which was cut from the movie because Roger Waters thought it dragged the flim on too much but is actually quite great), the trailer, a still gallery and commentary by Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe which is great and at times very funny. If nothing else, the bonus features may interest you.<br />If you'd rather experience The Wall in a different way and are interested in seeing just what the live shows for the album were like, I'd strongly suggest Roger Waters' \\"The Wall: Live in Berlin\\" DVD. It's a great DVD despite some stale guests here and there. A truly great thing to witness if you really love the album.<br />One love to all,<BR>Kevin

B00000JGOJ|4|As soon as I heard the opening, voice-over monologue from Joan (Angelina Jolie), Playing by Heart had me. I knew it would be interesting, but I also saw the trap the writer/director/producer (Willard Carroll) had set for himself. I wanted to shout through the screen and warn him -- if only so at the conclusion I could have the schadenfreud of saying 'I told you so.' Because Willard Carroll, who has many more credits as a producer than he has as a writer or director, was making the rookie mistake of being too clever. Like one of his characters, Meredith (Gillian Anderson), a theater director, who when given a compliment that someone liked her play has to ask: \\"Before or after I deconstructed it?\\"<br /><br />Let's take a moment to deconstruct that opening monologue. First, Joan name drops Chet Baker, and this shows that she is very sophisticated, to appreciate Chet Baker. Even to know who Chet Baker is colors me impressed. But would she be the kind of person who appreciates Chet Baker for purely superficial reasons; like his movie star good looks that led photographer Bruce Weber to become a fan and make a documentary called Let's Get Lost that dwelled on Chet's Matinee Idol looks; and paired him with Chris Isaak, though their music was apples and oranges, merely because they both made photogenic models? Or would Joan be the kind of jazz fan who loved Chet for his beautiful sound and lyricism, even if years of drugs had taken their toll on his looks, and a drug dealer had smashed his teeth in, forcing him to adjust his embouchure to allow for playing with dentures?<br /><br />Besides name dropping Chet Baker, which could be either a good thing or a bad thing depending on whether Joan was sincere or merely a poseur, she quoted a line that I have always admired, or at least a paraphrase of it. The musician who played like Chet Baker was supposed to have said, when Joan wanted to talk about how his solo made her feel, that talking about music was like dancing about architecture. Or talking about love, also like dancing about architecture. I know this quote, actually it says that writing about music is like dancing about architecture, but the problem is, her friend, the Chet Bakeresque trumpeter, is not the person who made up this quote. I thought that Elvis Costello had said this, and he did say it in an interview in 1983, but when asked about it later, he didn't remember saying it, but thought he had heard Martin Mull say it. It is also attributed to Steve Martin, Frank Zappa, and Laurie Anderson. Even Frank Lloyd Wright is supposed to have said it, but that seems Frank Lloyd Wrong, because, being an architect, he would have seen no contradiction in dancing about architecture. Willard Carroll was so enamored of the simile that the original title of Playing by Heart was going to be Dancing about Architecture. But Willard Carroll, the producer, wisely decided that it would be too clever, much to the chagrin of Willard Carroll, the writer, and also Willard Carroll, the director.<br /><br />Playing By Heart shows various couples, seemingly unrelated, but all in various stages and phases of love. Joan (played to perfection by a young Angelina Jolie) is the kind of woman who talks too loud on the phone, yelling the intimate details of her life even louder to be heard over the din of the L.A. nightclub she is in. Keenan (Ryan Phillippe) is a keen observer. He doesn't say much, but you can tell that he doesn't miss a thing. He sees right through Joan, but keeps his own cards close to the vest. But it seems like to an extrovert like Joan, Eau D'Indifference is the most irresistible cologne of all. As she tells her sister afterwards, once again talking too loud into her phone:<br /><br />------------------<br />Joan: The lad doesn't say much and when he does, he finds just the right words to crush my soul.<br />==========================<br /><br />Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillippe look like they would make a very cute couple, but here I have to say that they are both acting up a storm. Their good looks are like masks actors put on to portray characters. This film is pre-Oscar for Girl, Interrupted, and really shows great potential for Jolie. I would almost say that she is acting better here than in GI. Phillippe is an excellent foil for her. He is understated, while she chews up the scenery and spits it out. The more he holds back, the more you wonder: what is his deep dark secret?<br /><br />-------------------<br />Joan: [to waitress] I'll have a vodka martini, very dry, straight up. three olives, and... my sullen friend here will have...<br />Keenan: A Coke.<br />Joan: The poster boy for designated drivers will have a *Coke.*<br />===================================<br /><br />Paul (Sean Connery) and Hannah (Gena Rowlands) are also going through a rough patch, but the month is December rather than May. They banter like an old married couple, because they are an old married couple.<br /><br />------------------------------------<br />Paul: Don't look at me with that tone of voice.<br />===========================================<br /><br />Paul corrects Hannah's grammar. At one point she says she wouldn't feel any different, and he says 'differently.' Remember that distinction, because there is a small though subtle pay off later, in what passes for a running gag among the chronically clever. A lot of Playing By Heart concerns how we show our love by paying attention to the minute details of what is said by our loved ones, even if we correct their grammar:<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Paul: You're overwrought.<br />Hannah: I'm perfectly wrought. Given the circumstances, I'm even a little underwrought.<br />Paul: There's no such word.<br />Hannah: There is now.<br />==================================================<br /><br />The cleverest couple, and the character who lets her cleverness sabotage her happiness the most, would have to be Meredith (Gillian Anderson) and Trent (Jon Stewart). Meredith is, of course, if you have been paying attention, the play director. This is how her version of 'meet cute' plays out:<br /><br />---------------<br />Trent: You know I'm not just asking you to dinner as a pre-emptive strike against litigation. I'm asking because...<br />Meredith: I'll have dinner with you.<br />Trent: What changed your mind?<br />Meredith: Anyone who can say 'preemptive strike against litigation' with a straight face deserves a dinner companion.<br />=============================<br /><br />Trent is a match for Meredith in the clever department, but at least he doesn't take himself or his own cleverness too seriously. Just as in Jon Stewart's real life gig, as the anchor of The Daily Show, Trent knows the importance of humor:<br /><br />-------------<br />Meredith: Wow.<br />Trent: Yeah I know, the flowers are a little much, but I'm late. But only because I had second thoughts about the flowers and threw them away halfway down the block. Then had third thoughts and went back and got them.<br />=================================<br /><br />Sometimes though, in love and life, it is best to go with your first inspiration. The first thought, let alone the second or third. There is such a thing as over-thinking, Meredith. That is what Trent is trying to tell you, though he does it in a self-mocking way. I think he likes you.<br /><br />While Meredith and Keenan seem to resist falling in love and getting in a relationship with Trent and Joan, respectively, Gracie (Madeleine Stowe) and Roger (Anthony Edwards) just want a physical relationship without any emotional baggage. They are both married, but not to each other. Madeleine Stowe steals the show with her passionate performance. She, not the guy, is the one who pushes for the no strings set up. Anthony Edwards will be familiar to those who have seen ER in the early seasons, where he played a doctor. He is a different kind of professional here, but I wouldn't dream of spoiling the surprise by telling on him. By the way, there is a clever reference to the spoiler of all spoilers in this movie, so if you still don't know what Citizen Kane means when he says \\"Rosebud\\" you had better watch that one first.<br /><br />Another mystery is just who is Hugh (Dennis Quaid). He keeps turning up and telling people harrowing tales, and you really start to believe his sob stories, but the problem is he tells everyone a different story. If he is a con man, then what is he after? He never seems to get anything out of it. At one point he claims to be a TV exec in charge or ABC's Thursday Night Line-up. His wife is shacked up with the guy who is in charge of NBC's. Oh, the bitter irony, when he gets fired. The lawyer who is hearing his tale of woe is played by none other than Nastassja Kinski. But he passes up her offer of 'coffee.' What gives?<br /><br />-------------<br />Hugh: I'm better at all these lies I've manufactured than I am at the ones I'm living.<br />=====================<br /><br />Another sub plot involves a mother and son. Paul (Jay Mohr), the son, is dying of AIDS, and is using his last days to finally get straight, so to speak, with his mother, Mildred (Ellen Burstyn). Meanwhile, the movie keeps cutting back and forth from Hugh, Mark and Mildred, and the different couples.<br /><br />Back to Trent and Meredith:<br /><br />----------------------------<br />Meredith: Well, That doesn't take long does it?<br />Trent: What doesn't?<br />Meredith: I mean, you turn a guy down a-and WHAM. he just metamorphoses into an anger ball.<br />Trent: An 'Anger ball'?<br />Meredith: See.<br />======================================<br /><br />By the time the third woman has thrown out an 'anger ball' epitaph at her man, like it was the phrase that pays in a radio contest, you begin to suspect something. Just who are these sisters talking to? Who are the sisters they are talking to? Is it all relative? Stay tuned.<br /><br />The final scene is where all the cleverness takes its toll. What kills it for me is the sound track. They are all at an event with live music, it is actually supposed to be the jazz band that Joan dug. The trumpet player is the guy who said the line about dancing about architecture. But the music is smooth jazz mixed with an orchestral score, all obviously dubbed in. Jonathan Demme in Rachel Getting Married used lots of musicians playing live. It was well integrated into the scene, the only thing you could complain about was perhaps they had too many musicians. It is so fake in Playing By Heart, and the whole effect is ruined. Another example of jazz music being used in a film, but in a good way, would be Mo' Better Blues. I'm not saying that the music in Playing By Heart was bad, just that in this scene, where everything was riding on its integrity, it was fake, not the music that the band was playing. They had Chris Botti writing some tunes and playing trumpet, and actually had two composers scoring the soundtrack -- one was scrapped for some reason. There were a couple of Chet Baker recordings used for some scenes. But in the final crucial scene, when all the chips were down, writer/director/producer Willard Carroll choked.<br /><br />Still, I am giving this 4 stars for all the clever dialogue, and the stellar cast who really delivered their lines as if they had thought them all up themselves.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Meredith: I'll tell you what I don't want. I don't want all this calculated artificiality. This dress, these stupid little bows in my hair, they aren't me. I mean, look at you. You - you don't sit around your house in an Armani suit, do you?<br />Trent: No. My house is black-tie.<br />====================================<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0019XZDZO Smart People]] (2008) ....

B00KG2RI9I|5|Love it
B0047Y0FGY|4|I liken the book to eating \\"wisdom\\" cookies with a glass of sour milk. Good airport, leisure, fun read, esp for men.
B001AVCFJM|5|This movie really helped to relaunch the Star Trek franchise that has been growing stale in fits and starts over the decades. It has everything one hoped a Star Trek film would have, minus the taking itself too seriously that has hampered other Trek films.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the story is just too similar to story and plot lines that Star Trek has recycled over and over again through the years.<br /><br />Let's hope the second film in this series has something a bit more original to the story.<br /><br />Recommended, though I wish I had waited until I owned a BluRay player to purchase this movie. This was one of my last DVD purchases, and it's a film that really benefits from HDTV viewing.
B00AEJM6H2|5|my goal is jewels star is a five star rated game. and I am playing it until I get three stars in all levels..  very additive.<br />I love this game...
B000001EMW|5|I can't tell you how great this CD is.  For all Metallica fans, who  sometimes want or need to have dinner music  but can't stand classical  music.  This is the CD for you. You will find yourself humming and singing  along but you will truly be enjoying the music.  If you like Metallica and  you enjoy music I highly recommend this CD
B007FH9GA6|5|When I heard David Fincher was set to direct this movie adaptation of the world-famous book, I instantly had very high expectations. He met and exceeded those expectations. I have see this movie three times now and I cannot find anything negative to say about it at all. There are some minor deviations from the source material but these changes only serve to enhance the story. I don't want to dive much into plot so as not to spoil this gem for the 10 people left in the world who have neither read the book nor seen the movie. I'll just say watch the film. It is great!<br /><br />By the way, this movie is a very hard \\"R\\". I wouldn't recommend this for kids.
B00B2V66VS|5|I think this game is like and unlike the first temple run and i love to play thee kinds of games and it free i think everyone should try playing it you may not do well on your first try but you will improve
B00E9A656K|5|This is the best game ever!
B003XF1XOQ|3|A nice novel you want to read till the end.....also keeps you guessing most of the times.  Last chapters seem rushed through.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is in my top 5 games. This game is very fun if you like to create houses and monuments.
B00ADIT8U2|4|Fun game with good puzzles. It could have been a bit longer.
B009FZHYKU|5|Well I have to say I was done with Lori and I think the way that story line ended was perfect.  I love Andrew Lincoln, he does an amazing job.  I like where they went in the story arc this season and can't wait to see what surprises we have next season.
B00005JO9J|5|I am a physician so a lot of the medical matter makes me wince and I bear it. Yet, there are those moments in every episode when I see the actors address real human emotions and frustrations. That is when I almost forget that I am looking at more of the same sorta St.Elsewhere/ER \\"let's play doctor\\" trash. This isn't trash....it is entertainment.The cast is almost believable !
B0089LOG02|5|I enjoyed this book a lot. It was well written and held my interest.I will deffenatly read more books written by this author.
B000QRIGLC|5|Couldn't put it down. Important to read to acknowledge their sacrifice.
B00A285RC6|5|Great story told with warmth and a good dose of honesty. I read it over the course of two days - couldn't put it down. Kudos to Adam Braun for meeting his dreams head on.
B00A9ET4MC|5|OUTSTANDING!  I could not put this book down.  She writes beautifully and the story she weaves touches all senses.  But it is only one story.  Please watch her Ted talk interview about the dangers of telling one story - it is fascinating and really opened my eyes. [...]    I lead a book club and this has been put on our listed of books.  I cannot wait to read her other books.!
B000EF5NAS|5|I have watched this movie over and over and it is always a great staple in our home.
B009NFHF0Q|5|In this novel, Gaiman perfectly recreates the surreal quality of childhood in which reality and fantasy co-mingle.  The story begins as the narrator revisits the neighborhood where he grew up and remembers an event that ruptured the innocence of his early years: the sucide of a boarder his family had taken in, a man who had accidentally run over the narrator's kitten and taken over his room in the house.  He takes refuge in the home of a neighbor girl, Lettie, who lives with her mother and grandmother in a farmhouse at the end of the lane.  While they appear normal on the surface,  these women are anything but, and the body of water that looks like a pond turns out to also have magical qualities.  He and Lettie go on an adventure during which he accidentally brings back a spirit from another world who, while apparently well-meaning, begins to cause all manner of trouble in the young narrator's life.  What's magical and enrapturing about this novel the way Gaiman captures the inner terrors and surreal qualities of a child's point of view.  If you liked _Coraline_, _Neverwhere_ and any of Gaiman's other novels, you're sure to enjoy this one as well.
B002SQNM9A|5|I cannot really review anything I buy for someone else and never even lay eyes on.  The best can say is that my family member loved it.

B001KVZ6HK|3|Of course I wanted to like this, and going in, I was confident that it would be a five star blast. But from the first scene on, I had the alarming sense that something was badly wrong. Yes, it is the best reproduction of an action comic on screen, but aside from the verbal sparring, I don't see anything here that tops something like X2 (beyond the superfighting). I can understand how lovers of the source material would adore this movie, but please don't expect any more than that. Don't be confused by Nolan's films or Whedon's pedigree (or the fanboy love) into anticipating genuine drama, story intrigue (or coherence) from a movie constructed around a string of powers fights.<br /><br />I had wanted to say that this was the best movie that could have been delivered under the intense fan-service constraints imposed on its creators. But (after seeing it four times and falling asleep twice) I can't. This isn't The Dark Night. There's a huge amount of enjoyable detail here that improves over the earlier movies in this franchise, but there are many elements that still seem ham handed. Some examples:<br />* The first post-credits scene has Black Widow escaping from bondage; an awesome scene in the trailer. This is undercut in the movie by revealing that her captors already know her identity and that they have essentially surrendered. Fighting her way out of a chair is cool in itself, and the movie seems to be satisfied with that & unconcerned that the setup lowers the dramatic stakes. Before the fight begins, she is presented as neither vulnerable nor in peril.<br />* The entire plot of the movie (before its interminable climax) turns out to be an elaborate scheme to unleash a monster from among the good guys. We never find out exactly why this is Loki's scheme (except in the deleted scenes: it's a prophylactic) but, in any case, it doesn't lead anywhere & isn't really motivated by anything. Angel (series 4) had exactly the same problem with unmotivated antagonism but it is MUCH more apparent here. There's little effort to conceal a structure that has the heroes running in a circle to the climactic fight.<br /><br />Is it just me? I hope I'm not being obsessively picky about a summer blockbuster. But I don't think it *is* just me, because the director's commentary obsesses over logistical detail. Whedon explains that the Iron Man / Thor battle was a contractual requirement, and that having them fight over possession of the captive Loki was an improvement over Marvel's \\"brainwash\\" concept. It just didn't play that way to me. Thor has no credible motive for fighting after learning that keeping Loki on earth could save humanity. In each watch-through this comes across as a flimsy excuse for a battle, especially after Thor drops the matter (without a word) after a dust-up.<br /><br />I could go on with the disappointing scenes (e.g. a *trickster god* being fooled by a ruse *that every audience member saw through* into blabbing his unnecessarily complex scheme) but maybe a blockbusters shouldn't be judged on those terms. And if you like this type of movie then you'll already have seen it and will have thrilled to its many cool details. I was hoping for more, so I can't recommend this to anyone who doesn't already know they like it. Ruffalo's Hulk is a major advance in the maturation of the screen superhero, but if you aren't interested in comic book worlds for their own sake then that won't matter to you & you should wait for the next movie in the hopes that it becomes what this one promised to be.
B00J0LH16Q|1|absolutely hate it
0393061310|4|I was tempted to give Jared 5 stars based on the extent of his information and his strength of his argument.  I gave him only 4 stars because, although I think he is 75% correct, I think he has ignored or denies factors that may be important.<br /><br />Early in his book, Kali, an intelligent New Guinean and would-be shaker and mover asks a significant question.  \\"Why does the white man have more cargo [goods, stuff, useful things] than we do?  Jared, correctly in my opinion, refutes the politically incorrect view that New Guineans must be less intelligent than whites.  Quite the contrary, Jared asserts.  New Guineans, on the average, are more intelligent than whites.<br /><br />A little like Jared, I've had the opportunity to live with 'primitive' people and have seen their superiority to me in things like bushcraft, tracking, spacial orientation and other things....yet.... they are not necessarily more intelligent than I am.  Their experience is simply different than mine.  I agree, however, that they are, on the average, intelligent people dealing with problems somewhat different those of 'civilized' individuals.<br /><br />Jared attributes the dominance of Western Man over almost all other peoples of the earth because of our geographical location and because of the fortuitous presence of large wild animals that had the potential for domestication i.e. animals like the auroch, wild horse, ibex, wild sheep etc.  In the Americas, for instance--despite the fact that the meso-Americans and Andean peoples may have been superior to Western peoples in terms of agriculture--the only domesticatable wild animal available to them may have been the guanaco and vicuna.  Therefore, native-americans were obliged to carry things themselves.  Hence Cortes conquered Mexico, rather than Montezuma conquering Spain.<br /><br />BUT....and it's a big 'BUT'....We know, from toys discovered that the ancient Americans understood the wheel.  Why then didn't they discover the wheel-barrow propelled by a single person?  It multiplies human labor by a factor of 3.  It would have made the construction of monuments and almost everything else, a lot easier.  Why didn't they make the connection or, if they did, why didn't they carry it to the next logical level and actually use it.  I don't know but I rather suspect that the wheel WASN'T used initially in a cart propelled by large domestic animals.  Even in Mesopotamia and China, it was likely used by the first and most available 'domestic' animal...that is the human being.  Why did the people's of the Old World come up with the idea and those of the New World didn't.  For that matter, why didn't Diamond discuss it.<br /><br />Yes, cattle, sheep, goats and a myriad of other creatures were available to the peoples of the entire 'old world.'  Despite this, Europeans and Middle Easterners made the most effective use of them.  Why?<br /><br />Indeed, why?  Let me postulate another couple of scenario.  Let us imagine, that human societies spread over the earth are like the atmosphere spread over the earth.  Why a storm in one place and not another?  Perhaps a very minor, almost imperceptible perturbation, causes major changes down the line.  A slight shift in atmospheric pressure over China and there's a devastating hurricane in Louisiana...a slight cultural perturbation, perhaps in now Albania, and Pizarro burns Atahualpa at the stake?  Maybe the 'superiority' of Western culture is no more than a happenstance.<br /><br />Also, although now largely discredited, who really knows if there are differences in the way that different brains work?  This is not to say that certain brains are necessarily 'better' than others but that they might be different.  Also, who is to say that industrialized, 'civilized' society is better than hunter gatherer societies?  In many ways, it isn't.  Civilized society is ulcerogenic.  Hunter-gatherer societies are probably more satisfying and fun.  Genesis, in the Bible, talks of man being thrown out of Paradise and having to work by the sweat of his brow.  This is almost certainly an allegory about the replacement of enjoyable and care-free hunter-gatherer existence as opposed to the drudgery of early civilization.<br /><br />Why is domination a function of a pressure wave produced by black powder in a pipe propelling a leaden slug? Luck?<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Conquest of Mexicoeat of his brow.

B000005ITX|1|Please, spend a few extra dollars and get the new Rhino edition.  I was unfortunate enough to buy this version only one month before the new one was released.  The sound quality on this is atrocious.  I repeat, do not buy this version!
0553593714|5|Absolutely LOVED it!!!
1423377001|5|This CD series is a must for people that love task-based work.  It is an imperative to understand that we have a finite worlking life unless we engage the creative, sythesising side of our brains in a complementary manner.
B002QYUVY8|5|It is the best movie I have ever seen. Acting and plot wise. Everything is perfect  That's all I can say
0446677450|1|I love financial literacy books, and I had to try Rich Dad Poor Dad.  In general the book is like most finincial help books, repetitive and vague.  Nothing was even suggested to the reader to try until half way through the book.  All the tactics the author suggests are high risk, which I don't have a problem with, except for the fact that he claims with financial education these tactics become low risk?  The odds of you winning the lottery do not increase with practice...  Overall the author comes off as arrogant and obnoxious.  The book puts a fun twist on the idea of a day job and the concept of money, but overall this book is a waste of paper that makes this arrogant author more obnoxiously wealthy.  Buy this book if you would like to widen the gap between the rich and poor :)
044022425X|5|Love this book
B0016HNOXQ|5|Funny how it takes more than several plays to appreciate new music sometimes. I wasn't thrilled with Third the first couple of plays, but now I think it's completely brilliant! So much so that I've been playing it repeatedly all week long. If you're expecting a continuation of what they did on the first two albums, you'll likely be disappointed. Third is really not triphop as it is a new and successful direction for the band. It's much more experimental and minimalist with droning textures over more of an industrial beat, but there are also some very etherial ballads that make for an interesting contrast. It's good to hear that Portishead didn't take the easy way and rehash what was done 10 years ago, they reinvented themselves with excellent results.
B007FTZDN8|5|TED is &#34;THE BEST&#34; in personal development, inspirational and motivational talks on the internet. Every talk I've listened to has always brought me new insight and better understanding of human behaviour. I have a Master's degree in Organizational Behaviour and have found so many uses for training and inspiring individual development from this resource. It is truly one of the most valuable asset you will have access to on the net.<br />~Bob Bernardi
B00MZ3WKQC|5|All is incredebly super.
B005ZOBNOI|5|This heart wrenching book is a must read books for young adults! John Green steals your emotions and makes them go on a roller coaster the entire time! Simply amazing.
B00A9ET4MC|4|A very interesting novel.  It was somewhat difficult to follow, but I think my difficulty was that I was using the Kindle version and I am not very adept at going to different sections.  While the story and characters are interesting, I'm not sure that all of the detail included was really necessary. The protagonist was &#34;nicely&#34; complex.  But was the ending really realistic ?  Were the star-crossed lovers really likely to be together at the end?
B003DNN0L2|5|One of my sons favorite movies!
B00E9A656K|3|Good app. Would be better is the game had steering capability but the shifting action seems accurate. Good storyline and graphics.
B004Q3RKH8|5|I hated this when it 1st came out. Now... I'm shocked by how good it really is. It has aged well
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Excellent series with Great acting cinematography, and drama. Can't wait for Season 4.  Please make season 4 available now as each episode airs.
B00BWQW73E|3|This was a fairly readable business book about the creation and the early development of Amazon.com.<br />To a certain extent, it filled out some of the gaps in my understanding about how the idea for the original on-line bookselling business was conceived, financed and launched.  It also offered some biographical information about Jeff Bezos which I did not know and found interesting.<br />Unfortunately, that is about all the book did for me and a lot of it was, for me, fairly dull reading which required a certain amount of patience to get through and offered little understanding of the nature of the problems Bezos and his colleagues must have faced or how they dealt with them.  Many of these problems were referred to, but it seemed to me they were dealt with very summarily and I got little insight from their descriptions.  There were too many names referenced and there was too little substance associated with any of them except, perhaps, Bezos himself.  It was a veritable river of people moving through the organization and not much sense of what they were actually doing, what difference it made and why they were leaving (when they did).  Especially after the business began its very rapid growth and began to move into a multitude of new areas, I was unable to understand (in an overall way) what was really going on and I had no idea how Bezos was able to understand it (although I am firmly convinced that he did).<br />That is a criticism I suppose I make of most business books (and most biographies for that matter).  They are full of facts, names and dates but seem to me to provide very little understanding about the nature of the problems that are being described or the actions that are taken.<br />As a long-term Amazon shareholder, I am very interested in this company and even fascinated by it.  I want to know more about it, but to date the only really interesting information I seem to be able to find about it comes from the annual Letter to Shareholders from JeffBezos, himself.
B0029358GM|3|slow moving album.  about five good songs on it not bad but not their best effort but bull black nova and youll never know do a good job of making this a purchase i am pleased with.
B000EWDJ3O|5|I loved \\"Blade Runner\\" when it came out to theaters, it's one of my favourite movies, and I was looking for the book since a while, it was fantastic, I understand the changes for the film version, but the book is no less than thefilm. I enjoyed it very very much.
B00JB3MVCW|2|Wasn't what I envisioned this epic should have been...
B00KDKM58C|2|Having been around for the \\"real deal\\", I wasn't too thrilled with this.  I wish I had listened to the cuts first.  Just didn't care for their voices.  Especially the high one.  LOVED the real deal
B000002A46|4|GOOD
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Such a great show!  The acting is amazing.  The storyline is incredible.  Wish there were more shows out there like this.  I'm hooked.
B000QCS8RY|5|I have always enjoyed this fast paced peek at life in olde England. Very insightful of the times as well as somewhat whimsical at times. I truly felt I was inside the story experiencing life at a time women were little more than encumbrances. I believe this would have been considered rather daring and racy for its time. Excellent read.
B0069G5Z9K|4|I love this app it's awesome and reminds me of Nintendo, but I got a motorcycle and it said &amp;#34;bad a**&amp;#34; I was ok with that until my 8 year-old brother played it. I think it's ok for people over the age of 12.
B004LWZWGK|5|As expected
B002VPE1WK|5|A very high quality bag for your DSLR, lenses and accessories. I use a Crumpler Five Million Dollar Home bag for my day to day shooting - A DSLR body and a couple of lenses and accessories. But there are many times when I want to carry much more than that - 3 or 4 lenses, a battery grip, a reflector, a speedlight, cords, extra memory cards - and carry all this gear safely and comfortably.  This bag is compact, with great ergonomics but cavernous in capacity. I had no problem fitting my Nikon D300S, battery grip and 35, 50, 70-300 lenses and a SB-700 speedlight. The pockets easily hold a folded reflector, ND filters, memory cards, lens caps, straps, etc. The Velcro dividers allowed easy customization of the main compartment for snug and safe storage of each piece of equipment.    The padded shoulder and waist straps give a very comfortable and secure carry with 15-20 pounds of gear.   This bag lacks some higher end features like a rain cover or more flexible outside storage of a tripod or attach point for other bags and pouches. But considering the price and utility of this bag, that's an acceptable compromise.  Highly recommended!
B007SYWFRM|5|my girls love ice age so naturally they wanted to play.  only downside is they want my kindle all the time.  lol
B004T32SOK|5|I have been using &#34;Dropbox&#34; for quite some time and look forward to using this version as well. I love that you can save many items and synch with all of your technology that has it installed. If you store lots of data you may be required to pay a small amount, but if you're like me and store a minimal amount it is free.
B00AREIAI8|4|Had a bit of trouble figuring some stuff out without any instructions, but the 2 and 5 year old loved playing with the horse. Being able to play off line was a big plus. Caught myself playing after putting them to bed!

B0009R1T7M|5|Only time will tell if Sufjan Stevens manages to churn out enough albums for all fifty states. Since 2003, he's covered only two of the states. Maybe he can combine some state names...<br /><br />But whether or not he covers the whole USA, Stevens' will keep charming people with his music, as he does in his latest album \\"Illinoise.\\" And no, that is not a typo. It's sort of folk -- dreamy acoustic pop, with songs about aliens, God, and wacky interludes. This is folk music for the Wes Anderson fans.<br /><br />It opens with a dreamy intro about a UFO, written in elusive language that could hint at either aliens or a religious vision. Your pick which it is, but Stevens' sweet voice and birdlike instruments make it sound ethereal... before it switches over into the choral singing and inspiring horns of \\"Black Hawk War.\\" By the time it's over, you'll feel like saluting.<br /><br />Stevens uses that as a springboard for lighter material -- inspiring rock anthems, mellow acoustic music, and vaguely ominous balladry. Some of the songs wouldn't be out of place at a down-home barn dance, and others are sparkling indie bliss. And yes, some songs dabble at both styles, like the sweeping dancey \\"Man of Metropolis.\\"<br /><br />By the last stretch of the album, Stevens switches over to a folk-dreampop style, with cute little interludes between the songs. \\"They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!!\\" wins for most unique title, but it also shows Stevens off in his eerie folk best. It's a sound that continues its melancholy way, right to the end -- the sparkling \\"Out of Egypt.\\"<br /><br />Yep, \\"Illinoise\\" is one of those albums that qualifies as an experience -- it's the sort of music that transports you away, and doesn't set you back down until it ends. Though it borders on maudlin in places, Stevens' songcraft and musical skill are enough to make every song on this album a treasure.<br /><br />Stevens has your basic folk voice, but he uses it with such sweetness and smoothness that he sounds amazing. Sometimes he just sings as is, and sometimes he lets the chorus of backing vocals swell up behind him, singing harmony to every line. And then there's the music, which adds further harmony to his vocals. Ah yes, the music. It's a colourful patchwork of basic folk -- acoustic guitar, drums, bells, horns, piano and what sounds like a xylophone. It's bright in some places, dismal in others.<br /><br />And it's full of Stevens' bittersweet lyrics, where he manages to make us pity a serial killer, mourn a city's passing, and wonder what those lights in the sky are. He has a definite way with words (\\"i can't explain the state that I'm in/the state of my heart... he was my best friend\\"). And though Stevens often plays coy about the spiritual undertones of his songs, the passion in them is undeniable (\\"In the tower above the earth, we built it for Emmanuel....\\").<br /><br />It's going to be hard to top the eerie folk of \\"Illinoise,\\" but Sufjan Stevens will undoubtedly do it. Whatever state he chooses next. Bittersweet and beautiful.s is, and sometimes he lets the chorus of backing vocals swell up behind him, singing harmony to every line.

0140288503|4|I enjoyed reading Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down immensely.  It is a very well researched, fast paced account of the United States military's doomed battle in Somalia.  Bowden is a great story- teller and a meticulous researcher and I enjoy his books very much.  However, I feel that in his recreation he left two very important points out of the story.<br />I might be nit-picking, but I think that these two details are pretty important to the story.  I do not claim to be a military or world affairs expert, but I read Black Hawk Down, watched the movie, and watched the documentary about the battle on the History Channel.  In the documentary on the History channel, they raised these two points I am talking about.<br />First of all, Bowden makes it seem like the raid on Aidide's compound came about because of one specific event, the capture of Aidide's money man by the United States.  The truth of the matter is that the tensions between the US and Aidide built for several months before they exploded into this battle in Mogadishu.  Originally, there was a terrible famine in Somalia and the UN was sent in to bring food and supplies to help the citizens of Somalia.  Somalia's most notorious war-lord, Mohammed Farah Aidide, and his men began to intercept UN food shipments at gun point and take them for themselves, leaving the people of Somalia to die of starvation.  This is where the US involvement came into play.  The US committed troops to track down Aidide and after a series of raids they managed to capture a few of his top men, but not him.  Over the course of several weeks tensions mounted while the raids were taking place.  Aidide had the Somalis whipped into a frenzy with his diatribes against the United States.  After the UN leveled a building in which several of Aidide's top generals were meeting killing them and several innocent civilians without any questions asked, the Somalis wanted American blood.  I do not think that Bowden did as good a job as he could have in explaining the background events that led up to the battle in \\"Mog.\\"  After seeing the documentary on the history channel I had a better idea of what actually happened.<br />Secondly, Bowden fails to mention one very interesting tidbit of information.  Aidide's own son was part of the peacekeeping force sent to Somalia by the United States.  He task, as assigned by the government, was to hunt and kill his own father.  After Aidide's assassination, a few years after the \\"Black Hawk Down\\" incident, his son returned to Somalia to take his father's place in leading his band of Somali thugs.  Personally, I thought this would have made for a very interesting subplot.<br />On the whole, Black Hawk Down is a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone that likes a fast-paced real life drama.
B00JAQJMJ0|5|I love the harmonized modeling at the beginning - an interesting story.
B001M5UDGS|5|There's not enough good things that can be said about Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog.     It's simply stunning.
B002ZG997C|2|Purchase the DVD because it had a Chinese Crested dog in it.  Once I got the movie and watched it I was pleasantly surprized.  Very good film.  Video of the Chinese Crested lasted about 2 seconds.
B00127RAJY|5|I didn't weigh myself at the start of the Shred but reckon I stood at 90kg.<br /><br />This is my second go at the Shred. I quit the first time to protect my knees (thinking I would first shift some kilos using Slim in Six and then attempt it again). This time round I have decided to not give up unless my knees give out. I plan to do it five or six days a week; two weeks per level. I'm adding Leslie Sansone walks (so that I don't have to diet), 10 Minute Solution ab workouts and plenty of stretching.<br /><br />As for my diet, I don't really deny myself, but I like healthy food, so I think I eat well most of the time.<br /><br />WEEK ONE: A week ago, my waistline measured 36.5\\" and hips about 50\\". I was thrilled to see my waistline shrink to 35.5\\" and hips 49.75\\". When I did Slim in Six --- I lasted four weeks on that --- I was losing a half inch a week so losing an inch is a huge accomplishment, and in only five days.<br /><br />WEEK TWO: Waist - 34\\" (I'm stunned!)  Hips - 49\\"<br />Instead of adding two miles this week I did three, and on Wednesday actually interval trained with [[ASIN:B002MY53QI Leslie Sansone's 5K with a Twist]]! I had my last chance workout yesterday (Saturday) which comprised of a 5-min warm-up and then 10 minutes of abs, Level One and Leslie's Three Fast Miles. Last Saturday I was dying using a two-mile. I hoped I could do three a week later with gusto but I was still dying! However, my performance has definitely improved and whereas I can't move up to Level Two just yet I'm almost ready to keep up with the girls (I follow both, depending on the move itself).<br /><br />PS: My knees are doing much better than when I started; I'm glad I didn't use them as my excuse to not Shred.<br /><br />PPS: Last week I was ecstatic to not see my belly while standing and looking down my sports bra. Today I can't see it peeping through my T-shirt! Yay!<br /><br />WEEK THREE: Waist - 34\\"  Hips - 49\\"<br />Alas! It's been sooo cold this week. I did the Shred four times, abs and three miles twice, two miles once and little stretching. I had a cream doughnut and carrot cake (on separate days!). I weighed myself yesterday (Saturday) and was well over 90kg! I want to believe I've gained muscle and maybe water (I take Glucosamine for the knees and have read it increases water retention) but I am a little disappointed that I'm so heavy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, good things happened this week: I fit into a UK 14 shirt, and my workout shorts began to ride up and down my waist. I'm STILL on my way to being shredded!<br /><br />WEEK FOUR, FIVE, SIX... I LOST COUNT: Waist - 33\\" Hips - 48\\"<br /><br />The struggle continues. I'm happy to have managed to shave off another inch although I've not exercised consistently. This slump is nothing new. My body typically rebels a month into a weight loss programme; cravings kick in and death row is more enticing than exercise. I'm trying to motivate myself with the memory of how good I felt after working out and on Sundays when I measured myself. Jillian once said via podcast that when the slump happens, one should give oneself permission to take a break. Although her slump lasted seven days and here I am, several weeks later, still slumped.<br /><br />UPDATE: I give up. Kinda. I have now progressed to Level Two, albeit never mastering Level One, because I hoped that the novelty would keep me going. But Level Two is just so hard that I've decided to stick to Level One and add other DVDs to make a rotation. Maybe I'll try all three levels some time in 2011... and I'm STILL on my way to being shredded!<br /><br />UPDATE, JANUARY 2013: I did it! I finally did all three levels of the 30 Day Shred! I only barely mastered Level One, but I'm happy with my performance on all levels because I did things I never thought I could do! I am still very heavy, about 95kg, so I'm positive that the lighter I become, the better I will perform.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I only lost 2kg in the four months I Shredded, and I'm still wearing my regular clothes. I was hoping to be much further along. This time my diet was not good: too many carbs, not enough protein. I've only just corrected my diet, but after four months of the Shred, I've moved on. I still recommend this workout because it does work you out and improve fitness. I believe my results were atypical.

B0000AQS0F|5|Unfortunately, I didn't get to see a whole episode of Firefly while it was on Fox, but kept running across people mentioning it after it's demise while trying to help petition getting Wonderfalls back on the air. Everyone was talking about how great it was, so I had to get the set and see for myself. Boy was I impressed! I was totally blown away! I can't wait for the movie 'Serenity' to hit the theaters this coming September (knock on wood they don't change the date AGAIN--it was originally going to come out in April, but they didn't want Serenity to get lost in the shadow of the new Star Wars movie, which is totally understandable considering how few people have heard about this awesome show)!!<br /><br />I moved to WA state 9 years ago after living in Tucson, AZ for 25 years. Every time I watch one of the Firefly episodes, I feel like I'm there again, and don't want the show to end. It's not only because I miss living there so much, but because the characters are so believable, and the show itself is extremely ingenious, incorporating the old west into a sci-fi environment. I like Star Trek, the X-Files, Dark Angel, and Tru Calling (can't forget Wonderfalls, either!), but Firefly actually tops my list for science fiction favorite, by being so innovative. I just can't find the words to tell everyone how most excellent I think it is. I also can't believe that Fox doesn't know a good thing when it has it in the palm of it's hand. Not only once, but TWICE, counting Wonderfalls.
B00436GNVC|5|I first saw her on the Later with Jools Holland show and quickly fell for her style of singing. And not to forget how easy on the eyes she is.&#34; Well Well Well&#34;, then &#34;My boy&#34; made a fan out of me.

1401324649|4|My book club has read this book.  This book was not my favorite, but all I can say is that the author surely has an imagination.
B00007L4MJ|1|I bought a copy of this film, but was disappointed to find that I couldn't watch past chapter 22-23; the image wouldn't play, no matter what I did.  So I bought another.  Same problem.  There's a line across the top of the DVD, so there's likely something wrong with it.  I'm not sure if this is a problem with every disc, but I bought 2 faulty ones.  I hope yours isn't messed up too.  The movie is 5 stars, but I give it 1 star since I couldn't finish the film due to technical problems - there is no excuse for this.
B006BGZJJ4|5|Works as expected. I am always happy with this cable as it's made well.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Chromecast is one of the best purchases I've made it a long time.  It's incredible value for the cost.  I previously had a small computer that I used as a media center complete with a wireless keyboard and mouse.  Chromecast removes the need of having this computer while simplifying the process of turning your tv into a media center.

B004EPZ07U|3|I've been a Green Lantern since I was able to turn pages of a comic book, no idea how DC thought this actor<br />was Hal Jordan.  No depth to the characters, it was all about the CGI, hence why it failed at the movies.  Just can't believe<br />they did what they did, GL could have launched the JLA like Iron Man had done for the Avengers.  Oh well.. reboot time.
B009NQKXYK|3|I was really hoping for more aliens.  It's kind of related to the other Alien movies, but just barely.  I feel they could have done more to connect it.  It was okay, especially if you like sci-fi like I do.

B002UM5BXW|3|If you like Anthony Bourdain on his TV shows then you will like this book.  He tells the ins and outs of trying to be a Chef in New York city.  He gives his back story and shows us all the mistakes he has made in the restaurant industry.  It can be funny and interesting.  Anthony is a good story teller.
B00A6PD9I4|4|Great kids family movie
B008C20TDG|5|I found the book easy to read and very informative. Looking forward to better eating and health for my family and me!
6303269826|5|I had to watch this movie for a class I'm taking on media.  We had to compare it with other movies that covered the gun fight at the Okay Corral.  This one, according to court documents from witnesses is the most accurate.<br />I think that the effect of this movie was really hurt by 2 versions of the Earp brothers and the gun fight at the Okay Corral coming out within about 6 months of each other.  The other movie being &quot;Tombstone.&quot;<br />It was pretty gory compared to other movies about Wyatt Earp and is battle for revenge/justice.
B00AIBZLVY|4|I have to admit it, I liked \\"Mama'.<br /><br />In recent years, I've really gotten away from the gorier horror films that favor blood and body count over story or character or plot (with some exceptions, and this conversion is I think mostly to some of the more - and greater - Asian horror flicks I've fallen for).<br /><br />Just one reason, flawed as it is, that I really enjoyed 'Mama'. Sure, it goes for the cheap jump scares, but for me most of those still worked to great effect, and I found the film more than a bit creepy at times. The performances of Jessica Chastain and the two little girls really make the film, and even with the occasionally obvious CGI - and the plot holes that the film leaves behind - I was still greatly entertained and even loved the bittersweet ending.<br /><br />Kind of similar to the way I felt about 'Darkness Falls'; if you liked that one at all, you should like 'Mama'.

B0067RQYNW|5|This app works great and I can access my Microsoft Word documents with ease through the SkyDrive.  I have some password protected documents written in Word and I couldn't open them with Microsoft Mobile office app or SkyDrive app. There was no where to input the password. Plus I couldn't make any edits. With Kingston Office, I can access my protected documents with my password from my word document.  I haven't fully used the app, but I have done some editing through it on my kindle.  This works well on my kindle and on my Samsung Galaxy S4.  This app works well for me.

B00K3Q0SX0|4|Music is just great.  I'm a big fan of this Band.  Being picky here.  On my copy of the double CD, the track listing on the cover AND BOTH labels, do not correspond to the way the tracks actually play.  Just a small thing; but to get it wrong on the cover and the label?
B00BSBR9N6|4|If you are looking for a light, fun summer read I would recommend The Rosie Project especially if you are a fan of the TV show Big Bang Theory. This book is based on the premise that a character with very few social skills (such as the show's character Sheldon) designs a project to find a wife. The ending is very touching. I would have given it 5 stars but the beginning is a little tedious. If you hang with it, I promise you there are parts of the story that will make you giggle out loud.
B00E8KLWB4|5|Love this game on many levels.  Has great graphics and different levels of difficulty to keep my interest.  This is the best hidden object I've played.
B009UX2YAC|4|I feel that it does have the same meaning as temple run it has more characters, boards,updates and better graphics so instead of having black monsters running after you you have a police cop because your graffiti some trains in temple run your running out of a temple with a artefact and black fingers that look like shadowy monster chase you and you turn the screen to go right or left in subway surfer you flick the screen to go side to side and get coins: the only things I request is that the coin for people and boards is to be lowered so there just a tad more Easyer to get. Other than that it a great game
B001NIA27E|5|Love this movie
B003G4W49C|5|I loved this story. The Characters were strong and interesting, and the story line was compelling with a strong narrative drive. From one scene to the next, I couldn't stop turning the pages. This was a fun-filled, excellent read, and I'm happy that I took the time to check it out.
B004J4WNL2|4|Yes, I prefer an hour with a book to an hour with  most people that I have to spend an hour with. And GOOD for me !!! Thank you for telling it like it is !!!
B00AZMFK3K|5|My hubby and I went to see this in the movies. We enjoyed the movie, but sometimes the movie goes so fast, that I get lost in the storyline. As soon as we received the movie from Amazon, we waited for a quiet moment, and put it on. Now we can appreciate the storyline, and since we are both Star Trek fans, I am sure this be a keeper! Good Movie!
B002VECM4A|4|It's an intelligent movie of modern incest in a factually disfunctional Afro-American family and unaction of paid for taking actions against such deeds.
B001HNE3NO|5|Historical fiction is a good way to learn about and retain information about certain periods of history.  I learned a lot about the life of the Jews in France during WW II and the period leading up to the war.
B00181JGI2|5|this movie entertained me a bit when i was a silly teenager, drinking and having no responsibilities, and i had largely forgotten it. now there is a bunch of hype around it with mixing it with taoism and zen.<br /><br />so i re watched it and was enthralled. the dude's attitude toward life, his ability to let go of things and remain cool is inspiring. something i couldn't see when i was young. to be an adult and maintain his attitude on life is a really amazing feat! i'm now a drug and alcohol free devout buddhist and i saw a whole different film! i have lots of responsibilities and am always trying to focus on the dhamma to keep my mind free but i was too uptight with my overall attitude, watching this movie inspired me to relax a lot more.<br /><br />do i agree that the dude is a zen master? um... no, i do not. he smokes pot and drinks alcohol all day, lies, and speaks harshly.<br />i suppose the dude could be the 70's definition of a hippie zen master though he is not a zen master in the classical sense.<br /><br />could he be a taoist master? sure, why not, that is an extremely vague concept so pinning it down is nearly impossible. read the tao te ching and some chuang tzu. they're all over the place! the dude could fit right in a story from the chuang tzu no problem!<br /><br />however are there zen elements in the film? definitely! the whole attitude of just letting everything go is very zen. especially of not taking things personally, being neutral and non violent, living in the moment and not over thinking things. i mean they are in a heap of trouble and decide to go bowling! that's very zen lol!<br /><br />very great film. i'm picking up the new book from the library today. \\"the dude and the zen master\\" jeff bridges and bernie glassman. after reading an interview i now think jeff is probably a really cool guy in real life and this bernie glassman guy sounds like a class act, a real example of zen! both are people i would like to learn more about.
B00631VJIC|5|I bought this for my husband who is a huge Sons of Anarchy fan.  Kathy Seagal was especially good. House of the Rising sun was the best he ever heard including Bob Dillon's version. Strongly recommend this for Sons fans.
B0063GORYU|5|Great game
B00FMQIMZ2|5|he love them
B00127RAJY|3|I would have given this exercise workout 5 stars were it not for the terrible DVD production. My reasons on the downgrade: [(1) You can't fast forward to where the exercise workout actually begins--you waste quite a few minutes for that to run through itself; [2] you can't hit \\"Top Menu\\" on the remote to get to the workout immediately; [3] the editing job was pretty bad--even if you are in sync with timing, when the on-screen scene changes, the people are not doing what you are doing; and (4) the music leaves a LOT to be desired, and doesn't match the rhythm of the exercising].    The workout in general is very good, and I like Jillian's no-nonsense approach (the same as her demeanor on the TV show, although perhaps not as forceful, but still effective). I liked the fact that I could actually see the other 2 women (the harder way and the modified method) at the same time. I am in my sixties, and found the first 2 workouts to be good, but definitely not hard or particularly  challenging. I don't even sweat for workout #1 on a 96-degree day. (I have  exercised daily for years, using many exercise videos and traditional forms of exercise, plus working out at a gym.) But I did like workout #3--that got me sweating. I rotate the workouts (a suggestion other reviewers have recommended).
1932907009|5|Save the Cat! might well be the last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.  Mr. Snyder not only provides a Beat Sheet with a universal structure that's practical and the most useful in generating story since The Hero's Journey, he guides the writer from the spark of an idea through troubleshooting your finished manuscript.  Snyder presents familiar, contemporary, relevant examples to illustrate straightforward principles.  His \\"laws of screenplay physics\\" show you how to create a sympathetic hero, painlessly work in exposition, keep your story believable, and more.  For novelists as well as screenwriters, here's your toolkit.  If I had to limit my recommendation for the writer's essential library to three books, they would be Bird by Bird, The Writer's Journey, and Save the Cat.
1612130283|1|I just finished 50 Shades of Gray.  I read it in two days, so at least i didn't invest too much time in it, because if I had invested more time, I would not be happy!<br /><br />This book is seriously written on a 6th grade level (not that I would want a 6th grader writing it, just saying the level of writing).  It was very simplistic.<br /><br />The thing that annoyed me the most though was the repetitiveness of words and language.  I mean how many times  was \\"Oh my\\" used?  \\"Breath Hitched\\", \\"Holy Hell\\".  I mean come one!<br /><br />it was very predictable.  They see each other, they have sex.  That's about it.<br /><br />Pretty pathetic.<br /><br />There was no depth at all in to the psyche of Ana.
B00BVYNSLC|5|Maslany does a great Job acting multiple parts. Suspenseful, an Orphan Black marathon is in order.
B000FC2L1Y|5|Wonderful book. Read it 3 times over past few years. Highly recommend it & all Outlander books written by Diana Gabaldon's.
B00IXHBS6M|5|The best Bass/Drum combo that I have heard. Throw in talent on an awesome guitar and vocals Wham Bam What hit me. Led II
B00003CXCD|5|No point in getting defensive about someone else's opinion, but Robert Horton (Amazon.com essential video) is considerably off the mark with his assessment of the casting of Gregory Peck.  Gregory Peck's stiffness as an actor was always part of the package -- can't change it, or the whole persona falls apart.  He's perfect as a foreign news bureau reporter, with a self-consciousness that fits the character to a &quot;T&quot;.  Mr. Horton suggests Cary Grant, who would have been 'way too slick and charming.  As for William Wyler's direction, it's a perfect pairing with Peck's performance.  Though Wyler was never afraid of a jump-cut, and the staging and continuity are a little ragged, we have to remember that this thing WAS filmed on location in post-war Italy, so it wouldn't have been the most trouble-free shoot.  The actor who plays the hairdresser who snips the princess's hair early in the picture is a gem.  As to Audrey Hepburn, this was the first time she rolled out that performance that she would essentially repeat again and again for the rest of her career.  It was a limited bag of tricks, but each gesture, each look, each line delivered with that accent, was miraculous.  Do I adore Audrey Hepburn?  Yes I do.
B00D2K40WY|5|It was the first time I really like this one. But you have to get the real thing. Love It
B005LAIH2W|5|A wonderful sci-fi thriller with some interesting twists and turns. I think most viewers will say this was well done and entertaining!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I really love this game because like it's really addicting and is gets me all hyped up. 😜
B00HDMMISA|5|Amazing story, just like all her other books I was sucked in from the beginning.  I couldn't put this book down and I can't wait for Moriarty's next book.
B00BUCXVPI|4|I enjoyed the movie in spite of Tom Cruise' s  one dimensional acting
B00AHSIQWE|2|I thought it was very confusing at the beginning. Very slow start to get to the plot of the true story
B0089EHWQE|5|Beautifully written,  This story took me through the whole range of emotional experiences. I laughed and I cried and wished I could have written the ending.
B00E9A656K|5|I like this game because it gives you something to work to. I like the graphics as well. I just wish there where a Subaru in the game. Other then that it's a good game all around if you ask me.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Enjoyed the suspense, liked the way it was written.  Would recommend it to a friend
B00012FXB8|3|This would have been a good stand-alone movie, but isn't a worthy sequel to the excellent &quot;Aliens&quot;.  There are too many plot twists and suppositions that aren't believable from the ending of &quot;Aliens&quot;.  For example, how could Ripley have been impregnated inside the ship when the queen Alien was never inside the ship?  <BR>Getting back to the suspense and thrill similar to the first film is one of the redeeming qualities to this film.  There are several instances of genuine fear in the film.  The cinematography is very good, and adds to the &quot;spookiness&quot; of the film.  The alien looks a bit different than in the first two films, also.  <BR>I don't think this is a worthy sequel to the two top-notch films that preceded it.
1608198065|5|A masterwork of humor, angst, fear, dread -- & of all the anxieties that chisel away at each of us. In a weird way, &#34;Can't We Talk...&#34; is reassuring, not depressing: an indelible reminder that none of us are alone in this vale of tears. Even after we're left alone...
B0000668IF|1|18 is a complete 180º from Play.  Where Play kept you on your toes, 18 will barely keep you on your feet.  Most of the CD is ambient filler with monotone vocals.  Gone are the body rockin' beats and groves that kept Play alive and the listener glued.  Track 9 was the only one that was palatable.  18 is a big disappointment for Moby fans.  Every song on Play was an individual creation.  The only way to tell if your listening to a different track on 18 is when your CD player differentiates it.  I think that Eminm has it right when he said that Moby is done.  If you like your beats consistent and repetitive this is the CD for you.  It is not for me...
B00B0LPWU6|2|Heard a lot of buzz about movie.  Thought the basis of movie was good, but overall story line was quite depressing.
B0050ZPAPA|4|I've just started reading the Iron Druid books by Kevin Hearne and have totally got lost in the story! Well written; engrossing plot that develops at a pace you can keep up with; action is spaced but exciting; finding it hard to put down the book at a reasonable hour. Have read about 10 books in the last few months trying to find another as engrossing as the likes of Anne (& Todd) MacCaffrey, Terry Goodkind, Terry Pratchet, Jim Butcher, et al.<br /><br />So glad there's more books after the first!<br />Thank you Mr Hearne,<br />Kath
B006PAZMMK|5|Love it!!
B00HGJ18C2|5|Great simple game
B008QPCCQQ|5|I must have read Little Women 10-20 times as a child and cried every time I read it.  The relationship between the sisters is so touching.  It wasn't until much later that I made the connection with the Civil War, and reading it as an adult made the story even richer.  This book is a wonderful read aloud to middle school and high school students studying the Civil War time period.  I highly recommend reading the book before watching the movie.  The movie is great, but cannot begin to touch the emotions portrayed in the book!  The other works of Alcott as also as touching.  I loved Eight Cousins and Rose in Bloom almost as much as Little Women!
B00DHQHAH0|5|The show captivated my attention throughout the season and the development of the characters helped the plot progress. Loved it.
B000ASATYO|5|This is a funny and endearing movie with Michael J. Fox, one of my favorite actors, as a guy who not only 'sees dead people' but employs them in his not-quite legal business!  You'll love the characters and they truly are 'characters' in the best senses of the word.  This was a gift for my adult daughter who wanted it for her collection of favorite movies to view again and again.
B0002EXH5O|5|Megadeth's 4th record is easily their best even though they've had many excellent records before and after including Countdown To Extinction, Peace Sells...But Who's Buying?, Youthanasia, Endgame and others. They've had a slight decline from 97-01 but even those albums weren't terrible. Rust In Peace has everything from their heavier thrash to their more melodic work. Lyrically it's more mature as well, most the occult-themed lyrics are gone and it take a more intelligent approach dealing with more political themes. Dave Mustaine's guitar solos were better than ever in 1990 and even more technical than on their early work. Rust In Peace takes a more progressive theme while still most of the thrash is still there. Out of their 14 album discography, Rust In Peace is #1 and possibly the greatest metal album of all time (ranks up there in my top 5).<br />Highlights: Hangar 18. Take No Prisoners, Tornado Of Souls

B007IXWL2C|5|Awesome!
B002KYHZLQ|5|I could write a book on how much I enjoyed this book and this series. It really is brillant! It is not for everyone however. The author assumes the reader is intelligent and doesn't spoon feed you information. This allows you to figure things out for yourself. Which I really enjoy.

B0001V6ZJ8|5|A drama/biography/musical from 1952? My wife just wasn't interested. But I insisted that there's no film like the original (i.e. the REAL) \\"Moulin Rouge.\\" It's a biography of the renown French artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec from the late 1890s who had very short legs and grew to stand only about 4'11\\" due to an accident and bone disease. Although he was from an aristocratic family he chose to live alone in Paris to pursue his art career. He would spend time at a local cabaret, Moulin Rouge, where he'd find inspiration for his art, as well as fuel for his increasing alcoholism.<br /><br />Although Henri (Jos&eacute; Ferrer) was brilliant artistically & intellectually, he understandably had a poor self-image due to his dwarfism, which was constantly reinforced by various mean-spirited people. Yet, he discovers love for the first time when he meets a spirited woman bred in the cobblestone jungles of Paris (Colette Marchand). Will this love enhance his life or ultimately poison him? I'll leave that for you to discover.<br /><br />INTERESTING ITEMS:<br /><br />- The opening dance hall sequences are highlighted by Katherine Kath (the redhead) and a young Zsa Zsa Gabor.<br />- Jos&eacute; Ferrer is great as the protagonist with his commanding voice and interesting dialogues. His commentaries on life are brilliant and brutally honest, but also cynical.<br />- The viewer REALLY wants to see Henri find true love, happiness and victory, despite his deformity, but his cynicalism and alcoholism sadly enshroud him.<br />- The story is both entertaining AND thought-provoking. My wife & I had some good discussions after the film. For instance, real-life people & couples that the story brought to mind, the nature of existence as \\"unattractive\\" and unloved, missed opportunities thrown in our laps due to poor self-image and addictions, being a \\"has been\\" and a \\"continue to be,\\" etc.<br />- There's another significant female character who shows up in the third act, but I'm not sure of her name (in the movie or real life). In any event, the viewer will notice that she's NOT embarrassed to appear with Henri in public like the erratic Marie Charlet. This is an important part; take note.<br /><br />Since the film is a biography it could only end one way, but I won't spoil it for you if you're not familiar with the true story.<br /><br />The film was shot in Paris and England and runs 2 hours.<br /><br />FINAL WORD: Make no mistake, \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a masterpiece. There's really nothing else like it. It's the perfect antidote to modern 'blockbuster' drek. Disregard the fact that it was released in 1952, particularly if you have a distaste for old movies, as \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is a timeless film both hugely entertaining and thought-provoking, not to mention REAL. After watching my wife expressed how much she liked the film and thanked me because she would have never chosen it on her own.<br /><br />GRADE: A+nt, the viewer will notice that she's NOT embarrassed to appear with Henri in public like the erratic Marie Charlet.

B00009V8Z9|4|Undoubtedly, this is one of the most entertaining CDs I've acquired in a long time.  Degraw's musical style is fresh and unencumbered by bravado or fake glitz.  Something about the combination of his music and voice envelopes you and carries you right into his lyrics...and that's where the trouble lies.  Because most of his message tends to reach to the core of who we are and what we know, one cannot overlook the worn and tired metaphors that litter this otherwise exceptional CD.  Like a previous writer pointed out, we've already heard about a love that \\"fits like a glove.\\"  Additionally, in the first cut, Follow Through, the phrase \\"I haven't felt like this in so many moons...\\" feels like a brick wall just as you begin to settle in and realize that he has put into words your own feelings.<br />Aside from that, though, this is definitely a great CD.  With a little maturity, and maybe a helpful thesaurus, I'm confident Degraw's lyics will soon match his other impressive talents.
1858704553|5|THIS IS A VERY ASOME ITEM THAT I PICKED 2 OF THESE ITEMS, THAK-VOU SO VERY MUCH, IF I WAS LOOKING FOR SOME SPEICAL CD PRUDUCTS AS THIS ITEM I WOULD LIKE TO WORK WITH YOU FOR THESE SPECIL EDITIONS ,AND I WOULD BUY OTHER SUCH ITEMS,THANK-YOU SO VERY MUCH.
B00UPSUYU8|3|This appears to be very helpful and useful when I need it
B00003CWNR|5|A sensitive and intelligent character-driven film, adapted from John Irving's novel by the author himself, which features truly breathtaking cinematography, a lush musical score, and uniformly excellent performances by a formidable cast which includes Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron, Delroy Lindo, Paul Rudd, Kathy Baker, Jane Alexander, and supporting Oscar-winner Michael Caine.  The main plot line centers around a young man (Maguire), raised in an orphanage headed by a charismatic doctor (Caine), who decides to venture out into the world and learns the hard way that life is not merely black and white, but many subtle variations of gray.  While this is hardly a unique theme, the characters in &quot;Cider House Rules&quot; are so exquisitely drawn, and the movie so masterfully produced, that everything which might in lesser hands seem overly familiar appears fresh, new, and distinctive.<br />The DVD offers a perfect sound and video transfer, and includes a nice selection of &quot;extras&quot;, including a documentary on the making of the film, the original Theatrical Trailer, and highlights of the television ad campaign.  Overall, the DVD is an exemplary presentation of a bona fide modern classic, and one that's well worth multiple viewings.
B005K0HDGE|5|I am stunned at how hard it was to put down this book. I feel like I walked next to Jack (the main character) and saw what he saw, smelt everything he smelt, and felt every emotion he felt. It is the best book I have read by far.
B00IHMEBDU|2|Read the trilogy, it was ok and probably good for younger readers. I wasn't that impressed or engrossed with the storyline
B00AWBYA2G|5|Great movie  i love the music.
B009LMTDL0|5|Whether you're working in corporate America, or just sitting on the local Little League Board, if you're a woman, you need to take a seat at the table. Understand that when you are assertive, others may see you as bitchy. Understand the ways you are sabotaging yourself by being too nice - or yes, not &#34;nice&#34; enough. It stinks that a woman can say the exact same thing as a man, in the same tone of voice, and she'll be perceived as pushy or bitchy, and he'll be perceived as a go-getter, but until more women take that seat at the table, that's the way it is.<br /><br />I do think Sandberg has had many advantages, from income level and supportive family of origin, to working in start-up industries with young men who are used to thinking outside the box. Doesn't mean she doesn't make excellent points for every woman who wants to succeed in business and in life. Every American woman should read this.
B004FRX0MY|5|Super thanks
B00DA6YEKS|5|This book is an excellent accompaniment to the way of kings. Keep at it even when it seems dark and dim, this author loves his characters and it shows.

B00B7Y0206|5|I think that this app is very effective because it has all the videos that I want to watch right on time and is never late with new videos. It also has everything you have on any version of youtube so I highly recommend this app.
B00B2DGYQS|5|I can only add another bravo to the positive reviews already posted for \\"Yossi.\\"  The unhurried and completely human telling of Yossi Gettelman's healing after the loss of his great love and all the regrets that went with the tragedy makes the story wonderfully credible.  Yossi's meeting after 10 years with the parents of his dead partner is heartbreaking, but is the beginning of the recovery of this wonderful and deeply grieving man.  The second part of the film--the meeting with a free-spirited young soldier who recognizes Yossi for the good man that he is a great statement of optimism and salvation and will bring a tear to the most cynical of readers.<br /><br />\\"Yossi\\" is a very fine film about a gay man and is, at the same time, a film for anyone who likes a fine film about the human heart.  Highly recommended.

B00BHMETKC|5|it was a great movie. Enjoyed watching very much. Would recomend to anyone who likes true story's that are AWESOME!
0756686970|5|We got this book for my 5 (at the time 4) year old son. Like his Dad he loves anything Star Wars, he LOVES this book. He loves learning about all the characters. It has become a nightly thing that my husband will read a couple of characters to him! Since he also has a lot of Star Wars lego sets, he is now able to name most of the characters he has and he also includes a little fact about them :-). Great book for any Start Wars fans.
B00EK0UBPU|3|I rated this book three stars because the story line was great, the reading of it was a marathon and the ending left me feeling a bit cheated.<br />I had to keep going back to check on who each character was (this coming from someone who can easily follow Tolkien's epic mythology and myriad characters.)  I'm also a New Zealander so the geography and the history was most familiar and I loved the historical picture of Hokitika and the gold rush community.<br />I think the word I'm looking for is ponderous and perhaps I was expecting more from a such highly rated book.  Also unless you are into astrology that part of the book is just wasted because a novice (like me) on such matters can't understand it  - if you're going to put a clever little hook (and it is clever) like that to 'bind' your story it would have been very interesting if there had been a key to understand it.<br />I would recommend it to anyone to read as a great concept but I found too long winded for what it is and it doesn't start to pace well until 3/4 into the book.
B007HUD6OS|5|Love all John Grisham books and truly enjoy  These.  I will continue to order more books from all his writings in the future

B00IG2DOKM|4|When I started this game, I figured it would be like Cityville with a lot of quest to do,but thankfully it isn't. I like being able to interact with friends. Some of the time limits on factories making items is a little too long on somethings, and you don't have to have energy to harvest or collect items from ships, or factories. Great time passer. I don't play a lot of games, but this one has nice graphics, and the animals are so cute.
1591843162|5|If you pass on reading this book, you will most certainly state sometime in the near future - \\"Gee, I didn't get the memo.\\"<br /><br />If you are anything like me, you read non-fiction books with your learner mind and usually when the topic falls somewhere on your radar screen.  Linchpin found me like a heat seeking missal and I quickly joined the few thousand other people who donated the price of the book (or more) to Seth's choice non-profit organization - The Acumen Fund.<br /><br />A little background on where I'll be coming from in this review:  my maiden name is Lynch - so my entire life I heard `lynchpin'.  I decided early that I liked being a linchpin - I did things differently, things that were meaningful to others - as a way to earn it and own it.  So, full disclosure - I'm already biased about linchpins.<br /><br />I've only been aware of Seth Godin for about seven months.  I signed up for Seth's blog after one of the coaches in my master mind group mentioned his name along with one of his stunning quotes.  At first I was amused with his daily blog.  Soon, I became pretty engaged as I had become a student of permission marketing via the internet when I decided to self-publish and self-promote my first book.<br /><br />But now, with Linchpin, Seth Godin is completely in my head.  Not only did I connect with the title Linchpin, but the subtitle - Are You Indispensable? - literally rocked me to my core because it immediately connected with the message in my own recently published book - \\"you must become an irreplaceable talent to thrive in the global 21st century.\\"  More disclosure.<br /><br />This might be semantics but this is one term where I depart with Seth. I've actually been on record to say that it used to be about being indispensable and today - it's about being irreplaceable.  The old connotation of indispensable infers to me that a worker is awarded that description because of what they do for a company or a particular employer that creates value, but it isn't necessarily transferrable to another company or employer if things go bust.  You can't outsource Bono, so his art is irreplaceable.  You could replace him with a warm body - someone who can sing, but would you try?  Certainly not. The over-the-phone customer service person who's ability to calm an irate caller, gain their trust in a matter of seconds, fix their issue, and sell more as a result of earning even more loyalty - this person is irreplaceable - because any number of employers would clamor to have them on the team.  Again, you could replace them with another person and train on the process - but you can't replace the value this linchpin created. This is irreplaceable talent.<br /><br />I finally put Linchpin down after the week it took me to finish reading and I am elated that Seth Godin was able to quiet his Lizard Brain and finish and publish this book.  If you believe like I do that a worker renaissance is upon us, Seth just moved the ball substantially forward for you and me.<br /><br />Linchpin is a gift to humanity.  The book is before it's time which is exactly why it is a gift.  Seth brings the future to the present and eloquently describes why external circumstances, i.e. the ubiquitous workplace, `the factory' is ripe for what he is calling a revolution (like it) and what I call the Worker Renaissance.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />Post Industrial World<br />The world cares more about and places more value on unique voices and remarkable insights than it does on cheap labor and the assembly line ... The proletariat now owns the means of production ... the workers are self-organized on-line; now access to capital and the ability to find one another are no longer problems ... The factory is dead; if the factories are our minds, if the thing the market values is insight or creativity or engagement - then capital isn't nearly the factor it used to be ... Today, the means of production = a laptop computer with Internet connectivity ... Three thousand dollars buys a worker an entire factory ... The Hierarchy of Value: Lift, Hunt, Grow, Produce, Sell, Connect, Create/invent - lots of people can lift, few can sell, to create/invent is scarce and almost no one puts in the work here - this is the linchpin.<br /><br />The old American dream:<br />Keep your head down<br />Follow instructions<br />Show up on time<br />Work hard<br />Suck it up<br />... and you will be rewarded<br /><br />The new American Dream<br />Be remarkable<br />Be generous<br />Create art<br />Make judgment calls<br />Connect people and ideas -<br /> ... and we have no choice but to reward you.<br /><br />Attributes of a linchpin<br />Leverage internal forces (I refer to these as Awareness, Abundance Mentality and Adaptability) - these are available to all of us - they are choices not talents<br />Navigate without maps<br />Create value through emotional labor<br />Detach emotionally from the outcome<br />Give gifts<br />Work is art<br />Art is the ability to create change in a person<br />Give without expecting the get<br />Connect with others<br />Persevere<br /><br />More about linchpins:<br />Artists<br />Work in their strengths/talents<br />Indispensable<br />They ship<br /><br />Key Concepts<br />The Lizard Brain - part of your brain that wants to keep you in fear<br />The Resistance - when the Lizard Brain takes over<br />Daemon - the genius inside you<br />Linchpins create art<br />Gifts play big in the `greater than self' role of work<br /><br />So here's the message - Seth Godin apparently maintains the premise that everyone has talent, (genius and art) - it's the choices you make for what you do with your talent that matter.  Everyone has a Daemon, everyone has a Lizard Brain - who gets through is what counts.<br /><br />The attributes of awareness, abundance and adaptability are three that I've trio'd together - but they are clearly evident in Seth's Linchpin message.  Again - there is the choice to develop these as habits, or not.  These attributes help you quiet the Lizard Brain and let the Daemon through.<br /><br />Focusing on the give v. the get is what opens up the pathways for you to receive back - authentically and abundantly - not the other way around.<br /><br />You have to create value in your work - but it's likely that you first you have to plug into the definition of value in the post industrial world.  There is a real education here for many of us.<br /><br />There is hope here as well.  Hope that leaders, who now subscribe to the old conditions of the factory and worker model, will get this message and get on board to create more places for workers to do their art.<br /><br />Linchpin has a big message for the individual, but Seth has set the table for the greater message as well.  What if the world swelled with linchpins?  Linchpins outnumber everyone else?  What are the possibilities?  Global Prosperity?<br /><br />Bump Linchpin to the top of your must read list and buy it now, because we need you to.The Hierarchy of Value: Lift, Hunt, Grow, Produce, Sell, Connect, Create/invent - lots of people can lift, few can sell, to create/invent is scarce and almost no one puts in the work here - this is the linchpin.

B00EPMANQA|4|I enjoyed it, Ryan Reynolds is one of my favorite actors so I'm a little biased.
B00IUBXPEY|5|The second of the trilogy was as good if not better than the first. Can't wait for the final book to be made into a movie. Someone told me the third book may be made into two movies since so much happened in it, sounds good to me!
B00000IQW3|5|...I see that the price has been brought into line with similar offers.  Not sure if a new release or just new pricing, but I've placed my order!...<br />I really did enjoy this movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in sci-fi or action genres. Also the trailer park boy saves universe theme is well done with Alex's grand entrance back into the trailer park positively a blast!<br />BUT - I just wonder why this DVD is so costly? It is priced entirely out of line with others having similar features. This isn't a good trend and has so far stopped me from buying it.
B0054JZC6E|4|this is a decent game for how many you get. i got it for free so i feel it was worth it.
B00PEJG1K0|5|Absolutely love this album. It sounds fantastic, and the packaging is super cool. I love everything about it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5|I love Downton Abbey.  Every episode has high drama, with new developments and complications.  The costumes are Amazing, and the acting is top notch.  I love the sweet (and stormy) love stories threading through the plot.  5 stars!
B00KMULA6Q|5|This has to be one of the saddest movies I have ever seen! But also one of the best and most important, it tells a heartbreaking story that everyone should watch.
B00UMT83E4|5|My wife and I love OMAM and this album does not disappoint. They stay true to their sound (looking at you Mumford) while also maturing. They said their first album was about monsters and this one is about men. You definitely feel the weakness and strengths of men throughout the album. It has a darker feel to the album, but it's still a joy to listen to. Organs is my favorite track while Empire and Crystals have that great radio friendly sound. I'm not ready to say it's a better album than their first, but it's definitely not worse. Both albums are great and I'll enjoy this for years to come.
B008G8SFGO|2|Been a fan since the late 80s and like my grandma used to say, \\"You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you can't fool us all!\\" The album is not that bad, but if you're gonna dress up a couple guys in another one's gimmick and try to pretend we won't notice, it's not going to work guys (Gene & Paul). Give Tommy and Eric their own identities or take off the make-up. I'm sure these guys have their own persona's!<br /><br />MoPop
B009329ZF2|5|Great movie.
B0064MPXFA|4|i look forward to where this show is going, as it has been on for a while.  of course margulies is fantastic.
B0031RAOVY|5|Found this very enjoyable but can't watch without tears rolling down your cheeks.  Love stories that involve dedicated dogs. Try it.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Loved it.  This was an excellent book that I think a lot of people should read.  John Green does an amazing job of capturing the uncertainty of illness along with the hope and challenges of young love.
B00UN9PRIS|5|Yes, it was just what I wanted. Really fast service, also. Thanks.
B00EHMFC78|5|Compelling, great characters and falls into that category of &#34;can't put it down.&#34;  Baldacci never fails to compel readers to get involved in his stories and his fiction is always believable because he surrounds his stories with so many true facts.
B008JFUQ16|5|A Classic 2
B005CRQ4OW|5|it is a funny book for boys and girls but i can not belive that there are more diary of the wimpy kid books when i first read it made me laugh but after a while i read it  agein and i was boring
B00AQ3K8IU|5|I live that this book has some pretty unpredictable twists and turns. (Yes, I meant live nor love...once you read the book you will understand). There is some tough subject matter, having to go there with personal history of my own, I appreciate the delicate balance between being real and insensitive. I felt like it was a real depiction of what it is like to go through that experience. Loved this book,and its message.
B000T433CO|5|It will make you laugh, cry, Feel loved and on an adventure at the same time. Such a feel good movie!!!
B00005N5S5|5|This is truly a classic.  I jumped at the chance to get it on DVD.  The special features and behind the scenes are worth watching.  I never get tired of watching this, even though I know all of the lines and the plot.  Great special effects, even for today's standards.
B002HWRYJE|5|My bf said this was the only Star Trek he hadn't seen yet, so I surprised him with this. We've enjoyed this several times since I got it. Came in excellent condition.
075640407X|5|I couldn't put the book down. It's been a while since I've found a book that has entertained me like this one.I am already half way through the the second one, and anxiously anticipating the third. Mr Rothfus has topped my personal list as a writer/novelist, especially within this genre.
030758836X|5|Even the parts I did not prefer were well-written - a classic.
B000JMKTLO|5|Amazing! Keeps u wanting more. Once again, you think the story will go one way and then bam, it takes an entire different turn.
B009GEEMLY|5|I loved the special affects In this movie. I read all the comics when I was a kid. Enjoy them on the screen.<br />I will be on the lookout for more<br /><br />Richard
B00UENHBAU|1|Couldn't figure out how to play the game!
B00L9B7IKE|1|Probably a great book for some. I found it depressing and boring. Not a complete review because I couldn't finish it. To many good books to read to waste time reading about this girls alcohol and mental problems.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Fabulous read....multiple story lines all kept me wanting to know more!!!  Enjoyed it enough to download another book by this author!!
B00F35B8F8|5|Loved this movie.  Had great action, fun story, and the usual Trekkie language.  There is some good humor along the way, which I always enjoy
6305128952|5|The other reviews have covered most of the virtues of this film and need not be repeated. This movie is about as good as it gets. It is much more than a &quot;horse story&quot;, a fact that seems to have eluded the  reviewer from PA (12/14/98).  Mr. Redford was for years seen as nothing  more than a pretty face. However, the films that he turns out suggest he is  something much more. He is an artist and his movies are indeed works of  art. The reviewers here are unanimous in the view that this film is pure  excellence. All except the reviewer from Nicaragua, that is. Were that  person here, she/he would be able to vote. Talk about scary.
B0054JZC6E|5|this game is awesome it takes some work to get what you want in the game but afterawile its awesome
B004JN1D2I|5|great story, can't put it down. kindle is the only way to read!<br />kindle is light & easy to travel with, thin & takes up no room when packed.<br />no bent pages, quick back peddling for reread.<br />The book great with details for people who are following the hbo show.
B00VWQ3LQG|3|Just meh.  Graphics were good. Meh.
B007U44492|5|This is a movie that you have to really sit and watch from the beginning. It is another awesome Nicholas Cage movie. It is also another one that my 2 teenage boys just love and have watched just about every night.
B009C7ZQM4|5|This works great on my Kindle Fire HD. My Fire was running slow. I thought it might be getting &quot;bogged&quot; down and needed cleaned. It worked. I'm downloading much faster now.
B000VBJEEG|5|A great family movie that is hilarious, clean and does not talk down to adults.  All ages will enjoy this movie.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Love it!! It's an amazing game to play when you get bored. It works perfectly and I've never had a problem with it.
B007QXWV1U|5|This makes a nice addition to your editing apps.
B006MW3UZW|5|I just love this series, glad to see it again.
B00005A1PR|5|India.Arie arrives to the States with an explosion debuting at No. 10 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart....Wow!<br />I just saw a commercial for her album the other day, I liked the sounds I heard, and bought it, and can't stop listening to it.<br />India's soulful voice and rhythms give something back to the soul arena that has been missing for a long time.<br />All the songs are strong, standouts though are &quot;Video&quot;, &quot;Brown Skin&quot; and &quot;Wonderful&quot; a dedication to Stevie Wonder, and is it ever.<br />The album, the production, arrangement are top notch.  I predict India.Arie to be a star on the rise and hopefully for a long period - like Madonna.<br />India.Arie is a definite buy for the CD music collection.
0553593714|5|I got this in a short time of period, meaning fast shipping. The book is in really good conditions even though is used, props for that.
B004A8ZWW4|5|MY HUSBAND & I BOTH LOVE THIS MOVIE & WISH THEIR WERE MORE JUST LIKE IT! MY HUSBAND GETS MAD @ ME BECAUSE I THINK THE ACTOR IS REALLY REALLY!!!!!!!!! HOT!!!!!!!! NO KIDDING
B005USZML4|4|Simple entertaining read suitable for children. Written in an engaging fast paced manner that while stretching credibility does entertain and inform.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great
B00DQZT494|4|It is more durable than I would have expected.  So far it is great. It is also a great color.
B00F6Y3FKW|5|I purchased when there was reported issues with one of the CD's, but had no issues importing all the CD's.  It was well packed, so no damage to the box.  Little complaint for Columbia for the disc sleeves, but if you squeeze the sides of the cardboard sleeves you can safely get the discs out without damage.  Since most of us now play by MP3 possible disc damage won't be an issue for playing them after importing it all.<br /><br />Glad that some of the hard to find studio albums were made available.
0374158460|5|Briefly, I ended up absolutely loving Freedom, and yet I can understand how some others didn't. Some folks to whom I recommended The Corrections did not love it. I also must say I approached Freedom eagerly but cautiously especially given all the mass media hype.    What I do strongly recommend is that those who started the book, and left it early on or after a couple of hundred pages, pick it up again. You have already paid your dues, and the stories and characters take major turns after about the first 250 pages, and from there, the book unfolds beautifully. I felt the same about The  Corrections. I do agree that Franzen starts out with laboriously described caricatures, but they are caricatures whose contradictory psychological and moral impulses reveal themselves over time and in many layers, finally reaching a entirely human core. This is true even if you don't love the characters per se. None of Franzen's characters can be described as lovable. They are given to us somewhat as our birth and chosen families are -- you mostly get what you are handed out, to tolerate, reject, co-exist with, change with or somehow adapt to. That is not the same as pretending they not human beings ie caricatures (even if it is the easiest way to view them) or loving them in an all encompassing and therefore irrational way.     As the book within the book repeats, \\"mistakes are made,\\" and not reading or not finishing this book may be one of them.
B00JVZ0DQG|5|This game is awesome. The only thing I would say is drop some of the prices so we can make it far in the game and not have to wait so long. The game looks great and is a blast to play other wise.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Fun, funny and funky, but challenging. You will have a great time trying to climb the hill in your jalopy Jeep-type vehicle meeting all kinds of trouble along the way.
B00F8MI9NK|5|My family just loves this movie. It remains one of our favorites. It's a great prequel that the kids and parents will love.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I really love this game, my friends love to play it, and most of all, there are really fun and funny characters. I think you guys should get it and I think you will have cun! 😊
B00005MM01|5|Thanks for the quick response. A Donovan masterpiece. Nothing better to put babies to sleep with. I've used this record<br />for three generations now. Thanks again, D.T.
B00004X01U|5|This  is by far the best CD to come out in quite a long time  Madonna has yet again stumped the competition.Move over teenie bopers the greatest female celebrity of all time has arrived and she isnt budging.
B004JN1D2I|1|I just downloaded this on my iPad with the kindle app and while the title was in focus the pages were slightly, but noticeably blurry.  I must say though that I 'returned' it immediately with no problems, something I didn't even know you could do.
B0002W4SWC|5|I first saw this movie with my girl friend when it first came out. I pissed my pants, and couldn't stop laughing for weeks to follow. I have since bought the books and can't wait 'til Friday (11/12) for part 2 to come out. I have read the book, and can't wait what parts they will keep and take out. But do look forward to the Thailand stuff.
6304708521|1|This is one of my favorite Beatles movies..but this DVD release is nothing short of sacrilage!  The picture is grainy and horrible, the audio is rotten...they even had the nerve to drop the speed on the reprise of the title song at the end of the movie (listen....the song SHOULD be in E...it's in Eb here!) This is terrible...I'm amazed someone as reputable as Amazon even carries it. Let's hope for an official release of the movie soon.
B008Y5OWO8|5|An amazing film
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game is the best great graphics and not like the other deer hunter that's bad ill rate this 10 out of 10
0811879542|1|Don't buy this 'hardcover.' This is the worst version of a hard cover I could imagine. Its basically a board book on its first and last pages and normal pages between. I have no idea how amazon can get away with selling this as a hard cover and at this price. Press Here is a fantastic kids book that will stand the test of time but this version is a waste.
B00HAGO9H2|5|YAY it's time to.play.
0553213105|5|When my friends and I were younger, we used to watch 'Wishbone' and every time we saw one we'd say, &quot;I can't wait to read that book&quot;. Well alas, eleven year olds aren't really suited for the books interpreted mostly because of the use of 'big words'. I'll admit, when I first picked this book up, I got a little too lost in the language. The characters seemed tiresome and vacuous. But taking advice from my mother, and the incredible drive of wanting to see Colin Firth in the series, but wanting to read the book first, kept me reading. And as I read farther and farther, I liked the book more and more. The cute story of Elizabeth Bennet and Mr.Darcy really caught my fancy (sorry, still using the language). It's a story that can still resonate today. With all the crappy love series that are in publication today, it's nice to see a story that has a remarkable heroine and a handsome beau who seems stuffy and rude at first, but is found to be remarkably charming and amiable at the end. I really adore this story and I recommend it to anyone looking to get lost in a lovely tale of old.
B003O86FMW|5|Book two, two days! In between working full time, cooking and keeping up a house.  Absolutely fantastic! Can't wait to start book three!
B0098460O4|5|I don't know why I feel as I do, and cannot explain my reaction to this CD. Like a lot of people, I saw the YouTube video of Jonathan and Charlotte's audition on Britain's Got Talent.  I was emotionally affected by their story and their song. I am a 54 year old woman who has never liked this type of music before.  I bought the \\"Together\\" CD and have played it over and over.  I know no Italian, but the songs speak to me and I find myself in tears.  There is just something about Jonathan's voice that touches me.  I follow them on Face Book and care about them as if they were my children.  I've never reacted to a CD like this before. Sounds crazy, huh?  But if you read the Face Book posts, I am not the only one.  Hope they will tour the US and put out another CD soon.
B00628SJJS|5|Great movie
B00F8H0LM2|5|This game has elements from both star wars and angery birds. The characters has unique special abilities and you can buy characters using in game money. So all in all good game. (Like anyone will read this)  );
B002FVHR5S|5|Oh, I love this movie. I've seen it several times now and it never gets old. Patrick Swayze (RIP), Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo are just perfect, and the supporting cast couldn't be better. It's fun to watch and the message of acceptance is just as relevant now as it was in 1995.
B000BW7QWW|4|Really nice conclusion to the TV series.  Firefly(the series) was unlike anything else ever before shown on television and Serenity was a nice going away present.  Hopefully a sequel is made so all of us SCI-FI nuts can get goosebumps all over again. :)  It Rocked!
B00V4JJFN4|4|entertaining. some dialog is a little difficult to understand. good battle scenes.
B004SJ3BCI|5|Great game. Addicting and fun. Can play while watching TV or doing other activities.  Fun to see what configuration the pigs will come up with next. Highly recommended.
B006885LZM|5|some great personal stories dialed into this great historic mini series.
B003GCTQAE|5|My coworkers have a book group every other week for this book and it generates so much discussion that I don't think we'll ever finish it. Our current pace is 2-4 sections (1/2 chapter) every two weeks. I feel like a lot of this stuff was covered in Code Complete 2 which I read several years ago but there's still new ground being covered and a refresher is definitely warranted for some of the topics.<br /><br />I think what's most important to me is the interesting discussions we have while discussing this book and the introspection it brings to our current project.
B0013H9DPM|5|This album is one of the best Styx albums ever. Suite Madame Blue is one of the greatest songs ever, I can't believe it's been almost forty years since this album came out.
B00JGUI66A|5|NUMBER ONE GAME IN MY OPINION
B009LQKHIO|3|This book needs editing.  I can overlook an error or 2, but this book was riddled with errors.  There were many times a comma was used improperly, etc...<br /><br />Todd's behaviour was disturbing...she was coming out of an extremely abusive marriage, yet the guy she was/is attracted to is scary, and comes on too strong.  ODD.  I see no reason for him to have that sort of personality flaw.
B007SGLZP8|5|A definite page turner<br />One of his best<br />The characters are of a kind<br />Would love to see that movie
B00LEIT6K2|5|I really enjoyed this game a lot. The graphics were amazing as well as the puzzles. Good story line, helpful hints. The HO scenes were outstanding and the graphics were great with the zoom in.
B0088X7YMS|2|have the other 3..we had to see it. Hard to get behind Animated Drama & frankly I feel asleep.
B000099T2L|4|the album is cool<BR>she did a great job<BR>i don't like her but what she did is wonderful<BR>RESPECT;Buy this album,cuz it worths your money believe me<BR>except if u don't like her like me
B006H3MIV8|5|This gets an extra star for supporting Amnesty International and another for several truly inspired covers. Three stars raised to five.<br /><br />Of course, Bob Dylan has been covered to death over the years. It seems everyone has wanted a shot at interpreting one of his brilliant songs. Unfortunately, some should restrain themselves. There are a number of covers here that are not only some of the worst covers of a Bob Dylan song ever, but among the worse sounds ever committed to a recording device.<br /><br />But fear not, most are at least average or better and there is a ton of good material for the money. If you're like me, you'll also find some truly excellent covers that will only add to your enjoyment of certain Dylan tunes. The covers by The Nightwatchman (Tom Morello), Sinead O'Connor, Johnny Cash and several others did that for me.<br /><br />I imagine a lot of people would be surprised that Miley Cyrus does a song on here, and might be even more surprised to hear that it's quite good. But really, it's the surprises that draw a lot of us to these sort of albums. Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan has quite a few - both good and bad.
B00APUYWYA|5|Non-stop funny throughout the movie. A little predictable with the love interest but it does not make the movie bad at all. A new favorite!
B00992CF6W|5|Please check out  minecraft for noobs lol fest. It is cool<br /><br />And also try out LukeMol 2001. It is YouTube channel
B00FATEJYE|4|The game is spectacular except for the bugs when you get the new challenges. Otherwise it is amazing. love it.
B007R21JJK|5|I have built a hand full of PC's now and find the Gigabyte Motherboards are solid and work right out of the box.
B000SEIK2S|1|The whole concept of 75-year-olds receiving new, amazingly powerful bodies in order to help save the world from invading galaxies ( which they were &#34;transported to via a &#34;beanstalk&#34;) inhabited by Tolkenesque beings was ridiculously incredible - even for sci if, for which one needs to suspend disbelief for the sake of the story.
B00BAXFDLM|3|Ancillary justice is a type of revenge story where the main character seeks their justice with the person, in this case hundreds of the same person, that wronged them. The writing was consistently good with plenty of action but the sci-fi and idea innovation was more sporadic. The idea of the ship AI trapped in a person was interesting and sure to attract A Clarke fans with its twist on Hal of 2001 fame and the 'she' confusion, lamented by many reviewers, was within tolerance for the usual sci-fi jargon load of the genre. It's weak spot for me was the less original world building of life thousands of years hence where beer and tea drinking folk watch live bands, pray a lot and fret over their family names - so the feel for me was sporadically good and not really in the classic zone but can see why it was shortlisted.
0385349947|5|Good book.  The author does a great job of describing all the issues that she tries to discuss. She likes to explain things thoroughly and you can tell that you put a lot of time and effort into making it very lucid and clear I recommend this to everyone it's a must read.
B006MW3UZW|3|The building and its interiors were very interesting. The high point of interest for me was seeing Maggie Smith as the Dowager. Her character was not especially interesting, but she did what she could with such a script.<br /><br />In sum, it is a dreary, over-long soap opera. Incidents that showed promise that they did not deliver were the murder mystery (Bates), prostitution (Ethyl), and homosexuality (the footman who clamped a kiss on his sleeping fellow footman).  The writers didn't develop those themes.  Watch it to see Maggie Smith, the building and its interiors. When you've done that,  skip the rest.
B007IXWKUK|5|Excellent book!!!!
B00BP4X3W2|5|Had heard this was tough to watch per the story is difficult to see.  Steven Spielberg does so well building and telling a story.  It is rated  R  for good reason; nudity and the topic is difficult, but really a must see, when you are ready.  Liam Neeson did a very good job as Schindler.

B000AJJNOK|1|yeah best album ever made if you like bad music. money goin' down the drain with this one.....
B003G4W49C|1|What wrong with ya'll?  This book sucks.<br /><br />I wasn't taken with it from the very beginning.  Then came the kiss of death.  There are hardly any girls in the program because of thousands of years of evolution has left female unable to do this man-work.  Or boy-work.<br /><br />I spot read most of the rest of the book and found I missed nothing in my assessment of this book and author.  This dude is weird and can't imagine females in fighting roles.  Can women control a drone?  Can women float around playing war?<br /><br />Let this crap go back into obscurity.
B0090EHVMC|5|My daughter really likes the songs in it.  Movie is so color full.
B002PL5GTC|5|Just as written and arrived very early, which was great because I ordered late and it was a birthday present. Ended up getting there in time for the birthday!!
0544336267|5|It is great.
B00HTYTQ5A|5|This series is a favorite.  Superbly written and delivered.  I never get bored even though I typically like shorter episodes.  I found myself wanting more even after 1.5 hours.
B007PT3QOQ|4|its cool Til it freezes up. I had to start over. would've got 5 stars if not for that. its cool though
B00CNQ7HAU|3|As usual, Mr. Grisham does a nice job of moving things along. However, you could see the conclusion coming a mile away. Nice read but not great. Colored by Mr. Grisham's view of the world..
B00O5HX3ZS|5|Different but still Neil and still good!
B00992CF6W|5|This game is so great, I play it every single day and it never gets lame. I play with my older brother, and we build houses, fight monsters, cook meet, and raise dogs.At first when you hear the name Minecraft you problay think that there are just weird mining videos but it is like 1,000 Times away from that. So I say you get the game. If I could I would give this game 100 stars! :)
0545128285|5|Being such a fan of the Harry Potter books & movies, it was fun reading the book referenced in the Deathly Hallows.  The other stories are very entertaining & having Dumbledore's input about each one is a lot of fun.  For any Harry Potter fan, I highly recommend it.
B0086700CM|5|I love this game it is a lot of fun but the part I would change is add more characters but the game is still really fun even with the short amount of characters I wish I could give it 100 stars I recommend getting it and ITS FREE can't go wrong
B00BZAJMWG|5|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. The movie has an interesting plot, and an incredible cast.  It is easy to see why Jennifer Lawrence received the Oscar for her incredible performance as a young woman overcoming many obstacles in her life. Bradley Cooper, likewise, gave an outstanding performance in his role as a man learning to cope with his issues as well.<br /><br />I especially liked being able to download this movie on my Kindle because I was able to watch it on my own time, and I could take it with me if I wanted to watch it when I was away from home. I also loved the fact that I could watch a movie with a more adult theme without worrying about my children trying to watch it too.
0618551050|5|This is an excellent book that discusses that how real progress is made in science and how some hype in some field could slow down the progress in science, as in the case of string theory and its effect on progress in physics. A must read
B00GINENG0|5|My talking Tom is so awesome I just want to play it all day.BEST GAME EVER🙌
B003TNQEF0|5|I must admit. I did not watch this movie to watch it on it's merits. I needed background noise and for some reason, picked this movie. Little did I know that I would be talking, yelling and screaming at the characters in this movie, then connecting and crying with the main character at the very end. This movie had the makings of a terrible scary movie. From your **SPOILER ALERT** reasonable main character to your &#34;extremist&#34; bible wielding  crazy woman and my hero, the store clerk guy who was the only one with balls big enough to kill her later in the move. But at the end of the movie, I found myself in a surprised position of actually liking this movie. Never have I been so animated chatting at my tablet while watching a movie!
B004A8ZWW4|5|thank you, great movie,,,,,,,,,,,
B008Y2FRFO|5|If you like the coin doer machines at carnivals when you were a kid this is the game for you. It doesn't take hours to play so doesn't,t get boring.
B00HA8WNZ0|5|Addictive and fun
B002APU580|4|I've read the book and this isn't spot on but the acting is wonderful. Ms. Knightley wouldn't have been my first choice as the heroine but she plays off the smoldering Mr Darcy very well. He would have been a great choice to play Jamie from the &#34;Outlander&#34; series of books.
B006FO3ERQ|5|Incredible novel...it took me home to my childhood and visits to family in the Prairies. Beautifully written, fascinating tale of disappointment, loss and survival. This story haunts me on many levels.<br /><br />Canadian in California

B008ASGP3U|5|I've read all the Rebus books and this is one of my favourites.  Rebus is at his acerbic best here, wrestling with age and struggling to find a way, even in retirement, to continue the work that defines him.  Like all of Rankin's books, Standing in Another Man's Grave subtly explores a core human concern, in this case the secrets and lies that are all too often a core part of family life.  Usually detective series start to run out of steam after a while, but this is not true of the now numerous Rebus books.  Like Henning Mankel and Michael Connelly, Ranking's novels transend the often banal nature of the detective genre.  The only sad thing, is that despite the vast numbers of detective writers, very few even get close to Rankin's craft.
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great to use. Shipped fast and was as advertised. Would recommend anyone to use the seller for this product any time.
B003BV8I3Q|1|Cd never played
B000FCK42M|5|Winslow is becoming one of my favorite authors. This is fiction that is based on fact. I'm not going to throw out a lot of words here. The characters, the violence, the corruption and the passion of a few people who try to do good, all come alive. Winslow talks like real people do and he nails the voices of each character. I'm a retired detective with several years of narcotics work on my resume. All I can say is read this book!
B0064MGU98|5|I admit that I am late to the game, but this is a great show. Watch it and find out for yourself.

B003JTHESA|5|The fifteenth (!) full-length studio album from England's Iron Maiden is a fantastic one. It is easily the band's finest work of the new millennium, and may also darn well be the best record they have released since \\"Powerslave.\\" Hence, this 2010 release is portentously-entitled \\"The Final Frontier,\\" but if it indeed turns out to be the last album of Maiden's career, then at least the band's fans can rest easily knowing that they went out on one-heck-of-a high note. Frontman Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound as top-notch as ever, and the band's guitarists (Adrian Smith, Dave Murray, and Janick Gers) clearly brought their A-game, as well. They let fly truckloads of crunchy, confrontational riffs, strong, propulsive leads, and solos that are nothing short of being positively astounding.<br /><br />But no matter how good the musicianship may be, the one thing that is perhaps most important, is the fact that the songwriting is much improved. Yes, \\"The Final Frontier,\\" may continue in the same vein as all of Iron Maiden's most recent albums (2006's \\"A Matter Of Life And Death,\\" 2003's \\"Dance Of Death,\\" and 2000's \\"Brave New World\\"), in that the songs are very epic and expansive. (The average song length is well-over five minutes, with several of the tracks being anywhere from eleven-to-fourteen minutes long, and only one of them clocking in at less than five minutes.) But unlike what was the case on \\"A Matter...\\", none of these tunes ever overstay their welcome, dragging on too long, and/or making the listener feel almost a little bit antsy by the time they're over. As a result, \\"Final Frontier\\" is a fully-satisfying, fulfilling, and rewarding listen. And its total playing time might be well-over seventy minutes long, but it will actually leave any hardcore Maiden fan wanting more.<br /><br />\\"Satellite 15\\" kicks the record off with a progressive drum solo followed by a fuzzy, grumbling electronic bass line, thus creating a very atmospheric and moody vibe. But then, around four-and-a-half minutes in, the song abruptly switches gears, adopting a heavy, bobbing guitar hook while Bruce's stellar vocals soar overhead. The song is not complete, however, without an anthemic chorus and a lengthy, twiddly, and positively air-guitar-able soloing section (which is well worth rewinding at least once, and listening to again). \\"El Dorado,\\" with its bass intro, catchy, galloping beat, crunchy, churning riffs, and couple of terrifically ripping, trade-off solos, (and not to mention its huge, epically soaring choruses and strong, propulsive bass line that flows throughout) is a strong follow-up. As is \\"Mother Of Mercy,\\" which starts out as a power ballad with warm acoustic guitars and supple crooning, before changing gears and trafficking in belligerent guitar riffing and another winding, shredding solo. And all the while, Bruce is heard wailing away about war, dying, and the \\"angel of pain.\\"<br /><br />\\"Coming Home\\" marries muscular guitar leads with excellent, crystalline-sounding prog-rock soloing, and tacks on another round of really memorable, soulfully-sung choruses for good measure. \\"The Alchemist\\" sounds almost like it could be a Judas Priest outtake, as it boasts a heavy, galloping beat, propulsive, chugging guitar and bass lines, fiery, shredding solos, and falsetto singing. The number is also of note for being the album's shortest song, clocking in at a relatively brief four minutes and thirty seconds. \\"Isle Of Avalon,\\" however, is not only another standout; it might very well be the set's biggest standout. It is highlighted by both progressive and heavy riffing, deliciously melodic leads, a wonderful solo section (the guitarists trade off three or four wonderfully melodic, even vaguely jazzy-sounding solos), and a steady, melodic, humming bass line. \\"Isle Of Avalon\\" is so complex, epic, and multi-faceted that it might not exactly be a tune that the listener can hum along to; but it is also one where you won't mind that it cracks the nine-minute mark (!) at all.<br /><br />But that is not to say that a song like \\"Starblind\\" is even a little bit shabby. It augments its proggy soloing with heavy, crunching licks, a wailing, ascending and dive-bombing solo, and a wealth of textbook/classic Iron Maiden-esque dual guitar harmonies. Next comes \\"The Talisman,\\" which begins as a docile power ballad for the first two-and-a-half minutes or so (meaning it has lovely acoustic strumming, infectious melodic crooning, and noteworthy lyrics.) But then the track slams into heavy, crunchy, driving territory with soaring power metal vocals and sub-speed-metal-esque pacing. Sure, there are plenty of clean, harmonic guitar leads, present here, but there are also borderline thunderous rhythms and really deft and dexterous drum fills. And Bruce's vocals are especially infectious near the end of the song. \\"The Man Who Would Be King\\" works very similarly, beginning as a dreamy power ballad before the electric guitars come thundering in, uncorking some chunky licks and a ton of shredding, melodic, and very air-guitar-able leads and solos. And so does the set closer, \\"When The Wild Wind Blows,\\" which opens with an ambient intro (complete with a pretty, unplugged string arrangement and an accompanying melodic bass line), before eventually becoming a lot heavier (around the two-and-a-half minute mark), and ripping out a bunch of fiery melodic riffs and solos.<br /><br />\\"The Final Frontier\\" is a terrifically epic, infectious, eminently memorable masterpiece with lots of breadth and staying power. As said before, it is the best piece of work that Iron Maiden have come up with since 1984's \\"Powerslave\\" (or, at the very least, 2000's \\"Brave New World\\"). A terrific effort all around from Bruce and the Boys.minute mark (!) at all.<br /><br />But that is not to say that a song like \\"Starblind\\" is even a little bit shabby.

6304936362|4|Memphis Belle, Michael Caton-Jones' fictionalized 1990 account of a real-life World War II B-17's final mission, harkens back to wartime morale-boosting films.  Like Wake Island or Air Force, it depicts the crew of a Flying Fortress taking part in the bloody aerial campaign over Western Europe - and trying to survive the last of a 25-mission tour of duty.<br />Produced by Catherine Wyler, whose father William had shot a documentary about the real Memphis Belle, this version takes familiar clich&eacute;s from World War II films and fleshes them out with fresh Hollywood faces.  Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Sean Astin (best known now as Samwise in the Lord of the Rings trilogy), Reed Diamond, and Harry Connick, Jr. are among the ten actors who portray the fictional crew of the Memphis Belle.<br />Released during the buildup to Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, this very retro movie failed to excite audiences, but even so, Memphis Belle is impressive once it gets off the ground and dispenses with expository material.<br />Set in England in May of 1943, the story starts somewhat slowly as an Army Air Force PR officer (John Lithgow) annoyingly prepares the crew and squadron for the Memphis Belle's return to the States.  The bomber has completed 24 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe.  Now the only thing standing between the war-weary flyboys and home is one last mission over Bremen.  There are the usual war movie get-to-know the crew scenes and even a quick (but not graphic) sexual encounter between one of the lads and a British lass...ho hum.<br />But when dawn comes and the bombers are sent to bomb a German fighter-aircraft factory, Memphis Belle draws the audience into the harrowing yet mesmerizing drama of a daylight bombing raid over Germany.  Here there are no Stealth fighters with laser-guided smart bombs flying with relative ease over the enemy.  Instead, we are treated to almost every danger faced by bomber crews in World War II - mid air collisions, flak, enemy fighters, and even a case of friendly fire.  Naturally, most of the havoc inflicted on the B-17s falls on the Memphis Belle, which in real life was not damaged as badly as this movie would have viewers believe.<br />The Warner Bros. DVD presents this film on both full and Widescreen formats on a double-sided single platter, making it necessary to handle with extreme care.  The image is less-than-awe-inspiring on an ordinary television or computer screen, at least for those few who caught this flick at the movie theater.  It's somewhat predictable and corny at times, but it is one of the few movies released in the past 15 years that treated its topic with an eye for accurate detail.  And while some of the shots did involve model aircraft, the filmmakers managed to round up all the surviving B-17s (in addition to a few American and German fighters), giving audiences a stirring tribute to all the aircrew who fought and died in World War II.fighters, and even a case of friendly fire.

B00008DDXC|5|I must admit even , after the first part Harry Potters - The Socerers Stone, I was very impressed with the story line. I must admit, I have refrained from reading the book  so I can enjoy the movie, and I have to admit I dont regret not reading the book a bit. Harry Potter, meets up with his old friends and the movie begins with many unexpected swirls and turns. The movie, not even for a moment stops for a breather, the action and suspence in the plot is what, keeps audiance in thier seats. This movie, is worth keeping in your DVD collection and so is its predecessor, as it is one the whole family will enjoy.
B00280LYIM|5|I read this series as a teen and I read the books to my kids now (leaving out a few &#34;scary&#34; parts. Great book for All ages!

B000YI7MRM|5|I found this movie by accidedent ,browsing around at period movies, and bought it cause I like Viggo. After \\"LOTR\\" I started looking at some of his other movies realizing he is a pretty good actor. I was not let down by \\"Alatriste.\\" Viggo plays the title charactor, a Spanish mercenary in the 17th century. There ia a lot going on in this movie and a lot of the reviewers complained about this, but I like the movie alot. Being in Spanish with subtitles did not detract at all from the story. There is action, romance and a real grittiness to this film. It also touches on some real historic events, wars in Flanders and against France. There are two love stories going on. Alatriste's love is a married actress who doesn't seem to really care for anyone and her retribution for this fits the crime. The other love story is the son of a friend of Alatriste's who was killed and Alatriste promised to take care of to the dying man. You can't quite be sure if this man's lover is sincere either. Viggo plays his charactor with very real emotions going from cold hearted mercenary to revenge seeking, then sypathetic regretful ex-lover. I was glad I took a chance on this film after reading some of the negative reviews. I never read the books so I don't know how it compares. I collect movies with period themes and especially this type and I'd put this in my list of ones to watch over again along with the series \\"The Tudors.\\"
B000002GJH|5|This is an album from'91,featuring future bands Pearl Jam & Soundgarden members(Vedder,Ament,McCready,etc...),and this is a great CD!!!You can hear grunge evolve right here.Be blown away by this music,do yourself a favor and give a listen.

B00005JMUL|5|Saw the movie at the Imax Theater.  It had so much more to it then we expected. The ride on top of the train was as if you were on a roller coaster!  Tom Hanks was an excellent Conductor.  The Santa Claus seemed old world and wonderful.  Finally we have an answer to how Santa's Sleigh is loaded. What fun! The message of the story was perfect for this time of year.

B008SAZHLQ|4|At first i couldn't put it down. I don't think I've ever read any young adult novels with Asians as the main character so that's new to me.<br />The exquisite interactions between the two of them when they just met, made me mistake it as Japanese literature. You can tell the affection just by a pull on the sleeves or the holding of hands. I do feel that actions speak louder than words in this book.<br />However the ending felt like a bit of a rush and abrupt. If that was the purpose I apologize. It makes me think the author ran out of juice.
B008EEZ64Y|4|Good book for young readers. Thought provoking.
B0094BB4TW|3|don't use it much mostly just to share pictures with the kids and pass along birthday greetings to certain people.

0743243153|5|&quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; is a book about non-conformity - being brave enough to admit that your life isn't going as well as you think it is, and finding your own path towards the truth, love, and perhaps even God.  Most people with even the most modest amount of self-awareness go through a stage whereby they challenge their own/parents/friends/societies beliefs and start to look for answers.  Few however, truly do change; instead they resign themselves to a mediocre existence of habitual worship (to God or to money) and habitual love.  This book's message is clear: do not to give up so easily, keep on searching!<br />At the time M. Scott Peck wrote the book, a main area of interest to him was Zen Buddhism, which fundamentally deals with the fact that our desires cause suffering (see &quot;The Four Noble Truths of the Buddha&quot;).  As a consequence of this, the book is a mixture of his own brand of psychology and psychotherapy (think along the lines of C.G. Jung), Eastern philosophy with a dash of Christianity thrown in for good measure.  Peck's questions and ideas are nothing new, however, he skilfully relates his own professional experiences with patients to exemplify the importance of self-understanding, so that we might break free from our suffering.  As part of this, Peck obliges us to examine the fundamental questions of our existence - what is the real nature of love? Is there any order to the universe? What is the meaning of life itself? Peck never directly gives us the answers, but does ask the questions and offers up his own theories. <br />&quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; is a good book for those searching for some truth in their life, and one that I think everyone should read at least once.  After this however, Peck clearly forgot his own advice.  He became a &quot;Born Again&quot;, started up a foundation, and gave several lectures on psychology, life, and his love of Jesus (see &quot;Further Along the Road Less Travelled&quot;).  I am not saying there's anything wrong with choosing a religion, though in my experience you develop a tunnel vision on things, which is clearly what happened of Peck.  Still, &quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; comes recommended to everyone, just realise that Peck doesn't have all the answers.
006202406X|5|Okay so many people are letting the fact that they didn't like the way the book ended cloud their judgment. It was a great book with twist and realistic. In addition, I enjoyed how the end of the book gave future update on how and what the characters were doing 2 years later to close out the book without feeling like their should have been more.
1573300403|5|I enjoyed viewing the great selection of videos on this DVD. This is a collection of videos from his number one hits and includes clips of his moon walk performance (Motown 25) and of his performance at the 1995 MTV awards. I enjoyed those the most but the entire DVD is very entertaining. I am not disappointed with anything on this DVD.

B007IXWL2C|5|I loved this book. The characters are real and lovable. The insight of Ana to be able to grasp Christian's past and Issues are brilliant.  She is a lovely person to get to know. The reader can feel his pain and her love and compassion. This is a must read.
0525953728|5|Book was a real quick read but very insightful, as a prior service member I could understand  the frustration they faced.
B00E3VTR1K|5|Galactic Energies by Luca Rossi  is a great book! I started out excited for one reason, lost that and got excited for different reasons.<br /><br /> I really liked the combination of science fiction with erotica. The concepts are great but they are the executions that really bring those to life.<br /><br /> I felt compassion and shame. I felt excited. This story really moved me. The stories are immediately gripping and frighteningly real. I was hooked from cover to cover!<br /><br />This book will change you.<br /><br />5 stars and can't wait to read more from this author
B000002H33|5|This album is a masterpiece!, this work simply defines what Metallica used to be before they became just another band. Battery, which is the first song in the album is an amazing evidence of talent and such a complex music, the guitar solos are incredible and full of melody, needless to say that the bass is at its top (by the way the last album with Cliff Burton). If you really want to get the best Metallica album, in my opinion, this is your choice.

0783117523|5|It is without a doubt one of Angelina Jolie's best work and best performance. The academy award winning actress should have won an Oscar with &quot;Gia&quot;, if only the film wasn't made for cable. An actress of the 20th Century, Angelina Jolie isn't just eye-candy, the girl can really act. Unlike other actresses, she has the unique qualities of talent and charisma.  The film is also seriously under-rated for it's directing and scripting. With every camera angle and dialogue, director Michael Cristofer made Gia come to life. From the first love scene between Gia and Linda to the morning after, the drug problem to the interview to relaunch her career and the heart wrenching choice that Gia made, choosing drugs over love is painstakingly written and choreographed.  If you love the film, make sure you read the book by Stephen Fried &quot;A Thing of Beauty: The Tragedy of Supermodel Gia&quot;, it will leave you crying.
B009ZQ8FQG|5|Great show!
B006GWO5NE|5|I like the thicker cord, so far it is much better than the others I've purchased in the pass. It is much less likely to mess up the way the others did, because of this thickness.
B000GFLKF8|5|I love Denzel Washington in just about anything, but this was a good movie with a lot of suspense.  You won't be disappointed, I promise you.
1476712042|5|This is one of the best books I have ever read!  I am actually reading it a second time through while I wait for the next three books in the series to arrive.  In short I would say:  good girl meets bad boy....they make a bet.  If he wins she has to live with him for a month, if she wins he has to be abstinent for a month.  I should mention he is lean, semi-muscular, and tattooed.  The two are in their late teens/early twenties and early college years.  I have recommended this book to many people and hope others will enjoy it as much as I have.
B007L3BMGA|1|Sorry, but this book was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. Not only was it extremely badly written - I had the impression that the author is a BIG fan of Copy and Paste - but it was rubbish and the subject had not been researched at all. The pathetic little heroine never stopped biting her lip and murmuring Holy Crap or something to that effect. The two of them only interrupted their rutting for her to blush and drink exotic drinks like pink champagne and for him to press his ever-present sex up against her hip and smile cynically<br />I even skipped through Volume 2 because I thought it must get better - it's on the best seller list. Sorry everybody, we have been conned!
0374531269|5|The courage of this boy and his experiences will live in your heart and mind.  He describes his life as a boy soldier in such a detailed and eloquent style that you can read the horrors of his life without feeling an insult to your sensitivities.  He lays his emotions bare and you love him.  I had no idea these conditions existed for children.  I am always amazed at the strength and tenacity of human beings.  This book adds to that store of amazement.  Read it, it does not disappoint.
B00EPQQ2PW|4|It was nice to have an album that you enjoy in total!  I enjoyed most of the songs.  Does not get boring on multiple listenings!
B00064ADR0|5|Saw Johnny in 72 at the Garden in NYC and man, what a show! Caught him again at the Felt Forum a year later with his brother and Rick Derringer. I own everything by Johnny and this is a classic. When I saw this edition, with a show from the Royal Albert Hall, I was most excited. I traded in my single disc copy and purchased this. The live performance disc is as good as it gets. If this gets your blood move'in (as I'm sure it will) check out some of his new \\"Bootleg Series\\" releases. There all live recordings through the past years. Some songs he has never recorded in the studio.
B007PT3QOQ|1|The game says to go to app store to update. It won't update. Had nothing but problems ever since I downloaded this game. It's looking like it's going in the trash unless this problem is fixed asap!
B00AREIAI8|4|Good game to pass the time.
B00FAPF5U0|4|Love playing this game it is very challenging and keeps your mind thinking.  Fun game to play with friend
B00E9ZATTY|5|A great family movie!  Parts of it were a little scary for the younger ones, but when you watch it before Monsters Inc. it can put things into perspective for them.  A great movie marathon night!
B008ROB9H4|4|I loved this story! If you enjoy historical romance, you'll love this too! Great cast of characters with superb acting.
B006O3MU96|1|My son asked me to delete immediately.  Thank goodness it was free or I would be really angry.  Oh well.
B00FATEJYE|5|This game is amazing had no troubles with the game I love it best game ever can't stop playing it
B000O77QD8|5|excellent
B00A7ZWUJC|2|Wished I noticed tjus wasnt tge gkean version. Nothing entertaining, cool or acceptable in the use of the n word. Wish people would wake up on this.
B000VBIGD6|5|OF COURSE WHO DOESN'T LOVE CHRISTMAS VACATION! I HAVE RUN THROUGH EVERY ONE I HAVE BOUGHT OVER THE YEARS! NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I HAVE SEEN THEM I STILL WATCH THEM & LAUGH! THE PRICE WAS GOOD & IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT IN A WHILE ………….. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR & BUY ONE! WE HAVE GROWN OLD WATCHING THIS! MY GRAND CHILDCHILDREN ARE GROWN UP & NEVER SAW IT OR HEARD IT SO WITH POPCORN WE MADE A EVENING OF IT!
B007L96VCY|5|When I bought the remasters for BOTR, McCartney, and McCartney II they all sounded pretty good when compared to the original, but nothing really blew me away. This, however, did. It's the best remastering job I ever heard on an album connected to Paul McCartney. The drums, cymbals, and the orchestrations never sounded so crisp and clear as they do now. And if there was one post Beatles album I didn't think could be improved upon with 21st century technology it was \\"Ram\\". I was wrong and I'm so glad I was because the listening experience was such a pleasent surprise.<br /><br />If you're a die hard fan this remaster is a must have. If you're a casual fan buy it anyway you won't regret it. Now I have to get the deluxe set to finally hear the mono version that people have been raving about for more years than I care to count.
B00AFROVQC|5|I'm just taking a short break to review this first in series by Morgan Rice.  I absolutely enjoyed this book which sets the stage for what is sure to become an all time favorite series of mine.  I love all the characters and the author has done an excellent job of opening each chacter to the reader.  All ready I'm rooting for Thor and Gwen.<br /><br />The author has skillfully hooked the reader in by bringing all main and marginal characters to life.  I've had no problem what-so-ever in believing the story line and the characters from the very first page.  For me, this is the hallmark of the very best in fantasy epic reading; that being the ability to lose one's self in the reading to the point that I forgot to start family dinner one night!<br /><br />I've already bought the next book and started a crock pot dinner, no interruptions tonite!  l can't wait to start the next book.  I love this author's style and method of keeping this readers interest.  Keep 'em coming Mr. Rice!
B000FCKC4C|4|Fun story.  Inspiring.  Easy read.
0446195529|5|I love the Camel Club books.  I would have liked a little more involvement of the full \\"club\\" in this book.  I would normally give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it an extra star for the Kindle pricing.    I wish the Kindle versions were more expensive than the hardcover version.  They're worth more to me because we avoid cutting down trees, the energy cost of making paper, the dioxins created in the bleaching process, the printing and transportation energy costs, the cost of fuel to ship the book to me, and finally I don't have to find a place to store the book.  If you're creative you can even share the book with family or close friends.    The lower carbon footprint and convenience of being able to carry a whole library with me are fantastic.      Amazon, please raise the price of the Kindle books!    Thanks,    Basil
B00KNOXB7M|5|thanks
B004EPZ0BG|4|It's your typical movie where the main characters...**SPOILER ALERT!** fall in love at the end. Not much of a spoiler or surprise. It did have some good humor in it though so it was enjoyable to watch.
B005LJITS0|3|This movie was okay.  It clearly sets up the possibility of a sequel which I may or may not watch but definitely won't spring to see it on the big screen.
1878424319|5|great book, great quality, great service
B005CRQ4GU|3|I thought that some parts were pretty funny, but not as good as \\"Dog Days\\" and \\"The Ugly Truth\\" . It didn't really stand out from the series. The varying plot and constant changes makes book 7 the hardest to follow. Not Kinney's best work.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Flappy wings is awesome I recommend you give it a try and rate it a five star  I Honestly recommend you should love this game ;)
0425263916|5|Just wish the sequel would have been available sooner she is a great writer. Just bought another book of hers.
0060392886|4|Twenty years of Motley cure told from the band member's point of view. starting with their club days in LA, when they all lived in the same dirty apartment to their late nineties reunion, the Dirt provides and in depth look into of of Rock's most controversial bands. Sometimes you get 2 three different POV's into the same story. For example; Vince Neil's infamous car wreck which killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicolas Razzle is told from the POV's of all for members; where they were. how they remember it. Anyone who's who loves reading Rock n' Roll Biographies, even if you're not a Crue fan would enjoy \\"the Dirt.\\" You won't like because of the book, in fact, you might grow hare them more, but, not without feeling some empathy. The human element is there, and the book itself is an entertaining read.
0525958002|5|I loved this book. Loved it. So sweet. And very readable and entertaining. Yes, he glosses over a lot of things (that whole Warren thing), but what is there just made me smile as I was reading. And that does not happen to me very much. An absolute must for any John fan.
B0089LOG02|5|Such a heart warming and different story. Loved learning apart of American history. Great voice and a page turner for sure.
B00K9V2OPE|5|As much as I like a romance, this one hit me right in the pit of the stomache.  What a way to go on a journey about loss of a loved one. I didn't know how I'd feel about this one: dealing with a relationship between a teacher and student, but I quickly realized it was about so much more. Wow! Well done!
B000JMKQX0|4|This is a fantastic read for fans of Zombie fiction and is fairly unique in it's delivery.  As you are probably already aware, this book is written as a collection of stories/interviews collected after the conclusion of the Zombie War.  Personally, I really enjoyed the format and voice that Max Brooks uses in this novel because it removes the focus on the limited perspective of a single character or group and expands to a much bigger/deeper global view.<br /><br />This of course, is almost certainly the reason that the similarities between the book and the movie stop at the title.  Ok, well there is one scene that stood out in Jerusalem interview that resonated strongly with a scene from the movie, but really that's about it.  Honestly though, I enjoyed both the book and the movie on their own merits, not for how well the movie followed the book, but as someone who enjoys zombie books and movies.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any fan of the zombie genre!  It's a great read.
0380789019|5|This was an amazing book!  Living in NYC it made me really think about those random &quot;dead ends&quot; and the gap between the subway and the platform.<br />I really wanted to visit the London Underground (and I don't  mean the subway) after reading this delightful and absorbing novel.  The  characters were well written and memorable.<br />Pick this book up and I  promise you will not want to put it down.
1451696191|4|The book was good, anyone who doesn't like talking about sex or anything of a sexual nature don't read it. Really, Mormon's probably wouldn't like this book. But I enjoyed it minus some of the parts where I felt like I had to take a shower. But it's a good book all together.<br />The book was in great condition when I got it.
B002QE3CTY|5|I bought this book as a small distraction from studying for finals, turns out it was a huge distraction! I couldn't put the book down!
B00IJJUIMY|5|Good story.
B005K17RU0|4|This is a quick, easy app for current weather conditions.  I can go more in-depth if I wish.  I like the wind speed, which is very important where I live.
B004J4WKUQ|4|At first I thought Ready Player One was an adolescent version of Stephenson's README, but as I read on, I began to really enjoy the cool references to the 80s and found that I cared about the characters. Not a bad book, and potentially a great movie.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Easy set up.Works exactly as described.
6305268835|5|I've never particularly liked Adam Sandler on Saturday Night Live, but he was good in &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot;, and I really liked him in this one!  In fact, I'd rate this as one of the better football movies ever  made, and certainly the funniest!  The supporting cast is strong, but  Sandler and his normally annoying Bayou accent are what make this one fly!
B0074PNCRM|5|There are plenty of reviews that say it all. This is a great book to read although it is a sad story. It might teach us to be grateful for every day of our live.
B00NEQRNVG|5|Love this series
B00KMX5V8G|5|Love it...
B00I46T7W4|2|The game has very few beginning cars, only four items and a whole lot of cheesy graphics, including the cars. Worst of all, the data can malfunction, and lose ALL progress in the game. The game is fun, but major modifications are required for excellence in gameplay.
B009IH0ICG|5|This is the best barbeque accessory I have ever bought! I would spend an hour trying to light and tend to my charcoal to make sure it was burning. This starter made it so simple and without lighter fluid!!!! My food tastes better and I can now focus on side dishes instead of my charcoal.
B00066FBQG|5|I had not seen this movie since the 1970s, so I decided to order it and see if it was still as good as I remembered. Answer? It is, if a bit quirkier than I recalled. Paul Newman and Robert Redford were the hunks of their day, and the prospect of the two of them in the same movie sent a lot of women, myself included, to theaters to see them in action. Katharine Ross as Etta Place did a great job, too.<br /><br />Seeing the film now, I think that the bicycle-riding scene to &#34;Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head&#34; was superfluous, if cute, and there are other minor aspects that come across as odd. But in its time, &#34;Sundance&#34; was a ground-breaking, enormously popular film, and I can still see why. It's worth seeing again.
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is slightly addictive. I love it though.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that it can be very slow at times.<br />A good thing is that I can be at like ten percent battery and the game will still last me a long time.
B00AGOGOLE|2|Came with no instructions. Can' t figure out how to delete photos or videos. However, it does a good video.
B000FC13E0|3|not up to Chrichton standards.  Too lengthy, boring, scanned the last half, did read the last chapter, but no surprises.  ,
0671646788|5|This book started it all.  Without a doubt one of the best book ever written.  I just love it.  This book is about realizing your potential as an individual, and it makes a wonderful companion to other books on the market.  One such book is, \\"How to find your dream job and make it a reality: solutions for a rewarding and meaningful career\\" by Jason McClure.  Of course, this book about realizing your career potential, which is very important. <br />In his book Jason takes the complexity out of the job/career search, and makes it easy and doable, which is why I highly recommend Jason's book.  If you buy any book as a complement to the \\"Magic of thinking big\\" I would recommend Jason's book.  Both books are classics, and both books offer proven solutions.
B00DPH7QFM|5|way sick
B001OQCV6K|4|It is a movie we ordered as a gift. I hate having to write reviews for each little thing we buy
0142000663|5|I have been reading and re-reading this book for last couple of weeks and haven't been able to get over it. The backdrop, the politics, the facts behind the fiction, are all a different world to me. Separated by several decades. Yet, there are factors that connect you straight to the book. Tom is a man who reminds you of someone you wanted to be in school after being expelled. Ma stands for strength in adversity. Pa for being an understanding human being.<br /><br />Amidst everything, the characters Steinbeck has created are  ephemeral yet so touchingly representative of human strength and dignity. The language of the characters is also communicative of the understanding of the lot Steinbeck has wanted to portray. The Scriptures' discussion between Tom and Ma when she comes to ask him to go (and her understanding the fact that children, especially adoloscents are likely to make mistakes in the heat of the moment) has a stark resemblance to the discussion of Indian scriptures I have overheard travelling to my village. It makes you wonder about the irony that when you are engrossed in reading such stories in fiction, you get appalled. But when you are just skipping through the newspapers, you miss the stories. There are quite a few Joads living out there, but we do not have the time to read through the stories in between the lines of the news columns.<br /><br />To sum it up, Grapes of Wrath is like a huge picture on a very large canvass that portrays the human life with a perspective that is way larger than we choose to adopt towards life. A must read.
B00ADR2DTG|5|Great headphone amp, only complaint is that it's not shielded against all RF (so your cell phone will click your headphones if it gets too close). For my application (monitoring DAW output and casual listening) sounds great.
B0090EHVMC|5|Bought for my three year old granddaughter and she loves it.  WAnts to watch it every day.<br />And she now \\"speaks for the trees\\".
B0012QE4Q2|5|disturbing book but good read
B00AQ3K8IU|4|Goosebumps and tears. College sucks you in to the depth of the characters. She has a way of making you become Sky......
B00E8KLWB4|5|I loe this game, very addictive though
B00PSLQGX6|5|I loved it, I can wait for the next season in January 2016!!!
B004JN1CW4|2|The book was good but toward the bend reserve sane thing over and over again. It became tiring after a while-<br />.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|FUN bubble game.
B0001O3YD0|5|The DVD arrived in a timely manner and was exactly as described.  There were no flaws in it, it functions perfectly, and its a pretty good movie too.  I'd certainly recommend it to sci-fi fans.
B000055Y0Y|5|love his movie it was so good will see it again
B004KBSQBA|5|Enjoyed hearing old songs that were produced in high fidelity.  It's good &#34;fire up&#34; music when I need a break during the day.
B00001QEE5|3|IT IS SAD THAT DISNEY HAS BECOME THE MULTIZILLION DOLLAR INSTITUTION THAT IT HAS.  IF IT WAS STILL UNDER THE WATCHFUL CARING EYES OF WALT DISNEY HIMSELF, I DON'T THINK THE DVD VERSION OF THIS MOVIE I JUST PURCHASED WOULD  BE THE SAME.  THE MOVIE OF COURSE IS AS GREAT AS IT ALWAYS WAS - A WONDER  OF ARTISTRY &amp; FANTASY SEAMLESSLY BLENDED TOGETHER. THE COLORS ARE AS  BEAUTIFUL AS EVER.  THE SOUND IS O.K., BUT I WOULD THINK THAT DISNEY COULD  DO SOMETHING IN THE WAY OF RESTORATION AS FAR AS THE HISS THAT IS VERY  NOTICEABLE - ESPECIALLY IN THE LOUDER PASSAGES.  <br />I ALSO AM NO DUMMY WHEN  IT COMES TO GENERAL DVD KNOWLEDGE, BUT I WAS TOTALLY CONFUSED LOOKING AT  THE BACK OF THE DVD CASE AS TO WHETHER THIS MOVIE WAS A WIDESCREEN VERSION  OR FULL SCREEN.  IT CLEARLY STATES IN MINISCULE LETTERS UNDER THE RUNNING  TIME THAT PETER PAN IS PRESENTED IN ITS ORIGINAL THEATRICAL ASPECT RATIO,  APPROX. 1.33:1. I (AND PROBABLY ANYONE ELSE BESIDES ROGER EBERT) WOULD  GUESS THAT THIS MEANS IT APPEARS AS IT WAS ORIGINALLY SHOWN IN THEATRES -  WIDESCREEN!  I WAS MORE THAN TICKED TO FIND LATER THAT IT IS IN FACT A PAN  AND SCAN VERSION, AND AFTER PAYING NOT A SMALL SUM OF MONEY, I FEEL A  LITTLE ROOKED.<br />MY SUGGESTION IS TO KEEP WATCHING THAT WORN OUT VHS COPY  UNTIL DISNEY DECIDES TO INVEST A LITTLE MORE IN ONE OF THEIR CROWN  ACHIEVEMENTS. OH AND DON'T WORRY TOO MUCH ABOUT THAT LIMITED ISSUE NONSENSE  MEANING THAT THEY ONLY MANUFACTURE EACH MOVIE TITLE ON A LIMITED NUMBER RUN  ONLY ONCE PER GENERATION (WITH DISNEY, GENERATIONS ARE BORN QUITE OFTEN).   RIGHT NOW, THEY OBVIOUSLY ARE HAVING A GIGANTIC CASE OF TIGHTWADITIS AND  YET ARE STILL PRICING THEIR TITLES WELL ABOVE OTHER STUDIOS. SAD, SAD,  SAD!<br />I ONLY HOPE WE ALL CAN SEE THIS MOVIE IN ITS FULL WIDESCREEN GLORY  AND SOUND SOON!   PETER PAN IN ITSELF IS STILL MAGICAL!
B006GWO5NE|5|The puppy ate my cable and I was so glad to get this one to replace it!
B00BAXFECK|2|This book was mostly about two drug an alcohol dependent teen agers to young adulthood boys/men and was very depressing tp read. I was so glad when I finished the book. I did not really enjoy it.
B008I34XUY|5|Frank Zappa was a musical genius. The musicians who played with him went on to play with other greats. Two of his drummers now work with Jeff Beck. I still need to replace more Zappa vinyl. There will never be another Zappa.
B0050DZ8J0|1|Have not bee able to sign into website since I registered for account.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I really like this game. It's a good time-passer. Or if you are just bored it's fun. They have lots of neat, creative and funny characters. Love it.
0679890475|5|This book is everything I remember from my childhood and comes in the kid friendly cardboard. It's just what I needed and expected!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good graphics. Very entertaining. I would recommend this app if you like hidden objects.  You have to wait for hints to replenish and earn energy, so sometimes you are forced into a break which isn't really a bad thing.
1101946342|5|SPEECHLESS!!!!!<br /><br />I am thrilled I was given this book, and after reading Christian POV does kind of put into words what he was going thorough ... although a cliffhanger, his pain, his sort of love for Anna, and I am sorry but she was kind of annoying ... I like the fact that he remembered Leila and how he felt about her
B00QLVY7J2|5|I've earned 650 coins here
B00E8KLWB4|5|Very fun game and challenging.
B00MLDTZJQ|5|Just so hard not to replace heat and rook with beckett and castle ;-) a clearly entertaining read. Looking forward to the other books
B008Y2VTIS|5|I love it! Just wish all seasons were on prime! Lol
B000002NE4|4|This is not what one would necessarily expect from Nick Cave but excellent nonetheless. Most of the songs explore love's wayward ways  in a frank, honest, and direct manner in the best Leonard Cohen tradition. Particularly successful are \\"Into My Arms,\\" \\"There Is a Kingdom,\\" and \\"(Are You) the One I've Been Waiting For?\\"  \\"Black Hair\\" and \\"Green Eyes\\" are somewhat more erotic and poetic. However, a handful of songs go beyond this and wax on other issues of life, particularly religion and Cave's unflinching view of human nature. \\"People Ain't No Good\\" is the best song in this manner and perhaps the best on the album. \\"Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere?\\" and \\"Idiot Prayer\\" are two other examples. For the most part, the music is laidback, used as a solid, simple bed for Cave's intimate lyrics and vocals. His low, \\"doomy and gloomy\\" voice, coupled with mostly piano-based music, makes it almost seem as if he is sitting at the piano in a church singing to you in the pew. For the Cave fan, this might be heaven.
B005LAIHSG|4|I really enjoyed this movie even though some friends said they didn't think it was all that good.<br />I love movies of this time peroid.
B00AREIAI8|5|Love it!<br />Fun for you kids.... and maybe even adults too.<br />Mine love this game.<br />Good for keeping kids preoccupied.
B003QTUQGU|5|I am 60 y/o female. I loved this movie and the actors...Johnny depp is a winner in anything, as well as Helen Bonham Carter(OFF WITH THEIR HEADS!)  This version is Alice at the age of 19. A must see movie, as I can't remember seeing the first.
B00IRMTTPU|5|Well written, acted, and directed. Simple. My attention never waivered while viewing this film. All awards received this year were well deserved.
B008JFUP0I|3|blu ray disc has a roaring noise when it is in play, the dvd does not. Other blu ray discs put into my machine makes no noise so it must be from this product.
B00AIQP9DE|5|game exceeded my expectations,was fun and some parts are challenging. the graphics are nice story was ok.<br />game is not totally free, you have to purchase it
B002IFT1ZA|5|Awesome Product.  Thank you.  The videos are awesome.  The shows are every bit as good as the hype.  This was worth the cost.
B008QTVNUI|4|Certainly entertaining, often unpredictable, and ultimately i do recommended Homeland. But i wouldnt call it mind-blowing, and the acting feels a little iffy in parts.
B0064MPXFA|5|I picked this up somewhere down the line and really liked it, so I decided to go back to the beginning!  Great acting, great writing, great storyline!  I LOVE the ethics (and the dilemmas), the family dynamics, the law - I just love all of it!!  My dad happened to mention to me that it was a good show, but you really couldn't watch it without starting at the beginning.  I disagree, I watched several episodes whenever I could catch them and enjoyed them a great deal, but I wanted to know more about the back story I had missed!!  It's a great show!
B00005JL96|5|For those animation fans who enjoyed the myths, fairy tales, and folk stories Disney had given us in the past, but yearned for a new story that has never been told before, Lilo and Stitch is just what you've been looking for. The animation is clean and tailored specifically to the story-line, the characters are easy to identify with, and the story is unique and perfectly suited for the new millennium. A quirky little girl, her older-sister-turned-guardian, her no-nonsense case worker and her newly-adopted extra-terrestrial &quot;dog&quot; create a story with a little bit of something for everyone. Lilo and Stitch is sure to win the hearts of kids of any age.
B00DVKOYBM|5|It is a good game to challenge your abilities against other players. Try it, you might like it.<br />  T
0385485786|2|This book is an empty, substance-less story more that would fitbetter on an NBC Movie of the Week than in a book.  It takes too longto read a plot that goes nowhere fast!  When Grisham does move the plot he does it interestingly, but he does it so slowly that it becomes predictable, dull, and downright boring.  The only intelligence sets in during the last chapter when Grisham seems to wax philosophically.  Other than that - wait for the movie that I'm sure will be coming soon!
B0009U5DD0|5|Bought it as a gift for someone that loves this group and she has been listening to it everyday since
B00IJZRY3Y|5|A total twist great book loved it:-)
B005XQLBU4|5|I had one glitch in the 2nd level but otherwise the game works great. Gets difficult quickly. Brings back memories to the good old days.
B003H9M1QM|5|Excellent
B00B2G2RG6|5|I started watching this on tv, but I missed the pilot. So far this has been a great series. Keeps you guessing
B007MC8YLQ|3|This is an OK Free Cell game, but it could be better if:<br />1) the stats section showed a single game high score, rather than only an aggregate sum total for all games played, and<br />2) there were more choices of card faces. There is only one option(?) and the face cards are hard to distinguish.
B00BD99JMW|5|This is the final third book in the Divergent series. True to the Dauntless , Tris and Four show bravery in choices that they make when they discover secrets about their world.
B00F08ADX6|4|Only complaint I have is that you can't save your progress and have to keep starting over, but that's also what keeps me coming back!
B0013FSL3E|5|Obviously 2008 isn't over yet, and likely there will be many great movies leading to the end of the year. But Wall-E was phenomenal film making at it's best. Not only was it amazingly entertaining and fun for any age, but it had a strong story, strong characterization, and strong cinematography.
B004DLPXAO|5|on my phone 4 on the go..
030758836X|1|Horrible, extremely slowly in the beginning of the book and the worst ending. I was so disappointed.  I was very surprised to see it get 4 and 5 stars.
B0091VKMSE|1|We tried to watch the movie and gave up about half way. Even Morgan Freeman could not save this movie!
B00LXLM05I|5|Pretty nice to just zone out and play this while I watch tv. Not a huge fan of the fact that there are only two classes that are playable but still has provided hours of game play.
B001KDQ4KQ|5|Wonderful book, drew you in and held you till the end. I would recommend this book to everyone to read.
B00G5G7EXY|5|Exactly what I expected which is a good thing.  So yeah I enjoyed it.  Will be interesting to see how once upon a time approaches the snow queen.
0300169787|5|If you're a fan of Alexander McQueen or just want an idea of his stunning creations, this is the book to buy. It makes me want to go to London and see the Met exhibit in person.... McQueen was such a talented designer, and the images gathered in this book are just a small sample of the collections he produced during his too short career. The book itself is impressive - they didn't skimp on the paper or the cover, and it's well worth the price for its production. It's quite the conversation piece from beginning to the end.
B008JFUS5A|5|I LOVE the series. Cant wait for mocking jay!<br />So sad that I have to wait to buy this though!<br />Wish it was coming out sooner!
B0027MJU00|5|This book was great!  Just like Gone Girl it kept me embraced in the story always trying to figure out what actually happened.  I highly recommend reading this if you like a good mystery.
B000002HAF|5|I bought this when I was 14 and now, 5 years later and a lot more mature, I have come to see this album of intricate, harsh, and compelling sound as one of the best things I ever bought.  The Pixies are at the root of a  tremendous volume of good work, but to get the raw power go to the source.   You won't be sorry.

B0087IT8FK|5|This a grown-up feel good movie. It is a story of profound friendship across race and class. It's based on a true story of a wealthy French invalid and the man he hires to be his caretaker. They develop a deep and lasting friendship that transcends their differences. I saw this when it came out, and it still makes me happy when I watch it. A truly great film.

0786965614|4|This really is a great manual and if i could give it 4.5 stars, I would. But I do need to take off at least one star because though it is a thorough compendium of monsters, it gives a lot of focus to the 10 types of dragons using at least 3 pages for each type and while such examination is appreciated, I would have liked to see a little more detail or variation for some of the other monsters and a couple other &#34;boss type&#34; monsters other than the tarrasque and respecitve ancient dragons. Yes of course the basics are covered such as the kraken and the beholder, but i would have liked to see a demonic pantheon or two (really just for a campaign I'm planning on running). I'm sure I'm just being greedy, there really is only so much one can fit into a single book. Despite my complaints, this is a magnificent book and is a surefire way to make your life as a DM easier in the new gen of D&D.
B00MNYTWMI|3|Not really what great.

B009DT98RK|5|I was able to catch Peter in Mesa, Arizona with two dear friends and acquired a multi-cd set of that nights show from the people who ran his tour for a nominal amount.<br /><br />This show was a little bit more &#34;raw&#34; than the one I was at, but equally amazing. I wish there were more shots of all the things that were shown on the screens behind the band, i.e.,shots of all stages of Peter's career and pictures of his musical idols and friends. The sound of the Bluray and camera work are 1st rate. I recommend you listen and watch on high quality audio and video gear.<br /><br />The part of the show that I enjoyed the most was, believe it or not, the part after FCA is over and he does a mish mash of his Humble Pie & solo material as well as a spine-tingling version of Soundgarden's &#34;Black Hole Sun&#34;.<br /><br />I wanna  go to the sun...
B00B2V66VS|5|This is a fun game, what more can I say. It's action.packed and keeps the player on their toes. One needs coordination to get good, but it'll keep up with your pace.
B0000A1RJI|4|When I first saw the theatrical trailers for this film, I was excited.  Being a huge Disneyland fan, I was naturally enthralled by the idea of a movie based on one of the park's most innovative and successful rides.  The music in the trailer somewhat confused me, though.  The lively \\"Yo-Ho\\" theme used in the ride couldn't be heard--instead, I heard driving orchestral music that sounded different from anything I'd heard before.  But I liked it a lot, and began trying to arrange it for piano. <br /> <br />Fast forward a few months.  I saw the film and really enjoyed it.  The music caught my attention again--it was very, very similar to what I'd heard in the trailer, but it wasn't exactly the same.  Nevertheless, I knew I needed the soundtrack. <br /> <br />Now, a few years later, I have most of the 45-minute soundtrack arranged for solo piano and play it regularly.  The soundtrack itself is a well-loved addition to my iPod's hard drive, and I know others who enjoy it as well.  Interestingly, this score works so well because it is NOT stereotypical \\"pirate music.\\"  The film is by no means a conventional pirate film, and Klaus Badelt's take on the music is intriguingly modern.  It mixes orchestral and electronic elements into a sonic texture that Hans Zimmer's Media Ventures has made so ubiquitous in films of this nature. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fresh and unique approach to film scoring, POTC is not for you.  This is the same sort of music that Zimmer and Badelt and the other composers at Media Ventures have written for films like The Time Machine and Gladiator.  That being said, this is of somewhat higher caliber than other Media Ventures scores I've heard. <br /> <br />Several very similar themes are utilized throughout the score.  Sometimes they become rather monotonous, but there are some renditions that are shockingly moving.  \\"One Last Shot\\" is the most unique track on the album, featuring an incredibly passionate statement of the main love theme, aswell as a number of French horn \\"echoes\\" of the other themes in the movie. <br /> <br />Let me sum up what I intended to say in this overly long review: <br /> <br />This is neither pure orchestral music nor pure electronic music.  The three or four very similar themes that Badelt composed for the film are used in a number of contexts, sometimes monotonously.  However, every track has its strong points.  Much of the music is loud and uses driving rhythmic figures. <br /> <br />Now we'll have to see how Zimmer does on his score for the film's sequel.  Only time will tell.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Very enjoyable read!
B009DCOU9S|3|The game was really not what I expected . I could do with a little more talking and a lot more puzzles and games. I really didn't like the storyline either but you really can't beat free.
B00005KA9F|4|A great movie with quite a number of twists about a couple of highly skilled thieves traveling the world to find (and steal) treasures worth millions (and billions) of dollars.  As with most action movies, there are definitely scenes that are very unrealistic, yet others that I never would have dreamed of, that under the right circumstances could work.<br />Things that improved the rating of the movie:<BR>1)  NO SEX SCENES!  It is nice to see a movie that has great action, yet did not put in filth just to sell it.<BR>2) A unique plot.  So many flicks are about the same thing, just done differently.<BR>3) Great twists!  The movie kept you guessing until the end.  I kept wondering how it would end.  No, the good guys do not always win!<BR>4) Good acting.<BR>5) It kept a good pace through the entire movie.  I did not get bored by it being too slow nor did I get overwhelmed by it moving so fast that I could not keep track of what was happening.<br />Things that hurt the rating of the movie:<BR>1) The use of the \\"F\\" word several times.  There was absolutely no need to add profanity to this movie, especially what I consider being hard core profanity.<BR>2) A couple completely unbelievable and unrealistic scenes.  Stretch the imagination, but keep to things that can really happen.<br />Overall, this was a good movie with a good plot.  I would recommend this movie - especially if you have TV Guardian to filter out the few times of foul language.<br />My Rating: B+
B0088ZSKOC|3|Give away an app (camera), then charge for additional tapes (the film).<br /><br />Picked this up during a give-away. He's got a fairly good voice, but a mild accent that at times forces me to break the momentum and concentrate on - what did he just say? If you're into a subscription services, this might be a way for you to go.<br /><br />I'm guessing relaxation is a technique one can learn on their own and save money.
B000023VR6|4|OK i was reading through these reviews and some of the people are right. it is kinda weak in some points. FIRST OF ALL XXXPLOSIVE is the tightest song and i dont care what anyone else has to say. that being said, on with  the review. as another reviewer mentioned, the reason why it did not get a  5 from me is the fact that the beginning of the cd is tight, but towards  the end, the songs start getting weaker. its still a MUST BUY. this is the  tightest cd out right now. nothing out right now can touch this. Jay-z's cd  is alright, because it has a song with dre on it. but his beats are like  BLAH right now. so go get both of these cats' albums.
B00V4JHNZG|1|This movie was awful. I really wish I had not watched it. The other Hobbits movies were not that good---way too slapstick---but this one is far worse. I will not even waste your time cataloging its failures. Just don't waste your time.

B00IK67OQO|1|I gave this movie 1 star because it is kind of rasict and biased depict about iran. at the beginning of this movie they show tehran like a mid 19 century city with time worn houses and lots of terrorists. Have you ever been in Tehran ? it totally different from stereotype Hollywood movies. stop dreaming about occyping tehran like what U.S. army did in IRAQ and Afghanistan.
B0064MPXFA|5|This series is like potato chips....you can't watch just one!  Don't start watching unless you have some time to devote to seeing more than one episode at a time.  The characters are well-developed and the cases they illustrate show all the &#34;grayness&#34; of law and justice.

B0051QIGP4|5|To all of you anal-retentive OCD folks popping your Adderall, this may not be the purchase for you.  Evidently if Amazon sells you a 99 cents album and you can't play the whole thing within 2 seconds, the world is coming to an end.      For the rest of us, buy this album for 99 cents.  After Amazon tells you that your purchase is complete, then walk away from your computer (slowly with no sharp objects nearby) and go chill out for a few hours.  Take a walk.  Have a real conversation with a friend.  Make yourself a snack.  Then, in a few hours, come back to your Amazon account page and the entire album will be there.      Cheers.

B008UCJ7KO|3|I was not pleased with this book at all. The story did not go anywhere. A lot of cliff hangers
B00M2D7L2I|3|Is it as good as the first two 5 star albums? To me it's 3.5 stars. I'm sure some fans are pxssed at this question because it's not fair. But for a lot of people this is the question they want answered. This is the question many old fans will be asking, this review is for you, not everyone and not for fans of Weezer's newer stuff. This is simply a review for people who have not yet bought the album and are wondering if it's as good as Blue and Pinkerton. This is for fans who just love the first 2 and didn't really care for all their other albums. This review will try to judge from a \\"how accessible is it?\\" stand point of view. Please don't vote yes or no unless you're an older fan from the early 90s wanting to know if this album is as good as the first 2, it wasn't intended for everyone else.    On some levels it is and some it isn't. The new album lacks the gritty, raw, enthusiastic energy of the first 2, the production is much cleaner on the new album. The vocals, guitars, and drums don't have the same intense energy as the first 2, I'm sure it has to do with them aging, gaining fame, popularity through the years which is normal and expected. The emotions of the singing combined with the juvenile lyrics feel contrived to some degree, like an older Rivers trying to capture the emotions of youth, it doesn't feel completely real to a degree. But the lyrics match their first 2, it just feels more contrived now being older with less singing emotion. After 8 good listens, some of the middle tracks do lose my attention, bored me a bit, and felt meaningless, my mind wandered.    The album isn't at all bad, it's the same weezer, just less energetic (compared to the first 2). No real change, artistic innovation was really made on this album either, so it's not a far departure from the first 2, nor is it a experimental artistic statement piece. The production is clean, tight, and songwriting is good. Many are saying this album is as good as the first 2, some riffs, lyrics, and sounds comes close but just lacks the gritty energy. Maybe if it were recorded live, it would be closer to the first 2. But this album definitely is better than some of the later weezer albums. So it's not the best, nor the worst. The hooks of this album doesn't hook you like the first 2, but the hooks are still good. The only song I didn't like was one with hipster whistling in it.    Here you have a really good weezer album, things changed as expected, but not a life changer like the first 2. Good songwriting, good riffs, ok energy, good hooks, decent emotional impact. So if you don't care about the gritty, enthusiastic energy of the first 2, you may find this album just as good as their first. Basically, If you take the their debut self titled blue album and Pinkerton and polished away the raw in your face energy and took away some of the catchy hooks and lowered their emotional impact and the realness of the lyrics and add nothing new you'd have Everything Will be Alright in the End. It's still pretty good, just lacks the magic of the first 2.    Here's an example comparison of other bands and artists changing equivalence of Weezers \\"Blue album and Pinkerton vs Everything Will be Alright in the End\\" is like:    Led Zeppelin's I -IV and Houses of the Holy vs Coda and physical graffiti.  Black Sabbath's Debut and Paranoid vs 13.  Nine inch nails Pretty hate machine, downward spiral, fragile vs hesitation marks.  Godsmack's debut vs 1000 hp.  Disturbs the Sickness vs Asylum.  Bjork's debut, post, homogenic, and vespertine vs Medulla, Volta, and Biophelia.  Metallica's Ride the lightning and master of puppets vs black album and death magnetic.  Jimmy eat worlds Clarity vs Invented or Bleed American.  Pink Floyd's Wish you were here, The Wall, and Dark Side of The Moon vs momentary lapse of reason.  The Doors debut vs the la woman.  Deftones adrenaline, around the fur, and White Pony vs Saturday night wrist.  Pearl Jams 10 vs Backspacer.  Guns and roses appetite for destruction vs Chinese democracy and use your illusion.  The clash's debut vs give them the rope.  Rancid's Out came the wolves vs Life won't wait.  Fleetwood Mac's Rumours vs Say you will.  Martin Scorsese's taxi driver and goodfellas vs the departed and aviator.  Stephen Spielberg's E.T. Vs A.I.  Michael Mann's Heat vs Public Enemies.  Star Wars original vs new trilogy.  Pulp Fiction vs Django Unchained.  Indiana jones original trilogy vs the 4th movie.  Mudhoney's super fuzz big muff vs all their other releases.  Sarah Mclachlan's Fumbling towards ecstasy and surfacing vs Laws of Illusion and shine on.  David Bowie's rise and fall of ziggy stardust vs the next day.    This is just an example comparison. I don't think any of the later releases by the artists mentioned are bad, just a lesser or different emotional impact like Weezer's Everything Will be Alright in the End. Artists change and it's ok sometimes. Some will even find the later stuff better or just as good.
B0009A1AS2|4|Once again Dream Theater has given us another epic work with limitless talent.  Their ninth studio album, the 74-minute Octavarium, is still consistent with their previous works but at the same time, has changed in structure and sound in several ways.  The noticable changes include a whole entire symphony on the background, less guitar solos in exchange for more keyboard solos, less progressive song structures, (with the exception of the title track) and I think James Labrie sings a bit better and bit more on this album than in other albums.  The symphony orchestra is, in my opinion, positive addition.  I think it definitely increases the epicness of the songs and gives them more of a built-up sound.  Then again, Dream Theater has one of the greatest rock ensembles of all time and I'm not sure if it's really neccesary.  Onto the songs: <br />Root of All Evil is a heavy sequel to a series that includes The Glass Prison and This Dying Soul from the SDOIT and TOT albums written by Mike Portnoy.  It's chorus could be a bit stronger but overall a good intro and a decent song (8.25/10). <br />Answer Lies Within is a more radio-friendly and mainstreamish song as is I Walk Beside You.  It's pretty good but one of the reasons I listen to Dream Theater is to get away from these types of songs (8/10). <br />These Walls is actually one of my favorites off this album.  It's chorus is one of the more memorable ones, the orchestra is quite good in the background, and it's a definite highlight off this album (9.25/10). <br />I Walk Beside You, like Answer Lies Within is another more mainstream-like song and sounds a little like U2 who I don't really like too much.  The orchestra though is pretty good on this one (8/10). <br />Panic Attack, oh what an amazing song.  Furious, heavy, catchy, fast as hell and just plain amazing, Panic Attack is easily one of the best off this album.  There's not a single moment where it slows down and is an overall great song (10/10). <br />Never Enough is a bit average for Dream Theater but nontheless, is a decent track that is reminiscent of the band Muse (another amazing band) and has keyboards that stand out (8/10). <br />Sacrificed Sons reflects on 9/11 and is among the longest tracks on the album clocking in at 10:43.  A pretty good track and has one of the better choruses off the album (8.75/10). <br />Octavarium, the 24-minute title track, goes into the same category as such other Dream Theater epics as A Change of Seasons and Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  Featuring 5 separate movements, Octavarium isn't the most epic of all Dream Theater works but is certainly a treat to listen.  After the 4 minute intro, the title track goes through a whole array of movements and choruses until its apparent climax when Labrie yells \\"I'm trapped in this Octavarium!\\"  Certainly one of Dream Theater's highlights in their catalogue (10/10).

B0054N73EY|4|You guys believe it? It's been more than 5 years since the Chilis released Stadium... The wait for new material from my favourite band has been a long one, to say the least.    The day I heard Frusciante decided to leave the Chilis was a devastating blow to me. It was a sad time for me and a lot of Chili Peppers fans alike. I got through it though, accepting the fact that John was passed the rock band stage in his life and wanted to focus on creating his own stuff. It made it easier for me to accept knowing that he left on good terms and that he was truly happy with the decision.     I don't know where I heard it from, but the Chilis acknowledged they were a completely brand new band, except for the fact that they just kept the name... I first listened to the album when they streamed it online. Yesterday, on the first day of release, I drove like a madman during my lunch break from work and bought the album (I haven't bought an actual CD in ages). I wanted to write about this earlier but I thought, the least I could do is give it a real good listen before I began to critique it. One has to understand that this is the follow up to Stadium Arcadium, pretty much a 'perfect' album in every sense.    My overall feel for the album is pretty good. I already knew going into it that I was not going to get the same feeling I would from a Frusci chilied album... I mean, Frusci lives to play music. His passion, devotion, and love for music is so strong, its an inspiration to see how in tune somebody can be with something... Comparing Josh to Frusci can't be done fairly because we all know Frusci is simply put, irreplaceable.    The album seemed very chills to me, which is what the Chilis bring, so I thought Josh did a great job on keeping that Chilis feel. But you're also missing a lot of the funk, something John started off in with and went through this amazing evolution over the years...Chad is solid like he always is. Flea always outdoes himself but is always a bit underrated, and Kiedis keeps getting better and better, vocally over the years. All of the instruments we're not normally used to (the ever increasing piano, the good ol' trumpet from flea, African drums, and even the cow bell) from the Chilis gives them a fresh sound, which is refreshing.    Now, if you HAD to make a comparison, you can compare Josh with Navarro, as they both came in after Frusciante leaves (both incredibly successful albums), whether on good terms or not. One Hot Minute had some good songs, but I can already say I like 'I'm With You' better. There are some real outstanding songs on the album which I've been playing over and over. If I had to say my top 5, here they are, not in any particular order:    3. Brendan's Death Song  8. Did I Let You Know   10. Happiness Loves Company   11. Police Station   13. Meet Me at the Corner     I think speaking for a lot of Chilis fans, we can all agree that we miss John's harmonizing and his solos... Frusci lets it all out with his solos, he makes you feel his emotions and his soul through them. (Jaddo, you know all of them amazing solos, way too many to name.) These are the huge things that's missing from this album. Josh does bring in some good vocals to the album however. I'm not trying to be biased at all here, but it still comes out a little bit. It sort of feels like Josh is holding back, rather, choosing to compliment the other 3 more than showcasing himself. Nonetheless, Josh is a great fit with the band. He's the natural person to step in after John leaves because of their closeness, and just the fact that he truly understands what the band is about.    Overall, the album is very good. It's very good, but not the same as the old stuff and it will never be that way because Josh is Josh, and John is John. Do I recommend it? Yes, go buy it for the love of Chilis whether you are a long time fan or whether you're just starting to realize the magic and universal love they exude.    Here's how I've always looked at them. Chad is like the rock of the group; Kiedis is the ball of energy or the flame; Flea is the crazy glue that holds the band in place; and Frusci... Frusci is the heart of the band.

B00006M183|5|Surely this album will create a riot at the stores coz it really is a fantastic album.Well i have recently started listening to pearl jam i.e is about 3 months ago.I started with most underrated album binaural and found it to be a treat and then moved back to no code then vitalogy and so on.I really think that an artist reserves the right to display his maturity,creativity and verstilaty.Pearl jam has shown over the times an evolution in their music while still sticking to their grunge roots.i think i have lectured enough so i will get to the point that most of the reviews i have read bout pearl jam albums they all refer to the album TEN and that pearl jam can never accomplish the feat again,well that is exactly my point coz pj does not want to repeat themselves they want to move on so either love it or leave it ;)so now comin to the album here's a track by track:<br />Can't keep:a good experimental song once again by pj.Which sounds quite different from the usual we here these days 8/10<br />Save You:Well here is a song for all u buffs who r searching for TEN in every album a gr8 grunge song 9/10<br />Love Boat Captain:Trademak pj song with a gr8 bridge and chorus not to mention the music. 9/10<br />Cropduster:this is my fav. song on the album which is immediately likeable bcoz of its catchy tune like red mosquito. 10/10<br />Ghost:Here's another grunge song with experimentation.no doubt pj fans will like it. 9/10<br />I am mine:Well u all must have heard this one unlike n e thing i have ever heard the most wonderful thing about the song r the lyrics which can be interpreted in so many ways 10/10.<br />Thumbing my way:gr8 acoustic song which reminds me of &quot;OFF HE GOES&quot;.A classic 9/10.<br />You Are: Sounds like a zeppelin song the influence is quite clear.need i say more the name zeppelin is synoymous with success. 9/10<br />Get Right: Nothing much to say bout this one reminds me of classic rock.a good song 8/10<br />Green disease: This is an all orignal pj song gr8. 9/10<br />HelpHelp: if the beatles did grunge this would be the result cool song. 8/10<br />Bush leaguer: pj take on politics this is another song with spoken dialogue like i'm open cool lyrics,nice chorus. 9/10<br />1/2 full: a country song which sounds like much of stings recent work.well in my opinion its not that gr8.6/10<br />Arc: unsual and interesting vedder proves that he can even chant a tribal song.If u play it loud enough it will actually rain ;).<br />All Or None: once again the neil young influence is eminent.a nice night song.8/10<br />Conclusion: even if u don't like pj and just appreciate music i'd sat go for this one.
0385491026|3|Margaret Atwood once wrote, &quot;Sisterhood is powerful; women are always supposed to get along with each other.  It's not true any more than it is for men.&quot;  Cat's Eye is basically about jealousy and cruelty between girls, as remembered by Elaine, now an adult, who has returned to her  hometown to visit.  As Elaine is walking through the city, she remembers  scenes that are each centered on a specific theme.  Some of these topics  include victimization, cultural dislocation, power struggles and violence  against females.  Atwood's main theme explores how girls can be fiercely  competitive and very cruel.  Atwood makes it clear that girls are not made  of &quot;sugar and spice and everything nice&quot;.  In one scene,  Cordelia, the leader of the group of girls who torment Elaine, throws  Elaine's hat into an icy cold stream and orders her to fetch it, and in  turn, almost kills her.  In the end, Elaine rises above her tormentors and  becomes more socially acceptable than her so-called friends.  During her  high school years, Cordelia actually tries to befriend her, but Elaine  holds control over her now.  The last half of the book is then devoted to  her life beyond her cruel friends, and also to her guilt for not helping  Cordelia.  Although this may seem like a fun and exciting plot to some, the  intense descriptive language is actually somewhat disturbing.  Atwood  vividly describes incidences such as Elaine peeling layers of skin off her  feet and also how she feels while having sex.  I gave it three stars  because although Cat's Eye is very long and disturbing, I thought that  Atwood incorporated some surprisingly true statements that I had never  thought of before.  I was surprised at how much I related to some of these  statements, like pain keeping people in reality.  Cat's Eye is very lengthy  and at times monotonous, but I actually like it now that I've finished  reading it.

B00005J6T1|5|Madonna debuted with this record in late 1983, initiating the most successful female pop career in history.  At the time, disco was dead and dance music was verboten on pop radio.  Along with Shannon, Madonna helped bring dance music back into the mainstream.  Thus, although \\"Madonna\\" sounds like safe pop music now, it was actually pretty cutting edge at the time.  \\"Everybody\\" was her first single; it became a solid dance hit but didn't cross over to pop radio or the Hot 100.  With its unusual shuffling beat, it should have been a hit and still sounds great today.<br /><br />\\"Madonna\\" eventually yielded three pop hits, each one charting higher then the previous - Holiday (#16), Borderline (#10), and Lucky Star (#4).  \\"Borderline\\" was her first ballad, although relatively up-tempo.  Her voice is thinner here than it would be on later ballads, but she still sounds lovely.  The video was also a huge hit and introduced people to Madonna's breakthrough style.  I became aware of Madonna for the first time through that video and have been a fan ever since.  \\"Lucky Star\\" sounds a bit dated with too many synthesizers, although it's still a great pop song.  Although \\"Holiday\\" was the smallest hit, it's perhaps the most enduring of the three: a real party anthem.<br /><br />Along with these hits, the non-singles are also uniformly solid.  \\"Burning Up\\" is the closest thing to a rock song that Madonna made during her early years, although the guitars are paired with a terrific dance beat.  \\"Physical Attraction\\" is another highlight - a dance song that really shows off Madonna's sex appeal and slither.  \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"I Know It\\" are the two least memorable songs on this CD - straight ahead dance tunes without much of Madonna's panache.  With just 8 songs, \\"Madonna\\" breezes by quickly and sometimes seems a bit insubstantial.  However, the CD is an undeniable dance classic that began the Queen of Pop's career.  Most highly recommended.
B00J2PF5FE|3|Uh, what? I don't remember purchasing this. My wife must have needed to stop our toddler's yapping otherwise, she'd never stoop to purchasing some Disney crap. I imagine pots were overflowing on the stove, wooden blocks were being hurled at the wall and somewhere a child's voice was yelling &#34;Poopy Doopy I Want Candy Now!&#34; So, she must have thrown this on the tube to calm things down a bit.<br /><br />Just kidding, my wife doesn't cook.
B00E8KLWB4|4|First time game user...I like searches...so I opened this app when it was advertised on my kindle...I like that it is walking me through the game with hints rather than having to read lots of instructions..I like doing the puzzles and the searches...the graphics are good...like the music also! This is a good game for a novice with enough levels to be a challenge...
0321344758|5|Its amazing that this little book (under 200), can be so useful. The book discusses in very easy to read, non-technical terms what makes a good web design focusing on not how to create web pages but how users will view and use your site based upon specific criteria.     The first chapter begins by giving a overiew of a high-level explanation of what users actually respond to in web layout and design. For instance, placement of text, type of buttons, graphical display, useage of drop-downs and navigation, etc.    The next few chapters gives alot of detail in how users actually view a web page. From how people read web pages (actually scan them), to how designers and user see web pages, to the reasoning behind user choies.    The middle part of the book focuses on describing what parts of a web page should like to get the desired results from visitors. The author gives great examples of page navigation techniques and what works and what doesn't. The authors description of navuigations techniques of professional desgined sites (Amazon, Gap, MSNBC, About.com) really make it believeable that his suggestions will work with your website too!    The end of the book reviews the importance of usability testing and why overlooking this last aspect of web development can decide whether your site is sucessful or not.    A great book, with lots of great information. A must buy!
B00A6CCF0K|2|I expected this to be a continuation of the Shining with an older Danny.  Instead, you have a group of people sucking &#34;mist&#34; out of others in order to stay alive?  It was implied that this is what was done in the Stanley Hotel.....not at all!  The Shining played more of a mind game on readers where the readers use their imagination whereas Doctor Sleep doesn't allow you to do that.  It described the actual act of being immortal by sucking &#34;mist&#34; and as for Rose the Hat?  One big horned tooth and her lower jaw unhinges?  There was nothing like that in the Shining.  As for the ending, I found that to be to quick and to easy for the &#34;good guys&#34; to prevail.
B001M5UDGS|3|I'm not crazy about this, even with a horse in it, but I bought it as a present for someone who loves it and they were every bit as excited as I hoped they'd be.
B00EXVZW6E|2|As much as I like hidden object puzzles, this one was not for me.  Basically, every level was same, with different background picture. Also, in my opinion, the developer should lose the conveyor belt or give an option to slow it down or turn it off altogether.

B008JMKN4Y|5|So, I have been going back and forth for the past several months on reading Beautiful Disaster. I typically try not to read bad reviews, because each person differs when it comes to story content. I allowed myself to be swayed by some of the not so great comments about this book. I will never again fall victim to a bad review...  I absolutely loved, loved this book!!! I could not stop reading. I finished it in two nights and have the dark circles under my eyes to prove my lack of sleep :) I couldn't help but fall in love with the characters, storyline and found myself feeling feisty, angry, happiness, etc. and that is what I want from a book... I want to be able to feel every emotion we are capable of feeling... It only makes the journey that much more real. I read books to escape reality for a bit, not to pass time or out of boredom. I was transported beyond what I imagined!! Highly recommended!!!
B00I2TW0UO|5|Awesome
B005ZOBNOI|5|Sometimes you read a sad book and it makes you sadder. And sometimes, you read a sad book and it makes you believe in the power of infinite love and makes you feel a little less sorry for yourself.  I was wallowing in one of those woe is me moments when I downloaded this book.  A book that I thought I had read but hadn't.  To say it moved me can only be an understatement.  The book is not about death, it is about life and accepting the fate and destiny we are given, as s***ty as it can sometimes be, because even in those desolate moments, there is the brightness of stars.
B0073COMUW|5|thanks but I didn't use yet It is look good arrive on time
B0016YBFZ8|5|My favorite mobster movie.
B00BWBHIUG|1|couldn't figure it out, deleted from my phone. Not much into these games anyway, truly think kids should be outside but it has been an especially bad winter. thought it might be entertaining for my grandkids.
B0013D69YE|5|i bought this album when it orginially came out and lost it over the years. had to buy it again-and it's just as great as i remember
B005HJWWW8|4|I got this to use with a racing scanner which had lower output than preferred, however I found it didn't play nice with the scanner.<br />The product does work just fine on other devices such as cell phones though...so I do give this a decent rating.
1591396190|5|This book does a great job of showing you how many well known companies that have gotten rid of what doesn't matter and focused on what does matter to the customer, and how you can do the same. At the end of the day, that's all that really matters.    Most business owners make the mistake of doing what they think is important, when they should be doing what their customers think is important.    I highly recommend this book for any entrepreneur in any industry.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Fast moving, addictive game. Fun to figure out strategic moves to get the best bonus possible. Even the kids love it. Haven't been asked to spend any money yet....but see from other reviewers that is coming:(
B007TBZ63Y|5|OMG I LOVE THIS ALREADY IM ONLY PAGE 72 but it's already amazing can't wait to read the other books
B0095ZQ36G|5|This is undoubtedly one of the best stories of WWII that I have read. The story was superbly researched and presented, the writing crisp and flowing. The characters were well defined, the political background relevant, and the military acronyms kept to a minimum. It is a remarkable telling of a single act of kindness in an awful war that spoke to a higher standard of behavior than is  common during combat. I very much related to Franz- I wish I had had the opportunity to know him.  The book allows me again to appreciate that good people, regardless of the country that they fight for, are placed in harms way during war. Definitely recommend this work if you are a fan of WWII or military literature and interested in the personnel who fought and their back stories.
B0064X7FVE|5|Very helpful when planning trips and outdoor activities

B00932DCS8|4|Excellent performances. Interesting, exciting & surprising plot, with some twists that really work. Very enjoyable
B000002L3Q|5|Great cd
B000005RT8|3|The CD was great of course it is McCartney. However, The CD case was cracked and scratched. It looked like it was returned and re-wrapped and sent out. It's not worth buying CDs on line if you are a serious collector that likes your CDs in good shape.
B009IH0ICG|5|This does a good job of starting my charcoal. I found that if I put about 2 to 3 tablespoons of cooking oil (peanut) in the center of the paper I put underneath, the charcoal starts much quicker and gets the charcoal started better prepared to dump into my BBQ pit.
0061743526|5|I lived 4 years in America and have heard so much about the book. It is a classic and I decided to read it. As a European I find it a bit difficult to understand the writing style from the author. But slowly I get there.<br />The book meets my expectations!!!!<br />It brings a smile on my face, sometimes I roar with laughter:)<br />I'm still reading the book, I take the time to understand it and got to the chapter in which the colored man is accused for raping a white woman.<br /><br />But so far, I think it's a great book!
B00FEMJF6O|4|Good game the graphics are pretty cool and the game plays smoothly I would drive recommend this game to my friends
B008MG1E4A|5|This is a very informative book.  I enjoyed it up until the kill.  I thought it dropped off after that.
B009UX2YAC|5|This game is so so fun! And if you don't get it this game your stupid. So think you should get this game.
0451228375|5|This may be the best book that I have ever read.( And I am 70+).  It is the follow-up novel to Pillars of the Earth but I think it could rate as a stand alone book. Ken Follett has a way of weaving history and fiction that brings the past to life. In this case thirteenth century England. I was amazed at the knowledge people of that era had about architecture-bridge building in particular. There is also a lot of intrigue-upheaval in the Catholic Church and how they learned to treat the bubonic plague.
B004UPAIDK|2|I have no one to &#34;blame&#34; for down loading this App, but let me save your money- don't buy it !

0862641438|5|We liked the movie so well my wife wanted to own the book as a remembrance. It does this task very well.
B0058VW36U|5|I know I gave it five stars but I just an update to happen fast and not months for one
0762434279|3|Item shipped timely and received in great condition.  Book was only about 2\\"X 2\\".  Expected a larger version.
B000QRIGLC|5|With the movie version of this book coming out in a week, I'm so glad I read the complete book prior. In my heart, I have concerns e movie will be a shell of the story and ethos Marcus has shared herein. If the upcoming movie is an interest to you, READ THE BOOK FIRST! Regardless, this is a book well worth the read.
B00PTB7B34|5|I just started plays its so good
B00A3NQNUU|5|I love this game so excited I can have it on my kindle fire hd! I have been waiting for it to be available!
B0097EWK3A|3|Loved the game until I got stuck...well, it got stuck. I was going along fine when I found myself unable to make any progress. Went on long enough that I looked up help online and it turns out I wasn't missing something. The part where u are supposed to pick up the rope wouldn't work  and since that blocks the next steps, I'm stuck.
B0037YOMWS|3|I've been interested in getting a financial calculator for awhile. Was hopeful that HP got it's act back together after their recent string fiascos (Read the reviews of the 17BII+ as an example).      As soon as I opened the package and manual, I tried to set it up for RPN mode since that's what I'm used to. I scrolled to the menu item and pressed the \\"input\\" button to change from algebraic to RPN. Nothing happened. Read the manual again. Pressed the button, could feel and hear it click but no change. I pressed harder and finally it registered. Great, a non-responsive button on a brand new product. After pressing a few dozen times, it seems to have loosened up a bit and works better now. But I noticed that it also sticks once in awhile. In other words, one press can end up acting like two presses in series.     I believe I have a defective unit and will ask for an exchange but if the next one has sticky or non-responsive buttons, it goes back and no third chances for HP.     I have a  still working HP15C scientific I bought back in 1985!. Made in Corvallis, Oregon and sold for about eighty bucks, it's case was lost sometime in 1987 and judging from the scratch marks, one can tell that it has been \\"abused\\" through college and several jobs.     Now I'll bet some bright MBA came to the conclusion that you just can't grow your business if your product is going to last 26 years. So naturally, they should just sell crap that needs replacing within a few months. Yeah, get a new HP during every Back to School sales event. It just maintains the impression that products \\"Made in China\\" have a long way to go before they earn the same reputation for quality as those of some other nations.    Oh and manufacturing issues aside, several design annoyances should be brought up. I understand that this is primarily meant to be a financial calculator and it's great that the basic finance functions have their own dedicated buttons and appear to work fairly efficiently. But the %change function has its own dedicated button as well. You think it would be a simple matter (like on my 15C) of entering say 100, then 120 and pressing the %change button to get 20% as the increase. No! Another dimwit at HP decided that the \\"proper approach\\" is to have you enter the % change \\"mode\\". Then scroll up to the initial value, input it, then scroll down to the final value, input that, then scroll back to the %change display, and FINALLY, press = to get your answer. Sheesh!
B0010SKUYM|2|I wish I had been aware that this was written for the teen market before I began.  The main character is certainly full of himself and at times, ridiculously arrogant.<br />It's as if the author had to make him the smartest and wisest and cleverest because the story was so weak.  The author is no GRRM.
B002LLE3PY|5|It's amazing how the sound was improved in the new mix. Some of the songs (Lady of the danzing water, for example) are completely renewed. Compared with the 30th aniversary edition, this it's like switch from a LP to a DVD.<br />I can't even wait for Islands!!!!
B00005QIPH|5|Just as it is describe.

B00684J49U|5|Love this series.
B00BSBR9N6|5|It was happy, light reading.  I loved that the main character had Asberger's and though differently, accomplished all his life goals.  Anyone would like it and as a bonus, x-rated it wasn't
B004UID2LC|3|Not quite what I wanted which was a portal to YouTube but with the ongoing software wars it is all I could get with my Kindle.
B00003Q43A|3|Let's face it...&quot;Independence Day&quot; is about as mindless an entertainment as you can get, but it IS entertainment, and it works beautifully on that level.<br />&quot;Independence Day&quot; is like a 1970's  disaster flick with $50 million in F/X. Things get blowed up real good  indeed...so good, in fact, that the movie loses a LOT of steam after things  stop getting blowed up. <br />Still, &quot;Independence Day&quot; is a lot of  fun, and features some funny performances (especially Will Smith, who  actually trash-talks one of the alien invaders as he drags him across the  desert). <br />But the point of this movie IS watching things get blowed up  real good.<br />And that it does well.
B008JGSM6G|5|The game comes off as quite easy and there are many levels that are very easy.<br />The game does get more difficult, though, and is quite fun.
B005XQLBU4|4|good game is very funny but the graphics are poor anyway I recommend this app if u are bored about your work jejej
B00PTB7B34|5|Very very fun
B000SEIKIW|5|Since picking up Briefer History of Time, I have found myself wishing that I had a physics teacher in high school who was just a fraction of the teacher Stephen Hawking must be.  As someone who has in the past had no interest in the sciences, this book has aroused my curiosity in a way I never thought would be possible.  I'm already planning to read Hawking's Grand Design and Brian Green's Elegant Universe immediately after this.  I now fully regret not taking more science courses in college!
B000002UAU|2|Almost the entire album is mediocre and not worth a purchase. The lyrics and melodies are infantile and grating, not to mention repetitive. When I hear songs like Lovely Rita, or Good Morning, Good Morning, I cant help but  think they are best suited for kindergardeners. The one exception to the  album is &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, one of my favorite songs of all  time. This song is brilliant beyond description or compare, and redeems  this album, making it a necessary purchase, unless you're willling to tape  that one song. Why this unbelievable mediocrity is so praised is beyond me.  When you hear it I'm sure you will agree.
B005LAIHCM|4|I saw the screening for the film in early February. The studio told the fans to not discuss the movie (obviously so people wouldn't reveal the spoilers, and in case of any bad publicity).<br /><br />Well either way, I found the movie to be very good. Almost reminded me of the exploitation flicks from the 70s and 80s starting with the title \\"House on the end of the street\\". The movie comes complete with a great twist that as well  reminded me of a specific flick from the 80s (Sleep**** **** see if you can figure it out).<br /><br />Plot: Setup is pretty simple. Mother and daughter Elissa and Sarah (Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence) move to a new place. Daughter develops feelings for the boy next door Ryan (Max Thieriot). The boy allegedly has a crazy sitter that might of murdered her parents. Elissa gets together with Ryan unaware of the danger she faces, and unaware that both Ryan and Carrie Ann<br /><br />The acting was very good. Obviously a good cast here: Elizabeth Shue, Jennifer Lawrence, Gil Bellows, Max Thieriot.<br /><br />The movie gets you thinking that things will turn out one away, but ends up ending another way. I thought the twist they came up was very good, and it was set up very well that no one saw it coming. So many movies claim that in their trailer, but this is one actual flock with an ending that most people didn't see coming.<br /><br />The soundtrack was good too. Pretty much it establish the dark atmosphere and that things will take a turn for the worse in many scenes.<br /><br />I got the benefit of an early screening, but I would definitely recommend it along with the along users who have seen it.
B00RNRD8RA|5|Although the humor was sophomoric at many points, it was still hilarious and relevant and clever.  Loved it!  Watched it twice in the rental period!

B005K0HDGE|4|Great read that takes you back to life in the late 50s/early 60's. While the story slows a bit in the middle, King does a great job building suspense towards the story's climax, and throwing in an ending I did not see coming.
B008BQ8YHQ|5|Great characters and great plots.
0061684384|5|I became a fan of Kat's the first time I saw her on Miami Ink and have followed her since then. She is much more suited where she is now with down to earth people surrounding her. Don't get me wrong, Ami James is a very talented tattoo artist, but one who is pretentious and let his \\"star\\" status add to that. Kat is just Kat.  I had the honor of meeting her and my book is signed by her. She is more beautiful in person and a genuine person. She ROCKS!

0679405631|3|You have 50 reviews for this book (the woman in white) which total 4 1/2 stars out of 5 - enough to really pique my curiosity.  But I quickly realized most of the reviews seem to be for other books (there's one for a Steven King book for example).  I was really interested in buying this book until I realized that most of the reviews are for other books.
B00AN0KGWE|5|Twists and turns, gore and guts. Mesmerizing, action packed and addicting. I recommend the show but not for children's eyes as there is an abundance of frontal nudity and graphic beheadings.

B004EBZX6W|5|WOW what useful app.  Now when my device won't load a page I can tell immediately whether it's the network OR the page (or the server the page is on).  Helped me actually diagnose a problem with my home network.
B00065GX64|5|This famous Fritz Lang classic is about a child murderer in Germany who finally meets justice not at the hands of the authorities but by fellow undesireables.  <br />The story is said by many  to be loosely based on the true story of the vampire of Dusseldorf .  <br />However the murderer in this movie  is not only a monster, he is a complex character that is also somewhat charming and childlike himself. So when we are not being repulsed by him we might find ourselves identifying him. Indeed when he stands in judgement before a judge and jury of criminals he might indeed be seen as a symbol of all humanity. <br />The movie is  a watershed  in film making in many ways and was perhaps the first successful \\"talkie\\" of the continent.  <br />The  short title is the one that made it through the Nazis censors who would not allow the  word 'murder\\" or \\"murderer\\"(or in this case the working title of the movie which was \\"Murderer are Among Us\\") in the title of a movie.   <br />It stars Peter Lorre who was more famous at the time as a surrealist than as a member of the movie trio that included  Humprey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet.  <br />The murders occur in squlid neighborhoods and this adds to making the movie quite atmospheric.  <br />The police in trying to track the murderer down use what were at that time modern investigative techiques making this moive the the grandfather to all crime movies and TV crime dramas. <br />But this is more than just an atmospheric murder mystery as it was a veiled but direct attack on the culture of the Nazi regime as well as a philosophicl discourse and an exploration of the human psyche. <br />This edition includes a second a DVD with commentary by Fritz Lang (who was himself no stranger to surrealism) , William Friedkin and others. <br />Highly recommended. <br />
B00PRXAP8M|1|Boring
B006LG7O38|4|I was surprised, but this film was very good. The original is my favorite, but this remake was very enjoyable and worth the rent.
B00HDMMISA|5|This book made me laugh out loud so many times that I was almost wary of reading it in waiting rooms and other public places. Then as it went along it made me think deeply and completely fall in love w the characters. And the weaving together of all the plot lines was so well done with an ending that I did NOT see coming. So fun.
B007KQ6XYY|1|This application does not work at all on a Samsung Galaxy S3.  Although you can get to the loading screen, it just loops back to the menu. I liked the original, so this was a huge disappointment.
B005S1Y44Y|5|I love this recording of Queen perhaps the best.  But I like many other ones that they did also.  This is a great sounding CD.  There is great dynamics in this one.
B00APUQPX6|4|You just can't go wrong with any of the Ice Age movies. Very funny and heartwarming stories always. I always just love Scrat and his trials in getting his nut.
B000N3ST9I|2|This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. I hardly enjoy listening to this album.<br />I hardly recommend this album. Addy.

B00UVCHZ3W|4|Classic Clapton. This guy's a rock and blues standard for the ages.
078322687X|4|Great movie to re-identify with your younger self if you grew up in the 80's or 90's, even still relevant to kids today though the technology is more advanced the social pressures of growing up are always timeless.
B00000JR2A|5|Tears 4 Fears is one of thee most underrated  bands of all time hands down! I feel that they never got their just do like other bands from the 80's.Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal is underrated singers and song wrighters \\"Thoes white boys have soul like black foke\\" in other words they can sang not sing their is a difference.I have all their cd's now and I'am waiting for a follow up on Everybody loves a happy ending,I hope they do another CD......nuff said
0802130208|5|A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES is decidedly a modern classic.  If you know New Orleans, it's like being there.  If you don't know New Orleans, you'll finally know what that corner of heaven is like!  Full of the best dunces on earth.
B00BNGFGIQ|4|This game is fun that's why I gave a 4 but it takes forever to unroll the monkey and shoots wrong

0385335482|3|This light read is one I almost wanted to put behind a plain brown wrapper.  However, there is \\"something\\" quite engaging about the Lucille Ball antics of the main character.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Great movie kids love it and has a very important massage great movie for the family friends and gift ideas
B00HXYKYIE|3|Very interesting to read.  Elephant information is fantastic. But the ending is.far.fetched
B003XF1XOQ|4|The conclusion to this series was uneven and the ending chapters were disjointed and left more questions than answers.  It was still an interesting read, but not as good as the first two books in my opinion.
B000OZ0NXA|5|Like it, Reacher's rules are wicked, but remind me of my military friends. I want to hit the road rescuing the weak, winning all fights, never doing laundry...Not a Joseph Cambell hero, but a hero nether the less.
B00688628M|5|Great series!
B00003CXBK|5|Arrived really fast, and exactly as it said it would. No scratches, looked like new.
B00S17FZ7C|5|nice song that sticks in your head all day
B00KA87GCW|5|Great game full of farming fun..
B0014DQSGW|4|Fun lighthearted, good acting  suited my mood that night - refreshing after The Perfect Storm which was great but intense
B003VANOFY|4|I have had this headset for about 2 years now. The sound is amazing, and the battery life is surprisingly really long.<br /><br />The only issue I have had with it is the micro USB port actually stop working on it. It will eventually pull itself out using logitech's charging cable. I had to RMA mine twice because of this issue. Logitech was very helpful getting a new pair to me without cost both times. Since I've used my Kindle charging cable to charge it and I have had no issues. The only thing I can think of is that the cables latching system is way to tight and will slowly tear out your USB port over time.
B00005QDW5|5|This is an excellent collection of Pink Floyd's work, not only because it spans their entire career and features a heavy dose of pre-\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" recordings, but also because it provides a fresh perspective on the material. For those of us who have listened to these songs in their original formats a thousand times, it's refreshing to hear \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" now roll into \\"Time\\" instead of \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" or hear \\"One of These Days\\" flow into \\"Us and Them.\\" It's like hearing it all brand new, and only a couple of the new mixes sound at all forced. I wouldn't give up the original albums for all the tea in China, but this collection gives me an alternative way of experiencing Floyd's uniquely homogeneous style. The highlight for me is the string of \\"Echoes,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Marooned,\\" \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" on disc 1. This would make half of a great concept album all by itself.    That having been said, this clearly sets the stage for another collection, because a number of essential Floyd tracks--including \\"Run Like Hell,\\" \\"Not Now John,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" and \\"Have A Cigar\\"--are missing. Can you say Echoes II? Let's hope.
B008JFUQ16|5|Great movie, found it less expensive here than in store.
B00CJKW4WQ|5|Using this on 2 Macs and couldn't be happier.  I missed not having a numeric keypad at times and this filled the void.  Also like that I can use it as a quick calculator as well.
B007UQRW62|5|My wife loves this movie and the blu ray is fantastic! The umbrella is a little silly but a nice touch.
B0012YYZYK|5|One of THE best live performances ever captured on film of one of the best rock bands of all time. A must have for a music fans collection!
B008Z9YGEE|4|Overall, I'd say that this movie does a fairly good job of taking the book and translating it to the big screen. But, there are some significant differences. In the book, everything is shown from the point of view of the main character, where her experiences, thoughts and feelings are the only way you know what is happening. I realize that kind of viewpoint wouldn't translate well in a movie, where you have to see the characters and how they interact with each other. Partly because of this, the book is much more intense than the movie. Don't get me wrong, I still liked the movie. And if you liked the book, you'll probably want to see the movie, just to see the characters brought to life. And even if you have never read the book, you would probably still want to see the movie. I'm looking forward to the next part.
B00A2DOKLU|5|love,love, love this cd, cant stop bumping it in my car, with my system it sounds so nice
B000O8OTNC|4|I use these for hunting and fishing backups because of their small size.  You won't get as sharp an edge as with a more traditional sharpener, but they are fine if you need to touch up a blade in the field.
B0065GC0BA|5|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND FELT VERY CLOSE TO THE HEROS.  I LOVED LOU AND FELT A GREAT DEAL OF EMPATHY AND ADMIRATION FOR WIL.  TERRIFIC READ
B00AQF8CJ0|5|This is a really fun and addicting game. I highly recommend this game  for when you need some &quot;down time.&quot;
B0028ER4PU|5|sounded perfect!!!
B00C8S9W0G|5|excellent book that ties all the threads together..<br />truely an entertaining read. I highly 'recommend the entire series. well done
B000065U1N|2|Hopefully Blockbuster will let me return this DVD with receipt and get a credit on the special edition when it comes out. The movie is a must see, but rent it until a better DVD comes out. I've soaked up about as much information as I could regarding this historical event. The DVD offers nothing more than a short behind the scenes featurette. <br />Buy the book, see the movie, and don't ever forget this story. It is possibly the most important event in modern American history, and guys like Randy Shugart, Gary Gordon, Mike Durant and the thousands of other guys like them should never be forgotten.<br />It's single minded purpose is its greatest strength. Steven Spielberg should take note of Ridley Scott's historic achievement in film making, and so should you.<br />God bless our Armed Forces.
B005LY4B0A|4|This game looks and runs great on my Epic 4g but looks like a mess on my Asus Transformer tablet. Dropped a star for that. PLEASE FIX. The concept is original and a refreshing change of pace from other games.
B000062YB1|5|I have said it a thousand times before, I am partial to SLAYER, and yes, I own this album as well, and it kicks ___!! It is loud, aggressive, and well put together, what more can you ask from a death metal record!! BUY IT...and again, if ya don't like blame the &quot;D3V14NT&quot; one!!
B00DJFIMW6|5|Lots of fun. Keeps you engaged for long periods of time. It also includes a pause button so you can stop it without losing  progress.
0062082353|5|Great read!  One of America's heroes that nobody knows, sad the media would not cover his memorial.  Buy a copy you will be trilled to have a copy of this book.
B00PSID6ZK|5|This game is so adorable.It is way better than &amp;#34;my talking Tom&amp;#34; LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!
B0011Z5IVE|5|There are few better complete albums than this. It is a must have for any rock music collection. Buy it, buy it, then buy it again.
B001HNE3NO|5|I watched the movie although the book has a lot more details the movie is just as heartbreaking. it is so sad I think about it everyday it really changes you makes you think of putting yourself in Sarah's position. I recommend it to everyone.
B00JOLNTTK|5|Fun and challenging.
B001NA6096|2|The female lead has charisma.  The whole movie just left me feeling like I watched somebody's weird, uncomfortable blind date, and yet they made a continuation of these. I dont get it. I was totally bored.
B004SBS8LA|5|My now 6 year old granson started playing Angry Birds when the game first came out. Since then, he got me to start playing it too. We have several versions plus Angry Birds Go! They are all fun.
B007IXWKUK|4|I chose to rate this book four out of five stars because while the first book was okay,I enjoyed this one so much more. The first book angered me because Ana was constantly complaining about her relationship, but would never walk out and leave. This book has all the aspects. Love, happiness, anger, sex, terror, danger, drama. Not to mention Christian revealing his past. Was great!
B00004T8RK|5|It is easy to tell why some may find this record below what they are used to from PJ.  The fact is this that Binaural is an excellent album that shows where Pearl Jam has been and is going.  The range of songs capitlized the band's skill and commitment to rock&roll.  The album rocks out from the beginning and then soars through deep, rocking, slow and acoustic songs. The variety is excellent. Some of the highlight tracks are Breakerfall, Gods Dice, Evacuation, Light Years, Nothing As it Seems, Thin Air, Of a Girl, Grievance, Insignificance, Rival, Sleight of Hand, Soon Forget, Parting Way.... that's right! ALL OF THEM! This album is a must have if you are consider yourself a fan of music.
B00003CX95|5|As a film, this is truly an awe-inspiring masterpiece that joins the ranks of great classics like &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;. Paramount did an  excellent job in bringing this movie to DVD. The picture is clear and  pristine due to the anamorphic enhancement &amp; widescreen formatting  which is required to convey the beauty of the film's various expansive wide  landscape shots of the Scottish valleys. Audio soundtrack is richly  detailed and expansive in its use of surround effects which adds the effect  of &quot;being there&quot; especially during the brutal battle scenes.  James Horner's music score comes through just beautifully. One aspect of  this dvd I really enjoyed is the audio commentary track by the director  himself Mel Gibson. He was very cordial, humorous, and at times very  informative about the whole affair of making this movie. Just listening to  Mel Gibson talk while viewing this movie made it feel as if you were  watching it with a down-to-earth friend. You'll get a kick out of it. Trust  me! There is one thing though: I just wish Paramount had included the TV  clips from the Academy Awards show of Mel Gibson receiving the Oscars and  his acceptance speech. The entire crew &amp; Mel Gibson himself so richly  deserved the Oscars the film won and including those Oscar clips in this  DVD's supplements would have been icing on the cake. This DVD is a  no-brainer, you can't get any better than this.
B00RLK35ZE|5|Love love love it!  History, drama, suspense, action and romance.  This series has everything! Beloved the books and now love being able to see it on screen.  Follows the books amazingly!
B00CH3DBNQ|5|I enjoyed the way the story was developed. very interesting to hear facts from someone other than the local news.
B00AIUUXHC|5|Great game. Easy and fun.
B000A78Z82|5|Another reviewer praised a song on this record for McCartneyesque-whatever.   Its 2006, D.B is a star now, and Paul McCartney doesn't really have new output thats interesting for anyone outside of the VFW bluehaired crowd. Cripple Crow, believe me I know, is brilliant in every conceivable way, even in making reviewers who dont like it realize what sad pathetic lives they have sitting around listening to 70 year olds who had their glory in 1960 and retired and old 28Special vinyls or whoever that is.  Cripple Crow isnt for the fans of has beens but rather fresh and really truly more genuinally psychedelic than any crap from some retired old guy sir mccartsaschmuck could ever make even in his prime, who was a beatle...and Banhart doesnt need Beetles or wings or some kinda concept hogwash \\"band\\".  When the whole \\"band is the guys name...thats like when the band isn't the star but the guy whose name provides the name of said band...like really great this is like great.  Believe me i know.  Its nothing like paul whateverhisname is, or some worn out old crap, or the geriatric stones who everyone goes around saying \\"ooooo, the new one rocks!!!\\"  Like yeah, rocks like mullet and bic lighter concert crowd \\"wow ma, kickass. can i get a mullet too like your loser alcoholic boyfriend?!!!\\"-rocks.  No, this really rocks,  and doesn't smell like \\"some old guy shoulda retired and invested money in a restaurant chain\\" mildew(i.e: not fresh) But rocks like ?\\"yeah im fresh and was born in the last decade or three.\\" -rocks. <br />  Not to rip on \\"\\"Paul-ese\\" McCart that awful sounding rubbish outta here\\" - Ney\\"\\"    but theres no basis for comparison. <br />If a movie was made that needded the good stuff we'de want this, not the easy rider soundtrack,   like its silly.  This is good and was recorded by someone young and fresh with new ideas. Dont listen to fools just buy it.  Trust me im good and listen to music thats really good.  Im from L.A. too and still dont say \\"ooooo it reminded me of the melodious solo wrok of Paul mccart-who? or worse yet Brian wilson.   Plllllleeeease.  So darn good.
B001AR4K8K|5|this movie is as good as the first time I saw it, many, MANY years ago!  If you enjoy vampire movies you are sure to love this...the humor is wonderful....the setting is perfect....It has a little more gore in it than I would have liked....but the humor more than makes up for it.
B00000K3D4|5|Good movie
B0020BUWX2|5|Can't wait to read the next one! Mesmerizing leaves you with its to think about and look forward. Will rent the DVDS soon.
B007THA4FI|1|There are so many words in the English dictionary to use without using the&#34;f&#34; word.  I have no recommendation to give for this book!
B00CHVJODE|5|rented this movie at first and was waiting for price to come down. so when i saw it as a 5$ lightning deal i had to have it!
1932907009|5|Recommend this book for everyone contemplating writing a script. It sets everything out in simplest of terms and makes the whole process fun.
B00CICZ7ZQ|5|shipped on time.  Works great.
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this it's awesome and u should totally get it. Maybe u should get the beginning to be faster when it has the chicken before hipster whale but that's all I ask for soo addicting
B00AZMFO9U|3|Poor ending.  It needed more music, we were short changed here.  Some parts humorous, but in the end this is a forgettable movie.
B004UID2LC|5|I really enjoy this app at home. I can download any video from youtube I want. I have like 35 music videos and 19 episodes of Fullmetal Alchemist.
B003KRJNBW|5|I loved it. Densel Washington played a wonder part, he was ruthless but also very kind. I think put a thought into the making of this movie.
B00127RAJY|5|I got this DVD in the mail and ran in to try it! You see and feel immediate results. Jillian keeps you motivated the whole time! I love to do my workouts all the time! I can't wait to do them and I am seeing positive results! HIGHLY recommend it! Totally kicks you butt!!!
B00CQZ65SI|5|Good insight of how food/diet has helped him in becoming the world best tennis player. Hecomes across as genuinely wanting the reader to want to follow his advice.
B00008H2LB|2|two words: talent, ingenuity<BR>i used to be a fan of LP till i learnd a little bit on the gitar, then listend to their album again and realized how much this band lacks both of them. <BR>This album shows how overused crappy electronica work can fool you kids into thinking this band can actually play an instrument.<BR>The rock parts are unbeliveably bland, and the rap parts are even blander if that could be at all possible. <BR>Emotion? Hell, any band can make corperatized, recycled and shrink wrapped in FMized lyrics that appeal to gajillion and a half 13 year olds and call it emotional. Phh, i can get more real emotion out of C-SPAN and CNN. This album is bull****
B009UX2YAC|5|This app is awesome and a really fun thing to pass the time I do youtube and people on my channel love it<br />And it is free
B00IUBXPEY|1|I'm tired of movies that quit for the sake of another sequel. No ending to speak of. Not holding my breath for the next one. Saw all this in the last one.
B000GCFX36|4|I thought the story was mindless & insipid at first, but compelling enough to continue & I'm so glad I did because it got better & better!!  It was very insightful and enjoyable!
B00006IM9Q|5|This is a great album.  It is not clear how I am to review the seller since he wasn't singing or playing an instrument.  He got it to me fast and in good condition.
B002IFT1ZA|5|Awesome is all I can say.  Can't wait for season 2.  Love all the characters and the lands they all are from.
0804139024|5|How many things do you have to think of, and then actually do successfully, to keep yourself alive on Mars?  A crewman stranded with assorted mission leftovers faces this problem with a level of ingenuity and skill that is, frankly, superhuman.  That he maintains throughout a wry sense of humor about his predicament makes him a Superhero.  And it's no accident.  When Whatney is in contact with his crew, it finally comes out; \\"Iron Man, Commander, *Iron Man* [italics]\\"  Bruce Downey Jr couldn't have said it better.  But none of his extraordinary resourcefulness interferes with the hero's humanity, because, as in most successful novels, deviations from everyday reality are unimportant.  This is especially true of Sci-Fi.  Despite the implausibility, you are completely drawn into the story.  All of the characters live.<br /><br />If you are bored by repeated ingenious solutions to technical problems, this book is not for you.  But if somewhere inside you there lurks even a spark of the soul of an engineer, you will love it.
B0065GC0BA|5|I read a great deal, but only occasionally is there a book that is so outstanding that it is memorable for a very long time. \\"Me Before You\\" was one of those books.<br />From the very beginning I was drawn into the life of this young woman and the very unusual situation in which she found herself. Obviously, the content was very well researched and therefore very informative.<br /><br />The ending was not surprising and probably could not have been different. I was enthralled to the last page and sorry when it was over.  Incredible!!
B000JSI7AI|5|When I first saw Brokeback with my two best friends, I was about fourteen years old. All three of us appreciated it and were torn by the ending, (especially my friend who spent most of the movie gushing over Jake Gyllenhaal) but I didn't give it a whole lot of thought until a few months ago when I realized how powerful a film it really is. I borrowed it from my friend and watched it and it instantly re-captivated me.    I watched it about three times in one week, noticing new symbolism and meaning each time in the phrases and actions of the characters. I noticed that the looks Jack and Ennis give one another when they first begin herding together are more than just obligatory. After reading Roger Ebert's helpful and honest review, I realized that Ennis really was taught to hate himself from an early age because of his upbringing. Some Japanese amazon reviews taught me to see that, when Ennis first finds his and Jack's shirts, Jack's is embracing Ennis', whereas at the end of the film, Ennis has his own shirt embracing Jack's. One thing I noticed on my own was that, (however obvious it might have been to others who have seen the film it took me a while to get it...) in the scene where Ennis is longingly holding the intertwined shirts, he is, 'in the closet', so to speak.    This is not to say that I have reached a 'conclusion' as to whether Jack and Ennis were gay, bi or straight. I simply don't believe they need to be labeled as anything for that could very well distract from what this film really is about ~ genuine love. The harshness, cruelty and unforgiving-ness of society has crippled many, and Jack and Ennis are no exception. Taking into account their upbringing and environment, theirs was a love that never would have made sense to anyone around them, including Ennis himself. Though they may have cheated on their wives, they were cheated first by society out of what could have been an everlasting happiness. I have now realized that Ennis fell in love with Jacknot because he was gay or straight, but because it was Jack. Jack entered Ennis' life like a gust of wind and left just as abruptly and was the only true love Ennis would ever experience. It's just a shame Ennis was unable to escape his past and the way he was taught.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|AWESOME!
B002TWWOHE|5|Liked it so much I bought all 5 seasons.
B009NG1Q96|4|41/2 stars. This book was amazing along with the first one. I cried when she cried for Marlee. I was happy when she went for Maxon instead of Aspen. I fell in love with this book along with the first. I stayed awake late into the night to finish. I can't wait to read the third!
B00E8KLWB4|4|liked it a lot. have it on my tablet as well. well be looking at other games like this one.
B000002MU3|4|Item as described.  Thank you!
B003B02O14|4|Grisham does it again.  When you think you have it figured out he will throw in a twist.  Great read as would be expected. Intriguing characters and captivating plot.  Enjoy!
B000MQC9H4|5|good movie!!!
B006XF5BTG|5|I have been doing as this book says. It was been working for me. I recommand this book to anyone and everyone.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Interesting, sensitive, beautifully written.  Doerr's characters try to find their way in a world gone mad, each touched by the mysterious musical broadcast from an unknown source.
B00004RYZT|1|This is ****NOT*** NTSC as advertised but PAL.  Won't play in US DVD players.  You have to use computer to see video.<br /><br />5 stars for video.  1 Star for getting description wrong.
B00IU0M85C|5|I got hooked on this show unexpectedly, I was going through withdrawals from Teen Wolf (yes, I got addicted to that show and I'm 45!!) and I happened to come upon this.  The lead character Tatiana Maslany is amazing, at first, I thought she was going to be one of those characters that you never liked, that basically was a bitch but nope...Tatiana or Sarah is not only a great actress but she is incredibly talented in the area of playing different roles.  Without giving too much away, Tatiana has to play at least 9 different roles in this series and does it with conviction.  If you like espionage, mystery coupled with science fiction and a bit of romance thrown in.....check this series out! Oh and one more thing, I love how open minded the writers of this show are, there is a lesbian relationship on the show and a strong gay character.  Outstanding characters that are not one dimensional and over time, make you want to stand up and say &#34;Yes!!  You can do it! Kick that bad guys/gals butt!!!!&#34;
B00S24RT3C|5|When I first heard that the new Sufjan album would be a return to his folk roots, I was a little disappointed. While I have long enjoyed Sufjan’s folkier albums, The Age of Adz is one of my all-time favorite records. I couldn’t help but hope we’d get something similar to that.<br /><br />Fortunately, Carrie & Lowell does not disappoint in any way. From the opening guitar on “Death with Dignity,” it’s obvious that this is one of the most beautiful albums in recent memory--and perhaps ever. Sufjan is at the top of his game musically, lyrically, and vocally. The album flows together perfectly, drawing the listener into a deep and heartfelt experience. However, each track also can stand alone as a great song.<br /><br />“Death with Dignity” and “Fourth of July” might be the highlights, but this is really an album that works so well together that it’s almost criminal to break it up. The entire album is perfect. I’d list the best songs or do a track-by-track analysis, but there’s no need. This is simply flawless. The musicianship is so rich and gorgeously layered. As much as I love The Age of Adz, Michigan, and Seven Swans, this is Sufjan’s true masterpiece.<br /><br />Because it is such a quiet album, some listeners may treat it as background music, but this is an album that really begs for complete immersion. It’s criminal not to give it your full attention and really listen to the rich music, beautiful lyrics, and minimal production. When you spin Carrie & Lowell, do yourself a favor and give your undivided attention to Sufjan. This is a record that rewards the listener again and again. An instant classic of profound and elegant musical beauty. Sufjan Stevens has really set himself apart from all other singer-songwriters of our generation.

B001GXF2YY|5|Excellent book!  Another great Harry Bosch novel where the twists and turns keep you turning the pages and the ending something you didn't see coming.  As always, cannot wait to read the next one in the series.  Michael Connelly has done an awesome job of creating the character of Harry Bosch and keeping him true to form throughout all of the books.  He isn't always predictable, but his personality and background are maintained.<br /><br />This book takes a look at the death of a lawyer in the middle of a lawsuit against the LAPD.  It will keep you guessing all the way!
B00F1BFRA6|5|Big fan of this series. Quality product.
B00000IL1K|5|I've never experienced Sarah other than 'All I Ask of You' from the Phantom.  Where have I been hiding all this time! Eden is absolutely wonderful, peaceful, relaxing, and to say the least, mesmerizing. Now that  I've awaken to the beauty of Sarah..I'll be adding new CD's to my  collection.
B001CDZZI6|4|I've taken many personality inventories, but this focused on some new categories, some of which seem to incorporate particularly feminine strengths.
B00003CX8Y|2|Shipping was great but I am disappointed because one of the disks skips
B0076DEJMO|2|That pretty much sums up an Abercrombie novel. This is how you end the life of one of the most      interesting characters in fantasy literature?His writing creates great visual imagery but I never like what I see.Ever see a      a beautiful spring day in any of his stories? Fat chance! To the discount rack with you!
B009CRLTVG|5|How can anyone remember his life in such detail? Rushdie must have kept notes daily. The book is better than any made-up fiction I have ever read. I read the book on Kindle, so I don't know whether there is a glossary of names. What a fascinating picture of the literary world it gives! Now maybe I should read something else that Mr.Rushdie has written!
B000XUBFE2|5|This book broke my heart, but I could not put it down. A wrenching but beautifully written story. Recommend it, but maybe not for the faint of heart.
B009QW7K5Q|2|Female lead character is weak and hypocritical.
B00KY7PEAA|5|Great and fun game for anyone of all ages
B003V6L94Q|5|Receipt of cd was done in short time.  Ordering from Amazon is very easy and they take care of packaging.  Pleased with the music on the cd and would order again.
B00A8ECU24|5|This is a fun little game, and quite immersive (even if it isn't canon).  It's definitely great for killing time with, and features a nice mix of organizational building (a la Total Domination) and touchscreen mini-games.<br /><br />The standard cooldowns and 'currencies' of varying rarity are included (as per any free app with in-app purchases) but they are less noticeable to me than in other apps.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this app for bronies, and kid sisters would definitely get a kick out of the mini-games, though the organizational bit would probably bore younger audiences.
B00688628M|5|Wonderful.
B0049J3QF4|1|I rented this for my son cause I accidently deleted cars from our DVR and I figured thr would buy me some time to get to the store to buy it on DVD. My child watches this on a loop 24/7 and has a melt down when he can't. So it sucked majorly when after watching it one time it said he had no more time to watch it. When I rented it it said 48 hour rental so I assumed that ment we could watch however many time he wants in 48 hours. I guess that's not the case.
034580404X|4|I enjoyed this triolgy and am glad I bought the set.I would recommend this triolgy to anyone who loves a good character study.
B000002KH3|4|What a great effort by VAN HALEN!Great songs like &quot;ain't talking 'bout love&quot; and &quot;little dreamer&quot; and great guitar works by EVH.Eddie was not only a great guitar player but the one who affected many  other rock and metal musicians.I believe that this is their greatest  alboum.The only negative things are the short lenght of the songs (that's  too american for me)and the mediocre performance of David roth.
B004V5A7K8|5|I love this game on my Kindle Fire.....it works very well on this device and it becomes an addictive game!
B00KY7PEAA|1|Its impossible to get stuff in this game. The only way to progress through this game is by buying resources and upgrades. Heck they even put in a hot girl in the ads to make them buy this crap!
B002BSHWUU|5|This is the best compilation of music from the greatest band ever! Classic!! An absolute must-have for all ages!!!  John, Paul, George, and Ringo will always be THE FAB 4!
B0064X7FVE|5|the weather channel app is very cool originally they didn't put in radar's now since I updated it there is more than I hoped for truely this app is cooler than any other weather app in the amazon store anyways enjoy this app
B00FF9SKSK|4|I have enjoyed all the fast & furious series, these have been by far my favorite movie franchise of all the time!!
B000XUBFE2|5|I usually speed read but that was impossible and it would have been a crime to rush through this amazing story.  The Book Thief is one of the best stories ever written.  The tenderness is raw and heartfelt with every character, but especially Leisel, the main character.  The ingeniousness is using death as the narrator.  I hear they're making a movie out of this novel.  read the book first.
B00GINENG0|4|I like all talking cat games but I do not think it is the best<br />It could really be better still it is an ok game to play it is good
B00AREIAI8|4|This is a great game. I love the detail and accuracy but unicorns-really? Make it more interactive in the next update and have girl characters.
B006AX6ONI|5|nice
B004LWZWGK|1|Product not properly mixed for sound or picture, for example; home theater setting with a set sound level - during action scenes the sound is deafening while on dialogue scenes sound is too low to discern dialogue. For picture - the size shifts many times from full screen to wide screen with the black bars displayed. Most annoying. This is a replacement as the first DVD had the same problems. Poor editing and mixing. Not recommended. Review is for Blu-ray DVD, have not used regular DVD.<br /><br />Update.  Review was too kind. This is a knockoff, has to be a counterfeit as no established studio would market a video with the lack of video and sound mixing this dvd has.
6304698542|5|This film is so damn atmospheric it's creepy. Fosse was becoming known as a great director at the time this film was made and rightfully so. The opening number alone is pure bliss. And even though characters were added and songs replaced it doesn't diminish this film from the stage production in the least. Liza is truly a damn good actress who was never truly appreciated. Her performance is so heart-tugging that it makes your hair stand on end. But the basis for this film isn't romance but the deconstruction of it. From the begining the images are striking and harsh even when a beautiful number is sung the lighting/dancing is never truly expressed and that is what life is and Fosse knew it all along-that no matter how free you say you are with your persona nobody wants their life out in the open for all to see. Life is cabaret and that's where we all live, inside one. Lit just enough so we let people peer in but dark enough to hide our most telling emotions. A must own! The lessons Sally Bowles (Minnelli) learns and lives through whilw working in the sexualy charged Kit Kat Klub are only matched by the growing power of the Nazi party that is grwoing around her in 1931 Berlin!
B0054JZC6E|2|initially the ads were not too intrusive but now they have gotten so annoying that I'm prob going to uninstall. games are good time passers but some don't work properly.
B00023B1AS|5|I'm amazed at how much power these two guys can produce out of just a pair of guitars, and it's not noise power, it's rockin, dancehall, don't mess with Texas kind of power. The videos are excitingly illustrated with leggy 80s' girls and classic cars that make your heart race, and add joy to any party. This collection is timeless and time-honored. Get off your Tush and get out La Grange because you don't want to miss the show.
0321344758|1|Bought because it was on Joel on Software's reading list. Clear and simple, easy to understand. If picked up in a shop, I would not have bought it.    - not much content, lots of whitespace, large fonts, lots of images  - common sense (ie, most of it you probably already know)    Read a few pages, then sent it to a friend who is building her first website.
B00BD99JMW|5|This book is awesome! It has action and romance, the perfect combination for a great, exciting, and heart wrenching book!!!-
B005TBN3EU|2|Beautiful scenery, and cute monkey - but too much over the top DARK drug related humor.  Too raunchy and not silly enough.  The best scene is the father-in-law speech.
B0039208JE|5|They did a good job on this blu-ray, great extras from the dvd, sound is great and so is picture. No dts, however as the dvd had.
B00HBQWGXK|5|Excellent
B00821OX98|3|I've only watched a couple episodes but good thus far
B00IOVH8AW|5|I love this song it makes me smile and happy. My grandsons and I love to sing along with it.
0800125789|5|great
B004AKCME8|5|This is a good movie I watched it with my Grandsons, and they took it to school for  movie time, everyone loved it. great movie.
B00BK5D95C|5|I heard about this through a friend and then again through NPR. First I couldn't get &#34;Tesselate&#34; out of my head. This is one of the most complete albums I've heard in a while. It's the full package. Just let it play through, people.
0061544493|4|This is a fun and light book to read.  For anyone who's a little behind in the fashion know how to..., this book will help you.  It's funny and witty and what you take away from it is that fashion is for everyone not matter what age, size or bank account you have.
B002SSUQFG|5|This watch arrived as described and in great shape. It was easy to set and once I had worn it for about 3 days it kept perfect time. Luminosity is far brighter than I expected and it is easy to read at night. It shows a little small on the wrist and I am on the small side. When I saw it online I thought that I would change the band but the band is actually quite nice for what it is. I may still change it to a leather one later on as some have done but after seeing the one it came with I can wait for awhile.I purchased this when it was on sale and I think it was an absolute steal at the price I paid for it.
B000HL2J0G|5|MacGyver is a one man &#34;Mission Impossible.&#34;  He is always fixing and finding ways to take care of what ever the problem is, just like the old Mission Impossible tv show used to be.  Is intriguing and fun to watch.  You get caught up in the story and outcome.
B002VPE1WK|5|This Backpack seems every bit as well made and well thought out as my much more expensive Tamrac backpack. I decided to get this for some recording equipment that I use, as the padding and design lends itself for that use, but I could just as easily use it for my Canon DSLR with it's lenses and accessories. This is an all around well made and well priced backpack. I am very please with the purchase.
B002KDUDG6|4|Now I will admit that I have never even seriously thought about purchasing a MB cd though I have enjoyed his tv performances. This is just not my kind of music. However in my attempt to branch out a bit, I gave \\"Crazy Love\\" a try and found myself really enjoying the music. From the first beats of \\"Cry Me A River\\" I was hooked. By the time I got to \\"Heartache Tonight\\" and Baby (you've got what it takes) I was a fan. As a person who doesn't like to listen to \\"old standards\\" and song covers, I was skeptical I would enjoy it. But this cd left me in a better happier mood than before I started and I was in a great mood for hours after I stopped listening. Thanks, Michael! I needed that!
0399226907|5|I buy this book five at a time and give it out as baby gifts.  The book teaches the timeless lesson that if you eat until you can't eat anymore, you'll turn into something beautiful.  I take this message to heart.
1401323820|5|The book written by Richard Castle does justice to the series \\"Castle\\" in a great way. I very much enjoyed this book and could imagine the characters as if it was live in front of me just like the series. The interaction between the main charcters was fun and lively.This book left me wanting more!
1446303314|5|I recommend this book and it pattern to who ever enjoy  fairy tales easily understood patterns and beautiful picture of items.
B00ILHW6AG|5|Different from other King novels I've read, but it kept my interest.
B002MQYOFW|5|I'm reading along with our twin 14 year old boys.  This book happens to be mandatory reading for their English grade, so we read and talk about the story. I'm intrigued. So are the twins which makes reading much more enjoyable. We anxious to finish this one and start, Catching Fire.

0895260131|4|John Spencer's book is bold, brash, and horribly beautiful.  Spencer takes the basic tenets of the Muslim faith that we read and hear about through the liberal media and smashes them to smithereens with ease and fortitude.  He asserts that the Islam is a thoroughly violent religion, oppressive to women and close-minded to all other systems of belief; quite the opposite in the perception that we have been given.  To believe that Islam is a peaceful religion and that Muslims get a bad name because of a small sect of fanatics, who are pumped up by the media, thus translating into a gross generalization about Muslims in general.  <br /> <br />Spencer says otherwise.  He takes a particular interest in addressing the Crusades.  He sets up the PC Myths first; that the Crusades were an attempt by White European Catholics, eager for Christian Imperialism, driven by greed and the need for glory, set out from their homeland to convert or kill the peaceful and enlightened Muslims.  That's the myth.  He turns it around and asserts that the Crusades were really a reaction to the 400+ years that Christians were getting persecuted by Muslims.  It tends to make sense that it would be that, as Islam spread violently throughout Asia, North Africa, and spilled over to Spain, only to be supressed by Charles Martel at the Battle Of Tours in the 700's. <br /> <br />Were the Christians right to Crusade to the \\"Holy Land?\\"  That's probably not the right question to ask in regards to this book.  Spencer is attempting to take off the veil off Islam as a peaceful religion and reveal it for what it is, a violent, repressive religion, intolerant of every thing else, whose followers are told to kill all infidels in order that they might earn their salvation.  That is the point that Spencer tries to drive home, and he succeeds.  Is he right?  Is what he is saying valid?  Is his book borne out of hatred and spite, or is it borne out of frustration that the truth is not being told about the Islamicfaith?  I suppose that spite is triggered by the frustration, and that is what we are reading.  The book is littered with lowblows at the Islamic faith, but, they do not come completely undeserved.  In a country where Islam, like Christianity, is secularized, this book will probably raise eyebrows to most for it's bold assertions.  But, they cannot be dismissed, because his assertions are backed by reasons and are illustrated by defining examples.  John Spencer has taken the veil off of Islam by retracing it from it's origins and revealing that it has never changed from one century to the next.  So that can be seen with events like 9/11.  Christians didn't do that, Muslims did.
B00VFTD43A|4|Good movie
B003YL4LYI|5|I purposely took half a year to finish this book and it took a lot of will power! I wasn't disappointed, other than it was over and Mr. Martin still isn't anywhere close to having the next book released. There was some fluff in this book but it didn't take too much away from the storytelling.
B004A8ZWWE|3|Real Steel was the kind of sleeper hit that's a bit refreshing in this day and age of massive blockbuster extravaganzas.  Granted that the film as a whole is a semi-cliche' mellowdrama with rock 'em sock 'em robots, but hey, there's just something about it that just makes you want to see it.  Given that, it doesn't necessarily make Real Steel anything special, and contrary to a majority of viewer's reactions to it, is actually pretty overrated.  Hugh Jackman stars as a down and out robot boxing manager that's stuck reconnecting with his estranged 11 year old son, all the while trying to climb back up the ranks of the robot boxing world.  That's pretty much it in a nut shell, with Lost vet Evangeline Lilly, Anthony Mackie, and Kevin Durand along for the ride too.  The effects are good and the film's action sequences are wonderful, but the overly predictable story and abundance of wanna-be-hipness really hurt the film.  All in all, Real Steel isn't bad, but it's nowhere near as special as many have found it to be.
B003YL4LYI|4|The first three books in this series were excellent.  I could hardly put them down.  The fourth book bored me almost to tears.  This book wasn't quite so boring, but was still not up to the standards of the first three.  I read it because I'm committed to the series.  Lets hope the next book is better.
B00JGMK6VG|5|Yeah, I am a fan. I saw it 8 times in the theater. So, I am gonna say I like it quite a bit.<br /><br />I will also say that I utterly adore the social commentary threaded throughout the comic-book-action.<br /><br />Also, you know, Winter Soldier. Yeah.
0553801473|5|I loved reading A Dance with Dragons, but I certainly did not always enjoy it. In fact, certain parts of the book are so dark they defy the imagination. Defenders of the darkness of the A Song of Ice and Fire series have often compared the books' grittiness to the evil of our own reality. But the world that sprang forth from the mind George R. R. Martin is perhaps even darker than our own miserable planet. Various parts of the book brought forth to mind the horrors of events such as the pestilence of the Black Death, or the cannibalistic doom of the Donner Party, or the psychopathic serial killer Robert Hansen. Seemingly all of the misery that human minds can recall from our wretched history has been marshaled into this single tome.<br /><br />Fans of George R.R. Martin's entire oeuvre will recognize that Martin's hallmark is a fascination with broken, corrupt, and decaying worlds. Throughout his fiction are found worlds that have once tasted grandeur, but have rotted away through the efforts of both time and humanity. The world of A Song of Ice and Fire is no different. Its lands are filled with ruined cities, extinct civilizations, and scattered peoples who squabble over memories.<br /><br />Perhaps it is fair that some question why these books should even be called fantasy when they might just as well be labeled as horror? Some of the passages from A Dance with Dragons are far more horrific than anything Hollywood has produced, perhaps ever. But I totally disagree with the notion that fantasy cannot be horrific as well. Too long have we suffered fantasy literature that dwells endlessly in shining castles. Soon enough, the grand castles, gleaming swords, and sage wizards become bland without some truly horrific stuff to spice it all up. Martin provides us with the spices we all crave. They may burn our mouths when we eat them, but once we have tasted them, we crave them. Not everyone can handle spicy food, and not everyone can handle fantasy books filled to the brim with rape, torture, mutilation, cannibalism, and all the other unpleasantries of life.<br /><br />Even if it can be a little dark, A Dance with Dragons is definitely the most magical and fantastical of the books so far. Bran's portion of the story alone was wonderful to read and would probably have made for a great children's fantasy if not for all the the violence. With the return of dragons to the world, magic and sorcery have been let loose, but never do they overwhelm the human elements of the story. Even the sorceress Melisandre misinterprets her visions and resort to cheap tricks to fool her audience.<br /><br />Another valid criticism of A Dance with Dragons might be that it is not as tightly wound as the first three books were. But it is a criticism that is only valid if one does not consider the narrative structure of the series as a whole. The series began with almost every character of note gathered at Winterfell. Through the many infamous twists and turn of the books, the story has become shattered like a crystal vase smashed into the ground. One cannot give readers so much thrilling death and destruction as Martin did in the first three books without breaking a lot of vases. But what death caused, death can also cure. Many smaller characters died off in A Dance with Dragons, and the pace will probably accelerate through The Winds of Winter.<br /><br />It is valuable to remember that Martin has always loved telling short stories set in his broken worlds. And he could not resist inserting some small stories for secondary characters into A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons. The skeptic will use these as evidence that Martin has \\"lost control of his narrative.\\" I prefer to describe this tendency as \\"just plain awesome.\\" The Chicago Sun-Times once said that A Game of Thrones is \\"an absorbing combination of the mythic, the sweepingly historical, and the intensely personal.\\" Where A Feast for Crows was abound with the personal, it lacked the epic portion of the formula. A Dance with Dragons made the personal stories epic in and of themselves.<br /><br />The book isn't perfect. Martin uses some phrases and words too freely and repetitively. I don't think we've seen the words niello, neeps, or serjeant before in the series, but they show up again and again throughout the book in multiple diverse contexts. The inner thoughts of many characters consists of the same phrases repeated many times over. It's effective but definitely not subtle.<br /><br />To be sure, those who scoff at the old chestnut that \\"The journey is more important than the destination\\" will surely dislike this book. A Song of Ice and Fire is in many ways like the river journey of Tyrion Lannister or that of Abner Marsh in Martin's own Fevre Dream or that of Charles Marlow in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. That is to say, it is a journey into the darkness of the human soul. A Dance with Dragons is but a leg of that journey, offering scant resolution, but heaps of oppressive doom. The coming winter described so vividly in the novel is but a reflection of the descent of the humans of the novel into a self-imposed hell of hatred, fear, hunger, and death.<br /><br />Those hoping for more resolution in The Winds of Winter may get some, but those hoping for some light at the end of the tunnel will be sorely disappointed, just as they were very likely disappointed in this book. This story can only grow even darker as winter comes in all its fury. I predict that those squeamish of reading about cannibalism will be made ill by the next book. We all know Martin loves detailed descriptions of foodstuffs, and eating each other seems to be the only hope of making it to A Dream of Spring for many of the people of Westeros. How do wights' livers taste? Probably not too bad with some neeps and a nice Arbor red.
0800129806|4|I think that they didn't cast it well. Julia Ormond is ok, but Richard Gear is terrible. personally I find Gear annoying and a slimy kisser playing Lancelot, the movie makers give you no reason to like him and Gwenevere together. There is no...I can't find the word for it, they just don't click. Throughout the movie I keep wondering why Gwenevere would pick Lancelot over Arthur(Sean Connery) who is a lot nicer, loves her, and is very good looking even though he is above middle-aged. However it is not bad to watch, a bit of a tear-jerker at the end, and good music by Jerry Goldsmith. If I could I would give it a 3&amp;1/2 star rating. You don't need to buy it, just go to your local video store.
B00J2PEU3W|4|good movie. the prequel to mary poppins including the real story of mary poppins and her purpose.love the singing and sarcasm here. if you liked mary poppins youll love this
B00VFTCGES|5|Awesome
B00F88GRSS|5|Excellent, both Douglas and Damon nailed their roles.
B00ILHW6AG|1|Good book until the final act as per usual. I got reeled back in with Dr. Sleep and 11/22/1963 after the gunslinger and the dome debacle but this book is back to crap. Please stop releasing books before you have found an ending to the story that is not total garbage!

B00AECDDYY|5|I am trying to beat this game on the hardest level and I have just about completed with the exception of the last level.  I cannot win on that level on anything but the easiest setting.  This is a great time kill game for me anyway.  Nothing hard or complicated, just a nice shootem up game.
B00DSS7BHG|5|I am a Band fan so I needed this cd boxed set.  Wow they sounded good even at their last performance.
B000FC2L1E|5|3rd in the series anybody who has read the first two will love it. Could be confusing for someone to start with this one as there is so much history between these characters.
B00DPM90C4|4|It was a little wordy, but very interesting especially, with the world events.  Love the last part and the ending.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Great!! Thank you!
B00NTCJHM8|5|Awesome!
B00ABGEFWC|5|I just think this game<br /> is epic and not alot of things are epic I am epic and you will be epic if you are nice enough to agree with y 5 star rating and the only reson I like to do this is because it is like youtube bye bye bye and finish this sentece I dare you to kiss  I dare you to kiss meeeeeeeeifrin the snake he likes to bight aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh bye bye you rock<br />c
B004XQO90E|5|Good Movie for a great price. It came promptly and in great condition.
B00B8R1NP0|3|For a 1st book he did &#34;OK.&#34;  Dialogue was stilted and extremely basic.  The Max character was not believable.  Plot way too predictable.  Worth the $.99.  I wish the author well as he continues and grows with hopes that his writing will improve.
B00BAXFECK|4|I loved this book so much up until about the 90% mark on my kindle.  After that I got a bit lost and confused.
B005ZOBNOI|5|It was so incredibly well written that even days after finishing I still feel like I'm going to cry :(
B003TU16AG|5|my husband wears the crap out of these shoes, hiking, rock climbing, swimming, even over his chest wadders dip netting
B00C7TAF3Y|5|I love this game, it is a fun puzzle game with absolutely marvelous graphics.  It is hard to put down and something you want to savor all at the same time.
B0000DD7LC|5|I enjoy Alicia Keys music so.  When I moved I lost her CD, so I was extremely excited when I received her CD in the mail again.
B000I0QK74|4|Times change. People change. I was never a big James Taylor fan but I do like this Christmas album. He's been around long enough and he is part of our cultural being. Good enough for me. The Sinatra's of my time are just about all gone. The young guys are now becoming part of the old guard. They say this album was released a couple of years ago under a different name with a couple less songs. Well that really doesn't matter. It makes me feel good inside and isn't that what's really important? It makes me feel good.
B004FOA84A|5|Wish it was longer. Great graphics and a lot of fun. I had no problems with FCs.  Installed on Droid X.
B0031TZ8TU|4|It is a wonder that Follett chose this topic for consideration because it was unlikely that either the media or Hollywood would even touch it.  After all, Ross Perot, to them, was a pariah.  Nonetheless, It was very satisfying to read such a heroic tale.  It was also nice to know that there are people out there who really believe in truth, justice, and the American way.  After reading how Perot defied all odds and spared no expense to save his employees from the clutches of Iran during its revolution in 1978 & 79, one can only wonder how much better off this country would have been if he were elected president in 1996.  Who knows?  Perhaps the international landscape would be much different than it is today.  The book is well done and an easy read.  The images and maps on the kindle version, however, leave much to be desired.  The major point I found underscored throughout this text was that a citizen should never ever trust the US State Department.  If one ever has issues in a foreign country, it becomes evident that the individual should not fully depend upon the State Department to resolve much of anything.  EDS (Electronic Data Systems)continually went to these folks seeking assistance, but the department actually cooperated with the Iranian government against them.  In this case, it was Perot's two chief in-country managers, which resulted in these men going to jail.  Only after independent action was taken could the EDS people be extricated from a hostile country.  Everyone should read this remarkable story.
1416905014|5|Matthew Reinhart at his best.  Vibrant colors, great engineering, familiar story. A well done production.
B002MQYOFW|5|This was a great read! I would definitely recommend this book for kids and adults. Its definitely a family book. Not for the very young readers though. There is excitement and action. It's a book that keeps you captivated. I can't wait for the movie
B0026JWDQW|5|This is for true music lovers only.  This is the kind of album you could be anywhere, be doing anything and enjoy and feel comfortable listening to it.    I loved the first album.  This album is much more bubbly -- I love it teh same, if not more I think.  One reviewer wrote how this album put a smile on her face...I'd have to agree.  I wish Paolo would tour in the US -- I would pay alot to hear him live.      His range is everything you could imagine and more.  If your into lame, pop type music -- (Brittney Spears...etc) then you wont get it.      Buy it!
B00GX59QO2|4|I enjoyed this movie a lot. If you like Bruce Will and John Malkovich, you will like this movie. Or, if you enjoyed the first one at all. This one was more humorous to me than the first one was and has more action in it. I hope and am looking forward to a third one.
B0027MJU00|5|Tense, fraught thriller with lots of twists and turns. Very entertaining on a cold winter's night!
B002YCVWXQ|5|One of my favorites
B005EGXNLS|5|I've read  all the books in the Saxon chronicles so far and haven't been able to put them down. Great writer with epic and believable characters.
B003O86FMW|4|Delightful, entertaining, edge of the seat reading, which allows the mind to run wild with imagination.  Definitely would recommend it to others.
B00H6T36QS|5|The only complaint is that I've run out of Joe Abercrombie and have had to resort to re-reading all his books. The First Law series is just about the best I've ever read, the Bloody Nine is bloody awesome! Please Joe, can we have some more?
B0086DB566|5|Good twists on the story
B00P5968FC|2|The filming was awful, as was the suspense and premise.  Very choppy and not scary at all.
B006XIR9KM|4|It's a very good of verison of a &#34;memory&#34; or &#34;concentration&#34; where you try to match pairs of hidden tiles. Several play modes and visual effects keep it interesting.
6300181278|4|Anyone wishing to appreciate classic horror and vampire films, there is no better place to start. The ending is disappointing, but the mood and the script plus Lugosi, Van Sloan and Dwight Frye's performances are absolutely  incredible.
B008AK8FHM|5|I'm 25 and have always been very spiritual but never found religion. This is the most meaningful book I have read and helps me process certain experiences and feelings I have had in life.
B005KELWJY|5|The battery seems to last for ages, the print is very clear, occasionally I have to use a firmer touch to turn the page, but that's probably just finger trouble. Downloading newly purchased books happens so fast.  Lightweight.  Much better when travelling.
B005I6EVUG|5|I absolutely love this case.  It's very unique for an e-Reader case; I've had iPad case, phone cases, iPod cases, and this takes the cake.  Inside is nice and soft, but not linty.  The only thing is I accidentally received the wrong fit for my e-Reader.  It's a very nice quality case.  Once I get the one that fits I'll be gravy!
B0020BUWX2|4|This is a great book for teens and adults! Some adult language, but it didn't take away from the story. Highly recommend!
B00FATEJYE|4|Fun game with some occasional technical issues. The developers are neither apologetic nor do they address customer concerns when there are big game crashes. But hey, it's free, right?
B008476HBM|5|love this book i keep reading it over and over again love jane austen it depicts the trials and tribulations of finding love in those ages
B008K6HN8I|4|Works great on both my phone and Kindle Fire... and of course it really helps getting the Apps that I want moved on to the Fire that sadly don't exist on Amazon. I mean no NPR App? Really?
B00GRVEDCM|5|This is a great game if you tend to like card games and strategic games however this game has absolutely no storyline at all so that might throw some people off of the game.
B00005JG6Q|5|Finally, after seven long years of wiating one of the best anime films ever is going to be released to DVD.  In short Akira encounters an escaped experiment and has a bizarre power activated within him.  simply one of the best anime ever, with truly astounding art work and visuals.  If you are even slightly interested in anime this is a must own.
B003ELOQCA|1|I went to this show in person and it was amazing.  That said, I just received this (single disc version) and I was very disappointed to realize that they did not include the opening song, which also happens to be one of the very best songs, of the show - \\"Breathe\\".  Now, I need to pay to return it, and re-order the two disc version, which has that song on the second disc.  I love U2, but they should have included all songs from the concert on the 1-disc version.  I can not understand why they would leave off their opening number, which was such a highlight of the show!
B009HQ9UHC|5|This game is awesome and Jimi loves it tomorrow he is probably going to play it ,ps the game is going to teach your kids or kid how to build cars.
B009T9P7OC|4|Equalizer has much variety, works well on Samsung Tab 3, 8 and Bluetooth speakers. Enhances sound beyond expected for such portable units.
B004G5ZY7E|5|LOVE Harry Hole and his adventures.  Young mothers are being murdered, snowmen are being left in the yards of some of the victims.  Why, is the question??? It is up to Harry Hole to solve it in his unique ways.  Nesbo weaves another intricate tail.  Great story telling and a page turner!  A must read!
B00EEL0LGY|5|I can enjoy this game every time. The screen is beautiful. And responses are really nice. The game is good for me. Thanks.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|I enjoyed this book very much, it seemed like some of the early Grisham books that I enjoyed most. It was a great story that had enough twists to keep you guessing and a satisfying ending.<br />This book is well worth your time and money. Read and enjoy, it will keep you entertained.
1780387105|4|I like the book but he dumbs down most of the songs..  I love justin.. i wouldn't be where i am without him. I glad I purchased his book but its kinda dumbed down and I only like maybe 10% of the songs.  I think the rock book would have been a better purchase for me but it wasn't out when i got this.  I would recommend it just cause you owe it to justin cause I know you been on his website.  BUy it from HIm NOT amazon though..  more money will get to him that way.
B008U7ZPHS|4|Very enjoyable
B0094BB4TW|4|Nice.
B000086EOE|5|I felt I had to chime in here, given all of the \\"4 Star\\" ratings I see that SOUND as though they should be 5 Stars. Man, you guys are tough with stars!<br /><br />Except for the die hard EARLY Genesis fans, Steve Hackett is probably almost totally unknown. Even during his time with Genesis, I don't think he got the credit he deserved for his guitar work - truly a virtuoso player with a unique and original style, yet understated. A lot of his playing back then was almost subliminal. Maybe why he didn't get the notoriety he rightfully deserved? I can't think of any other guitarist, along with Alan Holdsworth, who have this much talent, and yet remain relatively unknown for the most part, even by other guitarists.<br /><br />As for this CD - I originally bought this CD back in the mid 90's while I was looking for one of Hackett's classical CDs (Midsummer Night's Dream also a phenom disc - pick it up when you have the chance). I looked at this track listing and saw that he was basically offering re-worked, re-recorded versions of some of the great old Genesis music. This immediately struck a chord with me but for no other reason then just to answer a question that I've been asking myself for the past 25 or so years - when I listen to many of my old great favorite albums of the 60s and 70s (particularly the Prog/Art Rock ones) I find myself always wondering what these recordings would sound like if done today, in our modern recording studios. Well Steve has gone ahead and answered that question for me, at least as far as a few of Genesis' songs are concerned, and the results are astounding.<br /><br />The lineup of musicians he has put together for this project is also very noteworthy. And they do NOT disappoint. John Wetton sounds as though he's been singing these songs all his life. And Hackett's playing? - NO MORE understated guitar here. H efinally pulls out all the stops and shows once and for all that he belongs at the top amongst any of the other guitar greats.<br /><br />One can only hope that sometime in the future He will do a follow up to this CD with a few more \\"re-awakenings\\" of the early Gensis stuff. My own personal wish list:<br /><br />Suppers Ready (with Gabriel doing the \\"guest\\" vocal)<br />Get `em out by Friday (with John Wetton)<br />Cinema Show<br />Robbery, Assault and Battery<br />Squonk<br />For Absent Friendsometime in the future He will do a follow up to this CD with a few more \\"re-awakenings\\" of the early Gensis stuff. My own personal wish list:  Suppers Ready (with Gabriel doing the \\"guest\\" vocal)  Get `em out by Friday (with John Wetton)  Cinema Show  Robbery, Assault and Battery  Squonk  For Absent Friends
B00DU73T08|2|It was fine until the best friend of the host human chick's boyfriend fell desperately in love with the extraterrestrial parasite within her. Should the extraterrestrial parasite use the body of the girl to consummate its lust for the best friend of the girl's boyfriend?, or should it keep it together and respect the girl's body?... What a predicament!!! Oh my Gosh!!! They ultimately solved the problem by finding a throw away body of another chick which they patched up and implanted with the parasite... The movie would have been ok without this cheesy mind bending twist.
B007ZGO7EM|4|Super simple. Nice looking.  I like the application because it looks great and has big keys to prevent fat fingering.  It does not have the scientific and statistic funtions so if you need standard deviation look for something else.  If you want a good standard calculator download it now.
B004ZN9NCY|4|\\"Ummagumma\\" was, for a long time, a personal favorite of mine; as I've aged, the album has sounded less and less relevant to me.<br /><br />It originally consisted of two vinyl discs. The first featured four live performances from the band -- \\"Astronomy Domine,\\" \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene,\\" \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" and \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" -- and overall it was terrific. The second disc featured four segments in which each band member was to do pretty much whatever he wanted.<br /><br />Of the four, only Roger Waters seems to have developed enough as a writer at the time to pull this off -- his \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" was a languid but compelling aural home movie, which flowed into one of the strangest tracks ever on a Floyd album: \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict.\\" Keyboardist Rick Wright's \\"Sysyphus\\" was a 12-minute opus featuring lots of rumbling, low pianos and strange tones; it was frequently quite compelling and listenable, but droned on a bit too long. David Gilmour's \\"The Narrow Way\\" ... well, Gilmour himself later admitted he was just muddling along here (I'd like to quote him directly, but amazon wouldn't allow such language). Nick Mason's \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\" featured his drumming along with some flute played by his then-wife, Lindy, and lots of odd sound effects.<br /><br />I rarely listen to \\"Ummagumma\\" all the way through these days, but on occasion I will listen to the live half. The version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" -- which had been written by Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett -- is just amazing here, very energetic and quite spooky.
B00Y6QF0PE|1|It's is a copy and paste of the first book with very few insights into the mind of Christian  Grey.
B007IXWL2C|5|I give this book a 5 because it is the first book I have read in a while that I could literally not put down. It is very racy, but so intriguing. I would recommend this book for sure!
B008JDAC7G|5|Fun fun fun!!!!!! I really enjoy playing this game.  It eats up so many of my hours.  A, must buy for any one
0671004107|5|Are you interested in SF but are tired of laser-guns and strange power-fields and want to read something more close to reality? Then I would recommend &quot;Contact&quot; by Carl Sagan. If you didnt know Sagan was (he died about a year ago) professor of planetary research at Cornell University and has written many books on astronomy and popular-science. This is as far as I know his only novel but it is a good one, very serious and well thought-out.  Ellie Arroway is a radio astronomer who has devoted her life to SETI (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) but is strongly counteracted by her colleagues. One day however, her stubbornness bear fruit. A radio signal from the star Vega in the constellation of Lyra is detected. The signal isnt just a &quot;Hello ! we are here &quot; but its a sketch of a machine that turns out to be some sort of transport of people, perhaps to the the star Vega. Many questions arise such as, should the macine be built? If so ,who shou! ld go? Are the Vegans friendly? Etc. The machine is enormously expensive but at last it is decided that it should be built and the crew makes ready to go. This book is basically devoted to describe how we would react the day we understand that we are not alone, both politically and religiously. With the exception of Arthur C Clarkes 2001, not many books have taken this interesting subject so seriously as Sagans Contact. The book has also been filmed by Robert Zemeckis (Forest Gump) but as always the book is better than the film.
B00IS87HYI|4|The different levels give you different challenges.  Some seem easy while others are frustrating.<br /><br />The only down side is that if you reach the goal(s) and you still have lives left, you don't get to play until you run out of lives.
B00FAX6XQC|5|GREAT GAME. I recommend this game to everyone. This is the best Deer Hunter yet. I play it all the time
B0000C7PSW|5|I first heard Rufus Wainwright when he opened for Tori Amos several years ago. I then had an opportunity to see him on his Poses tour. I have been anticipating this album for so long, and at last it is here and it does not disappoint. The more I listen the more I love this CD. Never before has Rufus' sound seemed so full and so big. The orchestrations are so sweeping and as usual the lyrics are fantastic.<br />This CD works to restore my faith in the music industry and the fact that there are artists in the world that continue to make substantial and beautiful music. Buy it now!!!
B002ZG97RY|5|One of the most common complaints I've read about this film is the \\"liberal agenda\\" that this film represents. I didn't know that the search for truth is exclusively a \\"liberal agenda\\" and the \\"Hollywood Elite\\" is only interested in slamming the Bush Administration and not exploring other ideas and creating solid art. Why is that such a knee-jerk reaction over films of this element? If this were an \\"anti-Obama\\" or \\"anti-Clinton\\" film, would these same people be making these claims? Of course not. I believe that time will out and this film may very well be regarded as a great film, as it should already be.<br /><br />When I first heard of Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass reteaming for a film about the current Iraq war, I was very excited since I am a HUGE fan of their previous work together. THE BOURNE SUPREMACY/ULTIMATUM are two extraordinary pieces of action filmmaking and represent the best that the techno spy thriller genre has to offer. Later hearing that it was based on a true story about the search for WMD at the beginning of the Iraq war, I was even more interested to see how Greengrass would handle such a subject. After all, Greengrass, as a filmmaker, is no stranger to the territory of this subject matter, namely the great and tragic docudrama UNITED 93.<br /><br />So while we follow Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller's (Damon, excellent as per usual) quest to find WMD and find why he keeps coming up snake-eyes for all of his and his team's efforts, and why he keeps finding himself out of the loop between the Army, the Department of Defense, and the CIA keeping him in the dark while people are dying. The film turns from Iraq War film to mystery/thriller as Miller finds himself searching for a top-secret contact code-named Magellan, who is the person providing the misleading intel about the WMD. He finds himself either paired up or at odds with a Wall Street Journal reporter (the wonderful Amy Ryan, who admittedly doesn't have a lot to do in this film) who has been reporting on the confirmation of the WMD in Iraq, the top CIA man in Iraq (a terrific Brendan Gleeson), and the two-faced face of the DOD for the Administration in Iraq (played with force and conviction by Greg Kinnear). As the hunt for Magellan becomes more intense, so does the effort to stop Miller before he gets too close to the truth (represented by an unrecognizable Jason Isaacs as a mega-tough Special Forces operative).<br /><br />Before you start to think that because Greengrass and Damon have reunited for a film that this is \\"Jason Bourne in Iraq\\", you'd be dead wrong. Roy Miller couldn't be more different than Jason Bourne. They are both men of action who are on a quest for facts and that's where the similarities end. Damon is a great actor, and he turns in another great performance here. Greengrass is a tremendously gifted director with a real eye for pacing and putting the audience in the thick of the events and action in his films. Speaking of which, can we stop whining about his \\"shaky-cam\\" action style? It works. It's intense. It won't make you throw up. End of story. The script by the great Brian Helgeland, who has scripted so many terrific films like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, CONSPIRACY THEORY (severely underrated), MAN ON FIRE, MYSTIC RIVER (and also happens to be a very good director in his own right with A KNIGHT'S TALE, THE ORDER and PAYBACK), also turns in a tight and real script here.<br /><br />There isn't really a false move in this whole film, and it explores a fundamental flaw to something that shouldn't be ignored.<br /><br />The interesting part of this film is that it is based somewhat in fact. The character of Roy Miller is based on a real Warrant Officer who was asking many of the same questions that Miller asks. Obviously there's some dramatic license taken here, but still... why we go to war is as important as the lives that are lost during that war.<br /><br />In regards to the Blu-Ray disc, the supplemental material is pretty great and the transfer looks and sounds terrific, so I'm not sure why there have been complaints to the transfer.<br /><br />All in all, Greengrass and Damon bring us another intensely satisfying film experience, and whatever your beliefs about the Iraq war, this is a film worth viewing.so I'm not sure why there have been complaints to the transfer.     All in all, Greengrass and Damon bring us another intensely satisfying film experience, and whatever your beliefs about the Iraq war, this is a film worth viewing.
B003H4I4JU|4|Card was able to transfer a child Ender from a young adult book into a mature adult in a much deeper book. While the characters are just as relatable as in Ender's Game, the world around them sets up a very different story that is no less enjoyable.
B004I2K4E8|5|I've seen it two times on stage and the movie, but this is the best.  Seeing all the past performers at the end just makes it better.
B001ANSSDC|5|The book is NOTHING like the movie!  It is a wonderful story and superbly written. I highly recommend this book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5|Love it so far!
B00HY7VU60|5|I liked this show. I thought it was really good. I am a little bit of a sissey I guess because I cry in movies, but if you are a dude you will not laugh more than once so shut up.=) Its a great show.
B004EC5IUW|5|Simple one word review.<br /><br />Amazing<br /><br />If you've not seen the new Eva and you're a fan of the original you have to buy this now.
B000BH4YFE|5|This and the album before were the only two albums I thought were any good by T-Rex and they were both dynamite.

B00004X01U|5|Madonna was never a follower and never will be. She is a trend-setter. This album, if you listen to it properly, you will know exactly what I mean in the coming weeks. Soon, you'll be hearing teeny-boppers trying to follow in the steps of the diva herself, Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone. Believe me, this album is worth buying and listening to.
B00003CXDZ|5|have absolute no idea why people are panning this film.  i am a big fan of rock operas which this movie clearly is.  The direction was in one word marvelous.  the story can be compaired to shakespear in love but alot more exciting and captivating. the singing was surprisingly good. for someone who owns 30 municals on cd and seen 6 live i know what i'm talking about. some people said they walked out because they couldnt stand the singing, its a musical for cryin outloud of course there will be singing and dancing involved. I've seen the movie 4 times and will see it again most likely, if you havent seen it go see it in the theatre, its the only way to experience this movie.
B00QLVY7J2|4|I'm not sure, I just started to play the game. It seems like fun.
B00NG4K8UO|4|I have a love / hate relationship with this keyboard. Most of the time, it's ability to make sense of pure gibberish typing and flawlessly interpret what I was trying to say is truly amazing. Other times, if I misspell a word, it will change it to something totally random and if I don't catch it, I end up sending a text that makes me look like a total idiot (even more than if I had just misspelled the word).<br /><br />I really like the swipe back to erase, and this may be the main reason why I have continued to stick with it so long.
B009NY43NY|4|If you have followed Sookie's story this far, you are of course going to buy this book and read it. She wraps things up pretty well, although I didn't find it quite as gripping as some of her others in the series.
B00EL8I8IS|4|A fast paced action movie, I really liked it a lot, The acting was great, the plot was cool, and the movie kept you in your seat.  This one I watched twice because it moved so fast in some parts I wanted to see them a second time.
B00IX9UTLU|5|Great
B00I6IKSZ0|5|The best. Get it. It's free!
B00OKYQZDI|5|Great
B0037VNX44|1|Pointless movie. Weird execution of the almost non-existent plot.
B003JTHXOK|5|Awesome book another great work of nicholas sparks I watched the movie aftet reading the book and like always the book delivers more!!!
B00AREIAI8|4|I have always wanted a horse! I like this game although I just wish the energy would fill up faster besides that very entertaining.
B0091REZMW|3|Not bad
B007TBZ63Y|5|I loved reading this awesome book.  It was every thing I can ask for. Adventure, teamwork, and bravery. I love books.
B004UFEJVW|5|I really liked this movie, and I didn't expect to. I liked it because it was touching and different. I think it's easy to keep making the same fairy tale movie about princesses and what not, but this was original. I plan on buying it to show my daughter when she is old enough.
B00W6XM002|4|Different but a good game.
B002RBZ13Q|4|This is an upbeat, happy rock concert with full audience participation.  It's a gass.
B00UENHBAU|5|Wonderful job, Scott! The premise of this game is simple:<br />- Check cams to locate SpringTrap.<br />- Use audio devices to lure him into a different room<br />- Check and seal vents, as they are shortcuts for SpringTrap.<br />- Use maintenance panel to reboot systems like: Cams, Vents, &amp; Audio.<br />- Beware: when ventilation is offline, you may experience hallucinations, which gives SpringTrap an opportunity to kill you.<br />Great job, Scott. I`m happy this is out. I've been a fan of your games since the first came out. And this truly is a game worth playing.
B00AREIAI8|5|I have always wanted a horse and this game is so so so so so so so so so so cute!!!
B00H87RLJQ|5|Loved this book!  It is a bit long but thoroughly entertaining and never allows a dull moment.  Just when you think you have figured out the killer(s?) you are taken on a journey in the opposite direction.  This book is definitely worth the investment of the time it takes to read it.  I never wanted it to end!

B00005JN2F|4|First off, the movie was very entertaining and Matt Damon turns in another great Bourne performance, but where is the real story?  The credits say that the movie is based on the book but let me tell you, there is not one Iota of Ludlum's novel in this movie.  To say that I am dissapointed by this is the understatement of the decade and I think anyone who has read the book, or the series, will agree.  The novel spun an intricate web of espianoge set in Hong-Kong and dealt with a scenario that had global implications, not personal ones.  I think that it is atrocious that the movie was given the same name as the book.  The driving force in David Webb's life and his adventures in the novel was taken away and renders his internal struggle between Webb and Bourne meaningless.  All of the depth Ludlum gave Webb's character is missing and what we have now is a simple action thriller that is worth the price of admission, but is so dissapointing in plot that it is hard to enjoy.  If you are a fan of the books you will not recognize anything that remotely resembles the Supremecy so don't look for it.  If you enjoyed the first movie and are unfamiliar with the written works then you won't know the difference and will like this movie.  Hope this helps!
B003Z49LYO|4|Poor Tess.  Great acting.  A good stepping stone for Gemma Arterton and Eddie Redmayne.  Enjoyed very much. Would recommend it for those who like classic British dramas.

B00AG6Z92C|5|I have all of Andrea Bocelli's albums and this is one that will be played after you have had a very busy day and need to unwind.  If you are in the love mood, this is perfectly named for the event.  Another star for Andrea is in his corner for the perfect selection of songs.  No complaints from this very happy listener and owner of yet another great album.
B002KQOCJ2|1|Très très mauvais emballage. Le carton est plié et avec des coups. TRès nul!!!! Honteux!!!!!
B000KX0IOK|5|Loves!
078062565X|5|This movie STILL holds up good, considering it was released in the 30's. The action and FX were all good, although Kong's dancing fur is a little cheesy. Kong himself is a very intimidating beast. The grandfather of all  giant monster movies.
B000069HKH|5|Nobody needs recommendation to buy the new Springsteen's album .<br />Notwithstanding , I wish to offer you a glance at the new release from what I've gathered thus far .<br />As you must have heard , &quot;The Rising&quot; is heavily influenced by the terrible tragedy of the 11th of  September , 2001 . The shadow of the disaster is interwoven throughout the whole album , while several songs are of the saddest and most painful Springsteen has ever written : &quot;Into the fire&quot; , &quot;Missing you&quot; , &quot;Paradise&quot; and of course &quot;My city of ruins&quot;. However , other songs can be heard and regarded otherwise than within the context of the Twin Towers' collapse : &quot;Worlds apart&quot; - brand new direction for Springsteen , &quot;Lonesome day&quot; and &quot;further on (up the road)&quot; . Both kinds are divided to Rock N' Roll and ballads , and probably all of them are what the hardcore fans call &quot;instant classics&quot; .<br />In all , a sad album - but not entirely saddening - that worth every penny you're going to pay for it .
B0071XO8RA|5|What a rarity! The writing is really great. I've never read anything as unique and suspenseful as this series. Very out of the box thinking on the fall of society and the deceptive power of the government we literally entrust our lives to. You will be left guessing at every turn and nothing as it seems even when you think it does.
B00H71PBQ8|5|Very entertaining
B0085P2Z6E|5|It was a very enjoyable game with nice graphics and hard enough to be challenging. A bit annoying getting penalized when you are simply trying to move around but not irritating enough to subtract a star. I would recommend to any hog lover!
B0018QCXH8|5|fantastic movie, I highly rate this as a good watch, a telling tale worthy of a friday night, tub of popcorn and a good red wine.
B004FP1WX0|3|It kept my date's and I's interest for the whole thing. Great incite into the realities of the online dating world. Would have been better if they followed up with people that were being impersonated.
B005ZCXPP0|5|This was a great movie.  Really cannot wait to see Captain America Winter Solider in 2014.  This is one of Marvel's best comics.
B001K3K5MO|5|I saw this movie when I was a senior in high school.  Its one of my favorite movies of all time!  I bought it so that I can watch it with my daughter who is now a senior!  It has action, romance and humor!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Well ended saga.<br />It wasn't overly predictable, and that was refreshing.  A smart read for lovers of young adult fiction.
B00003CXCT|4|I won't go on a long rant about how what i like or dislike the \\"special edition of the first film.  How can you have Greedo shoot first ?  My only dissapointment is that the edition did not include either 2 sided discs ( one for each cut original and special) or some way to have the old ones.  I am lucky that I do have them on laserdisc so I can keep my originals for the moivies.  The BONUS DISC is great lots of trailers and a pretty good documentary.  worth the price overall
B000XUBFE2|5|I am not sure what I expected from this but the honesty,humor and simple beauty was wonderful. I would recommend this to my family and friends. It will be a long time before I leave Liesal behind.
B0091VTNZC|5|A new Christmas classic! Great movie!
B00ECU2RGY|3|It certainly is a pretty movie! It's entertaining too, not a bad story and has some good twists...if you don't guess too hard. There are some pretty major holes in the plot, but hey! It's fun.<br /><br />The acting is pretty good, the effects are stunning. Things are pretty well paced and interesting. Tom Cruise isn't just &#34;Tom Cruise&#34; in this movie either (which is good!)<br /><br />I don't regret renting it at all.
B000002LIM|5|Before the late 80's if you were to think of Batman and Music a beach party surf-like tune would pop into your head with a horn section that made you sing, &#34;Batman! dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, dun dun, Batman!&#34;. When Tim Burton followed up Beetlejuice with Batman he brought Danny Elfman along with him and Elfman rewrote the book on the score and sound that was Batman.<br /><br />Prior to this it was Superman that had the iconic Superhero Theme. &#34;Batman&#34; introduced yet another musical hook that stood up to [John] Williams' Man of Steel score. Over 20 years later its the score that set the tone for Batman. Following the film a few years later Danny Elfman was asked to do the song intro for &#34;Batman: The Animated Series&#34; which echoed the film's main score. It is this film's score that &#34;Lego: Batman&#34; saw fit to use as their backdrop for game-play music. The likes of [Hans] Zimmer's score for the Nolan films, the games and animated movies that followed would not have the same sound had this score not been done in the way that Elfman did it.<br /><br />Because Prince was also contracted to do a soundtrack that went along with the film I imagine it was written somewhere that Prince's album would get the same cover as the VHS. At first I thought, &#34;bummer,&#34; but then I took a look at the Score's CD cover. The iconic shot from the movie where the Batplane rises above the clouds to cast its silhouette against the moon is quite fitting for reflecting the tone of the movie and score.<br /><br />Each track is filled with mood that reflects the iconic imagery of the film. If you're a fan of the film and have seen it more times than you can count you'll hear tracks that are more than familiar to you but take the time to really listen to each one and admire it's compositional structure.<br /><br />While the inside sleeve doesn't have as big a fold out with as many pictures as the Prince album you do get a couple good shots, one being a closeup of Batman's face as he's driving the Batmobile, a shot exclusive to this album.<br /><br />A great quintessential addition for one who collects film scores and a must-own for Batfans everywhere.Batman's face as he's driving the Batmobile, a shot exclusive to this album.<br /><br />A great quintessential addition for one who collects film scores and a must-own for Batfans everywhere.

0553382179|5|Update: 5.5 years later. I am now a WAHM and a very busy Business Owner and still use her system. Not only me, but my entire family does! We could not function without this model which has become a way of life.<br /><br />I am not overstating... this book changed my life! As a first-time stay at home mom and first time entrepreneur, I struggled for months to find a way to happily manage my house, my family and myself without driving everyone crazy. I was discouraged and almost defeated when I found this book (through Amazon reviews - what a blessing!). I have been following the FlyLady method for about two months and for the first time in my life I am actually having fun cleaning and managing my home. Surprise is... my husband is using it too :)
B00A72989U|2|Should have listened to the samples more closely.  Too much rap for me.  Will be more careful in the future
B0063GORYU|4|I really enjoy the escape I get when playing spider solitaire. I am always trying to beat my own score.
B008MEM24S|4|forget the free one and just but the full version.  It is fun and my kids love it. I think my husband and i play it more then they do.
0394533992|5|I have been using this book, and it's companion Volume 2, for over 20 years.  It is by far the best cookbook for French cuisine on the market.  The clear, step-by-step directions, with extensive illustrations, carefully guide you through each recipe.   It teaches all of the basic techniques required to become proficient in the greatest cuisine in the world.<br />Try Julia's chocolate mousse and you'll never use another recipe,(but you will have to walk it off). I'm ordering a replacement copy from Amazon because my original is has been so used the binding has fallen apart!  I wouldn't be without it.

B00000AFGM|4|well done but not quite as good as antichrist
B005HI4LLY|4|Tucker & Dale vs Evil is ridiculously funny.  Plot is original, the mass suicide of the teenagers is awe inspiring.  Just funny.  Worth the watch.<br /><br />I do have some technical problems.  1)  Alberta Canada looks absolutely nothing like West Virginia (any part) where this movie was suppose to take place.  2)  There is no Morris Lake in West Virginia.  They could've used a more redneck name and use a real place like Stonecoal lake.  3)  Most West Virginians do not dress up like hillbilly's except on Halloween.
B00634GHJA|5|I like this app
B00OKYQZDI|5|Love this game. I got tired of Candy Crush! I'm really enjoying Cookie Jam!!
B004LWZWGK|5|One of the best movies this year. Christopher Nolan teaming again with Christian Bale to bring us the magic that started a few years ago with Batman Begins. You have got to see it to believe it. The Nolan batman trilogy is highly recommended, go out and buy it now.
B009ZXT4BY|5|I like it it's fun . I love it. I really like it .The game is really fun.And I like the creative mode.
