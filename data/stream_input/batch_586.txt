0790701251|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is primo. Not for younger kids though but teens can watch it to appreciate what our men and some women had to go through during the Viet Nam war.<br /><br />It's gory, realistic, charcters are great.<br /><br />Everyone has a \\"handle\\" like \\"Dallas\\" \\"Gomer\\" etc.<br /><br />When the stress of the boot camp gets to a slower soldier (mind wise) this is what can and really does happen in training.<br /><br />This was a terrible war and we never should have been there but at least it's a great history lesson. True to form.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I love this album. To those who argue it doesn't appeal to older people (older kids) I am a Grad Student and I think everything Pink has to say on this album is long overdo in the world of Paris Hiltons and Jessica Simpsons, where being none too bright seems to make a girl \\"hot\\" or at least \\"cute\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?\\"  <br /> <br />We're still here!
B000957O82|4.0|I really enjoyed Hitch.  Smith continues to prove that her really is a big screen actor.  He is charming, relaxed and easygoing in that real-person kind of way.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't rely on a lot of over-the-top romantic contrivances: playing two characters, constantly missing each other, getting too ditzy and silly : all big pluses.  The Kevin James plotline has the silliest bits, but even they are not over the top.  There is a genuinely sweet sincerity in this film, that really makes it work.  Eva Mendes is lovely and more serious than most of the girls chased in these films, Amber Valleta proves that she can actually deliver dialogue without being laughed at and James is the comically sweet loser/everyman.  Actually very well done.  One kind of comic nod to the old romatic comedies is a remote control Smith has in his apartment ala Rock Hudson in Pillow Talk - but it is quick and not an extended silly joke.  Definitely worth your time.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Over the years i've always been a huge fan of the Final Fantasy saga. The first time my interest was sparked was years ago when i was younger i saw a commmercial for Final Fantasy VII when it first came out on the Playstation. My reaction to seeing the commercial and to seeing the amazing CG sequences was \\"whoa, what is this? what have i stumbled upon?\\" Right then i knew that i was hooked. I had to research more of the series to find out exactly what it was. A little while after Final Fantasy came out on the PC, that was my chance to play it because i didnt have a playstation. I bought it and started playing it.... i had found something amazing. After that the series took off FFVII, then later FFVIII, FFIX, FFX, FFXI Online and soon to be FFXII. For those of you that have played Final Fantasy VII for years I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS MOVIE! while watching it, i became thoroughly interested, the movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, the plot progresses very nicely, the characters make the story enthralling and beautiful. Cloud makes you feel like youre right there with him, feeling what he's feeling, thinking what he's thinking. It really makes you think about the series alot, and what the plot means. Theres alot of deep meaning in this movie, it had alot of meaning for me in my life, it was inspiring to watch. The scene at the end of the movie (i wont give it away for any of you that havent seen it) makes you feel like youre a worthwhile person, it makes you realize that we all are special in life and that there are people who love us deeply and that we need to love them back. You never know who youre going to run into, it made me realize that even though the end has to come with most things, new beginnings always start and new adventures come to pass. This movie is worth every single dollar you spend on it, trust me. So join in the fantasy, awaken your spirit, and lets help square do what they do best. The FANTASY LIVES ON.
1400031362|5.0|I absolutely adore this series and I have no idea why I didn't discover them earlier. Alexander McCall Smith has a wonderful appreciation of language, idiosycracies of character and a sympathetic eye for nuance of language and manners which make this book (and this series) one of the best reads I have had.

Everything is worked out and it is all very small stuff - just as you would expect a detection agency would in a small town.

I adore these, there are no car chases, or dramatic finales, they are simple tales, told with simple affection. <br />
B000E97Y6A|5.0|The obvious star of this film is the talented visual-effects team.  They managed to revive a story that is all too well known, allowing even fans of the original classic to enjoy it like new.  It really is amazing how spectacularly they were able to achieve the feeling of newness from one of the classics.<br /><br />Aside from the special effects team, the only other star that truly shines is Naomi Watts.  Watts manages to convey all sorts of emotions, evoking real care and sympathy from the audience.  The viewer wants - at least I did - King Kong to survive, just so the love doesn't die.  Watts really pulls it off; she is magnificent.<br /><br />The early scenes from New York, the shots from Skull Island's fortress, and the amazing wildlife soon thereafter were all a testament to the special-effects team (although the Kong vs. 3 T-Rex fight reminded me of the choreography of the Hulk vs. the 3 mutant dogs in the most recent Hulk movie); I was in awe at the realism.<br /><br />The final scene, which makes this a sad story, is tragic and epic at the same time.  The battle between Kong and the airplanes, flying by and gunning mercilessly, reminds of an earlier battle that Kong had with some strange winged beasts, is set atop the Empire State Building, where Kong lives his final moments of life.  Even to the end, Kong's pureness and beauty shines through, protecting Watts until his death.  It's emotional, classic, and one of the best movie endings ever.<br /><br />I love this remake more than the original black and white version, simply brilliant.
1400031354|5.0|I can't believe it has taken me so long to discover the Precious Ramotswe stories - of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency - they are gorgeous. Precious like their owner, gently funny, beautifully polite and full of lovely moments. <br /> <br />Precious is engaged to Ra J B L Matkekoni, owner of the Speedy car repair service and himself a gentle man. I love the intertwiing of the stories in this. There is the problem of the American woman who lost her son 10 years ago. She knows he is not alive anymore, she simply wants to know what has happened. Then there is the problem of the local butcher who wants to know if his wife is cheating on him with another man. Unknown to Precious she has caused another problem, that of Ra J B L Matekoni's maid. She resents Precious coming into his life and now making her life very difficult. A fiance for Ra J B L Matekoni will spell the end for her life of relaxation. She will have to clean the house, she will not be able to entertain male friends. There are complications she does not wish to deal with. She wants Precious to go away and is prepared to do something about it. <br /> <br />These stories are very much about character development and plot. The problems which Precious has been hired for are generally small and not life threatening. The language is beautifully formal in the style you can imagine they speak, and the overall impression is of intimacy  - these are concerns which I can relate to they aren't murder and international spy rings. They are small concerns involved mostly in every day life. <br /> <br />There are some classic touches in this - the resolution of the butchers problem is classically beautiful, as in the undercover observation of the straying woman.  <br /> <br />This is beautifully written, it absolutely sings. I have fallen in love! Totally in love with this series!
B000002IZ4|5.0|<br />Without question this is STPs best effort. And, there aren't too many songs better than Big Empty (many fond memories attached to that one).   <br /> <br />Worth buying for: Take your pick. They're all very good, although Big Empty and Silvergun Superman are my top two favorites. <br /> <br />Icing on the cake: n/a <br /> <br />Could have done without: n/a

B000002GK1|4.0|Slightly better than Superunknown, but not quite as good as DOTU. Keep in mind, choosing between Badmotorfinger, Superunknown, and DOTU is like having to decide whether you want steak, shrimp, or Mahi (so long as you love steak, shrimp, and Mahi). Can't go wrong with any of them.<br /><br />Worth buying for: Searching with my Good Eye Closed and Outshined. Searching is an incredible song. Highly recommend it. That said, see below...<br /><br />Icing on the cake: After Searching and Outshined, it's all pretty much icing.<br /><br />Could have done without: Even though Searching is my favorite song on here, I could have done without the intro...both creepy and a bit disturbing.

0596009208|3.0|I bought this book along with Deitel's \\"Java how to Program\\". I don't know how this book received such a high rating. Every time I open this book I get frustrated because the book is not well organized at all and the authors failed to provide explanation for lot of important issues. If you really want to learn java, buy the Deitel's book. It provides explanation for every example and comes with a cd with all the example codes on it.
B000006OHL|5.0|Make no mistake, I love Bernard Herrmann's music and I love the music from Taxi Driver.  There's something about his music that hits you in strange places.  Like the more haunting parts of the Twilight Zone, or Vertigo, or North By Northwest, or so many other pieces.  There's something unconcious about his music.  Like a dream.  Herrmann suffered from depression most of his life and I think you can hear it in this music.  Anyway, this score has a bunch of pieces of that the film composer (not Herrmann) rescored that are just hilarious.  In particular the last track, the Reprise, is pure gold.  It's such a cheesy rendition of such a powerful piece of music.  Awesome.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I think the album cover sums it up: <br />If you could hear the prayers of an angel phetus, this is what it would sound like.
B0000027RL|3.0|This album has some great songs on it like:\\"Once\\",\\"Alive\\",\\"Black\\" and \\"Jeremy\\". Don't get me wrong the rest of the stuff isn't bad but I just don't enjoy it that much. Last but not least who on earth can label this album grunge? Either this or \\"Nevermind\\" is not grunge cos they have nothing in common.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is truely one of the best love stories I have ever seen.  The story moves along and really pulls in the viewer, which makes it more intimate.  You feel their emotions as you watch- you laugh, you cry and become even more connected.  I loved how they director shows the progression of love but not in a cheesey over the top Hollywood sort of way.  This is a must have for anyone who has ever been in love.
0800177177|4.0|As is the case with many of these latter-day horror movies, this is visually stunning. This one is particularly so, with beautiful colors, wild special effects, lavish sets and a handful of pretty women, led by Winona Ryder. <br /> <br />It isn't all beauty; there are some horrific, bloody moments in here. I've seen the film three times and the first two times was terrifying to me in parts. The last viewing wasn't as scary, but maybe I was distracted by seeing this on DVD for the first time, which enhanced the visuals and added some nice 5.1surround sound. <br /> <br />At two hours and 10 minutes, it's a bit long but there are very few lulls, if any. Gary Oldham gives his normal intense performance as Dracula and it never hurts to have Anthony Hopkins in the film.  <br /> <br />The only negative I found was Keannu Reeves, who sounds a bit wooden in his lines. Is it my imagination, or is he a terrible actor? Maybe it's just his voice. Nonetheless, Cary Elwes, Richard Grant, Sadie Frost and Bill Campbell all give good support to this film which is a real feast for the senses.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Unlike many films in recent memory, American Beauty truly did live up to the hype, and still holds its ground today. <br /> <br />Lester Burnam is a man who has become lost in his seemingly perfect world. His wife Carolyn is a real estate agent who is hell-bent on achieving absolute aesthetic perfection, no matter what the emotional cost. <br /> <br />As the film moves forward, Lester's heart is awakened by a series of life changing events, as well as the unraveling of his once sheltered existence. The cast is first rate, with Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch and Mena Suvari providing career-defining performances, though I believe that Wes Bentley's portrayl is ultimately the most haunting. <br /> <br />The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and looks very handsome on a widescreen display. The director's commentary from the director is illuminating as well, as many interesting facts and stories are provided for the viewer. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for everyone who lives in suburbia, and has ever dared to dream as to what would happen if they took a chance!
B000006IUQ|4.0|Boy, here's an intense film, a survival-in-the-wilderness adventure/thriller starring the unlikely duo of Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. It's not hard to guess who's the villain, in addition to a man-eating bear who stalks the two of them after their plane crashes in the woods of Alaska. <br /> <br />The sophistication of Hopkins, playing an extremely smart man, battling the crude Baldwin, who is insanely jealous of Hopkins' possessions, including his gorgeous wife (Elle McPherson), is intriguing to watch. So is the great scenery and best-of-all, a great action story that has you focused intently for the full two hours. <br /> <br />A human characteristic so often ignored in films the past half century is put on display here: compassionate forgiveness. Seeing forgiveness demonstrated instead of revenge is almost shocking to see. Kudos to the filmmakers, too, for not going overboard on the brutality in this adventure.
0385121679|5.0|I first came across the works of Stephen King during a rainy week in the summertime, when I was desperate for a boredom killer to pass the time. Luckily for me, my local bookstore was having a sale, and I ended up purchasing several novels to bide my time. <br /> <br />The Shining is a deeply psychological novel, one that I didn't fully comprehend when I first read it (I was only 13). However, after rereading this classic within the past year I can now fully understand what Mr. King was trying to say. <br /> <br />Jack Torrance is an alcoholic who is still battling the demons that plague his daily life. He takes a job as an overlooker for a sprawling Colorado hotel in an effort to reconnect with this wife and son, as well as finish the play he had been working on. <br /> <br />As the narrative progresses, we are thrown into the world of Jack; the brutal violence and heartbreaking struggles that we experience serve many purposes, the most importnat of which is a symbolical representation of the very ugly nature of substance abuse, and the devastating affects it has on our lives, and our loved ones. <br /> <br />While this novel truly is horrifying, I feel that it also transcends the confines of the typical 'haunted house story' and is truly a piece of literature that will be treasured for decades to come. Highly recommended for those who wish to have some meaning behind their chills and thrills, and for those who have experienced alcholism in their own lives, or that of their family members.
B00008MZ0N|1.0|I would rate this piece of film trash a \\"0\\", but unfortunately, that is not an available option. This stupid movie did not start the scene, but it did contribute to it. This review is to all of you ghetto monkey morons who think that because you have ground effects and an obnoxious sounding muffler, that somehow you have transformed yourselves into Mario Andretti and a Ferrari; I have some astounding news for you, the average citizen thinks you are an idiot with a license, and should be barred from ever contributing to the human populus. No one is impressed with your driving antics that endanger the rest of us on the roads and highways. In fact, everytime I read that one of you idiots died in a tragic accident due to your own ignorance and lack of driving skills, I actually celebrate with my friends, and we relieve ourselves on the grave, because there is one less stupid person on the road. Do the rest of the world a favor, save your money, don't make your car look stupid and ghetto, which in return, makes you look stupid and ghetto,learn how to drive safely, turn your hat around (facing forward), pick up your retarded looking baggy pants, put a belt on, and hide your underwear, (that no one wants to see, but laughs at you while you walk past) and speak a normal language that includes words besides \\"dawg\\" and other non-understandable neanderthal sounds that clearly indicate your lack of education and stupidity.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Kill Bill is an interesting hybrid. Featuring a caucasian lead within the realm of Japanese style film making, the issue of race does come up more than once, however it is apparent that this film is for EVERYONE, and that \\"silly caucasian girl who like to play with samauri swords\\" can indeed bring it! <br /> <br />The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a woman seeking revenge against her former colleagues, a group of assassins who left her for dead after murdering everyone who attended her ill fated wedding. After waking up in a coma approx. four years after the fact, she travels from coast to coast, and aiming to right the wrongs and even the scales in her favor. <br /> <br />The cast is excellent. Uma Thurman gives in the best performance of her career in my opinion, while Vivica Fox makes a tough first impression in the film's opening. Most of all, Lucy Liu is terrifying as the Yakuza boss O-Ren Ishii, inspired by another Japanese revenge film, 'Lady Snowblood.' <br /> <br />The film itself is an orgasm of light and sound, featuring beautiful fight scenes and liberating justice; Quentina Tarantino's style serves this picture well, and I can hardly wait for the inevitable Vol 3. in the future!
B00000JFV9|5.0|God Bless you, Curtis Mayfield.<br /><br />Okay, so I'm a 41 year old white male, big deal...you think I know nothing about soul...about funk...about groove? Think again. I grew up on this kind of stuff and I still find myself going back to it again and again not out of pure nostalgia, but because to me, it's \\"real music\\".<br /><br />Curtis Mayfield was a genius. It seems like everytime you turn around now somebody who hasn't even paid his/her dues is being called a genius or a diva which is kind of a sad commentary, because those people that they are calling geniuses cannot even hold a candle to Curtis Mayfield. You think Snoop Dog is going to hold up to the test of time? You really think in 30 years you're gonna pull out your Eminem Cds and tell your grandkids, \\"Oh, yeah...now that was music...\\" I don't think so...<br /><br />Mr. Mayfield struck a true chord with this recording. Without being obscene or vulgar he captured the sorrows, the joys, the ups, and the downs of not just people who lived on the city streets, but the everyday ups and downs of just being human and to me, that's a triumph in itself.<br /><br />I love this CD. You really have to sit and be with it and just allow it to seep into your psyche and know that what affects one affects the whole and what affects the whole affects the one. That's empathy. That's pathos. That's soul. That's life.<br /><br />God Bless you, Curtis Mayfield...thank you for all you left behind.

1400079179|4.0|Usually I only read history, but after all the fuss about this book I finally took the time to read it for myself. Well, as a thriller it is a good book - especially the fact that all the action appears to take place within half a day; make half a 24-series with Keifer Sutherland in it! - but I really don't understand all the fuss that has been made of this book. After having read Baigent's \\"Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\" - see my review of this book - about 20 years ago, and some of its follow-ups, I find nothing new about the \\"mystery\\" in Dan Brown; in fact, the use he makes of the material is very superficial. The lawsuit that Michael Baigent has started - and justly lost - against Dan Brown is really ridiculous: what about scores of other authors who have elaborated on the themes in the \\"Holy Blood\\"?<br /><br />So, in regard to the Church: is it real? was Jesus married to Mary Magdalene? Of course not: neither Jesus nor Mary Magdalene are historical persons. The Gospel story is an allegory on the yearly journey of the Sun across the signs of the Zodiac.<br /><br />So the Marys in the Gospel are:<br /><br />Mary the Mother = the planet Venus: when Venus rises as the Morning Star, just before sunrise, it appears as if Venus \\"gives birth\\" to the SUN;<br /><br />Mary the Wife: planet Earth: just as the wife is fertilized by the semen of the man, so the Earth is fertilized by the rays of the SUN;<br /><br />Mary the Sister: the Moon: many pre-christian religions have the sacred union/marriage - the Hieros Gamos - between a brother and a sister, in which case the latter 2 Marys merge into a single entity/concept. Since the Church abhorred such \\"incestuous\\" relations, the authors of the Gospels are completely at a loss how to deal with these concepts, resulting in the utter confusion between the different Marys in the Gospels. Especially Mary the Sister - Mary of Cleopas? Martha? Salome? - is impossible to disentangle from the story. In this respect the Old Testament does a lot better: Miriam (another Mary), the sister of Moses, is a well developed character.<br /><br />So what about the secret Leonardo Da Vinci has hidden in the Last Supper? Leonardo just knew the above mentioned truth, but had to keep out of the clutches of the Inquisition. So he alluded to the fact that the 12 Apostles are also personifications of the signs of the Zodiac. That's why one is depicted as a woman - there is only one female sign in the Zodiac: VIRGO -; the guy with the knife is the \\"piercer\\", ususally the bowman SAGITTARIUS, whose arrows \\"kill\\" the SUN at the winter solstice; the backstabbing traitor Judas = SCORPIO; the man with the keys is the \\"fisherman\\" Peter = PISCES. The other guys cannot be identified because they carry no attributes; but this is not surprising since these characters have also not been developed in the Gospels; but among them are Thomas \\"the Twin\\" Didymus = GEMINI; James, who is to be killed(beheaded?) by Herod = AQUARIUS; Bartholomy = Bar Ptolemy, the Egyptian worshipper of Amon - the ram - = ARIES; etc.<br /><br />So the Church welcomes the debate this book has spawned? I'm sure they will: discussing whether Jesus was married to the Magdalene will divert the attention from the real issue at stake: the ahistoricity of the Gospel and the debunking of Christianity as a heap of nonsens. Apparently, some churchmen reason \\"better a married Jesus than no Jesus at all\\".(another Mary), the sister of Moses, is a well developed character. <br />So what about the secret Leonardo Da Vinci has hidden in the Last Supper?

0393327655|3.0|Sam Harris is angry. Righteously angry. He powerfully states the case (obvious to atheists, i.e., rational thinkers) that organized religion is just so much nonsense, especially the Western variety with the personal god-figure. More importantly, he demonstrates how dangerous religious beliefs can be when acted upon seriously and literally. The expectation that Eternal Life awaits the deserving or chosen is comforting to the beleivers, but threatening when the true believer seeks to impose his beliefs on the rest of us, especially but not exclusively through martydom. Today, the world is confronted by a species of Islam that is fundamentally medieval.<br /><br />Harris' book is hampered in part by his too tenditious style. He comes across as a zealot. He does a fine job with description, but not so hot on his presecription. What are we, rationalists, supposed to do? It's not entirely clear that freedom of conscience would be safe in the hands of Sam Harris. The last chapter is a weak attempt to explore meditation and non-religous approaches to spirtuality.<br /><br />With these reservations, I do recommend reading this book.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is beautiful music.  But you should be able to listen to it as it's meant to be listened to.  Unfortunately, I work in a small cubicle area and share an office with hip-hop, country, and christian music fans.

B000002BFL|3.0|Tom Joad followed a short E-Street reunion for the greatest hits album. It is rumored that both Tom Joad and Youngstown were written with the E-Street in mind. These two songs are coincidentally the only two songs on the album that feature a strong melodic structure. This is immediately the biggest weakness of the album. Tom Joad was a small step up from Human Touch and Lucky Town for Springsteen, but still lacked the compelling quality of his earlier albums. Where Nebraska and Tunnel of Love, his first two \\"solo acoustic\\" outings, were characterized by strong R&R rhythms or lively melodies, the songs on Joad are more declamations.  <br /> <br />The strength of this album lies not in the songs but in the lyrics and the issues they address. Once again Springsteen confronts us with a darker side of the American dream. The tales on Joad are the tales of those left behind. The title song refers to the Steinbeck Dustbowl novel Grapes of Wrath, even though Springsteen admits his source is more the Ford movie than the book. In the lyrics we find Springsteen paraphrasing the climax of the novel in which Tom Joad plans to go out and organize workers movements. <br /> <br />\\"Now Tom said \\"Mom, wherever there's a cop beatin' a guy <br />Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries <br />Where there's a fight 'gainst the blood and hatred in the air <br />Look for me Mom I'll be there <br />Wherever there's somebody fightin' for a place to stand <br />Or decent job or a helpin' hand <br />Wherever somebody's strugglin' to be free <br />Look in their eyes Mom you'll see me.\\"\\" <br /> <br />This paraphrase sets the tone for the record. Over all the songs the Ghost of Tom Joad lurks. Be it either with the ex-convict unable to escape his past in Straight Time or the factory worker who feels more at home in \\"the blast furnaces of hell\\" in Youngstown, Tom Joad is there. Be it with the Mexican immigrants who get killed in an accident while chemically making cocaine or the New Timer leaving hisfamily in a search for work, Joad watches over them like a patron saint. The album closes with a man's somber reminiscences of childhood rhymes and sayings. <br />    <br />\\"Remember, \\"A quitter never wins and a winner never quits\\" <br />\\"The sun don't shine on a sleepin' dog's ass\\" <br />And all the rest of that stuff <br />But for you my best was never good enough\\" <br /> <br />And that about sums it up for some of us. <br />

B000056H7W|5.0|Opeth is probably the most talented band today in the whole death metal/progressive scene. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Mikael ?kerfeldt, who is the lead singer, guitarist and group leader, is a genius. His vocals can go from the best death metal growl I have ever heard, to these amazing clean vocals in the same song. These clean, \\"prog\\" vocals sound similar, maybe better, then Maynard James Keenan of Tool. And his guitar playing, you ask? He is one of the best guitarists in metal today, probably even in music currently. Rhythm guitarist Peter Lindgren is the James Hetfield of the 2000's (in music terms). He plays great behind ?kerfeldt. Martin Mendez on bass is up there as the best in death metal, and Martin Lopez is one of the best drummers in death metal. His double pedal is as fast and crazy as anyone can go. The rhythm section in Opeth is extremely underrated, and if I needed a dream death metal band, I want these two guys in the rhythm section. All 5 of these guys (and a just added keyboardist) make on of the most talented group of musicians I have ever heard. <br /> <br />But, what makes Opeth so creative and unique is the combination of death metal and prog into 10 minute songs. And unlike some other bands with many talented members that can't come through (Audioslave), Opeth makes the best music out there. They even mix some classical elements. These ten minute songs aren't the basic verse-chorus-verse structure, but more like movements. In these ten minute songs, they can showcase their talent without flaw. That's exactly what these guys do in every album they have released. The thing is they seemed to have done it a little better in 2001's \\"Blackwater Park\\". Everything just seems so much better. Not only better than Opeth's back catalogue (which is hard to better), but this is better than anything else you will listen to. If you decide to purchase this album, then everything you have ever listened to will just sound lesser, and you will be exposed to these music geniuses, or as I like to call them, artists.  <br /> <br />This masterpiece starts out with \\"The Leper Affinity\\". Probably one of the best Opeth songs, this starts out with a brutal riff and the death metal vocals, and 5 minutes into the song, it shifts to this progressive, clean singing. After the song, at least for me, my mouth was dropped to the floor. What a song. But then \\"Bleak\\" comes in. Another Opeth masterpiece, and one of my personal favorite's on this album. \\"Harvest\\" is next, and this shifts to the soft, prog part of the album. Only 6 minute's long, (which is short for Opeth), this prog masterpiece is, which I thought I would never say, beautiful. \\"The Drapery Falls\\" is another combination of death-metal and prog, and a fan favorite. \\"Dirge For November\\" and \\"The Funeral Portrait\\" follow. I like Dirge, but it really isn't the best on the album, but, hey, it is great nonetheless. \\"The Funeral Portrait\\" is more death-metal than prog, and my favorite on the album. \\"Patterns In The Ivy\\" is a short piano composition, which just goes perfectly into this album. The 12 minute title track follows, and caps off the best album released in these 00's. <br /> <br />So, what are you waiting for. Everybody who has reviewed this album, except the few morons who don't know good music when they hear it, says that it is a masterpiece. It can't be explained as normal people music, because it is just too good. It remains upon popular belief as Opeth's best and their breakout album. It is also considered the best album of the 00's. I cannot agree more. Anybody who is into death metal or prog already owns it, but even if you enjoy classical music, classic rock or any music at all, you should check out this band. This album is the perfect spot to start. Then, get Opeth's back catalogue, because it is just as good. These guys are already legends, and if they continue making albums like they are, they could be considered the greatest band ever. Not yet, but they have the opportunity. So, get this album...now! I recommend getting the limited edition version of this, because you get two brilliant b-sides, and it is cheaper on Amazon! Even if you own Blackwater Park originally.
B0007Y08T2|5.0|Dark Tranquillity is synonimous of essential melodic/death metal, and one of the top 5 bands in the genre. So, not much to say, this album got everything, incredible guitar riffs, powerful vocals, exquisite breakdowns and passages and perfect drumming.

B0000024JA|5.0|if you a hip hop head from the 90's, this album should always be talked about in all circles. 90s hip hop really set the stage for things to come in the next 10 years. it's too bad that 10 years later, the hip hop of now just does not measure up. as far as i understand, this particular time period for hip hop was more about the music as in beats, rhymes, lyricism, creativity, and all that makes hip hop great. i bought this album on tape more than once. at the same time, i bought another classic album. redman dare iz a darkside. remember month of the man?? i had the poster in my locker in high school. hoodies, black and milds, backpacks and bustops. those were the days.

B000EOTAM6|4.0|Once again I find myself in the minority. The Tomatometer's gauge at rottentomatoes.com levels off at an extremely cool 10% approval rating; meaning 90% of the critics DIDN'T like it.<br /><br />Most of the bashing comes via comparisons to CATWOMAN (another bomb) or the fact that the original Aeon Flux was an animated feature on MTV and the translation to live-action cinema didn't work. Not having seen these animated versions - or CATWOMAN for that matter - I can't make any comparisons. But what I can do is tell you how the movie flowed, how well it was acted, and its entertainment value.<br /><br />Charlize Theron (NORTH COUNTRY) stars as Aeon Flux, a rebel in the 25th century. A terrible disease has decimated humanity and its surviving members hide behind an enclosure, cut-off from the possible devastating effects of what lay beyond (think LOGAN'S RUN and you'll be close). Within the confines of their home live the remaining five million members of society thanks to the medical efforts of the Goodchild Regime, named after Trevor Goodchild (Martin Csokas). Aeon Flux belongs to an elite group of resistance fighters known as the Monicans who's goal is to topple the Goodchild Regime. People have been vanishing. Police actions are resulting in deaths. And Aeon Flux is going to find out why.<br /><br />As we move through the stronghold of humanity (the city is known as Bregna), we learn and see much about this futuristic yet completely alien-like society. Pills can heighten awareness and even send coded messages to ones brain. Computers look like musical instruments or a type of String Theory. Everyone feels that something is wrong with their world ...and there is. Cloning and its effects on the power-base of the Goodchild Regime are holding humanity back at a terrible price.<br /><br />CATWOMAN comparisons aside (yes, Charlize looks fantastic in her skin-tight leather outfit), this is a thinking person's film. There are lots of little tidbits thrown into the film that give it a futuristic look without trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).<br /><br />The pacing of the film was excellent. Never once did it get bogged down in the minutia of the times or the science. If you can't keep up, oh well. Leaping from action sequence to fight scene to action sequence made the 93 minutes fly by. The acting was okay. Nothing special but nothing horrible either. Charlize was the shining star, of course, and gave a relatively fine performance.<br /><br />For my time, this was extremely entertaining and sexy, and full of great sci-fi scenery.<br /><br />Only one question remains: What's up with the critics?!hout trying too hard (the computers were a nice touch, as were filming many external shots in Berlin, Germany where new construction is the rage).

0451529065|5.0|I was amazed at how easy to read this book was. I fully expected a dry tomb of factual anecdotes, however I was pleasantly surprised to find an easy and interesting read. Darwin's style of writing is extremely persuasive and thorough; it is easy to understand how this book took the world by storm through it's many supportive examples. In this day and age, it is still relevant and is not obviously dated, no mean feat for a science book written in 1859 before a lot of major discoveries.   [...]  The only negative about this particular issue is that the print is extremely small and closely set, which for some readers may indicate that a different edition would be preferable.
B00066VUPM|4.0|Before I got this collection, all I knew were the songs from \\"The Man Who\\". That drove me to get this, and now I'm very glad I did. Included here are the four great singles from \\"The Man Who\\", as well as every great one before or since. So besides killer tunes like \\"Writing To Reach You\\" and \\"Why Does It Always Rain On Me\\", I now also love most of the rest here. My new favorites would be the opener \\"Sing\\", maybe one of their happiest and catchiest singles ever. I also dig \\"Walking In The Sun\\", \\"Tied To The 90's\\", \\"Side\\", and \\"All I Wanna Do Is Rock\\". With each listen my fave songs tend to change though. My only complaints are....why limit themselves to just the singles for a collection, and like all comps, why not chronological order? Still, most of the good stuff is here, and anybody with a taste for good alt-rock or brit-pop who gets this, should end up quite \\"Happy\\".
B00005JOFQ|5.0|This film tells the story of two Wyoming ranch-hands getting a job together and eventually finding themselves in love with each other. The impact of this impossible love on their further lives is laid bare in agonizing detail, resulting in a heartbreakingly poignant conclusion that leaves not a single winner. Those who prefer happy endings are well advised to stay away, though they will be the poorer for it.<br /><br />The brilliant opening scene has you riveted right away. The main protagonists appear in the shot, yet all there is is silence. It takes ages for anyone to say anything, and when the first full sentence is spoken it is by neither of the boys, but by the man they are seeking a job from. It is typical of the film: enormous suspense and terrific emotional charges build up through silence and lack of action. The smallest gestures and the tiniest, mumbled phrases gain huge significance: Ennis squatting naked in the background, washing himself, and Jack in the foreground, very actively NOT looking. If you don't have an eye for such detail, this movie will mean nothing to you. If you do, the characters will speak to you in an unprecedented way, and you'll even find an occasional tongue in cheek joke adding some comic relief to this tragic story (e.g., Jack driving a tractor of the 'Versatile' brand). In this context, the few emotional and aggressive outbursts of course pack a tremendous punch.<br /><br />And then there is the sheer beauty of the images. The sweeping landscapes of Wyoming (actually Alberta, Canada) lend a Walt-Whitmanesque power to the relationship of the two men, and heighten the contrast with the hideous little towns where they conduct their obligatory marriages - which after a promising start recede into joyless dreariness, until, as Jack puts it, they can be conducted over the phone. Prieto's cinematography is simply breathtaking, and a random collection of frames from this film would make a great photobook.<br /><br />The lead actors carry the movie, and take the skill of acting to new heights. From Gyllenhaal this is no surprise, as he had already proven himself to be an actor of extraordinary calibre and versatility. His Jack Twist, notwithstanding his obvious imperfections, is instantly loveable, and his descent into increasing anger and bitterness painful to watch. It is, however, Ledger's performance that is the big surprise and the crowning glory of this film. Author Annie Proulx observed that he understood Ennis's character better than she herself did, and if ever an actor got under the skin of his character, it is here. His Ennis is like a coiled-up spring, the tremendous tension inside palpable throughout. Ledger certainly has come a long way, and more than makes up for silly excursions like 'The Brothers Grimm'. Interestingly, in a way he comes full circle with the start of his acting career, when he appeared in an Australian teen soap as a cyclist on a sports academy, struggling to come to terms with his homosexuality. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also give sterling performances as the tormented wives. Alma's Thanksgiving outburst and even more Lureen's telephone conversation with Ennis are acting feats of rare power - it is impossible to think of Hathaway returning to \\"Princess Diaries\\" after this, though apparently she will. Roberta Maxwell appears only briefly as Jack's mother, yet projects so much intensity into her few lines and all her facial expressions that you feel you could write a novel about the woman.<br /><br />Hollywood has come a long way in finally admitting a film like this to the mainstream. All the fuss surrounding it remains shocking, though; rightwing zealots and \\"christian\\" bishops would have you believe you're in for some gay hardcore flick, but BBM actually contains no more than the barest minimum of necessary man-on-man lovescenes. In comparison to straight-themed movies (or even to the straight lovescenes in BBM itself), there is still a long way to go.<br /><br />It is even more shocking that the will and the courage were still lacking to award BBM the ultimate prize it so very clearly deserved - some Academy members, like good old Tony Curtis (didn't we see him in a dress once?) refusing to even view it, thus further devaluating the meaning of the Oscar system. Good as Crash is, it has nothing of the tautness, tension and sheer personality of BBM, and even less of its raw beauty and sad, haunting atmosphere.<br /><br />In all, this is one of the most consistently beautiful, meaningful, and emotionally draining films I've seen in a long time - and this comes from somebody who generally cares very little for Wild West movies, the Sixties, or C&W music. This intimate, universal tale of loss and regret puts every Hollywood megabudget production of the last three decades to shame. If it leaves you unmoved, you might want to visit your GP to check whether your heart is still in place.at the will and the courage were still lacking to award BBM the ultimate prize it so very clearly deserved - some Academy members, like good old Tony Curtis (didn't we see him in a dress once?) refusing to even view it, thus further devaluating the meaning of the Oscar system.

630469654X|5.0|LadyHawke is a simply beautiful, enchanting and most romantic medievil tale of two lovers doomed by the darkened curse of an evil and jealous bishop. By day, the delicately exquisite Lady Isabeau (Michelle Pfeiffer) is transformed into a graceful Hawke, while her beloved and heroic Captain Ettienne Navarre(Rutger Hauer), takes on the form of a black Wolf through the night. Never the twain shall meet in human form, destined to never consummate their love. The devoted lovers can do nought but roam hopelessly, though never parted, waiting for a miracle and divine sign that the curse may somehow be broken. It comes in the form of a recently escaped prisoner, the quick and crafty theif, Phillipe 'The Mouse' Gaston(Matthew Broderick). Who, saved by Navarre and later assisted by a rougly eccentric and exiled Monk (played by veteran actor Leo Mckern), guides them to the key which will undo the curse and re-unite them, helping to ward off their attackers and enemies along the way.  LadyHawke handles the medievil genre with class and wit. Artfully directed and photogaphed, it is fast paced with plenty of action and thrills, whilst always maintaining the mystical and mythical poetry of the story beautifully. The script balances both modern comical elements with classic romance and imagery in a way which keeps the viewer both entertained and enchanted. Whilst the tragic dilemma of Navarre and Isabeau, along with their profound love for each other, is captured and presented in a way which is heartfelt and sublimely moving.  The actors are most suitably cast for this film. Pfeiffer; with her delicate, stunning classic beauty and refined grace, is perfect as Isabeau. And the lessor known 'Hauer', makes a most dashing and teutonically hansome Captain Navarre. Indeed an impressive and imposing, almost futuristic figure, all in black aloft his majestic, powerfull horse, 'Golaith'. But the film would not have been as successful or enjoyable without the delightful performance of Broderick as 'Phillipe'; who's character provides a comic lightness and suitable contrast within the story, that is cleverly subtle and droll. Added to this is an impressive supporting cast of very high class and calibre; including 'John Wood', who is just wonderful as the unsettlingly sinister and powerful Bishop.  The film, with its magical premise of the lovers' spirits being trapped within that of a beautiful bird of prey and majestic wild beast, has a very mystical feel and is quite visually stunning. The romantic and metaphorical imagery of this period and genre has always captivated me, I must admit. Part fairy tale/fantasy and romantic legend and part action packed adventure, it has all the ingredients to make it an enduring favourite and classic piece of cinema. My only criticism is that of the quite '80's' musical score which doesn't really capture the mood or emotion of the film. It is not one I would have chosen and does seem quite out of place. I realize that they chose it in order to give the story a more modern 'Hollywood action' kind of feel and undertone, but it didn't really work for me. I would have prefered some haunting celtish pipes and drums or suitable classical style. Apart from that, LadyHawke is a very well crafted, visually beautiful and riveting movie, perfect for watching on a rainy sunday.

B000B8QEZG|5.0|Madonna is an artist that constantly changes who she is. While she is still the Queen of Pop, her music style changes with each album. I like to think of her as a chameleon; you're never sure what she's going to do and Madonna never does the same thing twice.<br /><br />Starting out with her pop albums (the self titled \\"Madonna\\" and \\"True Blue\\") she then switched her focus to sex (who could forget her album \\"Erotica\\"? Or her book \\"SEX\\"?). Then, after the birth of her children, her focus changed once again to electronica. This change in focus produced perhaps the best selling Madonna album ever: \\"Ray of Light\\".<br /><br />After \\"Ray of Light\\" and another electronica folk album \\"Music\\" came \\"American Life\\". I love this album, but many claim it to be her one huge musical flop. It's a deeper album because Madonna attempted to make a statement and say something in her music.<br /><br />It covered all sorts of ground but was trashed by fans and critics and fans alike. To appease them she put out \\"Remixed and Revisited\\" which sparked her \\"Reinvention Tour\\". This album, though only a short seven songs, was received much better than \\"American Life\\" because it was like the old Madonna had come back to sing again.<br /><br />And then the dance floor was quiet for a bit. Many wondered if Madonna would continue her music career after such a devastating musical punch to the gut. Many thought it would be the last album of her career. I am ecstatic to report that the nay Sayers were wrong. Madonna is back with a vengeance and \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is the proof of that.<br /><br />Perhaps her best album since \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna has reinvented music once again. Taking her cues from music gone by, Madonna has created a non-stop dance album that just gets better each time you listen to it. It's disco mixed with beat and rhythm and you can't help but get up and dance to it. It's a nonstop dance album that just begs your body to move to its music. Gone is the dark haired Madonna of \\"American Life\\". Now a red haired siren leads us through a dance sensation.<br /><br />There has been a lot of publicity about Madonna using a sample of music from ABBA (\\"Gimme Gimme Gimme (A Man After Midnight)\\") but this serves well to give the album its starting point. \\"Hung Up\\" is an amazing dance track that makes you want to dance. The sample from ABBA gives it a life that flows through the album. Though there are no other samples of music in the rest of the songs, none are needed. After ABBA's help on the first song, Madonna is in comfortable shoes.<br /><br />After listening to the album several times (it hasn't left my stereo since I bought it) I'd have to say that my favorite song is \\"Push\\". I'm pretty sure that this song is about her husband Guy Ritchie, but the message of the song is a great one. Some of the lyrics are as follows:<br /><br />/you push me! /to go the extra mile/you push me!/when it's difficult to smile/you push me! /a better version of myself/you push me!/only you and no one else/you push me!<br /><br />see the other point of view/you push me!/when there's nothing else to do<br /><br />you push me!/when I think I know it all/You push me!/when I stumble and I fall/<br /><br />Though the song at first sounds like a rocking dance tune, you have to stop and listen to the words to find the deeper message within the song. That is true of many of the songs on \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\". Though the tune makes you want to dance, the words will let you see into the world of Madonna and her confessions.<br /><br />Another deep song on the album is \\"Isaac\\". It begins with incredible vocals by Yitzhak Sinwani that set the tune of this rocking track. The track is very much like a spiritual experience and is incredibly layered. It is one of the more spiritual tracks on the album, where Madonna comments on religion, heaven, hell and the forgiveness of God all in one song.<br /><br />/Staring up into the heavens/In this hell that binds your hands/Will you sacrifice your comfort?/Make your way in a foreign land?/Wrestle with your darkness/Angels call your name/Can you hear what they're saying?/Will you ever be the same?/<br /><br />One of my other favorite tracks is \\"Sorry\\". Though it is about a break up and forgiveness, it's an incredible track that makes you want to move. Everyone can relate to its words:<br /><br />/I don't want to hear/I don't want to know/Please don't say you're sorry/I've heard it all before/And I can take care of myself/<br /><br />Though it is one of the sadder songs on the album, it still makes you want to dance. It is deep because of its layers. You will only hear the message if you listen. I think that \\"Sorry\\" is an anthem for anyone that has ever had their heart broken and doesn't want it to be mended by petty words.<br /><br />Of course, not all songs are deep on this album. \\"I Love New York\\" while lacking in lyrics, is simply a great dance track. It is they weakest lyrically on the album but is one of the best tracks for a rollicking good beat and will make you grin by the end of it. Madonna was just having good fun with this song. While loving New York isn't really a confession, it's a great dance track.<br /><br />/I don't like cities/But I like New York/Other places/make me feel like a dork/Los Angeles is for/people who sleep/Paris and London/Baby you can keep/Other cities always make me mad/Other places always make me sad/No other city ever made glad except like New York/<br /><br />Words cannot express how much I love this album. I think it is ten times better than \\"Ray of Light\\" because it's evident that Madonna is having fun here. I've listened to the album countless times already and, each and every time, it's just getting better. It's so layered that I hear something new each time I listen to it.<br /><br />Madonna proves that, even though these are dance tracks, she is not just the Queen of Pop anymore.<br /><br />Jamieson Wolf<br /><br />Previously published at:<br /><br />Linear Reflections: The Review Siteavens/In this hell that binds your hands/Will you sacrifice your comfort?/Make your way in a foreign land?/Wrestle with your darkness/Angels call your name/Can you hear what they're saying?/Will you ever be the same?/ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />One of my other favorite tracks is \\"Sorry\\". Though it is about a break up and forgiveness, it's an incredible track that makes you want to move. Everyone can relate to its words:  <br /> <br />/I don't want to hear/I don't want to know/Please don't say you're sorry/I've heard it all before/And I can take care of myself/ <br /> <br />Though it is one of the sadder songs on the album, it still makes you want to dance. It is deep because of its layers. You will only hear the message if you listen. I think that \\"Sorry\\" is an anthem for anyone that has ever had their heart broken and doesn't want it to be mended by petty words.  <br /> <br />Of course, not all songs are deep on this album. \\"I Love New York\\" while lacking in lyrics, is simply a great dance track. It is they weakest lyrically on the album but is one of the best tracks for a rollicking good beat and will make you grin by the end of it. Madonna was just having good fun with this song. While loving New York isn't really a confession, it's a great dance track.  <br /> <br />/I don't like cities/But I like New York/Other places/make me feel like a dork/Los Angeles is for/people who sleep/Paris and London/Baby you can keep/Other cities always make me mad/Other places always make me sad/No other city ever made glad except like New York/ <br /> <br />Words cannot express how much I love this album. I think it is ten times better than \\"Ray of Light\\" because it's evident that Madonna is having fun here. I've listened to the album countless times already and, each and every time, it's just getting better. It's so layered that I hear something new each time I listen to it.  <br /> <br />Madonna proves that, even though these are dance tracks, she is not just the Queen of Pop anymore.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Jamieson Wolf <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Previously published at: <br /> <br />Linear Reflections: The Review Site <br /> <br />
B00009R6J7|4.0|This is great for awkward shooting positions where you have a hard time eyeing things up through the viewfinder.  Also, when doing panoramic series this is nice to help make sure that your photos will actually stitch together when all is said and done.  Even for normal shooting whenever you have to bend over most people tend to lean slightly, thus skewing their view, so this little gadget helps you make sure that you are really shooting level.
B00012QM9K|5.0|I originally saw this movie in a theater, and as the audience filed out I noticed that they were utterly silent. This film affected me as profoundly as any film I have seen, before or since. Spielberg has captured the inhumanity of the Holocaust, close-up and stark. Rather than comment through dialogue or use of the camera on the Nazis' hatred of the Jews, Spielberg instead let the actions speak for themselves. And those actions scream at you, tear at your soul, haunt you forever. <br /> <br />After watching the second time (I have viewed this DVD several dozen times), I realized that this particular picture has a look and a feel unlike anything I have seen from Hollywood - or anywhere else, for that matter. The black-and-white photography adds to the dingy, dirty feel of the entire movie. The violence is spontaneous and jarring, totally random and yet more frightening because of its randomness...anyone could be next. By the time the train bearing Schindler's women arrives at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the killing has desensitized us to a point,  only to face the new horror of killing on a whole other level. Many shots haunt me from \\"List\\", but two remain with me - The mountains of luggage, shoes, eyeglasses, etc. after loading Jews on cattle cars in Krakow, and the giant chimney at Auschwitz belching its human flame and smoke high into the night sky. <br /> <br />This film is important for future generations, to keep the memory of the Holocaust firmly in our minds' eye. I would recommend it to all people, although children under the age of 14 or 15 may wish to wait to watch it until they have gotten a bit older.
B000BT97AO|1.0|I bought this dvd because I am a fan of Neil Gaiman and also because of the good reviews from people here on Amazon.  With much anticipation, my hubby and I put the kids to bed early and sat down to watch it.  After about an hour of the movie we were looking at each other wondering how it could have gotten such good reviews!  Now, keep in mind that I have all of Neil Gaiman's books and I rather enjoy them...but this movie was so boring!!!  I am sad that I spent the money on buying it instead of renting it first.  I HIGHLY recommend renting it before purchasing so you can make your own judgement.  As for me...well, this dvd is NOT going to stay in our collection of dvd's, as it will not be watched again!  The Neverwhere movie, though poorly budgeted, was MUCH better...the story iis wonderful even if the movie itself was cheaply made.  I recommend that instead.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Director:  Eli Roth <br />Cast:  Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jan Vlasak, Jana Kaderabkova, Jennifer Lim. <br />Running Time: 94 minutes <br />Rated R for intense, gruesome torture violence, extreme amounts of female nudity, and language. <br /> <br />\\"Hostel\\" is a very confused, problematic film. On the one hand, it is armed with a dynamite, socially relevant premise and an absolutely blistering albeit accidental commentary of the human condition, judged especially on the audience but, on the other, it is an appalling example of missed execution, bumbling screen writing, and over-hype. It is a dichotomy of contradiction that unravels the macabre with the simple relish of fraternity caliber humor. Rest assured, this is not a very good film, but perhaps there is enough novelty in what will no doubt be a hugely successful film to warrant a look at some point.  The premise and subtext underlying director Eli Roth's (\\"Cabin Fever\\") latest film is essentially a dissection of the pleasures that drive two separate groups of vacationers. First, there are the three backpackers traveling as sex tourists across the European continent in pursuit of the carnal pleasures of the flesh. Two of the kids are the typical college byproduct of an over-sexualized culture in which adolescent achievement is measured more by the number of orgasm achieved during the month long jaunt rather than any academic, professional, or personal merit. Complementing this group are the heavies: rich, professional men who for a sizable fee can satisfy their diabolical pleasures of the body through the murder an torture of specimens apportioned out by some clandestine charnal company of mobsters and henchmen. These two groups are two extreme sides of the same coin, both in search of the pleasures derived from other people; one sexual, one absolutely homicidal. A very thin thread divides the two groups of protagonists, perhaps leading credence to the theory that left unchecked, extreme sexual behavior can lead to extreme homicidal behavior. <br /> <br />\\"Hostel\\" then breaks down in its transition. It turns alternately from a light hearted, \\"EuroTrip\\" sex romp populated by one truly annoying Icelandic character to a somewhat dark, more like dimly lighted than opaque, journey into the world of economic sadism but the transition is full of seams. With little of the ominousness of the gruesomely brilliant \\"Wolf Creek\\" or the suspense of \\"Audition\\", the plot heavy handedly limps from \\"American Pie\\" to Hannibal Lector like a jagged scar. Before the audience even has a chance to grasp the nature of the threat, one character is offed off-screen and another has a sit down with the diabolical surgeon who explains pretty much the jist of what is going on.  Also, there was a lack of continuity with the heavies; since the baddies are rich merchants of torture and leather jacketed henchmen, the nature of the villainy lacked a face. Black jackets and walkie talkies don't generate the same suspense as a ghostly Micheal Myers or backwoods mutant. In fact, as two of the principals flee the dungeons, the film digresses into an absurd Inspector Gadget esquire escape, with legions of henchmen pacing back and forth oblivious to the cowering pair skulking their way through the corridors Roth lacks an eye for action as evident here. It was beyond heavy handed, it was contrived. <br /> <br />The torture was rather boring, nothing much new: slicing of an Achilles, a dissection, a drill to the foot, clipping of a toe.   It was all pretty pedestrian and attention seeking as personified y its director. The carnage in this film essentially plays out with the suspense of a college party drinking game.  In the end, Roth may have betrayed his own sensibility. Changing tone for the third time in the film, the survivors limp toward a showdown with their tormentors in which retribution is inflicted in such a light hearted manner that one has to wonder if Rotheven believes in the subtext of his own film. If sex and sadism are two extreme sides of the same coin, then how can he relishly delight in the slaughter of the heavies with such gratuitously bloody style The audience swooned when the breasts made their first appearance, reviled (mildly) when the torture commenced, and then laughed when the three Hostel wranglers were rundown on the street Is Roth suggesting that the same psycho sexual tenancies exist even in relatively sane people (the audience?) or perhaps was the gore thrown in for the pure geek factor? If it is the former than the joke is on the audience and Roth is laughing at his own fan base. Either way, the change in tempo tended to unravel any horror that could have been generated, by purpose or incident. In the end, the carnage of \\"Hostel\\" is tantamount to eating a bad Thai meal; heavy feet and buyer's remorse.
6305313687|5.0|American History X is a powerful film directed by Tony Kaye, and starring Edward Norton (Fight Club), Edward Furlong (Terminator 2: Judgement Day), and Beverly D'Angelo (National Lampoon's Vacation).    The movie is about racism in American society, focusing on a white suburban man named Derek Vinyard, played brilliantly by Norton, who following the death of his father on the hands of a black man, becomes an active member of a white supremacy group led by Cameron Alexander, played by Keach. His ideals are all about ridding their society and ultimately the country from all the immigrants and minority groups who as he believes have infested the good white culture with poverty and struggle in 'their' own land. The events of the film are recollections, shot in black and white, of Derek's younger brother Danny, played by Furlong, who witnessed his older brother murder a black kid outside their home and get arrested. While Derek is in jail, he comes to a realization that everything he stood and fought for was an ill cause, and finally redeems himself; he comes out only to find that his own flesh and blood is following in his footsteps.    American History X is a very intriguing movie about redemption, discussing some very delicate and serious issues that are infesting in American society on a daily basis. What makes the movie so powerful is Edward Norton (he was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar for his excellent performance) who delivers his best onscreen performance to date.     Recommended    A
B00005JNEI|1.0|This movie is so stupid and one sided. You can tell a democrat made it. I think it is funny that I saw this movie for sale at wal-mart in the $3.88 pile. Shows how much it stinks. Bush won the 2004 election so this didn't help the democrats at all. Nice try Mikey.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|Keanu Reeves has emerged as a major presence here.  Of course, \\"My Private Idaho\\" showed us how good an actor he really is, but too few people saw that strange, excellent film.  Here he's great; sexy, competant, and with that edginess necessary to all action heroes.  And this movie delivers.  Action all the way, with Dennis Hopper, the perfect villain, and a strong female lead, a hero in her own right, who doesn't fall apart when everything else does.  It is violent, with a couple of gory scenes and extremely fast- paced.  I noticed in the beginning, when Reeves and the always excellent Jeff Daniels first arrive at the bomb site, as they prepare to go in, the camera moves around them in such a way, as to aid the impression of urgency and speed.  It was very good.  The bus leaping the 50-foot gap was the only scene that didn't work, as you could clearly see it sinking before they cut to the next shot where it hits the other side, tail end miraculously up instead of down.  And it sure looked like they blew up a real plane.  Hopper was truly creepy, playing his role with such understatement, as if this was all so ordinary.  But Reeves is the star here.
B00068NVL6|5.0|A close friend of mine recently showed me this film, which I knew NOTHING about. I literally mean NOTHING!<br /><br />I wasn't really a woody Allen fan, (that'll get me a few negative points, oh well!) and i'd only seen a couple of his films and enjoyed them BUT didn't get the hype (is that the right word?) about how he is regarded by some as the greatest director ever. However, all I can say now is ...<br /><br />Where has this film been all my life? It's older than I am! Why hasn't someone shown this to me earlier? Shame on you planet earth for keeping this quiet.<br /><br />I haven't got any interesting factoids or snippets of info about the film, but there are plenty of reviewers on here who can do that job better than I can, however, if you have seen this film why haven't you bought it yet. If you haven't seen it, buy it. If you know someone who hasn't seen it, buy it for them. You'll have a friend for life.<br /><br />I cannot stress how much I love this film, it's so refreshing and sharp and on the money, despite it's age. The use of imagery is used to hilarious effect. I don't want to spoil anything, so i'll just say that a couple of my favourite scenes are to do with dodgems, and indulgent film makers, and give a knowing nod and a wink.<br /><br />I get it now but i've got some catching up to do.<br /><br />Next stop Manhattan.
B000AMJDHY|3.0|In my humble opinion, Panic! at the Disco is not as great as they get credit for. The vocalist does sound a hell of a lot like Patrick from Fall Out Boy, but honestly the band doesnt sound EXACTLY like FOB, panic! is more dance-y and poppy and they have a bit of a different sound in general. They are very similar though. I have a few friends that really really like p!atd and never shut up about them. It's getting really annoying, because they're not that good, in my opinion. I don't like how everyone thinks they're like the best band ever when there are soo many bands that are so much better, even Fall Out Boy (i'm a big FOB fan). Like really, get a life. And they never even really became super popular until \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\" started to be played all the time on MTV, unless they were and i'm just really out of it (i don't watch mtv or listen to the radio or pay attention to the mainstream, i like what i like based on my own opinion and most of the time i don't even realize whether or not bands i like are popular or totally unheard of).  <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, i like Panic! at the Disco just fine, i just dont love them.. and i don't see why they're getting so much attention when they're not that good.
0393035158|4.0|This movie is worth viewing just for the experience of seeing Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson interacting in as free and natural a way as you could hope to see on screen.I haven't encountered such a believable coupling as this before.I liked the first half of the film most but the whole thing is of a very high standard and always entertaining to watch.uses. He should have confined himself solely to, for example, to the corrosive effect religion and faith can have on democratic government which was founded on reason, evidence, logic and other principles growing out of the Enlightenment.  <br /> <br />As we can see today, faith has promoted the idea of holding beliefs - political beliefs - with little or no underpinning evidence. The concept of believing on faith alone can make citizens lazy about collecting facts before forming a belief in what Bush says about WMD in Iraq.  <br /> <br />For people who have been exhorted by preachers to not be too bothered by pesky facts undermining beliefs in God, heaven and so on, acceptance of the flimsy evidence presented to them about Iraq is easy. They learned to avoid the requirement for evidence in church!  <br /> <br />So, this is the value of Harris' book - the concept of beliving in something using only \\"faith\\" as a guide should be kept very much in the background in conducting the affairs of a democracy where we must have reason, logic, open-mindedness and facts to guide us as we proceed in our country and in the world. To do otherwise can lead to disaster as can be seen presently.  <br /> <br />Anyone with knowledge of the Founders knows, while they called on \\"Providence\\", they did not base their actions on \\"faith\\" in forming and running our government.  <br /> <br />William P.

1401206905|5.0|In the world of Comic-Book Heros I have two favorites Batman and Swampthing. Moore Knows Swampthing and Miller Knows Batman. But not only does Miller know batman He knows the characters surrounding batman. This is Not just a batman origin but the origin of James Gordon (Soon to be commissioner) and  even shows how catwoman came to be. this is a great year one for batman. I only have one beef. Batman's model kinda reminded me of campy old BAM POW KABOOOM Batman. its not really worth any real notice and really only occurs in a a few segregated places but I think Mazzucchelli could have tryed a little bit harder. <br />In his defense though I think the artwork is amazing Im glad Miller decided not to illustrate this one. The story itself is flawless The ending is brilliant though its more of a beginning then an ending of course.
B000001EGA|2.0|I should first state that I am a huge EJ fan. His music has been extremely important to me over the years. He is, without a doubt, a genius ... I would go so far as to call him the Mozart of our times.<br /><br />But, Elton can also write bloated, self-indulgent tripe, and if you ask me, this album belongs in that bucket. I give it 2 stars just because of SSMLT, one of his all-time greats. I never cease to be blown away by that song. But the rest of this album? Booooooring!!!!
1401207138|5.0|Artwork-Brilliant, Story-Cativating, Characters-well established, This book Is pure Genius. I bought this book after reading the first two books in Moore's Swampthing series+ I heard all the hype surrounding this book and knew I had to check it out. Im so glad I did. every character is disgusting and wretched in their own way (with the exception of nite-owl who has just gotten fat) whatever political stance the character takes it shows the candid vile when ideas are taken too far. WHo watches the watchmen? You should. check this book out before you die without learning something about how comic books are supposed to be written. Also Dave Gibbons shows flawless artwork. There are some truely Breathtaking and horrifing images. However if you find you self unable to soak in details, artwork, prose, and dialoge at the same time you may have a hard time swallowing this book. this isnt superman. its not a childs comic do not read expecting a harty tale of good ole crime fighting heros facing of against crazed masked villians. You wont find that here.
B0000C8AV3|4.0|Dylan's 1983 \\"Infidels\\" traded the outright in your face religious themes for a far more subtle approach. First of all, the word \\"Jesus\\" does not appear anywhere on this album (in sharp contrast to his previous three albums \\"Slow Train Coming\\", \\"Saved\\", and \\"Shot of Love\\"). Nor does \\"God\\". With some very salient exceptions, the album as a whole comes off as purely secular. And many listeners interpreted it as such following its release. They exhaled deeply and gave thanks that Bob had finally \\"stopped preaching\\". Not only that, Mark Knopfler's presence probably helped. By 1983 Dire Straits had a solid and burgeoning reputation as a distinctive rock/pop band (at least in the UK, and very soon in the US). A much less well known Knopfler had also worked on Dylan's 1979 \\"Slow Train Coming\\". So, following Dylan's maligned \\"Christian\\" albums, Knopfler's new found success probably lent some credibility to this album.<br /><br />Appreciating \\"Infidels\\" as a non-religious work doesn't pose any great problems. It does include some brilliant songs, most notably the infectious \\"Jokerman\\" (often hailed as one of Dylan's best \\"late\\" songs) and the hauntingly ethereal \\"I and I\\". But other listeners dug through the lyrical strata and found boatloads of Biblical references. For example, \\"Jokerman\\" arguably contains thirty or more direct Biblical references (a quick search on the internet will reveal these). And theories about the identity of Dylan's \\"Sweetheart\\" in \\"Sweetheart Like You\\" abound. Suggestions range from Jesus to the Statue of Liberty. But a change in reference took place here. The lyrics on Infidels seem to point more to Judaism than Christianity. And of course at the time fiery rumors spread that Dylan had \\"re-converted\\" back to his heritage. To add to the speculation, the photo inside of \\"Infidels\\" shows Dylan kneeling at the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. So religion was very much still on the menu.<br /><br />Not only religion, but unabashed politics also returned. Some claim that the raucous \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" supported Israel's invasion of Iraq and Lebanon. The lyrics leave some room for speculation, but they almost definitely refer to Israel. \\"License To Kill\\" bemoans humanity's killer instincts. It also contains the somewhat eyebrow furrowing line \\"Oh, Man has invented his doom, first step was touching the moon.\\" \\"Man of Peace\\" rehashes the rather familiar message of a wolf in sheep's clothing while providing the album's most outright religious line: \\"Sometimes Satan comes as a man of peace.\\" And the not at all bashful \\"Union Sundown\\" criticized the greedy side of globalization before the term \\"globalization\\" became a buzzword. It also professes that \\"Democracy don't rule the world, you'd better get that through your head. This world is ruled by violence, but I guess that's better left unsaid.\\"<br /><br />Inevitably, many hailed \\"Infidels\\" as Dylan's \\"comeback\\" even though nearly every Dylan album has received that title at one point or another. Overall, it remains a fairly solid album, especially in comparison to his 1980s output. Though it doesn't sit comfortably amongst his best work. Also, a growing number of fans mourn what Dylan ultimately left off this album. The offical bootleg series finally released these tracks in the nineties. But whether or not the album would have improved greatly or not by including these tracks remains speculatory and arguable. Different songs would have likely led to different production techniques, a different sound, etc. So it remains difficult to say. In the end, Dylan decided not to include these songs and the album is what it is. And it remains a good but not great Dylan album made more than worthwhile by at least two late classics. The eighties signaled tough times for Dylan. A string of uneven and unfelt releases followed until \\"Oh Mercy\\" finally broke through the gathering clouds. Dylan talks about this period in \\"Chronicles, Volume 1\\". But at the time \\"Infidels\\" signaled no storm or decline. It showed that Dylan somehow managed to survive the most maligned phase of his career. And he just kept going.o storm or decline. It showed that Dylan somehow managed to survive the most maligned phase of his career. And he just kept going.

B0000AI45P|5.0|I first heard about Television when I was looking through Sonic Youth's influences. Any band Thurston likes I should I said to myself. Mind you I had no idea what they sounded like.  Of course I forgot about this and didn't remeber them untill I was puzzled on what to get in at the record store. I figured i'd give Television a shot and see if they were any good. <br />From the first note of See No Evil i knew this was a landmark album. The intertwining of Tom Verlaine's nervous lead and Richard Lloyd's more conventional rythym guitar is the groundwork for all most all indie bands of the 80's 90's and 00's.  Verlaine is an incredible song writer Dylan like lyrics with a backdrop of guitar frenzy. <br />The most common complaint about Television is that they aren't punk.  If you compare this to any Zeppelin album of the mid '70's this is punk. It proved punk wasnt about spit and razorblades, it proved that punk was mearly stripped down rock. <br />The fact that they credit solo's is groundbreaking alone.  The second solo on Marquee Moon is arguably the best solo put to tape it literally cascades high above any Jimmy Paige or David Gilmour solo that rely's on effects pedals and overdubs. Clean sounding fender guitars with no fuzztones was unheard of in the '70's but Television pulled it off. Every track is fresh and new even today.  Any fan of the Strokes can see direct influences.  Marquee Moon rewrote the rules of what music could sound like and showed that arena rock was dying already.
B0000640VO|5.0|I saw this film at the theater with my father and my brother. I didn't really understand what the movie was about at first, but I had my eyes glued to the screen because of its captivating cinematography. The film was rich in colours--it was never dull.<br /><br />It was only a year later did I understand this film. My brother bought a DVD, so I decided to watch it again. Along with its cinematography, I found out that the story too, was never dull. It's truly original and enchanting, and it's not always that I see films like this one. One thing that makes this film original is the fact that the circumstances in the story are weird (sometimes even impossible), touching, and funny at the same time. The cast of characters make this film even more charming. Audrey Tautou and Mathieu Kassovitz have perfect chemistry that I got attached to Amelie Poulain and Nino Quincampoix for a very long time.<br /><br />Great cast, great story, great colours, great director... it all sums up to a great film!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is a good movie but watch MULVA II : KILL TEEN APE it's pretty freakin' funny!

0618001816|5.0|Three features: 'Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life' a truly outrageous Monty Python film about the mystery of birth, death, and everything in between! 'The Life Of Brian' a daring satire about a blundering prophet in New Testament times, Brian Cohen, who is mistaken for the Messiah and 'The Holy Grail' The complete Python troupe is cast in this parody of the legend of the Holy Grail. The Knights of the Round Table battle dismembering foes and killer rabbits on their perilous quest. <br /> <br />For those of you who don't know of Monty Python, I'll give a short history of the show. Monty Python began in Britain in 1969 I think (please correct me if I'm wrong) as Monty Python's Flying Circus. One of the most outrageous and alternative sketch shows that hadn't been seen since the mad stylings of The Goons. Monty Python's Flying Circus was a bizarre combination of hilarious human sketches and random animations, such as, the now famous, giant foot (In fact I'd go so far as to say that without Monty Python, randomness wouldn't be such an important factor in comedy today). The cast made names for themselves on Monty Python- John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin are amoung the stars. <br /> <br />The Monty Python movies lost nothing from the original capers of the television series. Just as entertaining, interesting and yes- philosophical (philosophy was often the central pivot from which the cast drew ideas from, the sketches are not just laugh out loud funny, they are also often profound).  <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this box-set enough. Many laughs will follow.
B000088E6D|5.0|I went to Buble's concert couple of weeks ago. Man, his voice is amazing. You just haven't heard him if you never hear him live. This CD good as it is, doesn't do him justice at all. It's good there is concert DVD - Caught In The Act, which is as close as you can get for some taste of his live performance.
B0002STNQ2|2.0|Prey. Yep, it's a page-turner and perfectly enjoyable way to put your brain on hold for a few hours and enjoy the ride, Just as long as you don't waste too much money on it. (I got my copy at a thrift store.)<br /><br />The flipside is that it's nonsensical... You'll need not only to suspend your disbelief, but put it on ice and lock it in a safe-deposit box as well! The plausibility factor is more like fantasy than science-fiction.<br /><br />For one thing, the clues for the \\"surprise\\" ending are so blantantly obvious (at the beginning!) that the main character seems like a moron for not noticing that the people around him aren't what they seem to be.<br /><br />Secondly, Crichton (to his credit) tries to give the main character depth in showing  his marital, personal and family problems. Unfortunately, he's less successful than George Lucas was in portraying young love in \\"Attack of the Clones.\\" The protagonist's reactions, dialogue, and emotions are way out-of-sync for what's going on. No regret at the ending? Michael, Michael, Michael!<br /><br />Thirdly, the alternation between technological fill-ins and action / dialogue is a little rough.<br /><br />Prey is more reminescent of Sphere than Crichton's superior works such as The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Still entertaining, but not memorable, thrilling, or deeply satisfying.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|Most stupid movie ever. All a load of garbage and not even entertaining. Hollywood liberals ran with this one to make our Marines look like idiots.

B00005JLSE|5.0|Often when a Broadway musical is adapted to the screen, the original concept and story suffer.  This did not happen to this adaptation.  The true spirit of the musical is intact in this film.  In original production, the musical numbers were staged as a radio program. In the film, they are fantasy sequences staged at a nightclub.   <br /> <br />As the film begins, Velma Kelly is arriving at the nightclub without her partners (sister who she performs with and husband.)  The reason is she just killed both of them!   <br /> <br />Roxie Hart is at the club with her boyfriend Fred Casely.  And she sees Velma take the stage alone performing All That Jazz.  During the course of the song, we see Roxie and Fred's affair fizzle out, ending with Fred leaving and Roxie shooting him.  During this number, Roxie goes from reality to a fantasy world.  In this world, people comment on what is going on through the cabaret numbers. <br /> <br />Next we find the police detective arriving at the scene of the murder.  Roxie slips into her fantasy with Funny Honey.  Amos is covering for Roxie but when he finds out who is dead, he realizes what happens and hands Roxie over to the police. <br /> <br />Roxie arrives in the joint and meets Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton and she explains the rules (When You're Good to Mama.) (Look for the original Broadway Velma Kelly, Chita Rivera, in this scene.) <br /> <br />We get to meet the girls of Murder's Row in The Cell Block Tango.  Each describes what happened to land her on Murder's Row. (He ran into my knife, he ran into my knife ten times!) <br /> <br />Enter into the mix, the great murder attorney Billy Flynn.  Billy is Chicago's premiere defense attorney for women accused of murder.  He has never lost a case but he is not in it for the money ($5,000 per case) but All I Care About is love. <br /> <br />Billy decides to take on Roxie as a client but first, he must make her into a the a sympathetic character.  The best lies are based on truth and they embellish on Roxie's past but when it comes to the night in question well, We Both Reached for the Gun (this is particularly effective.  Roxie and all the reporters are just marionettes with Billy pulling the strings. <br /> <br />With her sudden fame, Roxie ponders what might be when she is acquitted.  Velma realizes that Roxie has taken her thunder and makes a desperate attempt to form an alliance because I Can't Do It Alone.  But Roxie quickly finds out that fame is fleeting when a heiress goes on a rampage and kills her boyfriend and his two playmates. <br /> <br />This is where Roxie shows that she is not a dumb blonde and creates a fake pregnancy.  And once again becomes #1 murderess but her husband realizes that he will always be Mister Cellophane. <br /> <br />As the trial approaches, Billy tells Roxie that trials are all Razzle Dazzle and everything is going fine until Velma is given Roxie's diary which has some damning passages.  This sends Billy into A Tap Dance. <br /> <br />In the end, both Roxie and Velma get off but Roxie still wants the fame and finds out that Chicago is crawling with murderesses and fame comes in pairs Nowadays and teams up with Velma. <br /> <br />This film is great on many levels.  As a screen adaptation of a musical, it is true to the source material.  The songs that were left out were because they did not fit the concept of the movie (See DVD extra Class).  As a commentary on today's judicial circus, it shows that things have not changed over the past fifty years - you have enough money, you can get away with murder.  And as a movie, it is just plain fun. <br /> <br />Rob Marshall has a vast background in musical theatre and it shows that he understands that form.  What he doesn't have is a background in film making but this does not show in this polished film.  He has gathered a high caliber cast and crew that all perform to perfection. <br /> <br />What many feel was the great find was Catherine Zeta Jones.  But once you see her pedigree (she was a dance champion in Wales), this was a breeze for her.  That is not saying her performance was not incredible, it was, but it was the part that she was waiting for and finally got! <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger had the greatest challenge, musical comedy was totally foreign to her but she comes through perfectly.  But a lot of this is due to Marshall.  Having Zeta Jones as the professional entertainer Velma Kelly, allowed Marshall choose a non dancer for the role of Roxie.  And as Roxie, Renee shines.  She captures that fine line between innocence and conniving murderess. <br /> <br />Richard Gere has a musical background but not a strong one.  Therefore, his performance is better than expected.  He actually took tap lessons and performs all his own dancing.  This was probably the most overlooked performance of the year (well except by the Golden Globes.) <br /> <br />DVD EXTRAS:   <br />Deleted Musical Number \\"Class\\" by Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah with optional commentary by Marshall and writer Bill Condon - Watch the number first then rewatch with the commentary.  This will give you maximum  enjoyment of what is one of the great musical numbers that didn't make the film. <br /> <br />Behind the Scenes Special - This was a making of documentary that was made after the movie won its six Oscars.  This is very good featurette that has lots of insights into the making of the film. <br /> <br />Commentary by director Rob Marshall and writer Bill Condon. <br />
B00003CX9S|5.0|Although not a family film, it is none the less one film every Christian should see.<br /><br />John Merrick had to be just about the kindest man that ever lived. A man that would put most so-called Christians to shame.<br /><br />This film will grip you and not let go.

It has everything to do with the people involved, but there's this other ingredient, of something set in motion.

It is a song about loss, personal and emotional, says Mark, \\"wreckage washing up all along the coast.\\"<br /><br />\\"This is Us\\", is selected to become the single of this album. It is infectious and many will relate to this.<br /><br />A lighter touch comes to \\"Red Staggewring, which is a Cajun-like tune where lovers compare themselves to motorcycles, cars and vintage guitars.<br /><br />On \\"Belle Star\\", Emmylou compares herself to an old West infamous female outlaw, \\"Belle Star\\" and Mark as Jesse James. This banter is reminiscent of Johnny and June Cash in their early albums.<br /><br />\\"Donkey Song' as a song written by Mark and meant for an earlier CD. They both enjoyed the freedom and silliness.<br /><br />\\"Love and Happiness:\\" is the only \\"proper\\" song that Emmylou says she has written. \\"You cannot always protect your children and this is my homage to them\\".<br /><br />\\"All the Road Running\\" paints the picture of the musician always on the road singing about love found and lost, missing family and friends, and life in the fast lane.<br /><br />\\"If This Is Goodbye\\" came out of 9/11.

0062502182|1.0|For a long, long, long time I resisted reading this book. Something deep within me told me that this book was full of it. But, then, two seemingly smart friends (whom I now know are absolutely dumb) convinced me to read this book. I don't know why, but, I spent huge money and picked the book up. <br /> <br />I read the first 40 pages and actually threw the book out the window (no jokes!). <br /> <br />I am not sure who paulo coelho is, but, from what I understand from his \\"biography\\" on his website ([...] he's practiced black-magic and is a self-professed mad-man who's been to mental institutions multiple times. <br /> <br />Moreover, I am amazed that paulo has got away by claiming the muslims \\"infidels\\"!! I am trying to figure out how this book was received in the muslim world. <br /> <br />The first 40 pages are full of useless philosophical (rap like \\"your friends never accept you for who you are\\" and \\"never trust anyone\\" and other blah-blah. I actually fell asleep after reading the first 16 pages. (For most of you who don't know me, I am famous for writing bug-free software 16 hours straight from early afternoon to late in the night without a break. This book actually made me fall asleep during the day!!!) <br /> <br />Dudes (and dudeys), stop wasting your time, effort and money reading this load of it. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE spend your time, effort, money wisely by reading books on economics. You will understand the real world much better. You don't need some black-magic practicing mad-man to tell you that you are a loser. If you want to stop being a loser, stop reading this load of it and read economics.
020530902X|5.0|English is my second language.  My English writing teacher highly recommends this book.  It does not take long before I appreciate why it is recommdend.  It is a very concise introduction to English usage and writing styles.  The advice is concrete, usually followed by contrasting examples, and the authors don't hesitate to call them \\"rules.\\"  Following the rules is definitely easier to do for ESL students than being asked to be creative without clear directions.<br /><br />\\"The Elements of Style\\", however, does not offer advice on writing mechanics.  English as a Second Language students looking for books on basic writing skills may find that the book does not meet their expectation.
B000K4WLXA|4.0|Ah, \\"Final Fantasy\\". How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. FF1... FF2... FF3... FF4... FF5... FF6... FF7... FF9... FF10... FF12... (FF8... not so much. FF11... never played)    For gamers like me, RPG freaks born in the 1970's, the \\"Final Fantasy\\" series of games is, in many ways, the pinacle of what video game RPGs should be. Epic, beautiful, clever, touching, etc.    The previous CGI FF film, [[ASIN:B00003CY5D Final Fantasy - The Spirits Within (Special Edition)]], did not live up to the fine tradition of the video games. The plot was, let's face it, bizzare at best (I so hate Gaia theory... it makes no sense! Earth as a living organism my left eye!). The voice-over work was unexceptional. The animation was great, but that was about it.    Now, however, we have \\"Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children\\". And it is good. Not great. Not like [[ASIN:B00065GX64 M - 2 Disc Special Edition (Criterion Collection Spine #30)]], [[ASIN:B0000DJZ8R The Grapes of Wrath]], [[ASIN:B0002DCHQA Sunrise - A Song of Two Humans]] or [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane]], but it is good.    The plot basically centers around a Sephiroth cosplaying freak (translation for non-otaku: femmy-looking bad-guy impersonating another femmy-looking bad-guy), who is trying to revive a Great Power of Evil (tm), in order to... to... you know, I'm still not entirely sure. Destroy the world? Have a mom? Something like that.    Really the plot doesn't matter. This is a movie about incredible sights, amazing sounds, stunning action sequences and a really, really hot main character (O, Cloud! My Cloud!). The CGI is really breath-taking. The characters are as close to photo-realistic as anything I've ever seen.    The fight sequences are just as impressive, if somewhat physics-violating (how is someone who is airborne supposed to boost someone else who is airborne? Still, this isn't as bad as [[ASIN:B000J10ERO Superman Returns (Two Disc Special Edition)]] where Superman lifted something he was standing on at thetime he was lifting it). Basically the fights are very much what you might expect of a CGI anime.    And the music! Oh, goodness, the music! Nobuo Uematsu is an extremely skilled composer and this film really highlights that. \\"Cloud's Theme\\" and \\"One-Winged Angel\\" are the best tracks, but the rest is spectacular, too! Heck, there's one part where any FF fan will laugh as the \\"Victory Music\\" plays! Just buying [[ASIN:B000AO8CH4 Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]] (the soundtack), alone would be worth it.    This movie really is complete fan-service. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you haven't played the game, expect to be very, very lost. Still, long as you're lost you might as well enjoy the brilliant sights and sounds.    The film gets four stars. 2 if you haven't played the game and 5 if you have. Enjoy!
B0007GAERG|5.0|People wrote her off in 2001. She was over 30. She was out of her prime, which had brought her 15 No.1's (at least 1 No.1 hit for each year of the 90s), and a display of a stunning 5 octave range hit effortlessly. People wrote her off that she would never regain form, she was done and might as well retire. Psh. Hold your tongue! <br /> <br />ITS LIKE THAT: A fantastic opening that showcases Mimi trying out some different feels of music. Usually when you think of Mariah Carey you think of 5 octave voice and ballads. In this uptempo song, she's celebrating and just talks about the joy of beeing free. Its a nice song, and the climax is very well done. 10/10. <br /> <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER: Also known as the \\"comeback song\\", but really us Mimi fans call it the \\"16th No.1 song\\". This beautiful ballad spent 14 weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100, and broke almost every airplay record ever. This gorgeous song is (as Mimi puts it) \\"a personal story\\" or hers and shes yearning for her guy to come back. 10/10. <br /> <br />SHAKE IT OFF: We Belong Together and this song are complete polar opposites. In this song, she's shaking a guy off. She's done with him and his games, his cheating, etc. It's midtempo, and peaked at #2 (which also gave Mimi the record of only female artist to hold the #1 and #2 position at the same time for Billboard Hot 100). 10/10. <br /> <br />MINE AGAIN: I don't know, its a bit waily at times. It's beautiful and stunning, and the plot of this song is basically the same as We Belong Together. I just think that Mine Again should have been sung when she was younger and had more air in her lungs back in the 90's-95. But nevertheless, this song is beautiful. 9/10. <br /> <br />SAY SOMETHIN': Features Snoop Dogg!! Alot of her fans didn't really enjoy this song, but I think this song is cool. I mean its not going to be remembered as a signature, but definitely for showing another fun side of Mimi. In this song she's like flirty with her boyfriend, and its great to hear her enjoying the moment. 9/10. <br /> <br />STAY THE NIGHT: Wow this song is great! It's absoulety fabulous and its displays Mimi's high and low notes, powerful and whisepry vocals. Just fantastic! In this song she's asking a guy to stay the night at her house, and wow this song mixes sexy+awesome really well! 10/10. <br /> <br />GET YOUR NUMBER: This song doesn't have that great of a constructiong as compared to its previous 6 tracks on the album, but alone its done very well. Featuring the amazing producer Jermaine Dupri, they sing back and forth about getting each other's number to meet again sometime after they spot each other at a night club. 8/10. <br /> <br />ONE AND ONLY: Featuring Twista, this song is very beautiful. She's saying that this guy is her \\"one and only\\", sorta like We Belong Together and Mine Again. Very nice, and the 2nd part [featured on the Ultra Platinum Edition] just gets better! 10/10. <br /> <br />CIRCLES: This is a good song. It's classic Mariah. The music as a backround, the voice as the standout. It hits every note perfeclty, and there's not a hint of her voice diminishing at all. It's very well done, and should have been released as a single. 10/10. <br /> <br />YOUR GIRL: She wants be your girl. Well she is fabulous in this song. It's a very nice song, but she does overdo it a bit in very small parts, but otherwise thumbs up! 9.5/10. <br /> <br />I WISH YOU KNEW: She's very creative by singing this as if she were singing it in front of a crowd. It's great, she wishes you knew how much she wants you, and i wish she knew how much I love this song! 10/10. <br /> <br />TO THE FLOOR: Another upbeat song featuring Nelly. It's very hot actually. She's talking about how she wants to get to the floor with this guy in a dance club. It's a very nice song, showing that Mariah isn't just capable of slow ballads. 9.5/10. <br /> <br />JOY RIDE: There have been people calling this \\"boring\\", but I find this song very relax. It's so smooth, itstalking about her 'joy ride' (or good times) during her life and its just a nice song. No overdoing or underdoing in this song. 10/10.. <br /> <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD: In all of the albums I've heard, none have ever had a better closing than this one. Set as a gospel, Mariah truly demands her independence through this song. She wants the Lord to free her of grief and sadness and lift her spirits up. The vocals are so powerful and perfect it was given an oustanding ovation at the 2006 Grammy's. This song is more than perfect! 11/10. <br /> <br />TOTAL: 136/140. That's amazing, a 97% which solidifies a 5 star album! If you ever plan on getting an album by Mariah Carey or any album, \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" should be in your top 5 list!

There is nothing to walk on. There is nowhere to go.<br /><br />For the only things that are real are Harold and the purple crayon. Otherwise, the universe in which he finds himself is apparently empty; nothing else is present. But what does nothing look like? It looks like nothing - a blank sheet of paper. But that kind of nothing is just exactly what is needed when what one is holding in one's hand is a purple crayon. And so the adventure gets underway.<br /><br />The first thing Harold does on setting out is draw a horizontal line.<br /><br />This may seem unimportant, but it is not.<br /><br />For what he has drawn is the horizon, and this means that now he is standing on the ground. He can walk on it too...<br /><br />Next he draws the moon (necessary if the walk is indeed to be in the moonlight). Harold draws it above the horizon - this means that it is in the sky. Now there is a reference point for height, and a world of three dimensions has come into being.<br /><br />Off he goes, drawing a path, a forest (with only one tree so he won't get lost in it) and a dragon to guard the apples that are growing in the tree. Here the creator encounters unintended consequences, as the dragon that he has wrought is so fearsome as to frighten even him. Harold backs away, his hand shaking, inadvertently drawing a wavy line as he goes.<br /><br />The wavy line traces out waves, and before he knows it, Harold is underwater in an ocean. He rescues himself by drawing a boat and makes his way to an unknown distant shore.<br /><br />The rest of the story is about Harold's trying to find his way back home. On the way there are more adventures as Harold searches far and wide.

B00005JMJG|5.0|This film has both Jim Carrey and Kate Winsett playing roles that you are probably unaccustomed to seeing them in. Jim Carrey plays  plain-vanilla introvert Joel and Winsett plays  extroverted salesgirl Clementine who likes to express herself by dying her hair an odd combination of colors and dressing up potatoes like Barbie Dolls. At the time he meets Clementine, Joel is living with someone named Naomi that he mentions several times during the film in only positive terms as \\"very nice\\". Joel must be searching for something other than \\"very nice\\" since this doesn't prevent him from throwing over this woman that the audience never sees for the unpredictable unknown quantity, Clementine. However, eventually the relationship ends so badly for this mismatched couple that Clementine has all memory of their relationship erased from her mind by a company that has the technology to provide such a service. When Joel discovers what she has done he is so hurt that he wants the same thing done to him so that he can erase the pain. The process takes an entire night, and during this process Joel relives all of the moments he and Clementine had together and realizes that Clementine brought enough happiness into his life that he doesn't want her erased from his mind after all. However, he is now unconscious and unable to communicate his wishes to those handling the procedure. Thus, he tells Clementine - inside his mind - what is going on and they attempt to hide from the \\"mind erasers\\" in places in his memories where he would have never taken her. Specifically, he takes her to particularly humiliating points in his childhood and adolescence. It seems telling that the pair have been together for two years yet Joel has apparently never told Clementine about any of these memories, apparently having shut her out of selective portions of his life. However, these evasion tactics are no match for the mind-erasing team of Lacuna Inc., and ultimately Clementine is cleansed from Joel's mind. Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them. The next day he awakes, is drawn to this prearranged meeting place for reasons he doesn't understand, and she is there. Neither one of them knows who the other is, but the relationship is beginning to start all over again when a disgruntled Lacuna employee gives them their files, which include tapes of what both Joel and Clementine thought of one another at the the time each requested to have the other erased. They listen to each others tapes and are both shocked and embarrassed. These are not flattering revelations, to say the least. In spite of the fact that they know their relationship will likely end up right where it did before, they decide to give it another try, because the alternative is to lose one another and the possibility of love and companionship.<br />The plot may be hard to follow as it bends back and forth through time, but it is worth it, and Jim Carrey gives the best performance he has given since \\"The Truman Show\\". The movie has a lot to say about how we are the product of our memories and our choices - both the bad and the good. It also illustrates how absolute power corrupts through the unconsciable actions of some of the employees of Lacuna Inc. who start out helping people and end up helping themselves. You'll find yourself catching something you missed before each time you watch it. I highly recommend this film.Just before the last memory of her is erased, she tells Joel to meet her in a particular spot that was special to both of them.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I walked into the multiplex to see the much appraised Brokeback Mountain.  I vaguely remember seeing the trailer a few weeks back, and even then didn't take much of an interest (guess the trailer didn't do it much justice).  I was trying to make myself comfortable, peering over my shoulder to have a look at the 'audience', which were pretty normal people - what the heck was I expecting!      The opening scene is among the most humbly beautiful things I've seen in movies and really sets the scene for the time and place, which is Wyoming 1963.  The tension and attraction between the characters Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist is developed so realistically; I was drawn into their world from the start - the line between reality and movie magic just faded to hell because the acting here is nothing I've ever seen before and that's saying something for a 21 year old jaded to the movie screen.  These are strong men, as straight as they can get: roughly spoken cowboys straight out of an old western - the epitome of masculinity itself.         Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist take up a job together one summer herding sheep up on Brokeback Mountain. It isn't long before they become great friends and soon an unexpected love developes between the two men, even though one of them, Ennis, claims \\"I'm not queer\\", and the look on Jack's face before he reluctantly and resignedly agrees.  At this point so early in the film, I couldn't understand why I was experiencing a physical, palpable pain in my heart.      Inevitably, both of them leave Brokeback Mountain and go their separate ways, gets married (which deteriorates), have kids.  However, both are unable to forget one another, and their reunion scene (after 4 yrs) is so powerful I still have to compose myself even now just thinking about it.  That scene, and among others, such as the post-divorce reunion, where Jack mistakes Ennis's divorce as a chance for them to finally be together, driving miles just to see him.  I won't explain the rest, as no doubt most of you have seen the movie and know, so I digress...      The story of Brokeback Mountain unfolds before you with great subtlety; never going down that cliched road of being over-the-top, outrageous or try to push a view onto anyone, and for that, I admire.  The almost electrifying tension between the characters is so palpable you would not believe and just proves that not all movies succeed by being loud and blunt.  It is  gentle and satisfying, yet deeply tragic.  Who knew that one look could say so much?  Not everything is for scenic purposes either: the film contains  lots of symbolism, most you might not notice until second viewing.      Nothing prepares you for this achingly beautiful, honest and  profound movie that surpasses being a \\"movie\\", and to be frank, becomes a life force that will embed itself forever into your memory.  I may not have known what I was getting myself into when I sat down to a screening of it, but I'm sure as hell glad that I did.  Movies this good don't come along often.       For those who berate the movie because either they reckon it promotes infidelity or because they, like the media, typecast it as being the 'gay cowboy movie': put aside your biases for a damned second.  Brokeback is first and foremost a story about love, about things that we humans never get around to doing and the regrets that ensue furthur down the line when yes, we realize (in the very words of Jack Twist) that \\"there ain't  never enough time, never enough.\\"
B000BNX3B4|4.0|This is a cute movie.  A good feel-good picture.  First of all, you have to suspend reasoning, because in real life people who look like John Cusack and Diane Lane would never have trouble finding dates.  All they would have to do is snap their fingers at cocktail parties.   That being said, you will enjoy this for its pure entertainment value.  The acting, by the way is very good.  The two main characters, and throw in Stockard Channing and the great Christopher Plummer, you have people who know what they are doing on the acting set.    <br /> <br />I would love to see John Cusack in tougher roles, in more ambitious movies.  He is that good I think.  How about a role in a great biography about a great priest, poet, painter or musician. Just a thought.   Cusack has such a screen presence.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Eight years ago I bought, played and fell in love with Final Fantasy 7 along with the rest of the world.  The ending to the game left many questions to be answered and a need for a sequel to be made.  Rumors flew that a sequel was going to be made, as well as the falsities of brining back Aeris in the game and the rumors all proved false only leaving the want for more unfullfilled.  Then it was announced that a Final Fantasy movie was to be made and hopes grew strong that it would be the much anticipated sequel to Final Fantasy 7.  Although Spirits Within was a great movie with excellent graphics it left many with dissapointment that it had nothing to do with any game what so ever.  Then finally it was announce that the sequel to Final Fantasy 7 would be released, though not as a game but a movie.  Now, 2006 it has finally arrived and was most definitely worth the wait.  A great movie with the best animated graphics I've seen.  This movie gave the closure that I, and possibly others, have been looking for for many years due to the game.
B00004YLBD|4.0|I have no doubt that the first time most westerners watch this they will feel confused afterwards. I'm pretty sure that the first time they see it they will think the animation was excellent, at least for its time. Maybe some will know they have just seen something special. Akira is probably the most famous Japanese animated movie, manga or anime, and is surely the most influential. It may not be an exaggeration to say it is one of the most influential movies of any kind ever, as many films, animated and not, have taken elements directly from it.<br /><br />I won't try to summarise the plot, i'm not sure if i can make it sound comprehensible, but it involves biker gangs, friendship, overpowering technology, and the apocalypse. The plot is confusing at times, especially for western audiences who had simply not experienced anything quite like this before, and the frantic pace and quick direction only make everything seem more chaotic (as if that wasn't the point to some degree), but the more times you watch it, the more you will see this is not a flaw. The animation is some of the best ever seen, the vision of Neo-Tokyo is stunning, and the last half hour is mind-blowing. Some parts are quite touching too, without becoming overly sappy, as we watch Tesuo's struggle, and the multitude of themes are well worth thinking about...<br /><br />This 2 disc edition offers two versions of the film, one with better sound, updated translation etc, though other features are sparse especaially when considering what a huge film this was.ommend two albums.  THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES (I've never been able to determine if the title was taken from Ernst Dowson's poem \\"Vitae Summa Brevis\\"-\\"They are not long, the days of wine and roses/Out of a misty dream/Our path emerges for a while, then closes/Within a dream.\\"-or the Jack Lemmon movie whose title was taken from the Dowson poem) and the retrospective TELL ME WHEN IT'S OVER:  THE BEST OF THE DREAM SYNDICATE.  Though the band produced a lot of good music, almost all of it is contained on these two CDs.  I'm actually not a big fan of the extended version of THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES.  The CD includes the eponymous EP that came out shortly before the LP and I find few of the EP cuts to be anywhere near as interesting as the LP versions.  I'm not much of a fan of extended versions of albums; I rarely find that the extra cuts are especially good additions to an album.  There are exceptions.  Elvis Costello's extended versions of albums often contain fascinating alternative cuts of songs (e.g., the acoustic version of \\"Green Shirt\\") and the Gram Parson versions of the songs that were (for legal reasons) sung instead by Roger McGuinn on the Byrds's SWEETHEART OF THE RODEO are vastly superior.  But these are the exceptions.  To be honest, I would rather that THE DAYS OF WINE AND ROSES featured only the original cuts and I'll be honest and say that on my iPod I've deleted the additions and kept only the original nine cuts. <br /> <br />However one listens to this album, either at home with all the cuts or on iPod with extra cuts eliminated (my recommendation), this is one of the crucial albums in the development of alternative rock.  The songs remain very strong a quarter of a century later (eeek! I suddenly feel old!).  \\"Tell Me When Its Over,\\" \\"When You Smile,\\" \\"That's What You Always Say,\\" \\"Then She Remembers,\\" \\"Halloween,\\" and the title track are as haunting now as when the album first came out.  Truly one of rock's great albums.
B00005Y6YB|1.0|I should qualify my comments by saying I watched maybe an hour before I gave up and turned it off.  So to anyone who wants to take my opinion with a grain of salt, that's fair. <br /> <br />\\"Lonesome Dove\\" is gritty and dirty, and I'm not just talking about the Texas dust.  It is definitely not for \\"family viewing.\\"  Here, even the \\"heroes,\\" portrayed in a sympathetic, likable way, display some very questionable behavior:  Stealing cattle, shooting people (accidentally) and laughing about it, taking turns with the town prostitute.  I'm not saying this wasn't reality in the old west, but it wasn't THE only reality. <br /> <br />Call me old-fashioned, but I love a story where the protagonists aren't necessarily perfect, but are still admirable, even from the beginning.  They may make mistakes, but they learn from them.  They have honor, and respect for life and women.  (There was none of that here.)  This film seemed to wallow in all that was cheap and tawdry ... AND enjoy going there.  I'm not looking for a Disney-fied picture of the West, but at least part one of \\"Dove\\" showed little heart or soul. <br /> <br />I wasn't overly impressed with the quality of the film either.  The acting wasn't awful, but it was formulaic.  The script was just one line of bland dialogue after another.  There was very little humor, and what humor there is (two cute and nosy pigs, a cook that stubbornly rings an annoying bell at suppertime despite orders not to) is recycled over and over.  The pace was very slow, which is fine, but after one hour, very little had developed with the plot or the characters in a substantial way. <br /> <br />\\"Lonesome Dove\\" can't hold a candle to \\"The Big Country\\" or \\"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\\" and other classic westerns.  There is something endearing about performers like John Wayne and Jimmy Stewart that Duvall and Jones don't have.  \\"Lonseome Dove\\" may have some redeeming qualities, but I don't have the patience to wait 9 hours to see them. Sorry.

B000006TRV|5.0|I cant think of a better album than The wall other than the Dark side of the moon.Each and every song here is brilliant especially songs like ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL,RUN LIKE HELL and COMFORTABLY NUMB.Very very highly recommended.Rock demonstrates his \\"self-educated\\" approach and lack of rigorous thought in the way he repeatedly makes assertions that go far beyond the conclusions drawn by the original authors of the original scientific research.  <br /> <br />For example on page 24 he mentions how dendrites (minuscule pieces of brain tissue) on a glass slide in a laboratory will grow a small amount after being stimulated in the laboratory. He then suggests that the reader try to open a car door with their non-dominant hand for a week (a simple motor-skill - door opening) to see how easy it is to make motor-skill changes, and then states that it is easy to change complex leadership behaviours with his six-step method which is based (he claims) on neuroscience. <br /> <br />The form of his argument is ... 1, dendrites can be enlarged on slides in laboratories and ... 2, you can learn to open doors with the other hand, and (because of this) ... 3,  it is easy to purposefully grow new neural connections and create new habits. Thus, he (erroneously) concludes (and repeatedly asserts) that leadership styles and organizational cultures (highly complex and highly contextualised and systemic behaviors) are easy to change using his particular six-step coaching method, and that therefore neuroscience provides a solid theoretical framework for the \\"Quiet Leadership\\" model. <br /> <br />Of course this is a seriously flawed and confused argument, and one which would be rejected in any first year undergraduate philosophy essay. This is because one premise does not lead to the next, and the conclusion is simply not supported by the premises. This kind of over-simplistic and erroneous reasoning, and inappropriate use of research is repeated throughout the book and this, as other reviewers have noted, makes the book confusing to read, frequently presenting common-sense ideas in an overcomplicated \\"scientific\\" fashion: pseudoscience. <br />  <br />The astute reader will also be quietly amused by the stark contrast between the espoused values of the supposed \\"quiet leader\\" (humble and self-effacing) and the author's own Alpha-male chest-thumping writing style - good salesmanship - but poor \\"Quiet Leadership\\" modelling. On one page alone I counted 12 \\"I did ...  I said ...  I've consulted to such-and-such a high-profile corporation\\" type statements, and in some places the book seems to be far more about the author himself than the topic of leadership or leading others! <br /> <br />More worrying is the fact that nowhere in the book, despite many extravagant claims, did I find any real experimental or solid research support for the notion that \\"Quiet Leadership\\" was in fact superior to other models of leadership or even effective. Given that this book is promoting a new leadership model, to be taken seriously the reader would reasonably expect to have seen in-depth comparisons between \\"Quiet Leadership\\", and more established models of leadership, for example, Bass and Avilio's Transformational Leadership Model, which is one of the well-known and most researched models of leadership in the serious leadership literature. <br /> <br />I'm not sure if I'm cynical or if others are being gullible, or if they are simply uninformed about both leadership and neuroscience  - but none of this book seems to be \\"groundbreaking code-breaking\\" \\"thought-leadership\\" or the \\"road to self-actualisation\\", just another example of using management mumbo-jumbo with a \\"scientific\\" label to legitimize and sell \\"magic bullet\\" leadership development products.  <br /> <br />Neuroscience may well (eventually) in time move beyond functional analysis of neurological brain processes and offer meaningful insights into real-world leadership behaviors and organisational change, but this book does not, as claimed, give a solid brain-based explanation of leadership nor a solid theoretical basis for leadership coaching.  <br /> <br />Buyer beware the \\"BS\\"!!! <br /> <br />A management reader  <br />
B00004Z459|1.0|The answer is NO!!!!  These guys dont' know jack-s**t about music!!!  I am not a tough reviewer, but this has to stop.  They are a watered down(way watered down), less talented, whiny imitation Korn.  This music is targeted solely for 11, 12, or 13 year olds whose parents won't let them get music with parental advisory stickers on them.  Heck, most of the people who listen to Linkin Park aren't even old enough to feel teen angst, because I go to high school, and no one there listens to them or they would be made fun of.  Kids, dont buy this [...]!!! Its not cool, better listen to nothing than listen to them.e each other, but it does add to the raucously unexpected sound of the album. <br /> <br />If anybody is completely sick of prepackaged, flavourless pop music, then they should check out Balkan Beat Box. Colourful, energetic and thoroughly entertaining.

0345363132|5.0|Sharon Kay Penman creates a real, living, breathing man behind the formindable image of Richard III, the man who suposedly killed the Princes in the Tower. <br />The story follows the life of Richard from his troubled childhood during the Wars of the Roses, where fears about his family, especially his beloved oldest brother, the sunne in splendour, Edward IV, dominate his life. The novel chronicles the stunning rise of the Yorkist king Edward IV to power, and the painful break with his Neville cousins, especially Richard Neville, the Earl of Warwick, also called the Kingmaker. <br />The bitter cost of power the Yorkists experience makes one wonder why people so desire the crown at all. As the Kingmaker seeks to control his young cousin Edward, he learns of Edwards marriage to the cool beauty Elizabeth Woodville, a Lancastrian widow, which spells the end of Warwicks power, and the temporary return of the Lancastrians to power. The painful war that brings Edward back to power comes at the death of the earl and his brother, Johnny Neville, who's betrayal of Edward in battle costs him his life. <br />With the return of the Yorkists to power, young Richard is handsomely rewarded for his loyalty and devotion to his brother with vast estates and titles, along with power in the north where he settles with Warwicks daughter, Anne Neville, his childhood sweetheart. The death of Edward IV at the young age of 40 plunges the kingdom-and Richard-into turmoil as the 12 year old Edward V comes to the throne. Should Richard take the throne for himself, or allow the Woodville-raised Edward V take the crown, threatening to plunge the country into civil war? The cost Richard pays for taking the crown destroyes his life, leading to a windswept plain at Bosworth Field and his early death. <br />I reeally loved this novel, but the pain of betrayal and family tension made the novel almost painful to read at times. The truth of how the young Edward V and his brother died will never be knownfor certain, but Penman's theory comes as close as any to answering the mystery of their fate.

I left Japan and had trouble coming to terms with my father in law's death.   A doctor who looks after terminally ill patients suggested I read this book and I'm glad I did. It reiterates all I'd forgotton about life - the eternal now is all we've got. It also echoes something the Shinto Monk said to me on that little Japanese island, \\"We must lose our egos to become enlightened\\".    PS.

0780622650|5.0|This film is actually deserving of 4 stars, but I gave it 5 just to couterbalance some of the unfairness here.  First, I am a long-time LIS fan, who grew up with the original show.  Most of the worst bashings I've seen about this movie is from original fans.  Their rejection of this film is responsible for the decline in value of old LIS merchandise, interest in making sequels, etc. In effect, they have sabotaged any chance of their beloved show making further comebacks (yes, as the first Batman film shows, multiple viewings by fans is where the money is at). If you read the fan's reviews about the old show, you'll find that many of them lament the fact that the show took a turn in the \\"camp\\" direction, as if it had remained as serious as it had started out, that it would have been another Star Trek.  Bull!  If the original series had continued in that direction, it would have ended up like any other old 60s obsolete show.  It was the campiness and the misguided IA vision that accidentally enabled it to seem as modern as it does now, years after even Original Trek starts seeming dated.  Back to this movie:  It DOES go in the direction that so many fans wish the original series did.  Filled with techno-babble to make the situations seem plausible, it plays as straight-faced as the first few episodes of the original series.  It starts with basically the same beginning as the first episode \\"the reluctant stowaway\\", has something approximating the menace of \\"the derelict\\", has 2 versions of the robot to give a feel of \\"war of the robots\\", lifts the crash-landing sequence from \\"island in the sky\\", the Bloop (or here, the Blarp) from same, the alternate universe device from \\"the anti-matter man\\", the dive-into-the-sun threat from \\"wild adventure\\", and the suspenseful escape from \\"blast-off into space\\", not to mention the menace of an altered Dr. Smith from a couple of different episodes.  Yes, the director knew little of LIS and filled it with triteness (the typical hollywood idea of a \\"dysfunctional\\" family, the rap-style theme, etc.), but this couldn't overcome the brilliant script by Akiva Goldman showing that she had done her homework.  Yes, Judy Robinson here doesn't seem to have much to do, as another reviewer pointed out, but she had even less to do in the original series.  Another reviewer said that they couldn't help but see \\"Friends\\" in the casting of Don West.  I've never watched that show, but I found Le Blanc in the role as an absolutely brilliant bit of casting after having been accustomed for years to a similiarly styled actor (Goddard)in that role in the original show.  And who dares posit that anybody else but Oldman could have convincingly followed in Jonathan Harris' footsteps?  Also, WHERE did they find that kid that played Will??    LIS was such a personal show for so many, my theory being that situated at the beginning of the TV generation it actually became a substitute for the real family, that I wonder if an original fan can make a truly objective assessment of any kind of remake.  Despite the fact that there was so little press coverage for this show at that time, I think most people my age (45) subconciously see Don West whenever we hear the term \\"cocky pilot\\", had a crush on Penny Robinson, and instantly recognize \\"Danger, Will Robinson\\", or \\"never fear, Smith is here\\".  I'm reminded of what a friend told me when I complained about the silliness of the recent \\"Godzilla\\" remake:  When we were watching these basically cult-movies as kids, we never dreamed anyone would ever even think about making a multi-million dollar mainstream remake of them.  Back then, mainstream meant John Wayne or Richard Burton, never sci-fi which was strictly under the \\"B\\" movie category, always.    Yes, kids today have no idea how society in general would have dismissively viewed their fascination with \\"X-Men\\", \\"Super-Atragon\\", etc. back then.  It took us to get old enough to actually influence things to that point of view. Remember how our parents loved Glenn Miller, Boots Randolph and such?  Well, this is our time. We watched the original show with as much fascination in our 6-year old minds as modern audiences watched the new one, perhaps more. Our memories will die with us unless we care enough about them to encourage their evolution to another generation. My aforementioned friend has been gone a few years now, but I'll always remember the pleasant surprise which he felt upon finding that someone had put the time, money and effort to enshrine one of our most treasured childhood memories into such an extravagant opus.  This film was a sincere attempt by many highly talented people to pay fitting homage to the old show. I feel this is because LIS meant as much to them as it does to us.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, not that I expect much, juss wanna have some action good times ya know?? But it juss turned out to be absolutely HORRIBLE! <br />First of all, I swear, if you go just watch the video game, it wouldn't be any different. The plot has no heartfelt storyline, no good acting, no convincing special effects for goodness sake, as much as I love Hugh Jackman, I rather see him in X-man than this just unbelievable bad movie. <br />the action weren't great either, like I said the special effects were BAD, and the people action looked like those old people from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Bunch of chases, and other than that bunch of cheezy and at times grossed out (and not even the gore kind most people like, this time think Gremlines)cartoony flicks.  <br />And not even a happy ending to cheer me up at the end. <br />that said, Underworld is a much better movie, at least that one felt more realistic and the characters are cooler.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I remember back when I was eight years old in Elementary school when I played Final Fantasy VII with my brother continuously, yet never could get quite attach to the ending which I felt ended rather abrupt for the characters.  Ironically seven years later creator Tetsuya Nomura and the Square Enix team create a beautiful CGI animated film sequel. This thrilled me because I've always wanted an appropriate conclusion to the story of these wonderful characters. The story follows Cloud Strife and his team in an epic struggle to keep the world cleansed of his arch-nemesis, the evil SOLDIER Sephiroth as he comes to terms with the deaths of his friend Zack and love, Aeris. The film has fantastic detail and texture of the people and the city, Midgar's new town called \\"Edge\\" where the characters and the people take refuge.  This includes Cloud's long time friends and fellow allies: Barrett Wallace, Cid Highwind, Tifa lockheart, Vincent Valentine, Cait Sith, and Red XIII who are all back in full prime.  The main villain of the story is still Sephiroth, instead taking the forms of young remnants Kadaj, Loz, Yahzoo and a fatal disease known as, \\"Geostigma\\" that affects a person's nervous system.  Cloud is infected with the disease along with the children, Denzel and Marlena giving him a reason to investigate the abnormality left by the demise of his adversary. Cloud has been haunted for two years since he defeated Sephiroth and his birth source Jenova, a memory that has driven him away from the people he loves. Memories of Aeris dying from Sephiroth and Jenova and the death of Zack have rendered Cloud in a state of failure in finding a cure for the disease that threatens to kill the children and himself.  His confrontation with Kadaj, seeking Jenova's head in order to revive the last trace of Sephiroth, thrusts Cloud back into his original mission. With Cloud's determination to be forgiven and to take up the sword once more with his friends, Cloud is determined to save the planet and the children he cares for from potential genocide. The Complete Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is the definite film and a wonderful conclusion to the FFVII story. A spectacular piece of animation and visual effects combined with the enhanced score composed by the game's original composer. A film that uses its beautiful effects to bring powerful emotion to the viewer.  The footage of the final battle, climax, and end credits have been restored with awesome additions that bring the story to an excellent finish that the characters in FFVII deserved for seven years of good memories.
B0001I55OC|3.0|Timeline by Michael Crighton is an enjoyable book.  Timeline, directed by Richard Donner could have been so much more.  First, I don't think the screenplay was so bad, but in my opinion what killed this movie were the performances by some key actors, particularly the talentless Paul Walker, followed closely by Frances O'Connor.  Gerard Butler was fine in his role as was Anna Friel and Billy Connelly but the other two leads were awful.  Their subpar performances really killed any chance the movie had at capturing an audience.  The action is well done and the music adds a whole new dimension to the film.  For a sci-fi film Timeline doesn't rely on too many computer affects which is nice to see.  However, perhaps if Donner had been more interested or if casting had been otherwise, Timeline would have found an audience.  Marton Csokas & Michael Sheen make an interesting dastardly duo.  With compatent actors in the two main lead roles, this movie would have done so much more.

B00005JOEA|5.0|First of all, almost everyone who has written a review on this movie has taken a very one sided approach to it. Either you loved the movie or you hated it with every fiber of your being. All of you missed the main theme in the movie in my opinion. To do what needs to be done no matter the cost. It doesnt matter if the political roles were revered and V was a conservative trying to oust a liberal government the theme would have been the same. You who say that this is an attack on Bush are retarded. Go out. Buy the comic. Read it if you can. Understand that this story is powerful. It shows that no matter how degraded our government system might become, liberal or conservative, that there will be someone there to fight for change. This is the voice of Fate signing off.......
1566565510|3.0|In seiner Kindheit hatte der nunmehr knapp zwanzigj&auml;hrige Evan mehrere Blackouts, zumeist in Situationen, die sehr dramatisch waren, etwa jener, als er siebenj&auml;hrig mit ein paar Kumpels eine Dynamitstange in einem Briefkasten verstaute. Der &auml;ltere Evan stellt irgendwann fest, mit Hilfe seiner Tageb&uuml;cher in die Vergangenheit reisen zu k&ouml;nnen, und deshalb versucht er, die vermeintlich ausschlaggebenden Situationen seines Vorlebens zu ver&auml;ndern, nicht zuletzt, um die geliebte Kayleigh am Selbstmord zu hindern. Seine Eingriffe in die Vergangenheit haben allerdings weitreichende, zuweilen sehr dramatische Folgen, und im Gegensatz zum titelgebenden Schmetterling ist es nicht nur ein Fl&uuml;gelschlag, den Evan mehr oder weniger tut, um Chaos auszul&ouml;sen. Jedenfalls wir alles immer noch schlimmer, und so mu&szlig; Evan immer weiter zur&uuml;ckreisen, um die Konsequenzen seines Handelns - des urspr&uuml;nglichen und des sp&auml;teren - auszub&uuml;geln.<br /><br />Der Film ist spannend, sogar packend, wenn man ausblendet, da&szlig; die Ursache f&uuml;r Evans F&auml;higkeiten oder ihr Hintergrund nie auch nur ansatzweise erl&auml;utert wird; es hat etwas mit dem Vater zu tun, das mu&szlig; dem Zuschauer gen&uuml;gen. Dies ist &uuml;brigens nicht der einzige logische Holperer - die Schlu&szlig;sequenz fu&szlig;t systematisch auf einer v&ouml;llig anderen Vorgehensweise, und das Ende selbst hinterl&auml;&szlig;t auch die eine oder andere Frage. Thematisch folgt der Film insgesamt einem eher simplen Strickmuster, aber das, wie gesagt, auf durchaus nervenzerr&uuml;ttende Art. Ashton Kutcher ist nicht schlecht in seiner Rolle, wie der Film auch ansonsten gut be- und solide umgesetzt wurde. Bei solchen Streifen mu&szlig; man die Kognition immer ein bi&szlig;chen runterfahren, sonst machen sie keinen Spa&szlig;. Und den macht \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" insgesamt durchaus.
B000E33VWW|5.0|One of the best movies of 2005.  The insightful look at the character of the writer and the man, Capote.  One realizes that the celebrated Capote, who changed the course of modern literature, could also be as cold, cruel and manipulative as the killer, Perry, that he interviews for his book, \\"In Cold Blood.\\"<br /><br />The two men have other parallels, as well: childhood histories abuse, neglect, and abandonment; extroidinary creativity; intelligence; and a sensitive side to be used when needed.  They develop a relationship which pits Capote's self interest (finishing the  book) with some level of frienship for Perry (Perry must die for the book to be finished and Capote can pay for lawyers and appeals or not).<br /><br />This is a multi-layered work of art.  It is honest and \\"pulls no punches.\\"  You witness the moral quandries of the killer, Perry, and the man who wrote about him.<br /><br />an insightful demonstration of how children become violent.<br /><br />Dr. Kathy seifert, author of<br />[[ASIN:1933631481 How Children Become Violent: Keeping Your Kids Out of Gangs, Terrorist Organizations, and Cults]]
B000E0WJIC|5.0|Pick up \\"The Poison,\\" instead. Take a few of your favorite bands, As I lay Dying, Avenged Sevenfold, Thrice, etc.; mix up the best part about each one; you have Bullet for my Valentine. <br /> <br />I would place these guys in the same veign as the above mentioned names. Outwardly the instumentation has the same chord structuring as most of the new screamo/metal hybrid bands have, but you get a slight feel of perhaps a motley crue influence in there somewhere. The screaming isn't overly done and the lead singers voice, while not awe inspiring, isn't overly whiny or strained. <br /> <br />I gave this album 5 stars mainly on the grounds that I find myself not wanting to skip a track while I sing along in my car. That's what really matters.

B000A88EVE|4.0|Who'd have ever thought that Art, Sci-Fi and Bowie could be so delicatly wrapped into a single disc for you to enjoy?<br /><br />As an art film, this would not be easily understood by those not common viewers of those types of films.  In a visual sense without spoonfeeding the viewer it's intentions.  Criterion did the smart thing and included the book for those who like details.  In fact, if you're a reader or detail oriented, I would highly suggest reading first.<br /><br />Bowie, anyone who's a David Bowie fan either music or acting must see this film.  He plays a refreshing \\"Mr. Newton\\" who's amazingly very human.  Some may argue that it is his most Human role!  Regardless, it was a pleasing performance!<br /><br />Sci-Fi, in reverse?  As the other reviewers pointed out the film is not so much about an alien but about alienation and the downward spiral of \\"Mr. Newton\\".  It's almost possible to forget that he fell from the sky in the begining of the film.  Sadly, you can identify with his isolated scene at the end of the film where he took on music (no pun intended I'm positive) as a new career and was drinking alone in the afternoon.<br /><br />From desperate alien, to sucessful and powerful CEO, to a lost pawn, captive experiement, and finally the most sad of all... to isolated human in a commercial society.<br /><br />Breathtaking, heartbreaking, visually stunning.a fine addition to the story. Great to re-meet some of the faces that have gone before including California Fidelity workers Mac Voorhies and Kinsey's one time nemesis Gordon Titus. <br /> <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is the only grudge I hold against FOX, totally making a mess of publicity and air dates that practically guaranteed the loss of this program. <br /> <br />The writing is the most original. The characters are real, and what's more, honest about who they are and what they value. Forget political correctness or stereotyping - every show is a refreshing twist on TV episodic and character formulas, and I for one thank Josh and all of the actors and crews for giving their best on this series. <br /> <br />I borrowed the disc set from a friend, saw it all, then had to buy it for myself, just to see it again and again. It doesn't matter if youre sci-fi, western, drama or comedy inclined - you get it all here. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B000C3H4M2|5.0|The Talking Heads were one of the more revolutionary groups of the late 70's and early 80's. They created a music that is beyond description. David Byrne's anxiety ridden vocals are set against polyrhythmic world-music like beats - Brian Eno's influence is felt in the production adding his signature atmospheric wall of sounds - it all somehow combines into an amazing statement of the times.. Songs like 'cities' and 'life during wartime' comment on the state of our modern world - in a way that is still relevant and poignant today in 2006.. It is very difficult to describe or classify this music - all you can say is it works..and it has a lasting relevance.
B000BCKFWK|4.0|Frank Miller's comics don't do much for me, and I generally avoid them. So, Sin City had nothing to actually compare to. It was what it was, as it was. And what there was, was damn cool. I liked the style and the stories. Stark, grim, gritty, desolate. Not the kind of thing I'd watch before going to bed, but reaching down into the viscera and doing some twisting and making you wonder what dark urges and impulses lurk inside yourself. Asking some troubling questions maybe. Very violent, but<br /><br />I'm all for that kind of stuff, and while for others the `comic' connection may be what turns them on, for me it's the revelatory character of it all. That should be sufficient to make it worthwhile for those who, like me, can handle material like the Fables series and Y, but shy back from other graphic stories, like Frank Miller's.<br /><br />My favorite of the stories is `That Yellow Bastard'. To me it's the most poignant and visceral. I'm sure other people have other favorites, but that's cool.  This is one of those flicks that can be a lot of things to a lot of people.

This school year, my students (cumulatively) completed more than 5000 of these puzzles, some more than 500 individually. <br /> <br />Polgar doesn't have a lot of text here to read, just tons of puzzles, most of which are game-likely situations. One of the hardest things to teach students is often board vision and cooperation of pieces into attacks and mating attacks. Through repetition, this book helps players learn the patterns that will present them opportunities in their tournament games. My players that are serious about their improvement have, without exception, found that this book has bumped their ratings at least 200 points (some 400 points!) in less than a year! <br /> <br />As a coach, I have found that offering internal club recognition for completing puzzles such as these also improved club-wide interest. Additionally, many of the puzzles you find elsewhere, whether in a book or on-line, will have escape possibilities from the stated \\"mate-in-two\\" or other move numbers. Of the 5334 puzzles in this book, my students and I have only found ONE with such a problem! <br /> <br />I would not hesitate to give this book the highest possible review rating as a teaching manual - you don't need to re-write the book when Lazlo has already done it for you <br />
0800141601|5.0|A very pleasing all-around movie is how I found this Knights Of The Roundtable-type story and a good one for DVD, even one that's been on disc for quite some time. For an early DVD, this was a real treat for the ears with some great rear- speaker sound. The story, however, not the sound, was the main appeal of this film for me. <br /> <br />The three main stars in this movie were very appealing: Richard Gere as the cocky-but-good guy Sir Lancelot; Julia Ormond as Guinevere and Sean Connery, aptly cast as King Arthur. He certainly looks and acts the part, as does Ben Cross as the villain, Prince Malagant. <br /> <br />This is a straight adventure story, too, with none of the hocus-pocus sorcery baloney who often see in these King Arthur stories. This is beautifully filmed with a city of Camelot that is awesome to view. Nice values in here, too, with - gasp - the importance of prayer mentioned. No wonder so many reviewers out there hated this message. <br /> <br />This is simply a classy, great adventure and highly recommend to literally everyone who values a nice story that has values.
B000002UWF|2.0|I love Louis Prima, but this CD was disappointing. It arrived in the mail, and I put it in the stereo. The first song is \\"Just a  <br />Gigolo\\". It's a classic. Unfortunately, half of this CD sounds like \\"Just a Gigolo\\" - the same beat, the same arrangements, and in one case, the identical vocal line. Every song on this CD seems to have the same rhythm which is very annoying. I wouldn't recommend this particular album.
B0000640VO|4.0|If ever I needed a movie dubbed, this one would be it. Normally, I prefer subtitles, but the visuals in here are so incredible that trying to read the subtitles distracts me from taking in all there is to see. I wish we English-speaking people had that opiton. <br /> <br />Man, there is a lot to see: brilliant, beautiful colors in scene-after-scene. They alone make this DVD worth owning. The story is decent, pretty interesting but nothing super. The humor is \\"French,\\" meaning different from what we normally laugh at in North America. The story also, to be honest, gets frustrating after awhile, as Amelie goes on too long with her charade. If you've watched it, you know what I mean. <br /> <br />However, this is so uniquely and beautifully filmed that I can put up with a so-so story. The story is absurd, as most of the characters are, the lead actress, Audrey Tautou, is cute and fun to watch and the addition of humor to the romance story helps make the tale palatable. <br /> <br />There is almost no profanity in here and a few very quick nude shots which must be the reason for the \\"R\\" rating, otherwise it would be an easy \\"PG.\\" In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.is wir uns neu verliebt haben. <br /> <br />Ein sehr feiner, schräger Film.
0312263120|2.0|I bought this book when we left on vacation, and I must admit that it was an interesting read.  Generally, the style of writing was good at keeping me interested, however the total butchering of the facts in this book was terrible.  I don't know how Dan Brown's other books go in terms of fact checking, but he should at least have given the draft to a high-school computer student to verify.  This is one of those books that propagates dumb email forwards and makes stupid people feel smart.  What took the cake for me was a cross reference to a 64-bit encryption key having 64 characters (how many bits are there in a byte again?).  Although a petty complaint, simple factual errors such as this really took away from the immersion in the story, as well as the credibility of the author and the reviews plastered all over the book.  A three-million processor computer incapable of being unplugged?  A \\"1-million-bit\\" encryption key being guessed in under 3 hours?  An \\"unbreakable\\" encryption algorithm that is encrypted with itself?  A group of 180-IQ agent struggling for three chapters to unravel the final \\"clue\\"? (It was blatantly obvious from the minute the hint was posed).  \\"Enigma\\" weighing 12 tons? A super computer that willingly executes a virus? (a virus is just a program people!!!!).  <br /> <br />Either Dan Brown really skipped his homework on this one or he's taking the readers for morons.  Sadly, this could have been a great story, with some interesting messages with regards to privacy rights and government responsibility.  However the complete disregard for the facts seriously detracted from the value of this novel. <br /> <br />PS: Wikipedia contains a fantastic analysis of the errors reported in this book.  Anyone that reads this book should venture to Wikipedia and educate themselves.
B00005JKN9|4.0|Daniel Day-Lewis elevates this film from just \\"pretty good\\" to \\"very good.\\"   He is absolutely riveting, one of the most interesting \\"villains\\" I have ever seen on film. I am sorryhe didn't win the Academy Award for his performance.  His facial expressions alone cracked me up! <br /> <br />Day-Lewis played \\"Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting\\" he is one nasty dude. However, there are no real \\"good guys\\" in this story. The supposed hero, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a revenge-seeking man with a ton of flaws himself. The rest of the characters are either thieves, gang members, corrupt politicians or corrupt policeman. Ah yes, another family-oriented film from that kindly director Martin Scorcese. <br /> <br />What Scorcese lacks in family values, he comes close to making up for in style. This is another fascinating visual film with great sets, costumes, color and camera-work. Other typical Scorcese touches are in here: Catholic-bashing and brutal language. (I question whether the f-word was used back in the days this film takes place.) <br /> <br />All in all, a tough film that could be too unpleasant to watch but for Lewis' outstanding performance and the spectacular visuals
0060224657|5.0|Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith's legacy within the 1980s is arguably incomparable - their debut, 'The Hurting', released in the early rungs of the decade, was a violently passionate scrapbook of adolescent angst and unanswered questions.  By 1985 the duo had restocked their ammo, ready to fire in a different direction - 'Songs From The Big Chair' was, arguably, less angry and perhaps less conceptual than its predecessor, though no less philosophical.  They had adopted a more 'user-friendly' sound, and in return received worldwide acclaim and the plaudits they rightly deserved.<br /><br />By the time the now gargantuan fanbase had waited for a follow-up to 'Big Chair', Smith and Orzabal had swerved in yet another direction.  Having waited four long years for the third LP, the public was finally treated to 'The Seeds of Love', an album which reputedly broke several banks in one fell swoop.  The album would also be the duo's last creation together until their surprise reunion in 2003.<br /><br />'The Seeds of Love' is grandiose.  If it were any grander, it'd be a theatrical production.  The new direction TFF chose to point in was more luxurious, more orchestral, perhaps more poignant, than previous works.  This is not, however, the type of album you listen to and immediately enjoy - as my own experience has led me to believe.  Each song, from the jazz-fuelled venom of 'Badman's Song', to the solemn yearning of 'Woman in Chains' and 'Famous Last Words', and to the air-guitar-inspiring 'Year of the Knife', is so deep, and so thick with layers of instrumental experimentation and words of philosophy, of vengeance, and of sadness, that immediate enjoyment is virtually impossible - this is the sort of album that will grow on you the more you give it time to work its soul.<br /><br />The most commercial song by far is the successful single 'Sowing the Seeds of Love', a dynamic Beatles pastiche with what I believe to be Roland at the vocal peak of his career.  Though it is hard to compare three songs by TFF, one form each of their 80s albums, next to each other ('Mad World' against 'Shout' and 'Sowing The Seeds' for example), it is perfect evidence that the band were, and still are, an outfit which grows a little with each album.  It's hard to say whether this tops 'Big Chair', 'Hurting', 'Elemental', 'Everybody Loves a Happy Ending' or to a lesser extent 'Raoul and the Kings of Spain', but I'll be damned if it's not in the running.<br /><br />If you've listened to and enjoyed ANY of Tears For Fears' other albums, particularly 'Happy Ending', there's no doubt in my mind that this is a very wise purchase.  However, be prepared for your love for this album to grow gradually rather than be instantly immediate.to compare three songs by TFF, one form each of their 80s albums, next to each other ('Mad World' against 'Shout' and 'Sowing The Seeds' for example), it is perfect evidence that the band were, and still are, an outfit which grows a little with each album.

B000BT97AO|2.0|Being a fan of Neil Gaiman's writing, and a lover of fantasy movies, I had high expectations for this film.  I thought the asthetic was beautiful, but the plot was flimsy and the dialogue uninteresting.  It was beginning to feel like a chore to watch it and I gave up before it was over.

B0002DB50E|5.0|Being an avid David Cronenberg movie fan, I've come to appreciate the suttle details in his motion pictures that contribute to the macabre horror in his creations. \\"Videodrome\\" is certainly no exception: the DVD not only includes the unrated (uncut) version of the movie, but also includes well over an hour of supplimentary footage that makes understanding the plot far easier. If you were curious about \\"Videodrome\\" in the 1980's, this DVD set will certainly answer any questions you may have. <br /> <br />A quick disclaimer: the movie, its commentary, and the additional video on the second DVD is unrated and is as risque as late-night Cinemax. But if you've seen the R-rated version you probably know what to expect.
B00005MP58|3.0|I am extremely disappointed after watching this A&E special version of P&P. I'd return the DVD if I could. <br /> <br />Just about every actor in this movie was too old for the role they played. Looking at George Wickham, who is supposed to be about Darcy's age (about 28 year-old in the book. But in the movie, the actor looked like he was in his 40s. Not mention Caroline Bingley looking like in her late 30s. Even the leading actress, in my opinion, looked too mature to play the supposed 20,21 year-old Elizabeth Bennet. Could it be that there was simply a lack of excellent young British actors? <br />BTW, the picture quality looked bad.
B000A7LR82|4.0|The original vinyl version of this was stunning and a must have. The reissues have been very good but have tended to substitute in favoured or classic tracks like Louie Louie rather than the original track listing. The boxed set included the original tracks and a great deal more but somehow, despite the inclusions of many classics not on the original, like Love for example, it lost some impact. It was too much of a good thing if you like.  <br /> <br />Now, here for the first time in several years is a reissue that is both beautifully packaged (albeit that you'll need a magnifying glass for the inside of the gatefold) and does no more or less than reproduce the original on CD in mini gatefold and at a ludicrously cheap price. As such it makes a fantastic artyfact in its' own right. However, it's the music that's the real revelation. <br /> <br />This is a classic compilation. It has highs and lows, something for everyone and the real status of being an iconic, important historical artyfact (sorry, I have to keep using their spelling) , however, unlike many influential records, its' biggest asset is that it has the music in spades. It's corny, hard, soft, tacky and obscure. Fundamentally it's a record no collection should be without. It's not perfect. Everybody will have at least one track or more that they hate but they'll also have at least half a dozen tracks that lead them to explore new musical avenues and a lifetime of pleasure.  <br /> <br />Enjoy.director gives us a rare glimpse into the realities of war and life in the Middle East.  Certainly one of the best movies of 2005 and well worth the 98 minutes!
1889786268|5.0|This would have to be one of the best hard rock and live albums ever, and with two extra tracks and a sensational re-mastering job, it's got even better.   <br /> <br />Reed's band, and guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner in particular, create an almost orchestral sound.  For example, Sweet Jane features a marvellous instrumental introduction which builds and builds, then culminates in the riff kicking in just as Lou struts out on stage.  Rock n Roll is a great closing track, with some stunning guitar work.  Lou's in great voice, too.   <br /> <br />The original CD seemed to have been mastered through mud, but the new transfer has depth, `bite' and you can hear everything clearly.   <br /> <br />A companion LP, Lou Reed Live, was recorded at the same concerts but has yet to see the light of day on CD.  It had a nice version of Vicious, but not much else; a pity that wasn't added to this disc, but you can't have everything. <br /> <br />I wouldn't call this a `good time rock n roll record' - how could any album with 'Heroin' on it be considered a `good time' record? - but it really kicks along and still sounds fresh and exciting.   <br />
140003180X|5.0|This is the fourth outing for the wonderful Precious Ramotswe and her no.1 Ladies Detective Agency, along with her supporting assistant detective, Mma Makutsi as well as Mr J B L Matekoni. Mr J B L Matekoni is her fiance and the owner of the Tlekoni Rd Speedy Motors where Precious now has her agency. It is a very good move for now people who need a tune up in their car might also think to get the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency to do a little work for them while they wait for their car, and people who come in to have a matter seen to by the No. 1 Ladies Detective agency might also take advantage of the Tlekoni Rd Speedy Motors to have their motor tuned while they wait. Alexander McCall Smith uses every opportunity to gain maximum gentle humour out of the situation. It is lovely stuff.<br /><br />For afficianados of mysteries these are quite a different experience. It is not so much a whodunnit mystery, but more like how will thing be resolved. It is all very nicely done and there is no disappointment.<br /><br />There is new detective Agency in town, The Satisfaction Guaranteed Detective Agency , Ex-CID, EX-New York, Ex-Cellent. Run by a slippery character, Cephus Buthelezi who it seems impossible to pin down on anything actually real about his life. He is half-Zulu which seems to explain a lot. And he is also extremely arrogant, as an article in the local paper shows. Precious is already worried about the agency, but at least Mma Makutsi is half paid with her work at Speedy Motors as Assistant manager.<br /><br />Mma Makutsi wants more to her life though. She wants to establish her own business, and so she begins the Kalahari School of Typing for Men. This will be run using typewriters which don't always work very well and run in a church building so people will think they are going to church, not simply going to typing lessons, descretion guaranteed.<br /><br />There are two cases for Precious to resolve.

0321344758|5.0|If I read a book on web design or web usability, the thing that will turn me off the quickest is the dogmatic rantings of a self-proclaimed \\"expert\\" on the subject.  It's far too easy to call one's preferences \\"best practices\\" and think that everyone needs to conform to them.  Hate it, hate it, hate it!  So why did I pick up and read Don't Make Me Think : A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability (2nd Edition) by Steve Krug?  Because it's one of those usability books that actually clicks with me and restores my faith in common sense design techniques.<br /><br />Contents:<br /><br />Guiding Principles: Don't make me think!; How we really use the Web; Billboard Design 101; Animal, vegetable, or mineral?; Omit needless words<br /><br />Things You Need To Get Right: Street signs and Breadcrumbs; The first step in recovery is admitting that the Home page is beyond your control<br /><br />Making Sure You Got Them Right: \\"The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends\\"; Usability testing on 10 cents a day<br /><br />Larger Concerns And Outside Influences: Usability as common courtesy; Accessibility, Cascading Style Sheets; and you; Help! My boss wants me to ______.<br /><br />Recommended Reading; Acknowledgments; Index<br /><br />First off, Steve Krug does this web design stuff for a living.  So rather than live in the world of theory and stopwatches, he's actually seen and built things that both work and fail.  Because of that, his common sense experience shines through in his writing.  Couple that with some unique page design and entertaining graphics, and it's hard to not sit through and read the book from end to end in one sitting.  In fact, that's *exactly* what he designed the book for!  For those of us who have been working on the web for a very long time, it's amazing how much we take for granted and just \\"assume\\".  But the audience of our site(s) may be far less sophisticated, and the only way to understand usable web design is to see things through fresh eyes.  His pragmatic approach to usability testing is refreshing, and is something that you can easily do on any project without having to spend thousands for a full-blown lab.  Those findings will drive much of your design and help you to realize what works and what doesn't.  And it will probably surprise you what falls into which areas...<br /><br />This is one of those classic titles on a subject that needs to be read by everyone who makes their living doing web site design.  There's absolutely no reason *not* to spend the three or so hours it will take to cover the material.  I'm willing to bet it will make a positive impact on your design skills, and your audience will thank you profusely...usability testing is refreshing, and is something that you can easily do on any project without having to spend thousands for a full-blown lab.

0061015725|2.0|Despite the locomotive start to the story (the first 50 pages or so really grabbed my attention), I slowly became disappointed in it and, by the end, found that it was far less enjoyable than I expected from the author of Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain. <br /> <br />The scientific aspects of the story are phenomenally high-scaled, so don't pick this one up if you want a light read.  Crichton adeptly integrates very new and real science into the story about nanotechnology going astray.  His description of the nano-manufacturing apparatus is quite interesting.  The explanation of nano-evolution is even more intriguing as it poses questions I believe we should be asking about this technology.  As I had hoped, Crichton even provides a bibliography of reference material that he used to develop the scientific aspects of the story (which gave me lots of really nerdy follow-up material to digest). <br /> <br />I found it terribly sad, though, that he allowed the plot of the story to devolve so quickly.  The characters suddenly became frightened flocking targets with little realism in their interactions.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the end of the book, leaving the reader wondering if they only purchased part of the story.  The last-minute attempt to wrap up the loose ends with what amounts to a two-page excuse seems to be a last-ditch effort to pardon the story itself - a rushed closure seemingly spun from Crichton's lost interest in the material. <br /> <br />Another aspect of my disappointment came from the eerie similarity between Prey and the nanotechnology-related material in Decipher by Stel Pavlou.  Decipher, released some two years prior to Prey, includes a story arch regarding nanoparticles that can mimic humans, eat flesh and which ultimately become a formidable foe.  That the entire premise of Prey.  I realize that Decipher is a far more complex story and that the nanotechnology aspects are only one of its many parts, but Prey seems terriblysimilar. <br /> <br />The misuse of nanotechnology is a frightening prospect, one which Crichton failed to fully realize in this story.  It wasn't disturbing enough.  The realism got lost in his zeal to tell a story - any story.  Suspension of disbelief became impossible as the nanobots began to demonstrate abilities that were laughably unbelievable, including perfect human emulation that even a spouse could not recognize during intimate encounters. <br /> <br />Crichton's minimalist approach to what should have been a fantastically disturbing story is disappointing at best.  I expected a synthetic version of The Andromeda Strain to unfold.
B0000057C5|4.0|I am a big Rammstein fan. Although I think Rosenrot is better, this is still a great album. If you like Rammstein check out Oomph!, they are another German band that is simmilar. Also about the Du hast issue, it is \\"you have\\" or a more accurate translation is \\"you've\\". If it were \\"you hate\\" then the line would not make sense as you hate me asked and I did not say anything. Also \\"hate\\" is pronounced with a long \\"a\\" where as \\"have\\" is pronounced with a short \\"a\\" sound.
B0009MDPYW|5.0|\\"Constantine\\" is an unusual spiritual film, which portrays frightening demons and serene angels in a world where heaven and hell are unquestionable realities.  John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an expert in demonology and occult matters.  He performs exorcisms and is all too familiar with hell and non-Earthly entities.  The special effects are amazing in showing all sorts of demons and John's battles with them.<br /><br />The movie incorporates some details of the legendary spear of destiny, which is an actual artifact.  The spear pierced the side of Jesus Christ, is what actually killed Him, and not the crucifixion itself.  The film plays on the idea that the spear point is recovered in the ruins of an old church in Mexico wrapped in a Nazi flag (Hitler did in fact seize the artifact from a museum).  The story goes whoever holds the spear can control the fate of the world.<br /><br />Between the spear being found, and increase in demon activity on Earth, and John trying to send the demons back to hell, we have a woman.  The woman is a twin, whose sister was either killed by demonic forces or committed suicide.  As the sister had a gift and could see things others could not (various spirits without bodies), she was thought of as strange her whole life.  This resulted in her being institutionalized, which is no real surprise as psychiatrists are really nothing more than keepers of those society would rather not deal with or sadly enough, those with a different reality.  John tries to help her figure out what really happened to her twin as the fate of the world, as well as his future, all depends on it, even if he does not realize it at the time.  \\"Constantine\\" is a very creative film and interestingly enough, based on a comic book; I would highly recommend it for those looking for a truly unusual spiritual thriller.
B00005JO1R|3.0|\\"Walk The Line\\", written by Gill Dennis and James Mangold; directed by James Mangold.<br /><br />\\"Walk The Line\\" will inevitably be compared (at least from now until Oscar time) with \\"Ray\\", Taylor Hackford's popular biopic of Ray Charles.  Is it a better movie?  Is Joaquin Phoenix better than Jamie Foxx?  And so forth.  The answers, at least for me, vary quite at bit.<br /><br />Mr. Phoenix's Cash is simply not as vivid as Mr. Foxx's Charles.  His resemblance isn't as strong, and his vocals are initially shaky - the scene where Cash comes into his own during his first recording session isn't very successful - but he becomes more convincing as the film progresses.  Perhaps because I have no knowledge of June Carter's music, Reese Witherspoon's singing is far more successful.<br /><br />In general, though, I think \\"Walk the Line\\" is a more satisfying film than \\"Ray\\".  Granted, I grew up with Johnny Cash's music, and consider him to be one of the best country performers of all time, so I'm not sure how objective I can be.  What truly sets \\"Walk The Line\\" apart, though, isn't the music or the plot, but the choices of what the filmmakers decided to show us.<br /><br />The films opens strongly with the Folsom Prison concert - beginning as a distant thrum outside its walls, slowing building to a roar as we make our way toward the performers.  This bookends the film, with the main body of the story spanning about thirty years.<br /><br />Perhaps inevitably, much of the film has a great deal of plot similarities with \\"Ray\\" - nascent beginnings, a troubled childhood, marital discord, infidelities, substance abuse, creative conflicts and triumphs.  This familiar chain of events is a weakness, and keeps \\"Walk\\" from being a truly great movie.<br /><br />Its main strength is that it doesn't try to encapsule all of Cash's life, but chooses instead to focus on one of its most emotional, sympathetic periods.  His long term romance with June Carter is the film's true body, culminating in her acceptance of his proposal in 1969.  Reese Witherspoon is terrific in the role, giving the film much of its spark and spine. It's a lively, heartfelt performance that makes Mr. Phoenix's passionate pursuit of her so convincing.  Their chemistry together is strong, providing the film with extra heat.<br /><br />\\"Walk The Line\\", then, reads more as a love story than a biography, which makes the inevitable summation paragraph (usually involving another forty or fifty years of the artist's career) less disappointing.  \\"Ray's\\" attempt at biography was far more frustrating in this regard.<br /><br />\\"Walk\\" also gets more help from its supporting characters.  While \\"Ray's\\" supporting cast had a tendency to fade into the background, \\"Walk The Line\\" has a better spread of memorable performances, especially Waylon Payne's Jerry Lee Lewis, and Dallas Roberts making the most of his brief appearance as Sam Phillips.<br /><br />The use of music in the film is also strong, supporting the emotions of the content, rather than receding (as can often happen) into montage wallpaper.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Walk The Line\\" has its flaws, but is still a compelling and emotional story.

B00004XMV6|5.0|\\"9 1/2 Weeks\\" is an erotic thriller about the romance between Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) and John (Mickey Rourke).  As the name implies, their time together is not long, but without a doubt steamy and memorable.  John had his eye on Elizabeth from the beginning and swooped down like a hawk, while she could not resist his advances.<br /><br />Elizabeth falls in love with him very fast, and even as John becomes increasingly controlling and dominating, she still cannot break free from his charms.  He showers her with gifts almost continuously, but I hardly think they had much affect on her, since it was him and his excitement she seemed to like most.  The interactions and intimacy between two people are taken to a high level as she is blindfolded and he touches her body with ice cubes, as he feeds her with her eyes closed, and has sexual encounters with her in places such as a back alley and a clock tower.  The film does have more than a few erotic/sexual scenes, but not as vulgar as it could be, leaving some things to the imagination.<br /><br />Because I really did not know what to expect with John and if and when he would snap from being calm to angry, I was on edge for most of the movie.  Actually, he retained his exterior calmness even when he was dominating her, giving him a true covertly hostile personality.  On the other hand, Elizabeth was often timid and just wanted to be loved.  Moreover, although she may not have enjoyed all the games he wanted to play, it did look like she enjoyed much of them.  Seeing them both interact will leave an impression on you and may rank among one of the most memorable films about lust you may ever watch.
B000DWMYQ8|2.0|\\"Chicken Little\\", written by Robert L. Baird, Steve Bencich, Ron J. Friedman, and Dan Gerson; directed by Mark Dindal.  Spoilers abound.<br /><br />Disney's feature animation unit has seen some pretty rough times in recent years.  Most of the Disney films released since the glory days of \\"The Lion King\\" and \\"Aladdin\\" (with the possible exception of \\"Lilo and Stitch\\") have progressively lost more and more of their audience. Many have attributed this to the rise in popularity of computer animation, that perhaps audiences now see hand-drawn animation as old-fashioned (I don't think that's true at all, but that's another article).  \\"Chicken Little\\", then, is Disney's biggest bid yet to enter the 3D sweepstakes, and once again be a dominant force in animation.  I think that there's a lot riding on this film for the studio, fairly or not.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the strain shows, and the talky, hectic \\"Chicken Little\\" probably won't put much of a dent in their current track record.  To their credit, the filmmakers went in a different aesthetic direction than most computer fare. The film's look is a charming hybrid of cockeyed fifties design and children's storybook art.  A menagerie of fuzzy animals putter about in their diminutive cars, and many of the characters are boldly stylized and well animated.  But charm can only take you so far, and that's where the trouble begins.<br /><br />The story is an update of the old fairy tale, which, to be honest, I hardly remember.  In this version, Chicken Little (Zach Braff) is a boy, and he's right about the sky falling - if 'right' means that the sky is a piece of a spaceship's cloaking device (a nice use of the computer medium).  The problem is, there's been no evidence to support his warnings.  The plot attempts to worsen his situation in a school dodgeball game, but he comes off more as an unlucky klutz than the chicken who keeps crying wolf.<br /><br />When the \\"sky\\" falls a second time, Chicken Little, not surprisingly, wants nothing to do with it.  He's just helped his little league team win the pennant, and doesn't want to risk his precariously restored bond with his father, Buck Cluck (nicely voiced by Garry Marshall), who also wants to get past the whole town-laughingstock-thing.  This unfortunately removes their conflict (Son needs to prove himself, Dad wants him to lie low) established at the beginning.<br /><br />It's especially frustrating to see this central conflict wasted - the entire town misses crucial proof by a couple of seconds for the sake of a gag.  Where's dad, pulling Chicken Little by the arm, telling him to stop this nonsense and just come home?  This would've exacerbated their problems, rather than the aliens having to drive the plot.  But they do, and it's up to father and son to reunite and save the world from the oncoming invaders.<br /><br />This is pretty familiar stuff, and the film doesn't stop with echoing \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Billy Elliot\\", but also borrows heavily from \\"Jimmy Neutron\\", \\"Shrek\\", \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", \\"E.T.\\", \\"War of the Worlds\\" (which is explicitly mentioned), \\"Signs\\", \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\", and Top Forty playlists from thirty years ago.  Most of the the songs are ill-fitting, the nadir of this being the \\"I Bruise You\\" song, disservicing a good emotional moment.<br /><br />The supporting cast - buddies Runt (of the litter), \\"Ugly\\" Duckling, and Fish (out of water), are mostly one-joke characters who wear thin pretty quickly. Runt starts out as a panicky overeater and winds up a Streisand fan.  Fish seems especially extraneous, serving only to generate distracting background business.<br /><br />Some of these problems would be easier to handle if the film were funnier than it is - there's a chuckle here and there, but by far the best bit is the \\"Pee Wee's Big Adventure\\" coda where the cast watches the film version of what just happened to them.  Adam West makes a guest voice appearance, and sadly, the film feels the most at home with itself than it has for most of its running time.  While some small children may enjoy \\"Chicken Little\\", its future doesn't look bright.the film feels the most at home with itself than it has for most of its running time.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|Like lots of reviewers here, I'm baffled by the Editorial Review from Amazon.  I must admit however that I wasn't over the moon about the album the very first time I listened to it.  I was doing stuff around the house while listening, and thought it was really good but I wasn't thinking of it as great.  It was on a second listen that I began to find myself standing foolishly in the middle of the floor, whatever I was doing completely forgotten for a moment as a particular song sort of commanded my attention.  Finally I got the chance to listen to the whole thing closely and  without distractions as I was riding in a car.  It was this third time through that convinced me-- this is a really brilliant record.  It's simply not an in-your-face kind of thing, one that instantly screams whatever it is the Amazon reviewer was listening for the moment you press 'play'.  It is subtle and layered, something that reveals itself more fully with repeated listening.  I, like other reviewers here, find something new and wonderful each time, whether it's an unexpected turn of a melody, or a line from the lyric that I missed the first time, or one of Knopfler's just-exactly-perfect note choices.  I haven't been this moved or impressed by a release in a long time!
0689859368|4.0|First of all, I'd like to say that while I think the book was just the slightest bit too short and sparse, Holly Black has a gift when it comes to creating realistic families and settings that manage to make you feel all warm and fuzzy when you read about them.<br /><br />The characters in the first Spiderwick book behave exactly as their real life counterparts would.  The children fight, the mother gets annoyed when her kids goof off a bit too much, and the house is falling apart, exactly as an old, creaky manor should.<br /><br />Despite this- or perhaps because of it- I found myself growing quite attached to the children as I read.  I lost myself in the story, and I could really see the house and the events as the author wants us to, and the pictures, instead of contradicting my mental pictures, only added to them in a rather pleasant sort of way.<br /><br />When the supernatural first begins to enter the story, Black eases it in instead of throwing it in your face, and because of this subtle touch the magical elements seem perfectly natural and believable.  There were some points in the first half of the book when I found myself questioning whether the strange happenings really were supernatural, or simply the work of a mischevious youth, despite knowing full well from the book description that magical creatures would appear in the story at some point.<br /><br />Overall, a very worthy read.  As I said earlier, the book is just a bit shorter than I think it should be for the reader to really feel satisfied with this first installment, but that doesn't detract from the story, and I greatly enjoyed reading it.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I'm new to Final Fantasy series and I don't know how the old story was, but this movie is the most amazing animation I've seen for years.  The story is large, with non-stop actions for the complete 1.5 hours. The action scenes are so intense that I need to stop in the middle to take a break.  <br /> <br />This is a dvd I can watch again and again. Consider its quality and content, this is the most bang of the buck dvd for the year.
B00008PC2O|5.0|And the price i got it for...4.99 at Big Lots...lol...anyways this movie is perfect, and this ultimate edition DVD is brilliant as well...the Blu Ray edition coming in a month or 2 is the same one, so save your money, and go to your local big lots, it's a definite price saver~!!
B000071IYQ|5.0|I agree that this is way overpriced.  I, too, bought mine for about $60 at my local mall a few years ago.  If you have the money to spend, and you love the show that much, I think it's worth $150 to have good audio and video quality.  I'm wondering why it's priced so high.  If it's because they've stopped production of this, maybe it's not such an outrageous price.  A collector's item!  But, I definitly hope that doesn't mean they aren't releasing the second season.  I would be highly disappointed.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I first saw this movie in January and still can not get it out of my mind. I see lots of movies that get great reviews and sometimes they're deserved and sometimes not. I admit I didn't immediately see how great this movie was at first. I didn't cry at all and came out of the cinema confused, not sure of what I had seen, and wondering things like: why did Ennis punch Jack on that last day on the mountain? how did Jack actually die? where did the shirts come from? Then surprisingly I found myself thinking about the movie over the next few days so I decided to read the story, which cleared up some things, and went to see the movie again. This time the true greatness of the movie really hit me and I cried a lot. I think this is really a rare case where all the stars aligned in terms of story, directing, acting, music, cinematography, etc. I'm really glad I didn't read the story until I'd after I'd seen the movie so it was all new to me. I truly had no expectations beyond knowing that it was about a relationship between two men.   <br /> <br />I'm also really glad I wasn't living in the US and having to deal with the hype and constant jokes. Thankfully there was none of that in the UK. This is not a movie about \\"gay cowboys\\". When asked what drew Ennis and Jack together, Heath Ledger said in an interview that he felt that Ennis' soul fell in love with another soul, and that soul came in the form of a man. I think that's right on target, because Ennis never seemed interested in anyone after Jack, not in other men, his wife, or the waitress. Jack and Ennis were very lonely people and that only changed when they were together. They had very similar backgrounds and it's sad to think that this was probably their first real friendship. It's striking that during those four years they're apart, one time that they're clearly thinking of each other is when the issue of loneliness comes up, even though neither is alone at the time. How can anyone think their relationship was aboutlust? They carried on for 20 years and Jack drove 14 hours each way just to see Ennis a few times a year...a lot of trouble for just a few rolls in the hay. I admit the first time I saw this movie the love between them wasn't so obvious and the first tent scene mostly seemed to come out of nowhere, but after repeated viewings and paying close attention the love is very clear. These are very undemonstrative people and they are not going to be giving each other candy and flowers and declaring their love. But scenes such as Ennis holding Jack from behind in front of the fire and humming make the love blazingly clear, I frankly wish it had gone on as long as suggested in the story!  <br /> <br />And that's heartbreaking and the reason I think this movie has stayed with me for so long. You see them at the beginning, 19 years old with their lives ahead of them, and you see them become frustrated and sadder and going through the motions in life with the passing years, and 20 years later one is dead and the other is doomed to be alone and full of regret the rest of his life. You don't have to be gay or a cowboy or even a man to understand this movie. I am none of those things. I think everyone can understand being lonely and question whether they've made the right choices in life or will be full of regret at the end. You hope you'll find that one person your soul connects with and not end up alone. However, this story absolutely needs to take place between two men and I don't understand how people can say that this story could take place between a man and a woman. The point is that Ennis hates himself for being in love with another man and that's why he makes him and Jack live the way they do. Yet although they talk about their relationships with women, he goes ballistic at the thought of Jack sleeping with other men. Jack probably knows this, and I think this is why at their last meeting Jack says he's carrying on with the ranch foreman's wife rather than the ranch foreman, and rather sadly jokes about being shot by Lureen or her husband. Ennis learns the truth after Jack dies from Jack's father and finally has to realize that he may have finally driven Jack away.    <br /> <br />I have only one complaint about the story. Many people have said they like the scene at the end where Alma Jr. comes to tell Ennis she's getting married, but I don't. This scene isn't in the story and I think it was an attempt to make the audience feel a bit more hopeful that Ennis has changed because he decides to quit his job and go to the wedding. In the book Ennis is alone and haunted by dreams of Jack the rest of his life, which I find far more believable considering that he's full of regret, although even more heartbreaking than the movie's ending if that's even possible. <br /> <br />Though I don't particularly like country music, I did buy the soundtrack for the score but was disappointed that it contains so little of it. I hope they release the rest of the score and some of the other music mentioned in the credits. Although I've bought the DVD, I'd gladly buy a director's cut with commentary, deleted scenes, etc. The trailer contains some scenes that were not in the movie such as a scene where Ennis and Jack are in a car together. I'm surprised that the trailer wasn't on the DVD, that's fairly common. Being able to watch the DVD with subtitles is great because I realized that I missed some dialog even though I saw it in the cinema many many times, notably during the second tent scene.
1400079179|5.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" by Dan Brown. Robert Langdon a Professor of Religious Symbology is in Paris to give a lecture for \\"The American University of Paris\\". He is sleeping in his hotel after the lecture when he is awoken by the phone ringing. He is informed that a guest is on his way to his room. It turns out the local police need his help for some reason in a murder case at the Louvre. He doesn't know it yet but the Police suspect him. Adventure ensues.<br /><br />For those who don't know the book has a great deal to do with the Holy Grail. Where it is and what it is. Many Christians have big problem with this books point of view and seem not to want the book read or the movie viewed. If your faith is so weak that a book of fiction can make you question it, then you shouldn't read this. However if you can read a book of fiction that may or may not be contrary to what you believe and take it for what it is, a work of fiction, the you will enjoy this book. Apparently the subject matter has been the center of great debate for some time, and although the characters in this book support the side of the debate that most Christians do not follow the book is still a work of fiction and is an enjoyable story.<br /><br />The Good: The book moves at a good pace, with things constantly happening. Good characters. Great descriptions of Paris etc. very enjoyable read that is well written.<br /><br />The bad: Nothing of note.<br /><br />Overall the book was a great read and I highly recommend it.
B000EQ4G5K|1.0|Album cover is good for the eye sockets,but the music is a dime dozen. not bad in terms of production,but Rihanna doesn't have any real vocal range. \\"S.O.S\\" is catchy but alot that has to do with the 80's sample from the Group Soft Cell. catchy enough to get alot of play&a small buzz,but Rihanna is a dime a dozen vocalist who is basically a 3rd tier Beyonce on a good day.
B000EGCITG|5.0|It's rare these days to find an artist that actually improves over time as opposed to recycling the same tired materials over and over again. Pink is one of those artists. I'm one of the few that loved just about every track on Try This, so, I didn't really know what to expect from this one, especially after I hear Stupid Girls the first time, 'cause it didn't really do it for me. Seemed to me she was trying to hard to set herself apart from the pack. Then I heard the rest of the cd and I have seen the light. She is apart from the pack. Lightyears. One song, one song alone is worth the price of this cd, and that's \\"Who Knew\\". Breaks my f*cking heart everytime I hear it, so, believe me, it's on repeat. Just the basic construction of the whole disc and the way it flows, it's flawless. Love you Pink. Welcome back.

0385504209|2.0|Listen, I understand that the story is a bit exciting and fun to read at times, but this guy is a really weak writer.  I don't want to be an elitist, but i have read some pretty good stuff in my day and this is really not it at all.  The story itself is totally unbelieveable, but that's okay.  Who said books can't be a bit fantastic and out-there?  but Brown is a really terrible writer.  The DV Code is totally forced, concocted, and cheesey.  And have you tried any of the other books this clown had written?  Digital Fortress was again, a nice little (predictable) story, but Holy S### was the writing weak.  So in the end if you want to be entertained, I bet the movie will be worth 10 bucks, but the read?  Do that at your own risk of reading some of the most shoddy writing you've ever read, unless of course you read Steele, or Higgins-Clark, or Clancy for that matter.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|I found BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a painfully sad experience--wonderfully filmed, as Ang Lee's movies usually are, and well acted, but deeply depressing. It was comparable to watching a slow-motion train wreck on an ironically beautiful, bright sunny day--or reading one of Thomas Hardy's later novels.<br /><br />Neither Ennis Del Mar nor Jack Twist (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) was a character that most of us would admire or respect: both were like good-looking Lost Boys who never became responsible adults with the passage of time. Despite their differences in temperaments and experiences, they were like a pair of perpetual Peter Pans, poorly educated, pitifully below average intelligence, and morally irresponsible.<br /><br />Most would agree that our DNA and the vissitudes of life largely determine what handicaps or deficiencies our minds and bodies have, and these normally are factors that nobody ought to be blamed for. But our willpower (or \\"won't-power\\"), especially when it involves honest interactions with others, is usually seen as an entirely different matter. Throughout the film, both Ennis and Jack lead dishonest lives that harm their spouses, their children, themselves, and each other. (BTW, if you think this is harsh, ask yourself how vigorously you would defend a so-called straight married person who is leading a lie-based double life with one or more lovers outside his/her marriage.)<br /><br />If Ennis and Jack had been presented as malicious men, they would not deserve our pity. Instead, they come across as pitifully weak, essentially careless and thoughtless ageing adolescents. We watch their deceitful, destructive behavior with sorrow, knowing that they are incapable of changing for the better--perhaps foolishly hoping their lives will improve somehow but expecting them to worsen.<br /><br />As far as courage and integrity are concerned, the one bright spot in the picture was when Jack Twist stood up to his domineering father-in-law (ably played by L. D. Newsome); sad to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit. And the low point for Ennis was when he became violent with his ex-wife when she revealed that she knew he and Jack did not do any fishing on their fishing trips. Perhaps the most poignant scene is when Ennis asks his daughter, Alma Jr. (Kate Mara), if the man she's engaged to marry is in love with her, and she says that he is.<br /><br />The murder of Jack was skillfully foreshadowed and resonates, of course, with events that occur in many U.S. communities today. Sadly coping with this misfortune, Ennis, in the process of trying to fulfill Jack's wish that his ashes be taken to Brokeback Mountain, learns that his lover had been cheating on him with another man. At the end of the film, we can feel certain that he will never find happiness of any sort in the remainder of his own life.<br /><br />Early in his book WALDEN (1854), Thoreau comments, \\"The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats.\\" The film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN almost seems designed to illustrate that grim view of humanity.to say, immediately he fell back into spinelessness and deceit.

B0002KPIQY|1.0|There was a real Gia from a real neighborhood - NE Phila. and a real time. No one from my neighborhood even dreamed of a sudden rise to fame but she caught a break and became very famous and wealthy at a young age. Before she was mature and wise enough to handle it.  This movie makes ZERO effort at capturing the real person or in capturing the time, place and people where the story is set. It takes the tabloid headlines, sensationalizes them for its own lurid purposes and is praised as great entertainment. If they want to make a fictional story, don't say that it is based on a real person.
B000EGCITG|2.0|This is Lord of Karma, surfacing to tackle yet another mainstream album that is getting critical acclaim from critical airheads. So, let's jump straight in, shall we? <br /> <br />P!nk has made a big deal about her personality, and it takes centerstage in her music. Lead single Stupid Girls, where she lampoons manufactured personalities, like Paris Hilton and her ilk - shows us clearly where Pink stands on all of this. Anti-establishment - oops, make that ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT!!!1111 Now, my dear reader, let me ask you a question - what theme runs consistently through this album? That's right, anti-establishment! Anti-airheadism, anti-Bush (ironically, highly fashionable today), anti-EVERYTHING. Her musical personality is consistently, one of malcontent. So, what makes her so different from the manufactured personalities she so gleefully derides? <br /> <br />In Singapore, we have one of those anti-EVERYTHING political parties (then again, which country doesn't?). P!nks just like that kind of political party, she finds fault, lampoons at everything that's wrong, and in her vendetta against everything, no one takes her seriously. No, you're not dead, Pink. Yes, we don't care. <br /> <br />I cannot deny this album is a breathe of fresh air in the music industry. But since when did you listen to radio, to listen to real artistic music anyway? Many of you might be lost here, and I admit it is tough to scratch beyond the surface. Do drop me a message at anytime, if you want a few recommendations on what you might enjoy. <br /> <br />Pink? Yeah, like. whatever.

The last song  \\"If This is Goodbye\\" inspired by people who suffered the 911 attack will absolutely put you back in touch with what is important in your own life.  \\"This is Us\\" strikes a familiar chord to anyone who is old enough to have begun gathering pictures that remind us of who we are.

B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days continues the trend of Tool albums containing tracks that serve to present an interesting aural experience, or to prepare the listener for the coming song. As such, this album should be listened to from start to finish, rather than skipping from song to song -- it is a holistic experience that is more than just the sum of it's parts. <br /> <br />When compared to Lateralus, there are fewer heavy moments where distorted guitar riffs and Maynard's screams take centre stage. In fact, Maynard's vocals are mixed a quieter this time round, which allows the music a little more room to shine. Rather, this album is more mellow and songs build up intensity without quite reaching the blood-pumping heaviness of songs such as Parabola. <br /> <br />The only song that I truly consider to be filler is the final track, \\"Viginti Trees\\", which is somewhat reminiscent of the \\"(-) Ions\\" from AEnema. <br /> <br />Apart from the music, the packaging is also worthy of note. The booklet is incorporated into the hardcover-like binding of the album, and stereoscopic lenses allow you to view some pretty trippy 3D images in the booklet. Sure, you're not going to buy the album for the packaging, but it is damn cool all the same. <br /> <br />In conclusion, this album is less heavy than Lateralus but follows a similar pattern of major songs and interlude tracks. It also feels a little less of a rock album (if you could call Lateralus that) and more an epic combination of complex beats and guitar/bass riffs. <br /> <br />If were going to rate this against all other Tool albums, I would only give it 4 or 4.5 stars. However, I haven't had time for this album to grow on me in the same way that Lateralus and AEnema did, and compared to the majority of music being produced this album is worthy of a 5 star rating. If you like Tool, you won't be disappointed with this album, even if you don't think it's their best.

0553801503|3.0|I love George Martin's writing style and thoroughly enjoyed the previous books in the series.  Like many, I eagerly awaited the release of this novel, the fourth in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series.  Upon release, I  locked myself away in the bedroom, looking forward to countless hours of page-turning enjoyment.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.  I don't know if I set my expectations too high, or if I was thrown off by the truncated story line (half the characters were not included and will show up in the fifth book), but this book failed to impress.   Perhaps it would be better to wait until the 5th book is published and read them together.  On the bright side, maybe my expectations will lower, and I'll enjoy the next one as much as I enjoyed the first 3.

B000000993|5.0|You shouldn't listen to the ignorant people who post here solely to bash this highly talented band (which is underrated in my opinion, not overrated). I've listened to the best rock music from all around the world: Rammstein, Mago de Oz, Noir Desir, Oomph!, Mass Hysteria, Megaherz, Indochine, etc., and Tool is one of the few American bands that I actually enjoy listening to on a continual basis. I would venture to say that, yes, good American Rock is lacking today, but this band is an exception to the rule.
0553381695|3.0|This is not a negative review. So far, The Song of Ice and Fire saga remains interesting, somewhat unpredictable and well written. However, I must state that when nothing ever seems to go right for the most likable characters, it does tend to get REALLY tiresome and REALLY frustrating after a while (especially now that I am over 1300 pages into this thing). In fact, Martin seems rather to enjoy the fact that anything planned by the \\"good guys\\" goes awry. Sure, the Starks win some victories here and there. King Robb wins a few battles, but even here Martin usually tells us about them  after the fact. We don't even get the satisfaction of reading about Robb's victories (for some reason, we don't get his POV). I have no problem with the bad guys winning sometimes. That's just reality and it allows us to understand the \\"good\\" in a more vivid perspective. But so far, this series has been a non stop descent into the evils that men do. Be prepared: At any opportunity, Martin ensures that these books are as cruel and crude as possible. If you are normal, this starts to drain you emotionally after a while. Nevertheless, I'm already reading book 3.

If you ever wanted to take off and see what life held for you, to temp fate, walk out on the edge, find your soul in the wild outdoors, this book will go right to your heart.  You will find yourself admiring then getting angry at this young man who takes chances with his life most would not give a thought to and somehow coming through until the end when he finds his plans to leave the wild checkmated by a reality he never considered. This is a haunting tale that is hard to forget, because it dredges somethings of our past we have and may never resolve about roads not taken.
B0002EXH40|5.0|This album throws at us a handful of gems, a pair of boring tracks, and a series of solid bonus tracks. The first track, Reckoning Day, is my favorite off this album. Very catchy song with lyrics that proves Megadeth isn't all about death and other such things. Train of Consequences is very catchy, but it starts to annoy me after a while, so I'd say limit your dosage on that track.<br /><br />As much as I like to appreciate the lesser known tracks off an album, there's no denying that A Tout le Monde is completely amazing. Best lyrics on the album right there. Killing Road is arguably the heaviest song on here with its opening bass and guitar work, and it is also one of the catchiest. In truth, the only two tracks I really skip often are Elysian Fields (starts good but falls apart) and Black Curtains (I always seem to tune it out when listening so I guess its just boring, though I will note it has a nice solo).<br /><br />Victory is a commercial song, but it's one of my favorites. Starts fast ends faster. Lots of solos. I feel that Youthanasia as a song is severely underrated. The drums are absolutely amazing, and who can skip it with the shredding solos?<br /><br />The bonus tracks on this one are better than on a lot of the remasters. Millennium of the Blind isn't too special, but Mustaine sounds awesome and there's a few demon-speed solos in the middle. New World Order is forgetable but still solid, and Absolution contains a riff/mini-solo that was included in the song Trust off of Cryptic Writings. The A Tout le Monde demo was surprisingly enjoyable and easily the best bonus track. Not better than the finished version but good in a different way. It has a unique solo done with some sort of woodwind instrument, and it also sounds very raw, which in my opinion is a good thing.<br /><br />Overall, a great album that all Countdown fans will enjoy. It's not a Countdown beater, but I would say it has the best vocals of any Deth album.
6305079811|5.0|Great movie, not worth the $100.00 price tag, cheaper to get a bootleg on Ebay for twelve bucks.
0440539811|5.0|The Illuminatus! Trilogy is an excellent introduction to the work of prolific writer, philosopher, social scientist, raconteur,and laid-back-funny-old-dude Robert Anton Wilson. Wilson has written eight or so works of science fiction, and numerous nonfiction works that cover a plethora of diverse subject matter. One gets a clear sense of the vast range of experience possesed by Wilson in this, his most popular work to date, written with friend and colaborator Robert Shea (R.I.P.) <br />    The book essentially follows a large ensemble of characters whose experiences bounce off of each other, all in one way or another trying to find clues to the inner workings of a vast conspiracy. That is the basic thread, but the book itself contains a nonlinear plot sequence that weaves together a story of a kooky fast paced turbulent time, a spiritual detective story, a satirical rant, a social and political statement, a page turning science fiction-epic, and a book that references, in depth, the following and more: Eastern metaphysics, 60's era social dynamics, the esoteric activities of 1930's gangsters, black magic rituals, aleister crowley, the necronomicon, psychadelic rock music, sociopathic midgets, the truth about human origins, the significance of \\"the eye in the pyramid\\" on the dollar bill, dozens of literary references to William Blake, Ezra Pound, Goethe, and dozens of others, quantum everything, texas law enforcement, new york intelligentsia, hippies, yippies, wobblies, panthers, ayn rand, christian extremeists, William Burroughs, Allen Ginsberg, black power groups, Irish immigrants, enlightened millionaire submarine piloting pirates, The Justified Ancients of Mumuu, sociopathic millionaire drug and weapons dealers, a shady Las Vegas Pimp with a potentially world destroying disease latent within him, a huge apocalyptic climaxe at a Bavarian rock festival, and a comical hippie protagonist named George Dorn who comes to terms with himself and helps save the world. If you are reasonably intelligent, young (at heart or otherwise) enough to open up to strange ideas, and wise enough to take a joke, you may enjoy this book. But a word to the faint of heart, parts are a bit sexual, gruesome, or both. I think it adds to the plot personally but after reading this book, one can understand how Bob Wilson came to be friends with George Carlin, heh. Enjoy!
B00005JO20|2.0|Granted that the special effects are fantastic and you can believe that Kong is real, this film could definitely benefit by having at least one hour cut from the running time.     Too much time is spent on the establishing story of the out of work actress in New York and also on the ship's journey to Skull Island. Yes, it is wonderful to watch Naomi Watts - beautiful and talented. But Adrian Brody is one of the most unattractive males in leading roles today. The \\"mud people\\" of Skull Island are also particularly unattractive.    The stampede of dinosaurs is extremely well done, but could easily have been more effective if the time was cut in half. Yes, the kids will love it, but it slows the story needlessly.    There is also too much footage of Miss Watts entertaining Kong and his reactions to her antics. It becomes a case of \\"let's get on with the story\\".    This film is an example of let's do it because we can, rather than do it to tell a good story. It is a case of eating too much candy and ending up sick.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|If you are a fan of either artist, you will truly love this CD. Emmylou Harris has one of the most unique-sounding voices in the entire music world. Her vocals on the poignant track: \\"If This Is Goodbye\\" are haunting.  <br />I saw the duo perform and be interviewed on Imus In the Morning on the day the CD was launched in the U.S. and Knopfler explained that the inspiration for the song were the cell phone calls from the passengers on United Flight 93 (Sept. 11th) to their loved ones, after they learned that their flight had been hijacked. When I heard this track and thought of the plight of the passengers on that flight, it brought tears to my eyes and a chill down my spine. Ms. Harris has a way with her voice that makes you feel the emotion of the song. Knopfler's guitar work on the track is as good as it gets. I think you might even hear \\"Brothers in Arms\\" in the melody. I know I did.  <br />In any event, within minutes of their performance on the Don Imus show Tuesday the 25th, I was online ordering the CD from Amazon. I have never done that before. If you haven't purchased this CD, you need to. You will not be disappointed.
B000003S0P|5.0|... I often ended my college DJing show, and sometimes the term with \\"Starless.\\"  The majesty of this track is truly unique and breathtaking. Too emotional for words: starts as a beautiful, moody, minor key lament that goes into unique one-note guitar playing over a menacing, lumbering bass line that builds to an indescribable level of tension that's finally released into a nimble jazz bit that flows into a powerful reprise of the beginning theme that packs all the power and passion of King Crimson, Mark II into a thundering crescendo.   <br /> <br />Always played at the very end of the show, because absolutely NOTHING could follow it.  A phenomenal end to a powerful album.
0393317552|4.0|In `Guns, Germs and Steel' Diamond explains why human societies have evolved the way they have.  Drawing from his impressive knowledge of the natural sciences, Diamond develops a scientific basis for why Europe was able to develop ahead of the rest of the world, and in so doing he dispels racist and nationalistic myths that claim superiority of one class or race of human over another.   The bottom line is that humans are humans, regardless of race or time period.  If given the same environmental factors, any given human society is likely to progress at the same rate as any other human society.  The reason that Europe industrialized before any other society is that it had access to a unique set of environmental/geographic variables.  African or Native American societies would have industrialized on their own if given enough time, but as it happened, they didn't have the same level of resources and connections as Europe, and thus they progressed at a much slower rate.  When European cultures eventually collided with cultures evolving more slowly, the European cultures tended to suppress the slower culture through its evolved technology, and more alarmingly, through a host of germs that the European societies had grown immune to.   <br /> <br />So the question that Diamond sets out to answer is why it was that Europeans conquered so much of the world, and not the other way around.   The answer lies mostly in Europe's proximity to the Fertile Crescent, which was blessed with a rare combination of ideal location and a disproportionate percentage of the world's plants and animals capable of being domesticated.  By location, Diamond means having both access to numerous Eurasian societies for trade and being located on an `east/west' axis.  The east/west Eurasian axis is key because it meant that domesticated food plants could be transplanted anywhere along the axis and remain in the same climate.  This is opposed to the north/south axis of the Americas and Africa where transplanted food plants would have to adapt to different climates at different latitudes before becoming productive.  Besides location, the other key factor for development is having access to both plants and animals that can be domesticated.   Surprisingly, there's only around 12 large mammal species with all the traits required to be useful to humans as livestock, and most of them originated in the Fertile Crescent region.  With the combination of crops and livestock, the Fertile Crescent was able to develop `farmer power' ahead of the rest of the world.  Farmer power allowed for development of ever increasingly complex societies with specialist who could focus on improving technology.   Western Europe and China then were able to cherry pick the Fertile Crescent's crops, livestock and technology by virtue of their proximity and the fact that they shared a common latitude for easy transplant of plants/livestock - Africa, the Americas and Australia were not so lucky.   The Fertile Crescent societies would then fall behind Europe and China due to overloading and collapse of the delicate Fertile Crescent eco-sphere.  China would eventually fall behind Europe due to a unique European geography that allowed for numerous political states to survive and compete for dominance through push-pull cycles of technology development.  <br /> <br />One of the most striking points that Diamond makes is how the germs of the Old World eviscerated the peoples of the New World.  Beyond providing the ability to develop complex societies and technology, Eurasia's farmer power also had a more insidious aspect - it provided the densities of humans and animals required for animal germs to jump to humans.  In this way, the influenza, measles, small pox, typhoid germs would rise, but the Eurasian population densities had the advantage that their peoples were able to evolve at the same time that the germs were evolving - allowing the Eurasian societies to develop immunities.  Unfortunately, whenPizarro and the other conquistadors arrived in the New World, they introduced lethal germs into Mayan and Inca populations without any form of immunities, which resulted in whole sale decimation of their populations.  Though European technology was a factor, Diamond argues that it was weakening caused by these rampant new diseases that made the Mayan, Inca and Native American empires so easy for the Europeans to conquer.     <br /> <br />The strong point of Guns, Germs and Steel is Diamond's cogent explanation of the environmental/geographic factors that control how quickly human societies evolve from hunter/gatherers to farmers.  The weak point of the book is that Diamond tends to get mired down in pedantic explanations of why all the third world countries didn't progress as fast as Europe.  He spends a lot of time explaining why New Guinea society didn't have the unique combination of environmental variables require to evolve, and then he repeats the same argument for numerous African, Australian and American societies.  Diamond was obviously trying to give equal time to all parts of the world and therefore not show any bias, but the result is large patches of the book that are very dry and somewhat difficult to read.  Really, I think he could have made his case by first describing the unique set of variables that enabled the development of the Fertile Crescent, and then just arguing that the rest of the world didn't posses these same variables and therefore fell behind.  But, never the less, I recommend Guns, Germs and Steel because it provides amazing insight into why the world has developed the way it has, something we all need to know if we really want to understand the world we live in. <br />
B00005V3Z4|4.0|Donnie Darko is a teen horror film.  In addition, it's a teen romance.  In addition, Donnie Darko is a Hamletian study in familial relationship.  The viewer never really knows whether Donnie, a brilliant high school kid is wacko or completely sane while his adult world is nutty.  I particularly liked the scenes with the lady-shrink where under hypnosis Donnie has a self-pleasuring moment.  Things can go wrong in those shrink sessions for sure. <br /> <br />There are two groups of adults here, the Democrats and the Republicans.  Dukakis is smart and thoughtful.  Bush 1 is stammering and smarmy.  The Physical Education teacher is new-age bunko, book burning, inflexible along with her idol, Patrick Swayze, as the handsome motivational speaker with one message, there's Fear and Love.  To contrast, Drew Barrymore plays the really cool young English teacher that gets canned for being too Liberal.  Donnie rebels and insists there is a world of grays out there, not black and white.  Okay, this is relativism which has it's own critics.  I'd go along with the evil Dan Quail idea if it were more developed, but good and evil in Darko is pretty cardboard. <br /> <br />I'm not at all sure why Kelly decided it was important to do a 1988 film in 2001.  You got me on that one.  There's as much political animosity and self-help gobblygook today as there was in the 80's.  I can only assume that the 80's was a crucible for the director. <br /> <br />Finally, Darko is an incredibly creative film, very interesting to watch visually as things might fall out of the sky at any moment.  Donnie walks through life in movie time, effortlessly burning down buildings while his girlfriend sleeps during a movie date.  My teen dates were never like that. <br />
0307276902|3.0|I heard of this book, as did most people- after the scandal broke. I saw the scandal unfold on CNN's Larry King Live and Anderson Cooper, I watched in amusement as Oprah phoned in and supported James Frey, it was at this point that I decided I wanted to read this piece of work. But life, happens and I failed to rush right to the store, and I forgot about it, until the next scandal broke.  <br /> <br />When Oprah denounced Frey on national TV (somehow I don't think he saw that coming) I said forget it, why bother reading it! All was forgotten until a cool spring day, I happened upon the book at a garage sale, from across the yard, I recognized the blue cover, I raced over to where it lay, after a brief struggle (apparently someone else spotted it as well) I was the victor, and for only a Dollar. <br /> <br /> I eagerly begin reading, but it didn't make for smooth reading, the language, the vulgarity of it made me put it down several times. But I trooped through to finish, and the bottom line I was under whelmed. Ok so he lied, but was Lily a believable character? What made him fall in love with her? The eyes, her addiction to crack, the fact that she was a whore, what was it? The Leonard character was off the wall, the only character that had a whiff of truth was the Miles character, maybe because he stepped forward during the scandal and gave CNN an interview.  <br /> <br />I was disgusted by all of the vomit, urine, and blood. The adventures at the Dentist, as if the dentist asks you if you have been on drugs, before they start pumping you full of stuff. Yeah right! I must admit the book did pick up near the end, I read with interest of Lily's crack adventures, and Frey's after rehab bar stop, and the back cover page. I think the message this book sends to addicts is not good- basically it says a crackwhore is a crackwhore all day long, and that immediately after rehab, stare down a $40 drink and you will be cured. I do kinda, sorta wanna read My Friend Leonard...now will I? Time will tell <br />
076792603X|5.0|This amazing tale blew me away.  I haven't read this much ever.  The book The Da Vinci Code, is a book of intelligence.  I got hooked on the book and it was very difficult knowing that I had to put it down once in a while.  That's a very rare picture that anyone would see of me.  The descriptions and suspense will make you wanting to keep reading.  I have always loved the mystery type books and this one is well worth it.  The significance of what Dan Brown brought to the reader is fascinating and though I got confused sometimes, I regained my knowledge and worked my knowledge into the book to get me on track.  His descriptions sometimes got so complex to me that it put me in the scene as if I was actually there.<br /><br /> The Da Vinci Code starts off with Robert Langdon, visited by the Judicial Police, late after midnight, in search for help in the murder of Jacques Sauniere.  Langdon gets connected with Sauniere's granddaughter, Sophie Neveu.  Sophia is part of the cryptology department and is willing to help Langdon not be wrongfully accused of the murder.  Langdon and Sophia pair up to solve the mystery of his death following the clues that Sauniere left behind, beginning with the riddle at the scene of the crime. Its Langdon and Neveu's job to keep their findings of the Grail safe.  I guarantee that this book will keep you on the edge of your seat to find out what happens next.  This is the thriller that you have to read.  The suspense is well worth it all the way to the end.  His writing is just so pure and meaningful that you are put into the mystery.  I recommend this book to everyone because it was so exciting to read.
B00004RFCM|4.0|This complete season can be watched in one afternoon. Get a bottle of merlot, and by the time the afternoon is done, you will be on the net' checking out flights to NYC. Of course since season one is so short, and most of the shows can be seen on basic cable late at night. Why not hop right into season #2. The stylists are on board, and the clothing and the outfits are sub par in this First Season, I can imagine HBO holding their breath wondering it this was going to be a hit or miss. 30 minutes is way too short for this show. Again very quick watch!
B000002UDB|5.0|Magical Mystery Tour is certainly not high on anyone's list of the Beatles' best albums - but I'm yet to see a list that doesn't include at least one song from it. Magical Mystery Tour captures the Beatles in their creative peak, and it really does contain some of their best, most innovative and groundbreaking work. Unfortunately, it lacks in one important aspect that Sgt. Pepper, Revolver and Rubber Soul all excelled in: structure and balance. That same problem will recur one year later with the white album; but while the white album is rich and varied enough to be satisfying despite its structural flaws, Magical Mystery Tour feels incomplete: it feels, more than an album, like a soundtrack that had a few singles tacked on to it so it wouldn't be too short - which is, of course, exactly what it is. <br /> <br />Ironically enough, the very reason that Magical Mystery Tour doesn't work quite as well as the white album is because the songs are so good. While the white album feels like a series of experiments, some stronger and some weaker, and is therefore exciting and dynamic, the weaker songs on Magical Mystery Tour sound like filler next to the huge, perfectly produced masterpieces that are the singles. How can excellent songs like Your Mother Should Know and Blue Jay Way - which would have felt right at home on the white album - measure up to songs like Penny Lane or I Am the Walrus? These wonderful little songs are overshadowed by the magnitude of the greater creations on the album, which makes the whole experience somewhat unsatisfying. <br /> <br />All that being said - Magical Mystery Tour is still the Beatles at their best, and several songs on the album are among the most important musical creations of the psychedelic era. The first songs that come to mind are Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane; these two were actually released as a double-A single some time before the Sgt. Pepper album, and shocked listeners as two of the most original and innovativesongs recorded at the time. Both numbers refer to the Beatles' youth in Liverpool, but the nostalgic feel has a different fragrance to it than the one on songs like In My Life; both of these songs infuse drug influences and psychedelic lyrics and instrumentation that make them dreamlike and metaphysical. John Lennon's Strawberry Fields Forever clearly demonstrates that, using a location from John's childhood as a metaphor for serenity and calm; Paul McCartney's Penny Lane on the other hand is a story, reminiscing of some of the odd characters that inhibited Paul's childhood. Both of these songs are orchestrated and produced to perfection. <br /> <br />To complete the triangle there is I Am the Walrus, which stands as my personal favorite and is one of the most brilliant and perfect songs ever recorded; it signals a creative peak for Lennon, with surreal, poetical lyrics that make references from Lewis Carroll to Batman and are among the darkest and most haunting he's ever written; John's voice is harrowingly beautiful on this song, and the instrumentation is powerful and atmospheric. Like the first two songs I've mentioned, I Am the Walrus is a perfect production number, which left a distinctive mark on rock music for the nest four decades. Only slightly weaker musically, but no less influential, are three wonderful numbers, that are among the Beatles' most important creations; All You Need Is Love is John's anthem for the love generation, and even if it doesn't stand with his best musical creations, it's beautifully orchestrated and articulates the spirit of the time better than any other songwriter could. The Fool on the Hill is a gorgeous number by Paul, not revolutionary but a completely timeless creation nonetheless. Finally, Hello Goodbye is one of the Beatles's biggest hits, and one of the catchiest, most perfect pop numbers. Hello Goodbye is musically one of the weaker songs on the album, and may have felt more at home on a different album or even just as asingle, but it's still a fantastic song. <br /> <br />Pleasure can be found in the smaller songs, too; Baby You're a Rich Man, which was the B-side to All You Need is Love, is an excellent number with great vocals and instrumentation, and rocks harder than any other track on the album. Blue Jay Way is a continuation of the style George Harrison has been working on with Love You To, Within You Without You and The Inner Light; but it's also more personal and less assuming than those three, and shows more of George's sense of humor. The opening title track serves more as an introduction than as a worthy creation by its own right, but it still delivers, as does the odd instrumental Flying. All of these tracks get somehow lost by the five massive hits that dominate the album, but are all fine songs that are worth the attention. <br /> <br />So - although most of the best tracks on Magical Mystery Tour are also on the Blue album (1967-1970) - and it's no accident that this album has more songs on the greatest hits collection than any other in the Beatles catalogue - it's still an essential by itself, certainly for Beatles fans and also for any music lover - even if it's not among the first Beatles albums you should buy. The Magical Mystery Tour is dying to take you away, dying to take you away...
1400032717|5.0|Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is an amazing book.  The diary quality of writing was refreshing and easy to read, but definitely not poorly written. <br />I was able to relate to Christopher as my brother has a mild case of autism, and reading through a different thought pattern was very interesting.  Haddon pulled off the boy very well.  Christopher did not seem fake or contrived in any way.  Haddon created a very real and thoughtful character that everyone can relate to. <br />I would strongly recommend this book to anyone.  Seeing the world through the eyes of someone different is something that everyone should try.
B00062IVKS|5.0|Actor Robert DeNiro and director Martin Scorcese portray heavyweight champion Jake LaMotta as a man consumed by his fear of women, the vulnerability they can instill in him, and the ferocity of his resulting rage.  He uses the boxing ring as an arena for expressing that rage and, occasionally, atoning for his sins.  This extraordinary film shows us how an inarticulate brute makes a shambles of his life but reaches a degree of self-awareness that redeems him.  The final sequences, in which we see him making his living by reciting from literature before small audiences, have a kind of squalid sadness to them but also a quiet dignity.  A man who once lived by his fists and animal instincts alone now makes his living with his mind, and we can sense that he has learned the value of patience and forgiveness.
0783229372|4.0|This film got rocked by the reviewers at it release but actually the photography and snippets of acting and the special effects are really quite good. I think George C. Scott was a superb actor, a little miscast here as Colonel Franz Ritter (a great Luftwaffe pilot forced to do intelligence here for the Nazi SS - never really explained). But Scott is a quality professional given a mediocre script to work with.<br /><br />The filming (I think those are the LTA hangars at El Toro [Tustin] and Alameda) is really quite well done. I found the change of venue from Milwaukee to Washington to Frankfurt to the flight deck to be not necessarily seamless but still following a logical course. And the New York cops and Feebies are great.<br /><br />The trouble is that there was no real chemistry to the actors. Patton. . . whoops, Scott and Bancroft and Atherton and Durning say the right words but I was waiting (then and now) for something more visceral.<br /><br />The second problem is that the goal seems confused as to whether it is going to be an old time police procedural or a disaster movie. I suppose it could be both but it didn't come across well here.<br /><br />Which leads to the final overwhelming difficulty. You know, even if you've never heard of N.A.S. Lakehurst, the rise of the Third Reich, or zeppelins, what's going to happen. IT'S ON THE COVER OF THE DVD. So that takes some of the wind out of your sails . . . errrr, flammable hydrogen out of your zeppelin.<br /><br />I thought the filming was excellent; the special effects equally good; everything else? Mediocre. 4 generous stars. Larry Scantlebury
B00005JOVH|5.0|People really should not write a review on a movie that has not come out yet. <br /> <br />From the previews and based on the fact that the director is a huge comic book; x-men; fan, I think it might be alright.
B000002MTR|5.0|I haven't read all of the reviews concerning this album from this website (or anywhere else, for that matter), but I have taken notice that a lot of people don't tend to favor this one in comparison to the rest of RHCP's collection, which begs me to ask: WHY?!?!!  <br /> <br />Despite One Hot Minute being Dave Navarro's only album with the Peppers, I found he fit in perfectly, for the lack of a better word. The guitars are layered and diverse; sometimes taking the forefront and driving songs such as Warped, Coffee Shop, and Shallow Be Thy Game (three of the hardest-rocking tracks on the album), whereas other songs like Aeroplane, Walkabout, and the psychedelic, seemingly drug-induced swirl of Falling Into Grace feature just how well Navarro can intensify the sounds and moods of the accompanying instruments.  <br /> <br />Of course, I need not speak of the placement of Kiedis, Flea, and Smith in the band as they each have been and always will be the heart and soul of RHCP. <br /> <br />To say that \\"band chemistry here isn't quite up to past standards\\", is honestly ridiculous. As far as I'm concerned, this is by far THE BEST Red Hot Chili Peppers album ever to be released. Don't get my wrong, Blood Sugar Sex Majik had its share of unforgettable singles, but the gang was still in the process of developing their own unique sound and, in my opinion, fell short of producing an album that had more to offer than JUST their singles. I can't say I'm a fan of anything post-One Hot Minute, so I won't even comment on any of it, but I will say that none of what I've heard of their newer stuff even compares to the overall amazing craftsmanship that went into One Hot Minute.  <br /> <br />Eh...I think that's all I feel like typing now, so to end - BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale is shocking to see in this film about a man who is skeleton-thin and sleepless due to mysterious causes.  As his character Trevor explores the strange goings-on that threaten to close in around him, the viewer is inexorably drawn in and dragged along.  Thankfully, this film has a satisfying ending which explains a lot of what went before.  The Machinist is startling and well-crafted movie.
B00005A1PR|5.0|Her silky, soulful voice, her guitar playing, the catchy melodies and lyrics, the arrangements - this CD has it all! India.Arie is an incredibly musically gifted spirit. My review cannot give the just praise this muscial genious deserves so I urge the reader to purchase this CD now. This CD is a must in anyone's music library.
B00022M518|5.0|This is my hands down favorite Eno record. A wild concoction mixing glam, art-rock, doo-wop, film scores, krautrock and found noises into a brilliant stew. <br />When I first heard this on LP in 1979, I was a huge Roxy Music fan and this blew my mind. A radical summation of the first 2 Roxy LP's taken to their logical extremes. <br />For the first 10-15 years of listening to it I tended to prefer side 1. I now find that the (now) second half of the CD is really where the pay-off lies.  <br />A classic. <br />And a great remaster too!
0743487486|5.0|This book does an excellent job of addressing some of the key problems with the \\"traditional\\" parenting methods of rewards, praise, time outs, etc.<br /><br />Since most of the reviewers here have summed up what the book is about, I will mention the key points that stood out to me.<br /><br />I liked how he showed the long term effects of traditional parenting methods. I was raised this way and I can clearly see how the \\"carrot & stick\\" mentality had an affect on me.<br /><br />Since I want my children to grow up to be confident, self assured, balanced and loving, I have incorporated Alfie Kohn's methods into my parenting. I only wish my parents had done it for me!
1400062071|3.0|this is a lovely book. but a little too lovely. in the end, all wounds are healed, or healing. The Minister is an engrossing character, believable and sympathetic.  There are several other characters whom Strout develops nicely. Her fictional world is alive and credible.  But it's a bit too Hallmark-like in the end. All the loose ends are resolved too hopefully. And, although the novel is absorbing, you want something more dramatic to occur than ever does. It felt anti-climactic finally; Strout can write, no doubt about it.  she's a beautiful writer.  A lovely writer.  Maybe a little too lovely.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|I dont understand how Brian Molko and crew manage to create something so unique, so sonically perfect each time they release an album, all the songs in Meds are top notch, Infra Red, Drag, Space Monkey and Pierrot the Clown are the cream of the crop here, followed closely by rest, I have been a fan of placebo since their debut in 1996 and each time the release an album it baffles me how they can write something so different from the previous offering, but keeping the PlaCebo effect intact... Brian Molko's wonderful voice sounds as good as ever, this clearly shows a more mature Molko, the lyrics are less intricate than previous albums but pure genious regardless, put on your headphones take your meds and be free!.
B00005B36H|3.0|id like to start off saying im a tool fan and i 2mrrw is the realease of 10,000 days and i will go out and buy it. to tell you the truth though im not 2 exited bc i fear it will be another lateralus. lateralus has a few good songs but also some songs towards the end which are just flat out boring as hell, and they all sound the same. MJK is a amazing singer/lyricist, danny carey i dont know were 2 start hes just a amazing drummer, and justin chancellor a great bassist this band is full of talent but unfortunaltly adam jones is the one holding them back. Adam jones i think most guitarist would agree with me is a very medicore guitarist for such a big band. He is the king of milking riffs thus why all of tool's songs sound alot alike. he is obssesed with barre chords, and yes he does stray from that a little on this album but not to much. tool could have accomplished so much more if he had just been a rythem guitarist with some1 who could actually play being lead. i think most would agree with me ive never heard a song of his were i just go wow that is really cool, except \\"schism\\" which is a very cool song((watch there be 3 songs that sound like it on 10,000 days)) but to some it up tool is a great band minus adam jones and this is a good cd but nothing 2 special i would highly recomment aenima which i think is the best cd and their great cds are opiate-aenima then the rest is kind of boring. as a side note i recomment to try out a perfect circle they are a great band WITHOUT adam jones at guitar, and yes they would be better if they had danny carey but nonethe less dare i say it the are better than tool
B000002G23|5.0|Message In a Box is a 4 disc, 78 track anthology of all the Police's recorded studio work and a handful of live songs.  Its title is a bit deceiving because it's not in a \\"box\\" at all; rather, it is a book or gatefold-style set.  Also found in the gatefold is an attached booklet of color photos, a history of the band's career, a complete discography (with photos of all their releases) and, most interestingly, the stories behind the band's \\"B-Sides and other Obscure Releases,\\" as told by Sting, Stewart and Andy.<br /><br />The songs are more or less in sequence of release or their order on each respective Police album.  Because of the volume of songs, the ordering's not perfect.  The Regatta De Blanc album straddles discs one and two.  It's a minor complaint - if a complaint at all - and is offset by all the cool added material.<br /><br />The highlight of the set is really all the \\"B-sides and other obscure releases\\".  A few of those are better than tracks that found their way onto albums.  A true Police fan will want this set just for those songs.  If you like the Police enough to buy all their stuff, you're better off buying this set instead of their 5 studio albums separately.  It'll save you a few bucks.<br /><br />The sound quality is good; there are certainly no glaring quality issues.  As for the music, it's incredible!  The Police are one of the best bands ever and are truly underappreciated.  Their blend of reggae, ska, punk,  rock and new wave sounds was quite astounding, even during the creative surge in pop music in the late 70's, early 80's.<br /><br />I have hundreds of CD's but Message in a Box is, without question, in my top 10.

B00008DDHZ|5.0|Bloody Sunday is one of the most emotionally powerful movies of the last 20 years.  There are a lot of films that touch on some aspect or events of \\"The Troubles\\" in Northern Ireland, but Bloody Sunday is, far and away, the best of them all.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  James Nesbitt, as Ivan Cooper, the protestant MP and civil rights activist, gives an Oscar-caliber performance.  Regrettably, films like this get almost no attention from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences or other similar groups.  The cast around him all perform impeccably.<br /><br />Movies of this kind tend to romanticize or glorify the fallen. The writers and producers of this movie honored the dead without making them martyrs or without a sort of too-sweet sentimentality.  The suffering of the victims' families is real and raw, their losses very palpable and human.<br /><br />What makes the emotional impact so tremendous is the realism of the cinemetagrophy and dialog.  The attacks by British Paratroopers on the civil rights marchers feel real, terrifying.  Many of shots were made with hand-held cameras, so the viewer feels as if he/she is right in the middle of the event.  There is not a silly, superfluous, corny or overly-dramatic bit of dialog in the film.  The screams, the cries, the conversations, the speeches, etc., all are what you would expect to hear in or around an event like this.<br /><br />Critics might argue that the film is not balanced, that it portrays the British military in a bad light.  It's true that the British Paras are clearly the \\"bad guys,\\" but over 30 years of information-gathering about this dreadful event has strongly tended to show that the soldiers were primarily to blame for \\"Bloody Sunday.\\"  If you have issues with the objectivity of the film, perhaps those concerns should be addressed to the scores of historical (eyewitness, expert reconstruction) accounts on which the movie is based.<br /><br />Nothing entertaining or light-hearted or uplifting is to be found in Bloody Sunday.  It's dark, sad, even angering.  But you'll not find too many other films as gripping and meaningful as this.It's dark, sad, even angering.

0441172717|5.0|What a masterpiece!  Dune, officially known as Arrakis, is a desert planet with the most important natural resource in the universe.  It is into this atmosphere that the ancient feud of the Harkonen and Atreides families is finally settled. <br /> <br />Paul Atreides was the child who was not supposed to be.  His mother is a member of a religious order who was ordered to give birth to a girl child, not a boy.  This boy would change the course of the universe. <br /> <br />This book is so well written, you can actually sense that you have walked through the sand, worn a stillsuit, and met Paul-Muad'Dib.  In a genre that is often marked with less then steller character development, you feel that you know each and everyone of the characters and what they are feeling. <br /> <br />This is but the first of a six book epic series of the Atreides Dynasty, this one ending with Paul's defeat of all of his enemies on Dune, including the emperor. <br /> <br />Absolutely masterful.
B00062RCBW|5.0|This show is arguably my favorite TV show series. The first two seasons do have some cheesy effects, but buy the 3rd and 4th season, the special effects hold up today. I loved this show when it first aired back in late 80's and early 90's, and only rediscovered how good the series was by watching the reruns that are again on cable TV. Don't make the mistake I did and think that you'll just buy one or two seasons and be satisfied. Once you buy one you can't stop. It's better to just buy the entire series and save yourself over a $100 if you buy them separately.  However, if you insist on buying separate I would rate the best seasons in this order: <br /> <br />1) Season 6-Best episodes(Tapestry, Relics, Chain of Command 1&2, Descent part1 ) <br />2) Season 4 -Best episodes(Best of both words part 2, Legacy, Redemption part 1) <br />3) Season 5 -Best episodes(Redemption part 2, The Inner Light, Unification 1&2) <br />4) Season 3 -Best episodes(Yesterdays Enterprise, Deja Q, Best of both worlds part1) <br />5) Season 1 -Best episodes(The Big goodbye, Naked now, The battle) <br />6) Season 2 -Best episodes(Peak Performance, Q Who, A Matter of Honor) <br />7) Season 7 -Best episodes(All Good things part 1 &2, Descent part 2) <br /> <br />I believe season 6 has a constant flow of really good episodes, especially the deep and emotional stories of \\"Tapestry\\" and \\"Chain of Command\\". Seasons 4 and 5 are really a tie, but season 4 gets a slight edge because the lack of a Q episode in season 5, and the way Tasha's sister fills out that jumpsuit in the episode\\"Legacy\\" in season 4.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|I was so excited to watch this film... The 3 Academy Awards it won, the love story, the gorgeous mountain scenery, the incredible acting.  BUZZZZZZ. I don't think so! I'm a hopeless romantic and found this movie TERRIBLE! The movie was slow. The acting wasn't that great, with the exception of Michelle Williams, who was outstanding. There wasn't enough of a buildup to make the first, very graphic encounter believable. I think that scene was way over the top and was in it for Hollywood shock value. As for the musical score, it was the same 8-10 notes over and over again. Although I'm straight, I absolutely see nothing wrong with not being straight, whether bi or gay, which I'm sure that's what some of you might think. I truly think the only reason this won awards was because it was so out there... no matter how bad the movie was.  I continue to be Heath and Jake's fan, but not from this one!  But having watched this, that is two hours of my life I can't get back. What a shame! I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Kudos to the creators of this film for being able to take a taboo subject and present it in such an entertaining and even sweet way.     <br />Credit has to also go to Spader and Gyllenhaal.  They helped make characters that would normally be despicable or pathetic and made them actually very appealing.  If this love is wrong then I don't want to be right.

B000BJ7BCK|3.0|High school coming-of-age comedy drama has several known rules - the `loser' type boy who just cannot fit in the school life; bullying students or teachers; geeky friends of him; one ice queen-like beauty (always blonde); and sudden change of life that comes to him. Now, subvert these rules and add to them the formula of super heroes and super heroines, and what do you get? Is it `Spider-man'? Or `X-Men'? <br /> <br />No, it is `Sky High.' Disney's recent attempt to make a family picture out of these familiar materials should have been done several years eariler. The story may not be totally stale, but some may think so after watching two `Spider-man' films. True, `Sky High' provides some amusing moments, but the story of an underdog who becomes a super-hero is far from new and original, and the character of Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano) who enters Sky High, a secret academy hovering in the air, specially made for the students with potential super powers, could have been more interesting if we had not known `X-Men.'  <br /> <br />Anyway, at Sky High all the new students have to be in coveted `Heroes' class or despised `Sidekick' class. In spite of the fact Will's parents are famous and respected superdaddy and supermom `The Commander' and `JetStream' (played by Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston), Will himself cannot prove anything before the mean-spirited Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), and he goes to the sidekick class. From this point on, `Sky High' becomes mostly a mildly entertaining, but still predictable and forgettable drama. <br /> <br />Some comic fans might enjoy watching the film, spotting references to the genre. I am not a big fan of comic books, so I couldn't help feeling that the film, of which sole purpose seems to keep amusing us, is only running its course automatically, wasting every good opportunity to give it originality. In fact, the `super' powers of the cardboard students, Heroes or Sidekicks alike, are not particularly impressive (or weird,campy, whatever) enough, and their acting is not remarkable either. Give me `The Mystery Men' and you know their strange abilities are much more attractive though equally useless. <br /> <br />I watched `Sky High' simply because I liked the idea of Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston especially the latter as Super Man- and Wonder Woman-like figures (and don't miss the cameo of Lynda Carter). Strangely Russell's role as Will's daddy is slightly too serious (even he is parodying the accepted hero image), and his good comic timing is lost or undermined by the director's inept and derivative storytelling. Kelly Preston has been doing many thankless roles these days, but even in `Jack Frost' she was allowed to show more what she really can do. <br /> <br />Though the film is not without merits, my overall impression is that it is just another OK film from one of the studios with long history trying to catch up with the recent trend set up by the more powerful and imaginative creators -- like the people at Pixar who gave us impeccable `The Incredibles.'

B000E6ESL2|4.0|\\"Stay\\" is a strange movie with a feeling of dark unreality about it.  Occupying an unusual place in the crossroads of horror, drama, metaphysical and thriller territory, the most basic description of its plot would be that it's about a psychiatrist (played by Ewan McGregor) trying to prevent one of his patients (Ryan Gosling) from committing suicide, and finding out along the way that the patient may possess some kind of supernatural attributes.  But it gets a lot weirder, more baffling even, as it goes along.  The initial glimpes of possible paranormal powers - like an unerring ability to make predictions about the future - and hints that Gosling may have committed some kind of crime in his past, give way to more difficult-to-quantify phenomena, as MacGregor finds the whole world around him turning into an unfamiliar place in which the rules of time and space no longer seem to apply.  If this is one you were thinking of getting but have heard one of the spoiler reviews that give away the ending, I'd urge you not to forego it for that reason.  For one thing, there's a lot of little things in the undercurrent - including right toward the end - that imply the 'resolutions' may not be as cut-and-dried as they seem at first glance.  Like 'Dark Water' and 'Mute Witness', this is one you really have to pay close attention to to catch all the little nuances. <br /> <br />  I just saw this one very recently so it's not like I'm going to rewatch it in the next week, but it's one I would like to see again in the next few months.  There are a lot of things that I think are going to be interesting to observe with hindsight, and I think that quite a few viewers may end up feeling the same way.

0440419514|1.0|Fascinating book inappropriately marketed to children.<br /><br />Pro:<br /><br />Philip Pullman shows glimmers of brilliance as a writer. His characters are engaging, his worlds are vivid, his prose is delightful at times, and he occasionally produces lush and beautifully drawn descriptive paragraphs. His \\"science\\" is goofy but inventive, and without it his story couldn't work. He also demonstrates a good understanding of what appeals to an adolescent reader. I enjoyed the first volume, though my interest plateaued in the second volume and dropped like a stone in the third.<br /><br />Con:<br /><br />Philip Pullman is one of a growing group of authors who market their own controversial adult ideas and themes as juvenile fiction/fantasy. While I affirm his right to have, and to express his view of the world, Mr. Pullman's method of garnering an uncritical and captive audience for his message is despicable. Pullman is a skillful and sometimes powerful writer who understands his audience well; sadly he uses that skill and knowledge to entice, seduce, and manipulate the immature reader.<br /><br />Here is a summary of how the Pullman method works:<br /><br />The Golden Compass is a compelling action adventure of a young, smart, defiant, and spirited pre-adolescent (12-year old) girl. There are dark characters, ugly episodes and wicked happenings in this volume, but spunky Lyra is up to the challenge. And, she has cool friends (noble gypsies and armored bears, among others) to help her.<br /><br />In The Subtle Knife we meet Lyra's male counterpart Will. By the end of this also dark and rather convoluted part of the story we like Will a lot, too. And we hate the bad guys, although sometimes it's hard to tell just who the bad guys are. Will finds himself possessing a knife that only he can use; a knife that allows him to open windows into other, sometimes parallel, worlds.<br /><br />Now that Mr. Pullman has set his stage (and the child has a significant investment in the story), he force-feeds the unsuspecting reader his world view in The Amber Spyglass. Yes, there is some foreshadowing of what's coming in the first volumes, but until we get to the third volume we keep hoping that these are literary red herrings thrown in just to keep us off balance. Alas, no such luck.<br /><br />In short order Mr. Pullman informs us that:<br /><br />- The God of Judaism and Christianity is a fake, a liar, a dictatorial despot, a draconian authoritarian intent on making everybody miserable. Mr. Pullman's definition of \\"god, the Creator, the Lord, Yahweh, El, Adonai, the King, the Father the Almighty\\" is that he is the source of everything that's wrong with the world.<br /><br />- The church is run by self-serving, power-hungry dupes and mercenaries who ensure God's tyranny is carried out. Everyone else of faith is a discounted as a closed-minded simpleton who wouldn't know what to do without being told.<br /><br />- The health of this world and all of Pullman's \\"billions and billions\\" of other worlds is dependent on invisible, sentient dust, reminiscent of the Mitichlorians behind The Force of Star Wars lore. This dust is the product of man's gaining wisdom, a \\"natural\\" process that Pullman places in direct opposition to man's knowledge of God.<br /><br />- The \\"good guys\\" in this world are the secular naturalists, the amoral, the animals, the witches, and the rebellious angels who have set out to help overthrow and destroy God, and<br /><br />- Elite, self-actualized young men and women of character (like the reader, of course) possess the power to destroy God, and should destroy God because, after all, it's the right thing to do. With the assurance of Lyra's and Will's feelings that if we do destroy God then all will be well with the world and we will be happy.<br /><br />Harry Potter, meet Bertrand Russell and Ayn Rand. And don't forget Jean Genet, for flavor.<br /><br />Along the way Pullman gives lectures on:<br /><br />- The moral relativism of infanticide (it's bad to kill children if you are aligned with God, but its O.K. to kill children when necessary to further a \\"good\\" cause (i.e. deposing God, or whatever)),<br /><br />- The nature of homosexuality (though angels are nonphysical spirit beings that doesn't prevent them from being, and stereotypically behaving like, homosexuals), and<br /><br />- The pervasiveness of the supernatural (pretty much all of us have some kind of \\"spirit being/guide\\" counterpart that can help us do magical things, assuming we are just \\"special\\" enough, by virtue of birth and fate, to tap into this other self)<br /><br />In other words, Pullman uses the first two books to build a platform from which to deliver his elitist-humanist/post-modern/New Age message.<br /><br />There are several passages in the volumes when Lyra or Will actually ask a tough question (What happens when we die? Where do we go? Why are we here?). To these questions a more mature, more worldly adult character always sagely answers: \\"it's not time for you to know that now.\\" Pullman glosses over his answers to these questions as he finishes his story. As it turns out, Mr. Pullman subscribes to the philosophy of despair: we have no purpose other than to do what we think best, and when we die we're just dead. End of story. Which is fine from Pullman's perspective because with God in power Mr. Pullman's future is likely to be, well . . . . . Hell.<br /><br />Spoiler Warning (though if you are a parent you will definitely want to know this): The long-anticipated climax of this 1,200-page book never materializes. In the end, it turns out that destroying God isn't such a big thing after all, and certainly doesn't solve all of the worlds' problems. Only when God is gone does Pullman come clean that the real reason the worlds are dying is because of what men have done to the universe, and now the children will have to devote their lives to fixing the mess. In this unexpected extension of the story, Pullman now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy. Pullman omits a clinical account of what happens that afternoon, but whatever it is, it is magic: suddenly the relentless decay in the worlds is halted. Does this make any sense? No. But it helps to tie off a major loose end in the story, and provides Pullman a way to repeat an earlier theme to his young readers: that without God we are free to engage in sex without any restraint or guilt. Because with the death of God we are now free to be our own God. We can define our own morality, or lack of it, constrained only by what an open-minded society sets as limits in the new Republic of Heaven.<br /><br />Once finished with the books I went online; perhaps I was reading too much into this children's book. I wasn't surprised by what I learned.<br /><br />Mr. Pullman:<br /><br />- Is a self-described atheist.<br /><br />- Is listed as a member of the British Humanist Association (the goal of which is \\"an end to the privileged position of religion in law, education, broadcasting and wherever else it occurs\\")<br /><br />- Is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society (The society campaigns for: 1) the disestablishment of the Church of England, 2) the withdrawal of state subsidies to religious schools, 3) the end of tax exemptions for churches, 4) the abolition of the blasphemy law, 5) an end to the public funding of chaplains in prisons, hospitals and the armed services)<br /><br />Is His Dark Materials simply the anti-Narnia tome that Pullman says he set out to write? Perhaps. C. S. Lewis' Narnia stories are allegories of good and evil, principles and the lack of them, the nature of man and the nature of God, love, forgiveness, sacrifice, pride and humility. Pullman offers nothing more than shades of evil, ego, and seduction; God is dead, and man has no need for forgiveness, for Pullman's superman is intrinsically good and there is nothing to forgive. On the other hand, one could argue Pullman simply has a vendetta against God in general and against the Church of England in particular, and uses a book marketed at children to further his goal of revenge.<br /><br />In interviews, Mr. Pullman has claimed neither he nor his book is anti-religious. This is as an odd and dishonest position to take; akin to as if Lewis had said his Chronicles of Narnia has nothing to do with Christianity. True, Pullman is careful not to say anything about Allah in his primer on atheism, but one suspects that this Englishman's reason for the omission has somewhat more to do with cowardice and less to do with tolerance. Pullman assumes that in a politically correct publishing world he can get away with being anti-Semitic and anti-Christian. Leaving one to wonder: if a public speaker boldly and loudly teaches that the Judeo-Christian faith is responsible for all that is wrong and hurtful and evil in the world, and that the only way to solve the problem is to destroy what it stands for (and destroy most of the believers in the process), what more is necessary to classify the ranting as hate speech? If the speaker substituted any other group (Muslims, homosexuals, persons of color) in the sentence above, would society be so tolerant?<br /><br />His Dark Materials is unabashed humanist propaganda written to delight a child's mind. But just as devious is the way the author chooses to misrepresent faith. Mr. Pullman uses the traditional images, phrases, words, and symbols of the Jewish and Christian faiths in his book, but infuses his own meanings into them to twist them into serving his purpose. He trusts that his target audience doesn't know enough to spot his deceptions, or is insecure enough to accept his definitions as plausible. Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.<br /><br />While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience. An audience better served listening to another voice.now has our two (now newly adolescent) heroes take a big step in repairing the world by falling in love, immediately followed by a carefree afternoon of sensual intimacy.

Further, he makes several outrageous and false claims in the process; at one point Pullman casually purports Calvin to be an advocate for child killing, as if there were some documented and widely recognized historical basis for his comment. Just speculation on my part, but perhaps Mr. Pullman does these things and says these things because he assumes few will ever call him on them. And that if he tells his lies enough times in enough ways, the populace he so despises will eventually repeat his mantra as truth.  <br /> <br />While I cannot respect Mr. Pullman's condemnation of those who are aware of an authority higher than themselves, I could advocate a discussion of his thoughts on the subject if I believed he actually understood what he was talking about. Unfortunately, his own stunted and malignant grasp of the world view he opposes appears to have atrophied at about the age of his target audience. An audience better served listening to another voice.  <br />
B0007LXPBI|5.0|Lindsay lohan is very cute in this picture. Only an actress with this kind of talent can play two twins. Ohh, yeah. I think that if Disney would be alive, he would never would have made the ''oldie'' version. I think it's hot!! The parents are funny. They know they luv eachother, except their shy.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The height of Russell Crowe's acting - everyone's acting for that matter, is literally unbelievable - as was the production and every aspect of it.
B00005NNMJ|5.0|One of The quintessential albums in heavy metal history; if dictionaries had sound clips a good aguement could be made that the entry for heavy metal should come with a good excerpt for any track off \\"Balls To The Wall\\".  To the non-metal fan, dubbing a CD a quintessential metal album might suggest a narrowness, while nothing could be further from the truth.  While many bands have made excellent albums by crossing metal with some more mainstream, somewhat more 'accessible' form of music, a listen to this disc shows a good deal of the diversity and an overwhelming proof of the power and class pure metal is capable of.  A comparison between the first and last studio tracks - the 'Balls To The Wall' title track and 'Winterdreams' - shows right there an astonishing range.  The sound is huge without it having goteen beyond the range of the band to control and mold it; it moves at both blazing speeds and in more subdued, almost ballad-esque paces but is never too fast or too slow; it mixes fun/wondefully outrageous tracks like 'Head Over Heels' with politically/socially charged songs like its title track without the different tones seeming in the slightest bit out of place on the same album as one another.  The two sexually-charged tracks, 'Head Over Heels' and 'Turn Me On' sizzle with a powerful eroticism without coming off sleazy or cheap (even With the totally over-the-top shock-style lyrics in 'Head Over Heels'), a feat relatively few male-fronted metal or rock bands can manage on a consistent basis. <br /> <br />  Earlier Accept was good, but putting the band's manager Deaffy at the head of the lyrics-writing efforts was a tremendous move; she proved to be one of the most gifted songwriters ever on this album.  There are a number of bands out there who have everything going musically and vocally but could really use someone like this to help kick their writing up a notch to that level of greatness.  Not for note perfect, and with every track a classic (including 'Fight It Back' featuring Udo Dirkschneider's most banshee-ish vocal performance ever, which is saying quite a lot right there) and two great bonus tracks - live versions of 'Head Over Heels' and 'Love Child' recorded in Japan - \\"Balls To The Wall\\" is an essential classic.
B00003CXBH|5.0|I simply want to echo everyone here who loves this movie.  It, like any great work of art, is deliciously fecund, rewarding repeated viewings generously.<br /><br />This movie makes the 18th century vivid and real.  You never once feel you are watching a costume drama, as so often is the case with other historical films.  It envelopes you effortlessly in its world, making it feel very contemporary and relevant.<br /><br />The cast is, of course, legendary- Irons & DeNiro are laser spot on, as always.<br /><br />It is the supporting cast that truly seals the deal, though:<br /><br />Charles Low as the cruel, venal & avaricious representative of the Spanish crown Don Cabeza; and Ronald Pickup as the cool, humane & sardonic rep of the Portuguese crown are both extraordinary.  As is Ray McAnally who plays Cardinal Altamirano the papal legate.  Liam Neeson is great as one of the subordinate Jesuits; and Aidan Quinn rocks as the DeNiro character's tragic, love-lorn younger brother Felipe.<br /><br />But it's the Columbian Native Americans recruited to play the Guarani that really steal the show.  They - virtually all untrained actors - are unbelievably good.<br /><br />As a special, added pleasure the legendary Fr. Daniel Berrigan, an actual Jesuit, plays a cameo as one of the Jesuit brothers initially attached to the mission.  He is of course famous - some  would say notorious - for his antiwar and social justice work.<br /><br />Also, the music in this movie is simply gorgeous.  The score is by Ennio Morricone, and is one of the most wonderful I have ever heard. It is a fusion - Song putatively by the native Americans in the movie, accompanied primarily by wind instruments and percussion, in a entrancing, haunting fashion.  I'd recommend buying the soundtrack.<br /><br />The Mission won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and an Academy Award for its cinematography.  It also was nominated for five other Oscars and the Golden Globe for Best Picture.  So even the glitterati liked this film, if that's any recommendation.<br /><br />Finally, the themes of this film are universal, but particularly pertinent to Catholics and others of faith who are called to evangelize the world and succor the poor and disenfranchised.  Questions of the meaning of authority, obedience, justice, mercy, the morality of violence, true faith and charity are all raised and plumbed here, and anyone watching this film will be enlarged for it, I think.  I've used this film several times in as a teacher & catechist, always to great effect.<br /><br />So go watch this movie if you haven't yet.lly, the themes of this film are universal, but particularly pertinent to Catholics and others of faith who are called to evangelize the world and succor the poor and disenfranchised.

B000B5IPDI|5.0|Big Fish is a film for everyone, from little children to grown adults for not only is it loud and colorful and very entertaining, but it touches upon the very fabric of human relations, and what better fabric to touch on but the bond between father and son.  Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) is dieing, and it's becuase of this, and because of this only, that his son William (Crudup) returns home with his pregnant wife (7 months to the day).  William has no relationship with his father, mostly because he has a misconstrued perseption of who his father really is.  All he has in memory of his father are the 'tall tales' he told him as a child.  Theres a fundamental truth that runs throughout this film, and it's that as children sometimes we take our parents for granted, we assume the worst, and worse yet, when we don't understand them or don't want to understand them we can write them off completly.  As William finds out through the recollection with his fathers stories, not everything he knows is a lie and his idea of who is father is couldn't be further from the truth.  Albert Finney gives a brilliant performance, as does Ewan McGregor who plays Edward in flashbacks of his younger years.  As much a fairytale this film may be, it's not that far from reality.  A sweet and endearing film, truly exrtaordinary!

0316172324|2.0|I bought the book before a flight after reading the adulatory comments on the front and back. <br /> <br />It started well, with the premise that the subconsious forms a conclusion long before the consious mind is aware of it. I suppose it is obvious, but he makes the point well. <br /> <br />From there things get a bit lost. Reading along I soon realised that I was nearing the end and the number of pages left for a profound and all-encompassing conclusion was rapidly diminishing. <br /> <br />Unfortunately it never came. <br /> <br />This is a very short book which promises much but delivers little. I hope that the author will follow up with something more worthy of the title. It is really just a collection of true stories, mostly about racial or sexual prejudice, which leave a bad taste in the mouth. Each story is drawn out as well, a little like the History Channel. <br /> <br />I'm sure that there is a good book somewhere in this subject matter, but I can't for the life of me reconcile the reviews that this book has received (Compelling, Astonishing, Brilliant) with my experience. Maybe they only read the first chapter. Maybe I missing something. <br /> <br />Since reading this book I have been looking around and found this one: <br /> <br />The Genie Within: Your Subconcious Mind, how It Works And How To Use It (Paperback)  <br /> <br />Maybe this would be a better choice for this subject matter.
B000001EKX|4.0|\\"Hotter Than Hell\\" is a prime example of an album whose songs fit together so well, and compliment each other so well, that the album as a whole exceeds the sum of its parts.  'Coming Home', 'Going Blind' and the title track would certainly stand out in any format they were heard on - randomly on a radio, on a compilation, etc. - but tracks like 'Got To Choose' or 'Watching You', heard in isolation, would be good but nothing special (in my opinion).  This is in contrast to KISS albums like \\"Rock And Roll Over\\" or \\"Asylum\\" where pretty well everything would come off fantastic wherever it was.  But in the context of listening to this disc as a whole, 'Got To Choose', 'Watching You', et al. come off far better, especially after a repeated number of listenings.  The flow of the album just pulls everything from the greatest to the comparitively weaker songs up anywhere from one to several notches.  'All The Way', with some of the most inherently flawed of KISS lyrics, remains the only possible chink in the armor, but even that one isn't a Bad listen.  I agree with the reviewer who said that the production sounds far more unique than weak, and I too think the very unusual sound helps the album.  Different sounds come in on the album precisely where they're needed - the tremendous and bizarre basswork of 'Parasite' dominating the second track (not the first where it would have left an impression that similar sounds were to follow in the album, but right on second where it's best poised to say 'expect the unexpected'); the fast, hard-rocking 'Let Me Go Rock'N'Roll' coming in right after two slower tracks before there's even a hint of the disc starting fall into a trend of all slower or midtempo songs; and the only Peter Criss-fronted track of the album, 'Mainline' holding off until almost the end to give it an eclectic burst that's off the beaten track just a bit from most of KISS's material, the way Criss's songs usually do.  Not the best KISS release ever but a great album, with some fine tracks that often get overlooked.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|Wow. Much of this version is so well done! A much superior film to the Jessica Lange version of the 70s. The horrific tribe that abducts Ann Darrow. The raw trerror and power that Kong exudes. The jaw dropping dangers of the prehistroric Island. Jack Black's ambitious, manipulative movie producer is perfect.<br /><br />Alas, there are weaknesses as well. (Spoiler alerts): Kong battles large T-Rex style dinosaurs, as he holds Ann in alternative hand and foot grabs. C'mon... the woman would be inadvertently crushed during such a combat! How much more believable would it had been, to have Kong tuck Ann in some safe hiding place.<br /><br />The woman has the luck of Indiana Jones, escaping death about a thousand times.<br /><br />The movie has far too many \\"tortured close- ups\\" of Naomi Watts and crew.<br /><br />Many of the tender scenes involving Ann and Kong are masterful. But PLEASE, PLEASE... why the scene of Kong repeatedly sliding around on ice, in Central Park? He's being playful, Ann is laughing for some odd reason... has she forgotten that her large hairy friend is in mortal danger? (As are any hapless humans who get in Kong's way!) I could had accepted the scene, if Ann maintained her concern for Kong and prompted him to keep moving.<br /><br />The climax at the Empire State Building is very well done, but too tortured. It ran about five minutes longer than it should of, with far too many \\"cry with Ann\\" scenes.  Too much of a good thing isn't necessarily good. Sometimes less is more!<br /><br />Jeff Messenger, author of \\"The Shroud of Torrington.\\"
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I'm not one to call her a poser and swear her off...I mean, hell, she may be a poser but her music is still good so who cares.  Avril is Avril, theres no if ands or buts and so if you feel her attitude is fake just to get attention well thats fine, but don't knock her music for it...Tracks like 'How Does it Feel' and the heartbreaking 'Nobody's Home' show a maturity to Avril, a side that knows pain and lonliness, and her words are delivered so heartfelt, not mechanically, that it's hard to disagree with her.  There are classic radio hits like 'Don't Tell Me' and 'Take Me Away' and my personal favorite 'Together' and there are some so-so tracks or filler as you may call them but overall Avril stepped up her game and delivered a solid album exposing her heart on her sleave.  She's a gifted singer and deserves the attention she gets whether it's for the right reasons or not.  Hey, I just like her music.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I love the style of Depeche Mode, never the ordinary always unique. That's why they've been around for so long. My favorite songs are Suffer Well, I Want It All, and Precious. When I heard this album it reminded me of a new band called Chambre Noir, they use soundtracks and electronics as the backdrop of their music also. I recently saw Depeche Mode in concert and the show was awesome.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII is, without question, the most popular of the prestigious Final Fantasy series. It must be; Square says so themselves, by putting  out a glut of Final Fantasy VII followups, all of which form the aptly-named Compilation of Final Fantasy VII. Three new games are underway; two prequels and one sequel to the beloved original PSX RPG. However, the most hotly-anticipated of the compilation is not a game at all, but rather a CGI-animated film. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children has been a long, long time coming. Our lucky Japanese friends got it months ago, but we Americans have been required to wait nearly four years since it was first announced. Anticipation has only become greater over time, and now that it has finally arrived on our shores, the question can finally be answered: was it worth the wait? Well, the answer to that is an emphatic \\"yes.\\" Advent Children was worth the wait, worth the hype, and worth the anticipation. It is on all accounts a beautiful film, and no fan of Final Fantasy VII should go without it.  <br /> <br />     Most people are more than familiar with the premise of the film, but for posterity, I say it again. Advent Children picks up two years after the apocalyptic conlusion of Final Fantasy VII. The world was saved that day, but now the people are suffering from a fatal disease known as Geostigma. Among the many who have contracted the disease is our hero, Cloud. While he may have saved the world and defeated his worst enemy two years prior, Cloud is not a happy man. Tortured by guilt and self-doubt, he secludes himself from his friends, and refuses to let anyone help him. One day Cloud is attacked by three strange men known as Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo. They call him their \\"brother,\\" and demand to know where their \\"mother\\" is  hidden. And Kadaj in particular bears a striking resemblance to Cloud's deceased archenemy, Sephiroth.  <br /> <br />     I'll refrain from saying anymore. The narrative in Advent Children is an interesting, albeit very small continuation of the epic story we all saw in Final Fantasy VII. Kazushige Nojima, the writer of the original game returns to write for the film, and he manages to preserve the essence of the game quite well. Almost every important character from the game makes an appearance at one time or another, although the story does focus chiefly on Cloud, Tifa, and (surprisingly), Reno and Rude of the Turks. While Barret, Vincent, Yuffie, Cid, Red XIII, Cait Sith, and even Aerith all make appearances, their screen time is quite limited, and with the exception Vincent, they have only a few lines. (The expanded role of Vincent makes some sense, considering that they need to familiarize people with him before the release of his upcoming solo game, Dirge of Cerberus.)  <br /> <br />     The written dialogue is quite good for the most part, and it will be most gratifying to veterans of the game. However, people who have not played the game will most likely not care at all. The game does not spend a terrible amount of time developing characters, but really, we had a 50+ hour game that did that. However, the three new villains Kadaj, Loz and Yazoo suffer from inadequate development. By the end of the film we know nothing about them besides the fact that they can kick major ass in battle. Kadaj is somewhat more fleshed out, but still; none of them live up to the character of Sephiroth from the game.  <br /> <br />     I might as well go ahead and admit it. Advent Children exists mostly to show good guys fighting bad guys. Is this a bad thing? No, not necessarily. There are many words that could be used in describing the numerous action scenes in Advent Children. Words such as spectacular, amazing, groundbreaking, gravity-defying, and just plain awesome. To describe the actual battles would be spoiling them, but they are all amazing examples of CGI-mastery, and are utterly wonderful to behold.  <br /> <br />     As a matter of fact, that's what the entirety of Advent Children is: an amazing example of CGI-mastery. It completely blows away any CGI-animated film ever made, anywhere. The environments are beautiful in conception, and flawlessly realistic. Even under the most careful scrutiny, they simply show no trace of CGI. The character models are beautifully rendered, although they are intentionally kept unrealistic. (Slightly perhaps, with some characters looking more realistic than others.) This is a good, because the last thing we need is a repeat of the characters we saw in The Spirits Within. All the little details are given incredible care, right down to the fabric on Cloud's vest. Everything animates flawlessly, with nary a choppy animation throughout. All in all, Advent Children brings CGI animation to a new level; a level that creators will hopefully aspire to in the future.  <br /> <br />     While the visuals are the main attraction, the audio is also worth mention. The voice acting is, for the most part, excellent across the board, for both the Japanese and English tracks. (The DVD includes both.) Of course, the quality of the Japanese acting is impossible to discern by the average american, but still, the tone of the voices sure sound good. The English language, however, is what most people are probably interested in, considering that most have probably seen the Japanese version in some shape, form or fashion. And, while it may take a while to adjust to the new voices, the quality of the English dub is more than adequate. In fact, it's really quite good, with notable performances by Steve Burton as Cloud, Rachel Leigh Cook as Tifa, and Wally Wingert as Rufus Shinra. They're not all perfect, with some voices being less notable than others, but I can safely say that none of it is bad.  <br /> <br />     The English dub, however, does have a small issue concerning the re-written dialogue. Of course, re-writing was necessary in order to match the English voices with the animation of the mouths, but a few of the re-written lines have seriously lost their punch from the original Japanese dialogue. On top of that, some of the new dialogue is just plain bad. (Dilly dally shilly shally.....ugh, ugh, ugh.) Along with that, I found it dissapointing that, while the Japanese language is included, the English subtitles are from the English dub. (Which means that even if we don't have to hear \\"dilly dally,\\" we still have to read it.)  These are not serious issues by any means of course; and if you never watched the Japanese version, it won't make a bit of difference to you anyways. <br /> <br />     The other notable aspect of the audio is the music, composed by Mr. Uematsu himself. The quality of the music in Advent Children is consistently excellent, and adds to the experience greatly. A lot of it is returning music from the game, remixed and fully orchestrated. These are always welcome, and they all sound excellent. Among the returning themes are Those who Fight, (the battle theme), JENOVA, and, most notably, a rock/orchestra remix of One-Winged Angel, in all its glory. There are quite a few more, and it may take you a few viewings to catch them all. Besides the returning themes are more than a few completely original compositions. These new compositions are all excellent, and more than worthy of the Final Fantasy VII name. Overall, the music is nearly flawless, and it's what we've come to expect from a composer like Nobuo Uematsu. <br /> <br />Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is a gift to all fans of the game. Those who spent countless hours of their lives in the game will absolutely love it, and should go pick it up right now. Not only will they enjoy it for the visuals, but they will also find a very nice, well-conceived addition to a beloved story. And, to tell the truth, even those who have never touched a video game in their lives will probably derive some enjoyment from the film. It is a technical mastery of CGI animation, and features some of the most amazing battle scenes ever conceived. All in all, it is one of the most visually engaging films ever created, and anyone can enjoy a pretty picture.
6305428352|4.0|Being a musician myself, this movie appeals to me since not very many music-based movies are well made.  This just happens to be one of the better ones out there. <br /> <br />Being a composer, Mr. Holland signed up to be a music teacher at the local high school thinking this will give him money and the time to do composing.  Like many people out there, he did not realise how much time consuming being a teacher is and discovered it very quickly.   <br /> <br />With the movie starting in the turbulent 60s, we see Mr. Holland go through his life in the next 30 years.  Along with his lives, we can see the real life events happenening throughout times.  Events such as the Vietnam War, Nixon being impeached, the Flower Children days, through the disco days, and etcetera.   <br /> <br />Mr. Holland comes off as a self-centred person through many areas in the movie.  His attitudes reflect his desire to compose an opus that would make him famous.  Many of us can relate to this: the dreams we wish to achieve with many setbacks along our ways.    However, we are shown that even though Mr. Holland starts off as a stuffy person who only seems to care for himself, he slowly transitions into a person who can be just as compassionate as others. <br /> <br />This movie is about real people put in real situation.  We see a struggling teacher, a wife who supports the struggling teacher through everything, a caring principal, a very strict, uptight vice principal, a \\"gum-chewing coach\\", and the students who all represents ourselves in some ways or another.  None of the musicians in here are prodigy, although some do show more talents than others. <br /> <br />However, this movie doesn't get a full 5-star.  It had potential to be a 5-star movie, but my major complaint is the script.  At many times in the movie, it felt fragmented, poor flow.  The transition worked really nice, but the scenes were a bit off. <br /> <br />This movie may not be a true story, but after watching it, you can't help be imagine that it was, and that this story can happen to anyone at anytime.  A story of a teacher who achieves more than he hoped he did.  A story of how one person can make a difference in just the world he lives in.
B00005JOYA|4.0|I was introduced to Silent Hill 3 by my roommate, who was a huge horror buff.  He had nearly every horror flick you could imagine, and the games to go with them.  Posters around the room foretold the end of the world.  Yet, all of this combined paled in comparison to the experience of playing Silent Hill 3, which made the grotesque look amicable, and made Jason or Freddy Krueger look like your after-school music teacher (which may be good or bad, depending on your music teacher).  I still remember how, while running through a subway corridor, the green/brown walls all of a sudden began to pulsate and drip with blood, only to return back to the sewage-filled, rusted facade three seconds later upon reaching the end of the cooridor.  We both looked at each other, and said \\"WTF\\"! <br /> <br />I tell this to the readers who are either new to Silent Hill, or have played the game.  To both readers, the above description is basically the \\"allure\\" of this franchise - you will have never seen such displays of utter horror - and this movie will not disappoint.  After watching this movie, all I will say is that I will never think the same way about an air siren again. <br /> <br />To the former, it ends there.  The plot is skeletal, enough to justify the amazing scenery, and enough to please gamers who have immersed themselves into Silent Hill lore.  You will not find Oscar-winning acting, nor much rhyme or reason.  You may even be slightly annoyed (as I was) when the screen turns white, and someone begins a narration with \\"Congratulations...\\" as if you had just beaten a game, and are watching the ending.  My advice to you is to basically sit back, and prepare for a visual nightmare which has, until now, yet to erupt onto the big screen. <br /> <br />To the latter, I really think everything good about the game is in this movie.  The plot may make a little more sense, and the similarities of Sean Bean to the Silent Hill 2 protagonist, and Rosa to the Silent Hill 3 protagonist, are uncanny.  There's even a mention of Alessa and \\"rebirth\\", which were central to the plot in 3.  The characteristic \\"snow\\" pervades the street-level, and the sick and unforgiving nightmare of the hospital is prominantly displayed. <br /> <br />I give this movie 4 stars, and I'll tell a story to justify it: <br /> <br />I saw my roommate playing Silent Hill 3, and I still remember him going through the church.  The map, the MAP, out of all things, spooked me so much that when I played it myself, I never got past the hospital.  The map is an innocent child's drawing of the church, and the juxtaposition of that with the climax of the nightmare that is Silent Hill 3 was a bit too much for me.  This movie does not come close to drawing out that kind of response from me - I'm sure due to the mainstream appeal of this movie - and for that reason, I cannot justify giving it a higher rating.  I saw this with both eyes open throughout the entire movie, and outside of those damned air sirens, found myself more fascinated than spooked.  Of course, my opinion may change while watching this movie alone in the dark...
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I had purchased this movie recently, and boy was I entertained.  The characters were richly crafted in CGI, and the worlds were great to look at.  I loved the story and the action that took place within the film.  I definitely will watch again.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Inspired by a true story, I can't get over how profound this story is. The unfolding of a young man's struggle to wade through life with a facial deformity is strong with deep emotions. The movie exposes true cruelty in human nature, but also a capacity for love. Stoltz and Cher are burning with talent in this one! A rites of passage not only for youths, but also struggling adults, for in many ways Cher's character has a longer road down maturity lane than her teenage son.<br /><br />Another great movie along this same vein is 'Powder'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

0446310786|5.0|I wish someone had imposed this when I was in High School. This is just the book I would have enjoyed reading back then and enjoyed reading even now. The books just takes you back in time. The characters seem so real. Details like describing a frock that Scout wears to Church or women gossiping over afternoon tea will take you back in time. I am still hung over the town, its serenity and all its secrets. <br /> <br />Left me wondering how I missed such a good book for so long :)

Of the 16 songs there is 2 or 3 I skip over, I can only take so much off his drunk rambling some times.  A few are almost classic material or classic and the rest are good with maybe 3 that are ok.

B00006EXL5|5.0|I liked a couple of MCR's songs...that was before i saw them headline the London Earls' court Give it a Name Tour 2006...and let me tell you, they are one of my favorite bands. I was sketchy about buying their cds in the past...no more! I am sold! GO SEE THEM LIVE!!! They put on one hell of a concert.
0060207051|5.0|This is by far my kid's favorite baby/toddler book. I have read this to them since before they were born and still every night we go to bed as a matter of routine. It has such a harmony and flow about it and so soothing and calming for bedtime. I am sure when they outgrow this stage and I reread this book much later on in life, I will just bawl buckets over this one. Its such a classic and such a bonding book for parents and little ones.
B00003CXCT|1.0|Ok, I was a huge fan of Star Wars growing up.  The first movie I ever saw in the theater was the Empire Strikes Back with my grandparents and the first movie I ever owned was a VHS copy of Star Wars that someone recorded for me off the TV.  I fondly remember my first mail order Boba Fett and laying on the couch watching that old VHS over and over with my dad.  I think that the Empire Strikes back was the best of the series and that Boba Fett was arguably the coolest charachter.   <br /> <br />Somewhere along the line I seem to have forgotten how much of a hack George Lucas was though.  As I write this I am writing an article for publication and I have the DVDs playing in the background.  I bought the DVDs as soon as they came out on AMazon, despite my disapointment with the prequel trilogy.   <br /> <br />However, as I sat here on the couch I was startled to realize that Lucas had changed the movies once again, by inserting the voice of Jango Fett as Boba Fett's and replacing the original Anakin Skywalker w/ the new one.  I shouldn;t have expected anything more from the man who decided to let Greedo shoot first and produced the Star Wars Christmas Special.   <br /> <br />I guess when Lucas decides he needs an even bigger ranch and decides to produce a subsequent trilogy, he'll retcon the originals again.  Until then I can at least watch Peter Jackson's LOTR trilogy and be thankful that Tolkien is not around to help him retcon those.
B00000JLX0|5.0|I bought this deluxe  edition for my grandson, and it is beautiful.....these little [...] children are getting interested in the Titanic, also purchased the book about the Polar Teddy Bear...and these items are collector items.   Now the movie, I think they were a little hard on the Oh So Social, and they leave out the part about the jewelled copy of the Rubyait aboard ship and a Mummy aboard not listed in hold because - it was on bridge with the  Captain, and I believe this to be true - she was from Temple of Ay.   To see small children get so involved in this beautiful great ship - this masterpiece, and the mystery of its demise is something to behold in this day and age, when even the Cartoon Channel has become contaminated with a lot of smutty propaganda type \\"Adult Cartoons\\" now put on this channel by 8 oclock PM.Saddest thing about the Titanic, the truth will never be told.....but there were enough hints there, the music of the Barcarolle and the French Can Can - (Offenbach) - and the main theme song is beautiful, in itself a work of art....Leonardo is over-rated as a star, and I could have done without the 99 year old barefoot Rose - for all in all she was just a little crude to be in the Oh So Social Set that is pictured to be - well not so social when it came to the \\"third class Steerage.  And ladies of the day did not use crude language, some of the terms originating in the prisions and labor movement. One thing I noted - and saw for the first time - the duty bound officers aboard, the old \\"there is not to question why, there is but to do or die\\", for it was obvious the people aboard the Titanic left behind, never thought it would sink as fast as it did...the Captain went down with his ship. It seemed to me they made saints of some sinners, and sinners of some saints - and the Oh So Social returning from Upper Egypt were made to appear as though they were not gentlemen, but a bunch of ruthless,hate the poor robber barons.  This movie was anti our Giants but stop to think - this Giant of a Ship destroyed, and aboard some of America's giants killed as if they had all walked into a trap - even some of the crew made to appear ruthless, etc., which was not true - for in the Radio Room lay the secret to the demise of the Titanic......while this was some type of a propaganda piece it is worth watching - true the script was almost childish and whoever wrote same, should take refresher course in TRUTH ABOVE ALL....but all it all it is a collector's item, and we got a peek of the most beautiful ship in the world - and it made me wonder WHO IS KILLING OUR GIANTS?  This is a great buy ......

B00009V7T2|5.0|Imagine a fusion of Dante's Divina Commedia, Shakespeare's Hamlet, and Burroughs' Junkie given musical expression. This may give you a picture of what Mars Volta is doing.  And make no mistake, these guys are really learned, just in their own way, not with PhD's and Grammys. (We haven't yet reached the point where PhD's and Grammys are awarded to such genius.)  This is not music that you'd play for Mummy and Daddy, probably not either to entice your girlfriend (unless you want to drive 'em away). In fact, you probably won't either actually enjoy it on your first listen (unless you're even weirder than I am). But after some effort it will exhilarate you time and again.  With all this eulogy, I have to add a tragic note. Genius has a price. De-loused was inspired by the harrowing life and death of a close friend. It's very much about loss - and redemption.  The likeness to Zep has more to it: Cedric sings with the same natural beauty and abandon as Percy (and he switches with ease between English, Spanish and Cedrish), Omar is as far out as Jimmy, Flea and Jon manage to whack your brains to pulp, while Ikey and Jeremy create magnificent soundscapes.  The Hispanic dimension adds flavor.  For more info, look up Wikipedia's excellent articles.  I recommend De-loused highly, as well as the equally phenomenal follow-up Francis the Mute.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Michael Buble has developed an appealing rapport with his audience as well as charming performing antics that truly captivates and enthralls his listeners. The first time I saw him perform he wasn't exactly as playful as he is now. He has grown into a more connected and impassioned and funny and charming performer. And as a vocalist he interprets each song with simple yet heartfelt emotions beautifully complimented by his melodious and rich tone as well as his impeccable phrasing and diction. <br /> <br />The first single of his second album \\"Feeling Good\\" appropriately kicked off the show. I love this song very much, the arrangement was very classy and Buble's suave and cool voice fits the song quite well. His \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" was subdued and heartfelt, the simplicity of his rendition brought out  the beauty of the song even more. He then sang \\"You Don't Know Me/That's All\\" back to back, two of my all time favorite songs. He obviously loved the songs and the sincerity in his interpretations was evident.    <br /> <br />Laura Pausini and Buble did a sexy duet of \\"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\\". I wish they did Quando, Quando, Quando though too, that was one of my favorite tracks in his \\"It's Time\\" Album. Josh Groban had an amusing brief appearance when Buble started to mimic Groban's voice and stage mannerisms. He then proceeded to an amusing rendition of Maroon 5's \\"This Love\\". Vocally he was really out of his element even though the song was arranged big band style. But you've got to take the number the way it was intended which was to have fun with a pop song. <br /> <br />Other highlights are his suave and cool rendition of \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\", the upbeat \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" and the final song of the evening \\"Song for You\\". I also would like to point out how lovely the lighting was in the concert. I don't normally notice that kind of thing but in this concert, the lights really enhanced the mood and atmosphere of the show. I really think it was wonderful, just like the whole concert. <br /> <br />Grade: A-
0316172324|5.0|This simple book, provides more understanding and insight into why we think the way we do than most \\"heavier\\" books on such subjects. If you have ever wondered why you \\"just know\\" something but could never figure out how, then this book will help demystify such things for you.<br /><br />In business, we should do more to recognize and apply the principles of \\"Blink\\" and we should be less quick to judge those who appear to make snap judgements themselves. Assuming that they have read, researched or worked for long periods in a given field then it is quite likely not as much a snap judgement as you think.<br /><br />This is a great read, accessible and well written with many powerful stories to support the well constructed arguments.
0385338082|4.0|I bought this book from an airport bookstore.  I was intrigued by the cover, and I have heard good things about the author and her series.  After starting it on the plane, I was instintly pulled in.  I did not put it down until I was finished.  It was so funny, I was laughing out loud on the plane.  Upon getting home, I gave it to my roommate who agreed it was one of the best quick read books she has read in a long time.  We both urged our other friends to buy or borrow our copy.  So far five of our girlfriends have read it and all love it.
0156027321|5.0|Pi grew up a Zookeepers son in India with Ravi and his parents. This book has interesting perspectives on what it is like to be a Zoo animal and how it is a comfort to many of the animals.  At first the situation seems exaggerated being stuck on a life raft with a tiger Zebra, Hyena, and orangutan but the alternative explanation Pi gives to the ship investigators seems a little more plausible.  Are the animal's alternative personifications of the greedy chief, the mother and the courage he had in himself.  How could a island be carnivorous?  Eating fish and another person and anything that touches the soil at night?  The conversation he has with the tiger near the end shows that maybe the tiger is one he is having with himself.  Does the tiger eating the meer kats represent a primal instinct locked deeply in him that rears itself in times of desperation?  This is more plausible than being on a life raft for three days before noticing that there is a 450 pound lion in the same boat.  Exaggerated or not this book is an exciting survival story that can be enjoyed on many levels, whether you are into spirituality or just a good story.  It makes me want to know more about Hindu gods and Islam.  Be warned that parts of this novel can be extremely graphic and disturbing, some of the scenes kept me up and night.
B000EDWKXI|2.0|The Good: Sienna Miller and Lena Olin as Francesca Bruni and her Mother Andrea Bruni. Charming!<br /><br />The Bad: Jeremy Irons as Pucci, the Grand Inquisitor. He is totally miscast in this role.<br /><br />The Ugly: Oliver Platt (Paprizzio) with his shirt off and Heath Ledger dressed as a Venetian fop in a powdered white wig, lace and ruffles. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />'Casanova' is OK (maybe) for one viewing and that's primarily because of the many lovely ladies cavorting about in amorous pursuit of the legendary lover.
0316779237|4.0|If you laugh at children falling down this is the book for you.  He may push it sometimes but isn't that what a good writer should do?  Knowing he is half Greek, so am I, I was hoping for a good egg cracking story or roasting lamb in your backyard.  Unfortunately there wasn't one.  Santaland was my favorite.
B000BI0WOA|5.0|Great collection from a great group. I have all of their originals but sometimes its nice to have alternative groupings.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|With the title, Kurosawa has blurred the distinction between \\"dreams\\" and \\"nightmares\\" in this ensemble.  In fact, majority of what Kurosawa explores here are nightmares than dreams: the aftermath of nuclear explosions (twice), aftermath of a war, deforestation, and the likes.  Some \\"dreams\\" have explicit messages (Nuclear Aftermaths, The Village of Watermills,) some have implicit messages or just good as first rate narratives (Sun under the rain, the Van Gogh dream - excellent use of CGI in the latter).  Excellent cinematography.    What is consistently noticeable in all the narrations here is how quickly Kurosawa sets up the background and gets to the main theme, and how natural those backdrops are to the story!  A violently barking dog, at the entrance of a dark tunnel and the General walking into it is the backdrop for the \\"Tunnel\\".  In about five/seven minutes, this impeccable set up done, and Kurosawa rolls on with the episode.  It is left to your imagination whether the dog went and got the dead solider who does not seem to believe he is dead, or that the soldier appeared on his own.  Then the entire battalion of dead soldiers the General had ordered to the battle, all needing to be convinced that they are dead, arrive at the scene!  When the General convinces them all that they are dead, and as the sound of their boots marching backwards fades into silence, you are left wondering whether the General actually saluted them or was he really apologizing to them for the stupidity of the war, the responsibility he bore for their death.    The dog appears barking at the General again - perhaps the soldiers, as it is their Tannysonean duty to not question the General, did not dispute the consequence of his order, but the dog has no such obligations and is judging the General without prejudice!?    This is yet another nightmare that Kurosawa calls a \\"dream\\"! This is one of the best in the collection.    On the downside, at places - though very few such instances abound - Kurosawa seems to lose control of the narration.  For example, in the Watermills dream, the vocal narration (dialog) tends to drag on and overshadow the effect of the visuals. Even showing the old man and the visitor from different angles to capture the Nature around them would have added additional value.  The nearly still camera adds to the monotony of the situation as the old man goes into a long conversation.  \\"Village of the Watermills\\" is probably the lowest ranking one among all the episodes in the ensemble.    Some dreams seem to end prematurely - Kurosawa seems to deliberately not make statements where he easily could have.  But then they are supposed to be dreams and the endings of dreams are abrupt! And with such strong story line backed up by such narration, he does not need separate statements - the narration is the statement!

What about putting the songs onto my MP3 player? Again, it's impossible with this protection. If I pay MY hard earned money for a CD, I sure as heck better be able to put it on my portable music player!!  Wake up, the rights of the consumer are being infriged upon!!! The solution is simple, don't buy this trash!!    I will NEVER, I repeat NEVER, but a CD with this protection!!

0061015725|4.0|This is a book about a nanotechnology experiment gone horribly wrong. I'm pretty sure everyone has atleast heard of nanotechnology, if not understood it (My favourite, and first, reference is SuperPatriot and the cans of nanobots he carries around, but that's a story for another day). If it sounds alien, then this isn't the best place to start, because the nanotech here isn't exactly the friendliest of tech, and If you're looking forward to understanding the technology behind it, well I'm not sure how much Chrichton has made up, but most of it kinda went over my head. It's still a fascinating read, no matter where your interests lie, because like most of his other novels, what the protagonists do with the tech is just as fascinating as the tech itself.    The blurb at the back of the novel is quite fine in it's description of the novel. However, its ominous tone is a bit misleading. See, the novel itself isn't very scary. There are a few deaths, and the last few chapters are quite tense, but the horrors of rogue nanobots running (or rather, swarming) amuck in a civilian population are only implied, and after reading this, I'm sure most of us won't have any troubles visualising that.    And this is precisely the kind of creepy that scares me the most, because everything depicted here could actually be happening right now, someplace, somewhere. It doesn't rely on luck or fate or running across supernatural interference, but rather, it's the highly volatile, often stupidly self-destructing nature of human beings that acts as the prime catalyst for the whole darn mess.    For every fire-breathing dragon, there's the righteous knight; for every blood-sucking vampire, there's the holy water and wooden stake; for every lycanthrope there's the silver bullet; but for every moronic homosapien with more power than he can control, there's only another homosapien to muck things up. We are doomed.

0804106304|3.0|Amy Tan's The Joy Luck Club is a mix of vignettes from both mothers and daughters who formed a group to tell stories so they could spend one night forgetting about the outside world and its problems and instead gather to escape and enjoy one another's company. These meetings are aimed at lifting their spirits, forgetting about poverty, and pretending that each week was a New Year, a new start to life.  <br /> <br />One of the problems I had with the book was the repetitive nature of the mother-daughter problem theme along with the plethora of proverbs and mysticism preached by mothers to their daughters. I appreciate that this book deals with both the cultural and generational problems which exist in the Chinese culture, but it was a little too overdone. The book became at some points a bit too melodramatic, \\"soap-operaish\\" with the marital spats and conflicts between daughters and their mother's expectations. I really felt many times like I was reading the same story over.  I don't know how many more ancient secrets could possibly be revealed in the latter half of the book ,or how many more proverbs about turtles eating tears, etc can possibly be analyzed that hadn't already been covered in the first half of the book.  <br /> <br />Still, that being said, I did enjoy some of the stories in the books. One of the stories, \\"Rules of the Game\\", about a child prodigy in chess, was thought-provoking because it focused on how much life can be like a game of chess. Waverly becomes so successful in chess that her mother begins to \\"show her off\\", using her as a means of showing her pride. At the end, Waverly has to come to terms with the idea that she and her mother have different expectations and outlooks, even though they are both from the same culture. Another tale, Lena St. Clair's \\"The Voice from the Walls\\", was also enjoyable because it had seemed to veer from the predictable. After moving to a San Francisco apartment, Lena hears the muffled sounds of fighting and arguing going on in the apartment next door at night each night. Knowing that she has many issues going on in her own life, she feels a sense of guilt when she makes eye contact with the girl who lives next door a few days later, knowing full well that she knows and can hear the fights each night. Lena comes to her own understanding of the importance of family bonding, and reconciling, when she hears the family next door crying and laughing for joy when their daughter who had been missing was found safe, and relates this to her own struggles with her mother.  <br /> <br />Overall, this book is a decent read, but, depending on how much mother-daughter conflicts you can stomach, you may have to skip through certain stories to get to other tales that engage your interest. Amy Tan does have a great ability to write, and interweave dialogue that is realistic and paints a picture of society from the standpoint of the Chinese culture. The subject matter was just a little too long-winded, and repetitive.  <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. Being set a full 50 years earlier than Austen's story is entirely wrong but not worth bleating over. Oddly, the best way to portray rural dwellers of the day is deny them soap and water. There is a strange film over everyone as if they'd all been awake for a solid week and were not given time to shower before getting onto the set. Let's even try to forgive Grand Mal errors like Bingley entering the bedroom of an overnight female guest. Huh? If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of other similar problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well captured. Watch this thing with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.<br /><br />But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue this mess.<br /><br />First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog.  And despite being the epic romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.<br /><br />Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.<br /><br />Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the fa?ade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of pouty sex kitten, this trick looks as if a large dose of thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.<br /><br />Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be in the throes of an Ecstasy binge, which they are, yet still manage to disappoint us. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) is stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E version Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, \\"big eyes and stick-in-the-arse marionette movement\\" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.<br /><br />Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first love and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is cast once again as the fiery old crone (Lady Catherine de Bourg) which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste.  Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded (and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of red hair). The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this. And not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail.<br /><br />This is two thumbs way, way down. Down as in, to induce vomit after accidentally ingesting drain opener. The only thing that might have been slightly harder to swallow was the 2003 modernized version sent up by director Andrew Black. I'd rather see JACK Black in the director's chair. Naked.<br /><br />When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Bronte sisters. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC or PBS where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars.untless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first love and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time).

Terrifying. Whoever called this genre \\"power ballads\\" was obviously a previous victim.  <br /> <br />
1558216847|5.0|I read this book as an autobiography and I have given five stars because it is an excellent read. However, I read it as a true story not knowing anything about it. When I discovered it was a hoax and pure fiction (and I did begin to wonder after the crossing of the Gobi desert) I felt somewhat cheated. I felt very cheated after completing the book to find there was nothing at all about what happened to the men when the event was over. That is why it is without doubt a fictional work.  <br /> <br />A true biography would have left a verifiable thread about what happened when the men returned home - but there is nothing!
B00004RHZU|5.0|I just wanted to disagree with the critic's review here and say that I really like this CD, or at least the majority of the songs on it. That Amazon review was obviousy written by a man. Any woman will relate to Pink's lyrics, her confusion and anger towards men. It's great stuff. The songs are fun, upbeat songs that make you want to dance.
B00000JG41|4.0|I was just listening to Nurse With Wound's \\"Homotopy To Marie\\" and found where the CHA CHA CHAKACHAKACHAKACHAKA CHAK CHAK in Goodbye Sober Day is from. Why, it's from the Nurse With Wound song I Am Blind! Clever guy that Mike Patton.     Anyway this review has no real point besides i stumbled on that passage and felt like i had to tell someone. This is my least favorite Bungle record, but it's great anyway. That is all.    EDIT: after getting an email saying this:    \\"what a dumbass. the chanting has been around much longer than that. mike just borrowed the idea and incorporated it into an amazing song.... kind of like the new tomahawk album... native american songs were around long long ago... but patton took the ideas and made them into a metal/alternative/electronic album. there's a difference between copying something, and being influenced by something and creating your own genius music with those influences. you're probably too dumb to realize that though if you had to post a review just to say something so incredibly dumb and ignorant.\\"    which is totally lol-worthy (i wasn't criticizing, plus the style is actually a Balinese chant style known as Kecak and doesn't have native american roots... i meant it sounded actually SAMPLED), i figured maybe i should add more to the review.    This album is my least favorite bungle because the bizarre ideas are masked into \\"real\\" songs of the past... much more subtle you could say. I do enjoy it, but i enjoy more when you can put on any given song on the album and people don't say \\"this sounds like [insert band or style here]\\", but instead simply shake their head or cannot wipe the look of utter disgust off their faces. If you're new to bungle, i would probably recommend Disco Volante first, and if you can stomach that go on to the other two. It's by far the LEAST accessible of the trio, but there's no confusing whether you like bungle or not with that album.

B000C65Z1G|5.0|God I wish this movie won the best picture! It's interesting, the actings were GREAT (Ralph Fiennes and Rachel Weisez just took my breath away!) and its thriller is SO intense that I had to hold my breath, and the cinomatography GOSH it's BEAUTIFUL!! <br />Fiennes captured that perfect British well-mannered gentleman who constantly buried his inner conflict due to suspicion of his wife's disloyalty, and the hearbreaking breakdown and remorse when he found out the truth. This gotta be the first actor on a movie who gives me the goosebumps and makes me just admires him so. <br />Rachel Weisez is as gorgeous and great as always, she's one of my favorite actress of all time, so frickin talented!! <br /> <br />The ending was a little disappointing for me, yes I get it, the guy is going to die, most likely horribly (alas!). But still, ANOTHER cliffhanger and/or tragic movie?? I guess life just sucks huh? <br /> <br />Alot of people complained about the whole conspiracy is a little dumb, but seriously, stuff like this do happen, ya never know, I only know that, the only reason this film didn't even get nominated as a best picture is because Hollywood DESPERATELY trying to stay away from conversial stuff, the fact that Brokeback Mountain didn't win SO proved it. I mean, think about it, look back, which movie in the past that won best picture is controversial?  <br /> <br />Anyways this movie took my breath away, I didn't think I would like it as much, but I LOVED it, much more than the four best-picture nominated (of course including the won one-Crash) movie I've seen. Characters are just SO heartfelt, great performances, excellent all around. To be honest, haven't seen movie this good in a loooooong time.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|THE BAND: Dave Mustaine (lead vocals, lead & rhythm guitar), Marty Friedman (lead & rhythm guitar), David Ellefson (bass), Nick Menza (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (2004) This remixed version contains 15 songs clocking in at approximately 67 minutes. Included with the disc is a 18-page booklet containing a brief intro, band photos, song credits, song lyrics, and thank you's. \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" was original released in 1992 with 11 total tracks. Recorded at The Enterprise, Burbank, CA. New producer - Max Norman. Label - Capital.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Warning - do not trade in your original disc/album for this new remixed and remastered version of \\"Countdown To Extinction\\". You need them both! This new enhanced version contains slightly different takes on the songs. Mustaine's vocals appear (on some songs) like he's in a deep echo chamber. Song intro's, song ending's, and some guitar solo's sound completely different. In some songs, it even sounds like Nick Menza is using a different drum kit (from the orignal '92 release). In my opinion - these are classic NEW takes on classic songs (reminiscent of what Deep Purple just did with their classics \\"Machine Head\\" and \\"Burn\\"). On to the review of the disc... Like Metallica, Megadeth was originally known for lightning fast riffs and steady drums to hold the songs together. This kind of music played to a select group of listeners. Megadeth matured a little bit, got a new producer, slowed it down just a tad... and the result was \\"Countdown to Extinction\\". A solid effort from start to finish. The old school Megadeth fans will say the band sold out (like old school Metallica fans said the band did with their 1991 \\"Black\\" album as well as \\"Load\\" in 1996). I've always believed that you simply can't please everyone. With \\"Countdown To Extinction\\" though, I felt then as I do now - Megadeth reached so many more listeners with their new and improved sound. This isn't the band's best selling album for no reason. Mustaine and Friedman's guitars are hard, crunchy and tight. Ellefson's bass playing is thundering in the background. Menza's drumming has been equalled on other albums, but never better than here. The first 6 songs are back to back metal classics. My favorite songs (even years later) are \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\", \\"This Was My Life\\", \\"Sweating Bullets\\", and \\"Symphany of Destruction\\". The bonus tracks are great too - \\"Crown Of Worms\\" fits right into the spirit of the album. The 3 'Demo' cuts sound stripped down and crisp - great takes! If you were not into Megadeth because of their trademark speed licks and thrash... I guarantee you will be pleasantly surprised by the results from \\"Countdown To Extinction\\". In 1992, this was vastly different than anything else they'd ever done. This is easily my favorite release in the entire Megadeth catelog. Classic disc.dman's guitars are hard, crunchy and tight.

185984054X|2.0|As an atheist with a strong belief in ethical behavior and doing good for others, I have always had a certain ambivalence towards Mother Teresa. I was expecting Hitchens to reveal all sorts of previously unknown facts about how Mother Teresa was actually a phony, mistreating others and scamming funds for her own financial benefit. But actually the portrait that emerges is of a very sincere and dedicated woman, though politically and socially naive in her actions. In fact, almost all of Hitchens' criticisms of Mother Teresa could be equally directed towards the Vatican itself. Yes, I disagree with her staunch opposition to birth control and abortion, also, that in her zealous affirmation of Church doctrine, she is often doing more harm than good to the very people she is trying to help. But does this make her an evil menace, as Hitchens seems to suggest? No, not really, just a misguided person who is still very sincere and dedicated to helping the poor according to her own religious convictions.  <br /> <br />I don't feel like I learned much from this book that I didn't already know. Also I was somewhat put off by Hitchens' consistently arrogrant and snide tone. He really seems to be going for the jugular against Mother Teresa. If he had more damning facts in his case against her I might be more open to his harsh commentary. Instead he is basically providing a critique that could be equally leveled against the Vatican and conservative Catholic dogma in general. To me this information was already well known and not really worthy of a personal attack against Mother Teresa herself. To someone with no knowledge of Church doctrine or its questionable political affiliations this might be an informative read. But, for me, it was a dull disappointiment.
B000006XSD|3.0|What we are are hard-core Alice Cooper fans to have listened to this album in its entirety more than the one time on the day we bought it.  Though backed with the best songwriters and musicians, Alice's weak and uninspired delivery drag \\"Maurice Escargot\\" through his paces throughout most of this anemic offering (think what a sober Cooper could have made of \\"It's Hot Tonight!\\").  In my humble opinion, this album, though eclectic and humorous, is one where the joke is on Alice.  The great news here is the lush ballad \\"You and Me.\\"  Too bad they released a chopped up version as a single, even if it did chart as a Top Ten Hit.  The album version features a string section that soars with over the top angst.  This song is a classic, and is the bright spot on this tired yet oh so sincere Alice Cooper effort.
0375831002|5.0|I had read no reviews of this title prior to reading except to have heard the title brandied about. And I can only reiterate what others have said. The Book Thief is a beautifully written story, the sparse and in most causes nonemotional retelling of the Holocaust through a Death and a young girl's eyes is absolutely powerful. Writing at it's best. It is one of a handful of books I will buy and treasure - being a School Librarian I read many titles in a year, this is truly outstanding. Unfortunately many students will be daunted by the size and not attempt it but I will book talk it to anyone who will listen.
1400079179|1.0|I am probably the last person in the US to have read the immensly popular The DaVinci Code. This tripe is written at a 7th grade level. It is filled with every literary cliche' known to man, vis-a-vis his \\"jaw dropped.\\" Despite the author's contention the book is based on fact and his research, both seem to be lacking. This story has no basis in History, Art history, or Church history. The Templars being secret goddess, read pagan, worshipers. Leonardo being referred to as DaVinci. Author Brown had no idea that last names were not a factor until the late Renaissance. Finally, the thing about the Emperor Constantine leaving his heavy hand all over the Bible is just dribble. It is devoid of fact, ignores the physical limitations of the human body, and the laws of physics. I am sure I am not pointing out anything new here, but the heroine in the story lifts a gigantic picture all by her lonesome. The characters are paper thin. Fache the Parisian detective, I imagine, based on Brown's writing would sound like Peter Sellers Inspector Cluesau. Author Brown has the murder victim, in the past, having sex in a circle and he calls it, sounds like Greek, Hookey Magookey or some such nonsense. The Author uses every mystery cliche' known to first year Creative Writing students. Yes, the butler does do it, and the disabled person is a bad guy. The only thing missing was the book opening with \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" though, if I remember when Langdon is in his hotel room, it was a dark and stormy night. Finally, even Dan Brown did not use the words \\"Sacred Feminine\\" this book would be about 20 pages long. But, hey in the end the character Langdon lays a lip lock on Jesus' great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grand-daughter.<br /><br />And, to think some folks believe what is written in this book. Hey, DaVinci Codites, ever hear of a library or the internet?  Yes, \\"codites\\" is a made up word, but then again I am no Harvard trained Symbologist.  This book is just plain awful, ZERO stars.<br /><br />As a closing note, unlike many who have attacked this book on theological grounds and called it anti-Christian, I have done no such thing. But, I do find it interesting, while perusing the internet, that even atheists think this book stinks.This book is just plain awful, ZERO stars.  <br /> <br />As a closing note, unlike many who have attacked this book on theological grounds and called it anti-Christian, I have done no such thing.

B000002GB9|5.0|Wow what an album.Today if you buy a cd, you are lucky to get two decent songs on it. This cd The Grand Ilusion is like a greatest hits collection. There is not a single bad song here. In fact it is loaded with classics like Come Sail Away, and The Grand Illusion.I really like progressive rock and metal, and this cd contains one of the finest progressive rock jams of all time which is Castle Walls. Castle Walls is pure genius from beginning to end. Great synthesizer work and a collection of musicians who all could sing and had as good of high harmonies as Sweet did. What a great piece of music and I think is Styx's best .
B0001XAS1W|5.0|Al Stewart took his shot at the title in the mid-seventies and this album featured some truly wonderful tunes and the production values are a superb match for the strong writing and arrangements. You will enjoy \\"Lord Grenville\\" as the violins take you out on the sea with Her Majesty's Navy. Spend some time in the \\"Broadway Hotel\\" and travel out to the gun runners gauntlet \\"On The Border\\". Most will be very familiar with \\"Year Of The Cat\\", but this album is truly an excellent 'must-have' for the serious collector of seventies music.
B000002HRE|3.0|Seriously.    No one cares about your elitist sell-out rhetoric.    Reload is a damn good album, though more along the lines of standard hard rock than the psychedelic/alternative sound of Load.    Give it a try.
B000002KDM|5.0|With its stripped down austerity, this is one of the most masterful albums of the seventies. James was at his songwriting and arranging peak so early in his career, it is remarkable. \\"Love Has Brought Me Around\\" starts it off with a fine and gentle restraint. \\"You've Got A Friend\\" was anthemic.  <br />\\"Riding On The Railroad\\" still haunts these many years later. \\"MudSlide Slim and the Blue Horizon\\" and \\"You Can Close Your Eyes\\" are amazing in their playfulness and hopefulness. This was James Taylor at the pinnacle of his creative muse...
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|Ok, I loved this movie.  That said, I have to explain why.  I'm 22 and I refuse to grow up.  When FFVII came out my friends and I would run home from our middle school, ignore homework (the last time in my life I can remember being able to do that), and play FFVII.  We lived, ate, and breathed FFVII for over a year.      I've also read a ton on FFVII over the years.  Different theories on the meaning of the story, Sephiroth, Jenova, etc.  In short, I understand this world.  That is almost a necessity to watch this movie.      My girlfriend and I watched the movie together, she had no idea what Final Fantasy was, much less FFVII.  To her it was a jumble of random ideas.  Very little of the movie made sense.  I had to stop the movie several times to explain certain segments to her.  Who various people were, etc., etc.  If I hadn't been there, she'd have no clue what the movie was about.  The movie does not develop the characters or introduce them properly for someone who has not \\"met\\" them before in the game.    To me it was an exciting trip through memory lane, and a fantastic closing to the story.  The way the authors closed the story was phenomenal both philosophically and artistically.  The artwork involved was very unique, and those of you who like anime will probably enjoy it.    There was a downside, however.  I did not appreciate the way some of the characters were portrayed.  The theme of FFVII is very serious and the portrayal of Reno and Rude just distracted from that.  It was like having comic relief in the middle of a funeral.  Not that I couldn't see Reno and Rude acting that way based on the game, but I definitely felt it was innapropriate based on how the rest of the movie flowed.  The portrayal of much of the rest of Cloud's friends was also a little dissapointing.  Barret was little more than a charicature of the \\"big urban black male\\".  Yuffie said nothing more than \\"I want materia\\".  Nanaki (Red XIII if you prefer) said almost nothing.  Cait Sith was lacking the Cait.  Cid was nothing more than a redneck (and I love the recurrence of the engineer Cid in all of the FF stories, so that was especially dissapointing).  The good news is that, aside from Reno and Rude, the story line does not involve any of those characters, so they are only minor distractions from the overal brilliance of the movie.    If you played FFVII as a kid, or more recently, and enjoyed the story of the game, connected with the characters, and understood the themes, but felt like the ending did not close the story you'll be happy to see how everything wraps up for Cloud and his friends.  If you're interested in the movie, but not an FF fan, I must recommend you play FFVII first.  This movie will make very little sense to the uninitiated without a background in the game.
B00080ZG10|5.0|\\"The Aviator\\" is a good example that is showing us that Hollywood is still putting out great films. Leonardo does an excelling job playing Howard. The story is inspiring and sad at the same time. It is inspiring because he became everything he said he would as a child, but it was also part of his destruction. Sadly becoming paranoid during parts of his life, it was sad to watch. All of the co-stars, while not really looking very much like who they are supposed to be, do a great job as well. Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, everyone fit there roles.<br /><br />The production of the film was really well done. The look and the feel puts us back during Howard's time. The scenery is very beautiful and so are the costumes that the actors and actresses are wearing. It all looks very authentic.<br /><br />Great actors, sets and costumes. While watching, you forget it's a movie and you get lost in this true, but tragic story of Howard Hughs. Highly recommed this film, it is everything good anyone has ever said of this film.
B000002GC2|5.0|This was Q's first album after producing the \\"Thriller\\" album for Michael Jackson.  That album had Q's touch all over it.<br /><br />That album was my first introduction to Quincy Jones (I was 20 at the time) . So when \\"The Dude\\" was released I bought it immediately.<br /><br />I was very impressed once again.  It had all the \\"slick\\" production values I knew from \\"Thriller\\" and a great lineup of artists.<br /><br />And it introduced the very talented James Ingram to the masses (who would go on to have a number of R&B hits on his own later).<br /><br />I played \\"The Dude\\" to death back then.<br /><br />Quincy is indeed a very all-around talented man. From producer, to writer to musician, arranger, conductor and entrepreneur.<br /><br />My only criticism of this album (speaking of James Ingram) is that I frankly got sick of \\"Just Once\\".  I'm still tired of it.  It's still payed to death on AC radio.<br /><br />It's a great song, but enough is enough already. :-)<br /><br />In any event, if you've not heard this album, I highly recommend it and most any album from \\"Q\\" for that matter.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Let me start this review stating that USUALLY, I do not agree with the movie nominationis for the Oscar awards.  If you usually do, then don't waste your time reading this.  I decide whether or not I like a movie with a couple of different criteria.  First of all, did it entertain me?  I like to be entertained by a movie.  Second, did it make me laugh, cry, or some other emotion?  I like a movie that elicits emotion from me.  I liked Top Gun when it first came out because I had a boyfriend in the navy at the time who was an air traffic controller on an aircraft carrier.  I watched it whenever I needed to feel close to him.  He liked the movie as well.  Top Gun entertained me.  I have watched it well over 200 times in the last 20 some odd years. I have worn out a VHS and one DVD.  The movie just made me feel alive and feel good.  I like it when a movie does this for me.  Call me crazy, but if I'm going to pay for a movie, I don't require absolute reality.  In fact, a little escape without the use of mind altering substances, is a pretty good thing.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|I'm glad I bought this movie, and I have recommended my friends see it. The movie was tastefully done.
B00005JL0I|4.0|I decided to leave this after reading a few reviews of this SPOOF of Bond.  People are actually upset that someone dared to make fun of James Bond.  Give me a break how seriously can we take it after Timothy Dalton played 007 ?  The history given in one review does lead you to believe some of this movie was playing \\"catch-up\\" and no it's not hilarious but definitely funny and as someone who has seen every commercially successful Bond including R.Moore, S.Connery , T. Dalton, P. Brosnan and G. Lazenby this is funny.  You can definitely see \\"Austin Powers\\" in it as well as a few other movies, but one must keep in mind this is british humor so you won't be slapping your knee or falling off the sofa.  Frankly,  I have more of an issue with Daniel Craig playing the early Bond instead of some younger Brit, but he was excellent in \\"Layer Cake\\" so I guess we'll give him a chance although not thrilled with Eva Green as Vespa Lynd, she's no Ursula Andress.
B000EMGJM2|2.0|I give Van two stars for effort and artistry.  I was expecting a total heater after his first CD.  I am hugely disappointed.  Once again, I respect him as an artist and appreciate that he is unconventional in style, but it seems that he's flipped the script.  To me, the worst thing you can do is change from the artist you were when you were building a fan base.  I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this work, but it did not go over well with me.  Is this a crossover?
B000001G50|4.0|Karajan was an amazing conductor. Precise, demanding, exacting, but also emotional and deeply sensible to nuances and subtleties of the various works and comosers he conducted. He's amazing with Beethoven and Wagner, for instance. <br /> <br />With Pachelbel, however, something didn't click. I have at least three Karajan recordings of the Canon in D -as well as over 50 other versions- and none are as brief, \\"martial\\", cut-and-dry, hurry-up-and-leave like Karajan's. Don't ask me why, but it would seem that conducting Pachelbel was something he didn't enjoy. <br /> <br />The rest of the album, however, is very enjoyable, smooth, melodious, and thoroughly enjoyable and commendable. <br /> <br />So, in a nutshell: if you've had it with Pachelbel's Canon in D, this is a great recording for you. If, on the other hand, you really love the Canon, skip it while playing this album or, for that matter, any of Karajan's recordings of it, where you'll also find this report, as I have collected them all: my acoustical masochism knows no boundaries.  <br /> <br />I hope this helps you in your selection. Enjoy! <br />
B000EHSVQE|5.0|This is one of those movies that you either GET or you DON'T. If you get it you love it. If you don't get it, I strongly urge you to give it another chance in the future. This is one of the best feel good movies and absolutely HILARIOUS.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Well most of what is to be said about the movie has already been said. I certainly think you have to have played FF7 back in the days when it was actually advanced for its time; back when the big blocky characters and graphics were top of the line. You also have to be one of those people who really gets into the plot line behind the series to understand what makes this movie so satisfying. Otherwise it may just look like another anime of sorts. <br /> <br />The movie is created by most of the same minds who made the original game, so much of the music, characters, and themes are continued here. I think the plot itself here could have actually been a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, it does bring a lot more closure to the story then the original game does, and it is so incredible to see all those characters look so incredibly realistic, it also leaves a few unanswered questions and even an amount of open-endedness to make room for a possible sequel.  <br /> <br />The graphics here are extraordinary. Watch it on a big screen TV and you will feel like you are inside the game. I recommend watching it with English subtitles and Japanese dub to get the best experience out of it. The only notable downsides I saw were as follows. The movie has a lot of matrix-type fight scenes which actually get a bit boring after a while, and a lot of the fighting stretches way out of the realm of believability as people can not just levitate fighting in mid air for a fraction of as long as they do in the movie, or throw/hurl themselves upward while balancing on small objects. That being said, it makes the fighting done in the game feel so much more real. <br /> <br />In summary, this game for me was all about bringing back memories. If you were one of those people who couldn't stop playing this video game when you got it a decade ago, you will be very happy with it and wanna watch this movie over and over again. If you never played the game, the movie will still probably be worth watching, although far less relevant. FF7 (according to the extra cuts) has sold more than 9 million copies worldwide for a reason....even to this day its worth playing. Watching the video just makes me wanna play the game all over again. I'm glad I bought this DVD. <br />
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Even though the BBC version is probably more true to the book it definitely feels like a TV movie.  This big-screen version is  palpably richer with gorgeous cinematography and a beautiful score. Many things felt more realistic. The wonderful Bennett country home with the muddy yard, farm animals and laundry hanging. Ballroom scenes with everyone packed in together.  <br />I thought it was amazing how every actor made their character uniquely their own especially considering the hard act they had to follow. I especially enjoyed Brenda Blethlyn as Mrs. Bennett.  Matthew Macfadyen and Kiera Knightly had wonderful chemistry. Their pivotal scene together is one for the ages.  My only complaint is that the movie is so short - I would have liked to have seen as much of these actors as I did the ones in the series.  Can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk the line by Director James Mangold (I love all his movies) is a gorgeous tale of the love affair between Johnny Cash and June Carter. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are well-suited in their roles here. The film focuses mainly on how John and June met and toured together through the years and the start of their affair while he was still married to his first wife. Also talks about Johnny's addiction to pills and his unhealthy relationship with his father. Witherspoon received an oscar for her role, a much-derserved award for this talented actress. Phoenix is wonderful as well, he sure has Cash's mannerisms down to a T. John and June would eventually get married and spend 35 years in wedded bliss til their deaths took form. Walk the Line has solid writing, terrific acting, and a positive message that anyone know matter rich or poor can overcome old demons and survive. Beautiful love story, buy this film.
B000EDWKXI|5.0|It is definitely worth seeing this movie for the gorgeous sets alone.  The story is pure fun with Heath Ledger as an energetic Casanova, a luminous Sienna Miller as his love interest, and talented Lena Olin as her mother.  Oliver Platt is hilarious and touching as a pompous yet insecure Papprizzio. Jeremy Irons as the \\"Chief Inquisitor\\" from Rome plays his part to the hilt. Clever writing and several plot twists keep you entertained throughout. Not sure how it got an R rating - only a tiny bedroom scene in the beginning - the rest is definitely PG-13 material. The DVD is a has several great extras including a \\"Making of...\\", a detailed look at costuming, and a tour of Venice.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|Let me first say that I loved the Aeon Flux series on Mtv. It positively blew my mind. I use to watch this animated cartoon along with the greats. First came THE Maxx, then The State, Then Aeon. But, now that she's been poured into cinematic form, it seems that all the fan-nostalgia has been washed right out of me.<br /><br />Charlize theron, a brillant actress, Chameleon actress, did well in portraying Aeon as a kick-butt assasin who takes her work very seriously. I wouldn't have wanted anyone else to play Aeon but her, to be honest.<br /><br />But, alas, looking like a character doesn't necessarily mean that you will embody that character.<br /><br />The story takes place in the very far future as the last remaining humans build a city to house the last survivors of the population. Aeon, mingled in with the society, visits her sister often and has the feeling that the regime has been hiding something. Especially since people are dissapearing with no explanation for it.<br /><br />Now, as I was watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice that it had a similar outline to that of V FOR VENDETTA. But, sadly, this is no V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />The action was good and well cherographed, I admit.<br /><br />The costumes and plot were also very well done.<br /><br />If anything, I like the premise and story of this timeless character and movie.<br /><br />But, with this movie, I think they thrusted the audience too fast into the movie without really spending the time or effort in re-telling the backstory of Aeon and the Regime. Some parts I got confused as to whether everything was comprehendible or if it was just me. STAR WARS had a similar approach, introducing gadgets that need no explaination, but Aeon somehow falls flat in this department. It's not that the gagdets aren't well explained, it's just that they seem to almost pop out of nowhere or need MORE explaining.<br /><br />I'm Not saying that I hate the movie. I think that they did a spectacular job . . . but they could've done better. They could've spent more time with the backstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold. Each frame was not like a painting like it was in V FOR VENDETTA.<br /><br />It almost seems, when watching this movie, that they left something out or something was missing for the grand masterpiece. Thankfully, this doesn't hurt Charlize's career in any way but the film needs a lot of work still.<br /><br />I say, that if you are a hardcore Aeon Flux fan, that these things won't matter much. But, if you are a person who has never really been into the series, it may take you a long while to warm up to these characters. You may have to watch the original series and then come back to this movie in order to fully appreciate it more.<br /><br />I'd say that 40% of the movie was hype.<br /><br />Final verdict: Needs more history. Still good though.ckstory, becuase, in essence, that's what keeps us all interested in the characters. And I think that they could've at least spent more time on how the story would unfold.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|Well I thought this would be a horror movie for one thing. The previews showed nothing but a girl going out of her mind and going insane from the demons taking over her body. Well that's only about a half hour of the movie. The rest of the movie is courtroom mumbo jumbo. It's bad enough all my wife watches is Law and Order and every CSI, but when I want to watch a horror movie, I don't want to see more courtroom babble. This is not your daddy's Exorcist.<br /><br />The movie was well acted and the girl that played Emily did a great job, but there just wasn't enough to keep me interested. For a movie about a young girl being possessed, the movie is more about the defense attorney who defends the priest who is charged with criminal manslaughter or negligence or something. I'm sorry but it takes more than a lawyer waking up at 3:00 AM and discovering her front door is unlocked to frighten me.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is when the exorcism is being performed and the climatic part out in the barn when the demon finally admits he is the same demon that possessed Cain and Nero.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this DVD at the pawn shop for next to nothing. Like I said I was expecting a horror movie. This movie could barely get a 13 year old girl scared.
B00005JOYA|1.0|Well, it had nice cinematography. 'Silent Hill' started with some promise, and it had a good, creepy plot. However, all of that was squandered after the first ten minutes. I can understand how, since this movie is based off a popular series of video games, that the movie may have to be mostly action, since very few video games are story-driven. But, what we get here is a nice start with a tight, concise plot, and some creepy scenes, but once the movie moves itself to the town of Silent Hill, it becomes a stupid action movie, and the main plot dissapears. I have no problem with action movies, but my problem with this movie is that it's not scary, it's action is boring, the acting is bad, for the most part, and the set design is ugly. However, the cinematography was nice. <br /> <br />The movie would have benefited from being cut by about a half hour, and most of that could have been action that was cut. On top of the bloated running time, the movie made no friggin' sense. It was basically a version of 'The Village' with elders that like to burn people. I came out of the movie not knowing what happened, and not really caring, since the movie was like a slap in the face and just as enjoyable. I can't begin to describe how poorly made this movie is. Strung together with pieces of film stock or something cheap, the movie looks like a college student made it. The camerawork was nice, and the town of Silent Hill was captured nicely, especially with the constant fog. <br /> <br />While there are some creepy moments in the movie, they mostly involves sirens or flashlights. The movie came alive twice in the third act, and it was a saving grace...but not enough to make the movie good. In an extended sequence, barbed wire rips around a church, causing damage and eventually ripping people to pieces. In another scene, a flashback, we hear about a girl who was thought to be a witch, then burned. The scene is shot in a way that makes it look like a 1970's horror movie. But then themovie goes back to its extreme lack of just about everything. <br /> <br />The plot has Rose (Radha Mitchell) taking her adopted daughter Sharon to the town of Silent Hill. Sharon has been screaming the name of the town in her sleep, and Rose thinks that taking her there will help her. Silent Hill was set ablaze several years ago by a coal fire that still burns underground. At times, the fire knocks out all electricity, and featurless zombies pop out. At least I think it was the fires causing this. This is about the amount of clarity in this film. The zombies that come out from said fires are naked and can hardly walk, possibly because they drip acid blood (in a more interesting moment in my viewing experience, some girl in the very back of the theater remarked \\"Look! It's on its period!\\") But later, it is revealed that, no, the monsters are not having their time of the month, but simply are just deformed miners caught in the blasts underground. I think. <br /> <br />If you do see 'Silent Hill', which I do not endorse in any way whatsoever, then take head in my warning: DO NOT PAY FOR IT! Whether you have a free ticket to something like 'Ice Age' that you could care less about seeing, then use it to see this. But it would probably be better to do what I do whenever I am dissatisfied with a movie: sneak into another one and say it was that one that you payed for. This had a good plot and good actors that it could have put to good use, and the direction is flawless, but as it stands, 'Silent Hill' is an incomprehensible, poor, irresponsibly violent movie. <br /> <br />Running Time: 126 Minutes <br />MPAA Rating: R for strong horror violence/gore, disturbing images, and some language.
0060512806|5.0|This was my introduction to the work of Neal Stephenson, and can I just say \\"Wow.\\"  Its not just the gripping plots, or the way he so deftly interweaves them.  Its not the subject matter, or his ability to easily describe the intricacies of crytology, cave digging or Van Eck Phreaking in laymen's terms.  Its not even the choice of subject matter: WWII code wars, lost gold, the birth of the modern computers, love lost and won, international economics, or any of that.  Its the combination of all these things that make this book nearly impossible to put down.  And when you do manage to pry it out of your own hands, you will end up thinking of it, and waiting impatiently for your next chance to read more. <br /> <br />Truly a fantastic book.
B000024D4R|5.0|Roger Waters was angry in 1977. He had grown cynical with a music industry, that like the film industry, pandered to the lowest common denominator and were, for sake of profit, sucking the soul and creativity out of the art form. Roger saw mankind as falling into one of three categories of Orwellian metaphors, dogs, pigs, and sheep. I wont delve too far into that because other, better, reviewers beat me to it here and their reviews of this album make my own eloquence pale in comparison. Suffice it to say that no matter what category you fall into, it's not a favorable outlook. I don't know if I'm a dog or a pig. What I do know with ironclad certainty, is that I'm not a sheep. <br /> <br />Sheep would, as teenagers, submit to peer pressure and listen to Pink Floyd then as irrelevant middle aged men, listen to Beyonce in some desperate pathetic grasp at fading youth. God bless the Internet. For were it not for the Internet, simpleton doofus sheep like these would have no forum to vent their thoughtless bleating. <br /> <br />Rock music isn't about \\"having a good time\\". It, like all other musical genres, is about expression, or should be about expression. Michelangelo sculpted the Pieta as his expression of devout love for God. Roger Waters, with Pink Floyd, created this breathtaking album to consciously express his loathing for mankind and consciously or subconsciously express his self-loathing. A loathing that someone giving this album 1 star and an album by Beyonce 4 stars would seem to justify. If you're incapable of the music in your life having a higher purpose than \\"having a good time\\", I would urge you to go back to Beyonce and her passionless test pattern music and placate your simple soul.  <br /> <br />I guess that makes me guilty of looking down my nose at my fellow man. Judgmentalism and pretentiousness are not the same thing.  <br /> <br />Anyone who gives this stunning masterpiece 1 star to attack this great band while saying nothing about this particular CD, and most laughably of all, questioning the quality of the musicianship of the band members instantly, irrevocably and permanently damns their opinion on ALL matters to obsolescence. Pink Floyd have their detractors. And I have met many musicians who didn't care for Pink Floyd. Something as subjective as music will make legions of people not care for something no matter it's level of quality. But I have never met ANYONE who knew anything about music question Pink Floyd's musicianship. <br /> <br />Look at the other reviews and notice how many Pink Floyd fans use the word \\"underrated\\". It's the prevailing theme. It is also interesting to me that it's often said David Gilmour and the other members of Floyd besides Roger had little input in the creation of this album. That may be so but it's Gilmour's finest hour in a band with Waters. It's easily Floyd's heaviest and most guitar driven work. This is Pink Floyd's angriest and saddest album and quite possibly Pink Floyd's greatest album. <br /> <br />I pray that time has tempered Roger Water's seething hatred. I also pray that eventually time will temper mine and allow me to suffer fools gladly and be able to read the reviews of morons and not feel compelled to write one of my own in rebuttal. <br /> <br />Buy this CD and take a stand against the inexorable march of stupidity in pop culture.
B000B5IPLK|5.0|I can't even say how hot this DVD was.  I was blown away at Alicia's talent and Beauty on this joint.  Like others have said she not only went unplugged, she enhanced it.  For example on \\"A woman's worth\\" she had the guitar playin a funky melody that was absent in the original.  Another one is when she sang \\"You don't know my name\\" and in the middle of the song the band busted out the beat and melody from Black Moon's \\"Who got the props\\"!  Now I know many people won't know what the hell i'm talkin about here but if you do, then that's all I have to say to convince you that this joint is worth buying just for that.
1400079179|1.0|I disliked this book so much I could hardly finish it.<br /><br />I read a lot of thrillers. This one I read when it came into the Dutch bookstores, before it was a hype.<br /><br />The information on which this book is based is from the book \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\", which I read some twenty years ago. That was a very interesting book. Apart from that information, this thriller has a ridiculous plot, and not one interesting dialogue.<br /><br />So the real mystery to me is, why it became so sought after.<br /><br />Theo Bollerman - lover of thrillers
1592401791|4.0|This book is a good companion piece to the three \\"Beatle Anthologies\\", but it should be taken (read) with a grain of salt.<br /><br />EMI Studios in London serves as the backdrop for most of this book.  Geoff Emerick was hired there to train as a recording engineer, shortly before the Beatles first began making hits.  Emerick is uniquely qualified to write about the Beatles recording processes--- first as an observer, and then as an integral part of their later recordings.<br /><br />The distance between Emerick and the Beatles is key to this book.  His interactions with the group took place almost solely within the confines of what later came to be called \\"Abbey Road Studios\\" .  As an engineer Emerick wore a white lab coat,  and most of the time was positioned in an upper level, apart from the musicians.<br /><br />Emerick was a talented and resourceful engineer whose contributions became a big component of the \\"Beatle sound\\".  Part of his motivation for this book, it seems, is to lay out for posterity the many innovations he developed and how they enhanced  some of the Beatles' finest records.<br /><br />It's a very interesting read that will resonate with any Beatles fan.  On the downside, Emerick  comes across as rather stuffily conservative in his estimations of both the recordings, and the Beatles themselves.  He forms a bond only with Paul McCartney, and asserts that from the beginning, McCartney was the leader of the group (!)  It's quite telling that he titles the book after a McCartney song from \\"Revolver\\", the first  Beatle album that he (Emerick) engineered.<br /><br />John Lennon does get slighted a bit here, there and elsewhere, probably because for the most part his compositions weren't as lush and as likely to benefit from Mr. Emerick's services.  Thus, Emerick is dismissive of Lennon's 'rushed-out' song, \\"She Said, She Said\\",  which I think is a radically brilliant song compared to \\"Here, There, and Everywhere.\\"<br /><br />I am also one of the Beatles fans (that Emerick again dismisses) who love the \\"White Album\\".  Emerick finds the \\"White Album\\" to be anarchic...not understanding that many fans cherish it precisely because of  its breadth, and yes, its anarchy.<br /><br />Emerick more than once explains the role of an engineer as that of \\"making an environment in which an artist may flourish.\\"  But, he doesn't seem to understand that  John Lennon of all the Beatles most exemplified the temperament and conceptual thinking of an artist.  He instead is drawn to Paul McCartney, because like himself McCartney is a superior technician.... and because he's an affable bloke.  Emerick finds the other three Beatles surly, to different degrees.<br /><br />My assessment as I read the book was that Geoff Emerick is a classic \\"passive-aggressive.\\"  He praises all the Beatles with one hand, and [..]slaps them with the other--with the exception of Paul.  He also finds both kind and unkind things to say about producer George Martin.<br /><br />My advice, then, is to weigh this book along with all the rest of the accounts written about the Beatles.  It's another piece of the puzzle, but it probably isn't the definitive story.
6305807930|2.0|I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria. I like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work. It does have all his imagination but not his style. Pick it up with Phenomena and maybe youll like it but I doubt it.
B00003CXC7|5.0|For me, the most interesting aspect of this film was the relationship between the roles of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.  As the movie progresses, it becomes ever more puzzling to understand why would a woman, so incredibly intelligent, beautiful, elegant and with her own career, pursue a rude man nineteen years her senior, unkempt, with a somewhat dirty and greasy look, who treats her with sarcasm and condescension without any obvious reason.  Her behavior is even more unexplained when he tells her openly that if they parted, he would not miss her.  Yet she comes back!  And she does not impress as a submissive character, so why does she bother with him?<br /><br />I believe there is a power game between them, and her pride is hurt when he does not throw himself at her feet, perhaps he is the first man to resist her charms.  She doesn't know why but wants to discover, and she is determined to bring him to his knees, with him offering the wedding ring.  Once that happens, her game will be won and she would leave.  We can see how she takes an upper hand in the final scene, after her heroic break-in to the murderer's apartment, after that james' hero has no chance but to surrender, and immediately, as he is sleeping so obediently, like a baby, and in her care, she discards the book of their agreed-upon exotic voyages that she promised to him and turns instead to the most recent issue of Bazaar, her TRUE passion of fashion!!!  What a great battle of two egos, and poor James is totally defeated.<br /><br />His weakness and impotency is finally reveled in a scene when he sees her straggling with the murderer, and James does nothing except pathetically screaming, he is so passive at this moment, that we know his deep-hidden secret of incapacity, which is a source of his rudeness and cold reaction towards her.  We know that the power table is turning then, when she becomes a heroine and he is just a hopeless spectator and coward.  She is clearly the winner of the game.<br /><br />The film is a physiological masterpiece, and is worth watching alone for Grace's gowns..  <br /> <br />The film is a physiological masterpiece, and is worth watching alone for Grace's gowns. <br />    <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a show for the ages.  It is unbelievable how excellent it really is.  Everyone was at the top of their game -- writers, actors, directors.  I would not really call this a sci-fi series -- it's about regular people with regular problems who happen to live in a future time.  So if you don't normally watch sci-fi, don't worry about that aspect.  The humor, the depth, and ultimately, the _humanity_ in this show make it the best show I have ever seen on television, bar none.  It is a show for everybody. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and watch \\"Firefly.\\"  You will not regret it.
B00003CXA2|1.0|An absurd movie. Forrest would have been eaten alive in any neighborhood in America by swindlers or exploiters.<br /><br />People love the fantasy of a good simpleton getting along on his goodness but it ain't going to happen.<br /><br />There are a lot of fantasy fulfillment movies like this. ET. Close Encounters.<br /><br />People frequently are not aware that having their fantasy fulfilled does not necessarily make a good movie. They are so delighted to have see their fantasy come true they think that makes it a good movie. It's sort of like having someone around you who curries your favor by agreeing with everything you say. At first it might feel good but eventually you know the person is lying. In fact you can't believe anything they say because they agree with everything you say. Then they become annoying or even pathetic or sickening. Sort of like this film.<br /><br />In this case what they want is to curry your favor so they get a chunk of your money not your friendship. In other words they'll pander to you, give you what you want for money even if it's an absurd story.<br /><br />As for Hanks, ask yourself this: Is it his character you love or is it that he's tackled a difficult acting job and done it well? Is it hard to play a moron? Is it challenging to the audience? Has he challenged you? Or do you just like the characters he plays? Has Tom EVER challenged you to THINK about a character? Has he ever gotten you to like an unlikeable character or dislike a seemingly likeable charater?<br /><br />He's too smart for that. You make money in Hollywood because people like you not because you do what's right. You kiss up. Kiss up to producers. Kiss up to audiences. Kiss up to Opra. Kiss up to Leno. Get famous because people like your charaters. Don't challenge anyone's preconceived notions.<br /><br />OK the dumbos who disagree can now press the \\"not helpful\\" button, and the smart people can, at least, consider what I've written. Gee how could I have guessed so many would press the \\"not helpful\\" button!
0553103547|4.0|A Game of Thrones is quite a book. I almost didn't write a review of it, considering all the long and lengthy and accurate one's already written. But then again, why not add my two cents?<br /><br />This certainly is dark, fatalistic material. The characters are complex, the plot intricate, the writing solid. The world Martin creates is large and incredibly imaginative. By the end of a book like this there are a whole host of foreign names and expressions floating around in your mind. Images also, that haunt and taunt.<br /><br />I say \\"taunt\\" because this book doesn't wrap much of anything up. There is some plot resolution, but not much. Really, it just stops. I would've liked to have finished with a little more feeling that I'd read a complete book. This isn't that; it's a volume, and by the end if it's succeeded for you at all you're keen to get your hands on the next volume. I mean, some of the main characters in this never even meet, never effect each other at all. There stories play out in very different places. The only reason that works is because you know that they will eventually come together, maybe in book two, three, four...<br /><br />One thing I wouldn't have minded more of is description of battles. I loved Durham's Pride of Carthage for how intricate and massive and detailed the battles were, and I think Steven Pressfield does large scale battles well too. Those authors aren't writing fantasy, but after reading them I have a higher bar for how to describe epic warfare. Martin doesn't really do the big picture when it comes to the battles. He sort of just tells you what happens, or has somebody bring the news. This isn't a big complaint, but it's one reason this doesn't have the cinematic heft of Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line is that Martin has written an intelligent, complex novel that shows how gritty and imaginative fantasy can be. I'm a person who likes some genre writing (sci-fi, crime included), but I still want authors to buck against the norms and keep it interesting. Martin does that. I'm not going to buy the next book straight away, but it's nice to know that it's out there. In a few months I'll probably get a hankering to get back into this. Truth be known, I really want to see what lies beyond the Wall...authors to buck against the norms and keep it interesting. Martin does that.

B000002KD9|4.0|I`m embarressed to say that although I am a huge Neil Young fan,ever since I started writing reviews here its not until now that I am finally writing a review of a studio album (my review of Live Rust doesn`t count because its live) and it`s one of my absolute favorites.Danny Whitten was gone and Crazy Horse was no more.When not playing solo,Neil was playing with Nils Lofgren,Ralph Molina,Billy Talbot,Ben Keith and Greg Reeves and gathered from different sessions and a couple of years, it gives us several glimpses as to what direction he was heading....everywhere.  Not all the songs are homeruns but there is no downtime - the gems are scattered all around and that is why this is so good.  Tell Me Why,Birds,When You Dance,Don`t Let It Bring You Down and the title track are just a few of the outstanding tracks here.  At a time when most performers were reaching their peaks or unraveling completely,Neil,as usual,was just playing and recording with no agenda.Different moods and feelings move the album to its conclusion.Not really a must have but worth the trouble for the price...a signpost of the things to come and a lament about loss and leaving things behind and moving ahead for one reason or another.  A great Sunday morning album.
0321344758|5.0|Last term during graduate course of HCI (Human computer interaction), my professor made a WebCT forum thread called \\"HCI Resources\\". Students were to post entries ranging from web based HCI resources to newspaper articles and books which they've found useful. Krug's \\"Don't make me think\\" subtitled as \\"A common sense approach to web usability\\" has made quite a mark among the listings by multiple mentions and was highlighted in several other assignment posts. This is when I started reading it and despite the common belief that technical books are selective reads, \\"Don't make me think\\" is an addictive page turner in its right.<br /><br />Krug's book is generally based on KIS (Keep it simple) principle and is an easy read. Like the topic, book is aesthetically well designed and organized into distinct chapters addressing different topics of web usability and HCI in general.  Chapter titles are not your-usual-everyday-headlines but rather Daily Onion style ones depicting the theme discussed in the chapter. Krug's laws of usability may seem like common sense to most of us but you'd be amazed to see how many websites around us don't follow these simple guidelines to enhance the user experience.<br /><br />This two hundred page book is divided into eleven chapters and definitely deserves to be called \\"an illustrated guide on making your web presence meaningful!\\" Steve Krug has worked hard in providing us concrete details and no-fluff advice on all things web usability. With gentle wit and humor, he emphasizes on web designing for scanning instead of reading, presenting simple mindless choices to user, providing meaningful and short text and realization of business requirements for frequent changes. Along with pertaining illustrations, author has provided the reader interesting scenarios, comments, usability testing advice and web accessibility measures. For a web designer, developer, an application development manager or a technology devout CTO, this is a mind-opener towards realization of HCI's importance in the business. \\"Don't make me think\\" makes you think how important it is to understand that usability is not the enemy of design and contrary to common belief, it augments a good design. Among several acclaimed HCI books (for instance \\"User Interface Design and Evaluation - Morgan Kaufmann 2005, ISBN: 0-12-088436-4\\") and ACM papers I have been through, I've found Krug's laws to be most relevant and practical. It's a highly recommended reading for web designers, content managers, web developers and all others who utilize web as core business tool or accessorize on it.wards realization of HCI's importance in the business. \\"Don't make me think\\" makes you think how important it is to understand that usability is not the enemy of design and contrary to common belief, it augments a good design.

0446677450|3.0|way, way oversimplified.  This book had some interesting thoughts, and certainly a bit (and by a bit I mean a SMALL amount) of original insight, but it lacked any real depth or practical content.  The lessons taught here in 200 pages could have been easily presented in the course of about 40, but instead, they are repeated, reworded, and regurgitated over and over and over again to the point of near exhaustion.  The result is unfortunate--I was very interested for the first 50 or so pages, but after that the book became very tedious.  Add to that the co-author's poor writing style and 200 pages is asking an awful lot, even from someone who enjoys reading as much as I do. <br /> <br />I don't mean to say that this book is without its merits.  I enjoy reading financial books, and, having had it recommended to me several times by various people, decided to give it a shot.  As I said, I was at first intrigued.  Kiyosaki has some interesting points, but again those points are driven home over and over again.   <br /> <br />The problem I have is that I can sum up in one paragraph what I was able to get out of a book 200 pages long.  To become wealthy one needs to acquire true assets, those that increase cash flow without increasing monthly liabilities.  The best assets are the ones that create income without demanding too much of your time, such as stocks that grow or real estate that is managed for you.  Your house, a fancy car, or any other luxuries detract from cash flow, so you should never acquire those if you cannot afford to pay for them.  Set yourself up to receive excess income every month, reinvest that income in something that will actually make you money, and repeat until you're wealthy.   <br /> <br />In other words, invest and save all you can and live within your means.  Pretty simple.  The issue I have, I guess, is that this is all common sense.  The author has a few original thoughts that I was certainly appreciative of, but overall this book tells you what you should already know.  I recommend reading it if you really don't understand anything about managing your finances, and if you truly cannot grasp the concept of building assets and managing liabilities.  If that is the case, the oversimplified diagrams and watered-down examples will benefit you, I suppose.  If not, I wouldn't worry about it.  Reading a couple of Kiyosaki's columns on Yahoo Finance will give you all the insight into his theory you need.
B00002E23E|4.0|this movie is thight if your a zep fan like me.  one bad thing is the weird little movie things they show in the middle of the songs.  A really cool thing is the scenes behind the stage.  there is some cool stuff.  i totally recomend it though!!!  it captures tru zeppelin though <br />
B000DZIGDU|5.0|I hate war movies. I always have, always will. Having said that, I rarely watch war movies and have never seen such war movies as \\"Apocolypse Now\\" or \\"Platoon\\". The only reason I saw this movie was because I like Sam Mendes. Sam Mendes is an Oscar winning director (Best Director, American Beauty) and is fairly obscure. He's only directed three movies in 6 years. He carefully picks each film he does and this movie is no exception. The problem is, this movie has been unjustly billed as a war movie and it's not. It's the story of men at war in the Desert. But never do we see battle sequences portrayed in movies like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\", \\"Full Metal Jacket\\", or even \\"Cold Mountain\\". This movie is extremely entertaining, the performances are great, it's funny, and it's probably one of the biggest Oscar snubs of 2005. Hell, this movie is better than \\"Capote\\" and \\"Good Night, And Good Luck\\". Anyway, the movie is based on a memoir by Anthony Swofford, played here by Oscar nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, Brokeback Mountain). The movie opens with Swofford (or Swoff) in boot camp. The boot camp is instantly reminiscent of the one in \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" except R. Lee Ermey doesn't show up and make us laugh our a$$es off. The Boot Camp scenes are entertaining, but short lived. Swoff is transferred to the Camp Pendleton Marine Base where he meets Troy (Peter Sarsgaard, in another underappreciated performance), Kruger (Lucas Black, the kid with the weird accent from \\"Sling Blade\\"), Fergus (Brian Heraghty), Fowler (Evan Jones, better known as Cheddar Bob from \\"8 Mile\\" who seems to be playing the miltary version of that character), and Staff Sargeant Sykes (Oscar winner Jamie Foxx). Eventually, Swoff and the other men mentioned are transferred to Iraq for Operation: Desert Shield. If you're expecting them to arrive in Iraq and begin shooting Iraqui's left and right, then this isn't your kind of movie. For some odd reason, that's why I like this movie so much. It's awar movie, without being a war movie. Besides the entertainment factors, there's also the political aspect of this film. It couldn't have came out at a better time. This movie takes place when George Bush Sr.was in office, but all the events in this movie could be taking place right now. When Bush Sr. was President, the troops were fighting in Iraq. Now, Bush Jr. is in office and the troops are fighting in Iraq. Do I see a pattern here? Anyway, as I said before this movie is also pretty damn funny. The showing of \\"The Deer Hunter\\" scene was hilarious, to me anyways, and the comment Fowler makes in the shower was pretty funny. All the performances are standout; Including Gylenhaal, Foxx, Sarsgaard, Black, and Jones in no particular order. The reason Oscar ignored this film was because it was overshadowed by movies like Capote, Crash, and Brokeback Mountain. Allthough the last two are better movies. Anyway, I highly recommend this movie and it's one of the better films of 2005. <br /> <br />GRADE: A <br />

0156013983|5.0|I read this book when I was in High School a couple of years ago<br /><br />my teacher gave me a bookmark about Exuprey's famous quote.<br /><br />This book moved me soo much.<br /><br />I have always remembered fondly the book the writer and his message!<br /><br />One sees clearly only with the heart<br /><br />Anyting essential is invisible to the eyes.<br /><br />-Antoine De Saint-Exuprey<br /><br />Those two lines I will  repeat to my children.<br /><br />I am repurchasing this book mine is very worn out.
0743454537|5.0|The novel, \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is a tragic tale about a girl named Anna who all of her life, has been used as a lifeline for her sister. Her sister Kate was diagnosed with APL, a special type of leukemia, her parents plan to conceive another child so that Kate can have a related donor. Then that brings us to the present. Anna feels invisible. Like the sun in our solar system, her sister's health is what Anna's family revolves around. It seems to Anna, that everyone in her family is so busy worrying about Kate, there is no more attention left for her.  Anna finally has had enough of this treatment. She files a petition to be medically emancipated from her parents. This decision is one that rips her family apart. Also one that could mean life or death for Anna's dying sister. This book was filled with unexpected twists and interesting characters. The character's personalities touched me because they were so real.  I could relate to all of them in a way. I really liked the way that the author made each chapter be a different character's point of view. Although it was an overall excellent book, there were also things I didn't like about it. Like the fact that the book was so depressing. It seemed like every time something good happened, something bad would happen. Even though I liked the different point of views, it was sometimes very hard to follow. I would recommend this book to people thirteen years or older because it has some mature content. Overall I loved this book. It will be one story that will forever stick with me. It reminds me of how good I have it. After you read it you'll be thanking your lucky stars that you're not in that family's situation. If you read this book, trust me, you won't regret it!
0767805712|5.0|Gattaca is a seminal movie that reminds me of what is lacking nowadays with sci fi films. It's wonderfully written, directed, and acted. I have studied genetics, medicine, biology, eugenics, and philosophy. I can't tell you how many times this movie in some fashion is mentioned. I guess that is what is so powerful about this movie. The themes, much like the music, are recapitulated. Destiny, genes, life, fate- it's all so powerfully incorporated in the movie and how science/medicine thinks.  <br /> <br />It is no surprise to anyone that the discoverer of the structure of DNA, James Watson- once said, \\"our future is in our genes.\\" There is a genetic determinism that pervades our country, our way of thinking. Whether it is said inadvertently thru the way we are more and more reliant on genetic markers for labeling diseases or how we are nowadays discovering more and more ways to meddle with our genes. Science has in some sense become a religion. Genes are our predetermined fate.  <br /> <br />It is this issue that GATTACA hammers at or chips away at brillantly and relentlessly. There is no gene for free will/ for desire/ for ambition. We aren't just our genes. We are a product of our upbringing, our environment, and heriditary predispositions. We are more than just a sum of different characteristics, traits that can be tagged to a repeated sequence in our DNA. There is no science for personality or for fate.  <br /> <br />The acting in GATTACA is superb, understated (I know, enough with the superlatives). Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman have real chemistry. They play their roles with ease that fits the speakeasy, minimalist style of the movie. Jude Law has easily his best performance in GATTACA.  <br /> <br />The music or score by Michael Nyman- swoons and fits the dark but ultimately uplifting mood of the movie. Much of it is recapitulation- the scores repeat the same themes of struggle, persistence and sorrow.  <br /> <br />I am also impressed in the details of the movie. The double helix DNA stair cases in the apartment. The movie's title is written in DNA nucleotides.  <br /> <br />This movie did not translate well in the box office but it had a real impression/influence in both our culture and understanding of science.
B00005JNQA|2.0|Seldom has an ending been so disappointing and ruined a good film as this one. <br /> <br />For most of the way, this was a slick thriller, nicely photographed and nicely acted. Sean Penn is outstanding in here. I like to see him play low-key characters instead of hot-headed sleazeballs. Nicole Kidman also gives a good performance. Sometimes her classic beauty hides the fact she can act.  <br /> <br />The story was pretty involving, hard to put down once you've started. My only complaint up to the ending was the obvious plug for the United Nations. This looked a public relations piece for that organization. <br /> <br />However, then came that ending - a real insult to anyone's intelligence. In a nutshell, nobody would go the extremes they went to here to protect a visiting dignitary, using all that manpower and machinery....and then leave him all alone in a room at the end! Are you serious??? It was unbelievably stupid and ruined what had been an entertaining and somewhat- smart film.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|Jay-Z didn't make a mistake when he signed Rihanna as a recording artist. This young girl has a lot of potential, and throughout her second album, she lives up to most of it, with only a few missteps. While it is arguable that A GIRL LIKE ME is any better than MUSIC OF THE SUN, Rihanna seems more serious and more focused in some respects on her second round.  She isn't afraid to be more urban or more adult contemporary here. Ultimately, Rihanna shows of her pipes more here than her debut.<br /><br />The production is exceptional with more adult contemporary oriented arrangements with acoustic guitars, piano, and strings, to reggae-centric productions featuring nicely produced tropical drums, to staight up urban dance pop arrangements with looped synth lines.  Anyway it happens, the production is one of the strong points of this album.  Besides that, there seems to be more credible hit material here, especially at the forefront of the album.  \\"S.O.S.\\" is a brilliant way to open the album dodging the straightfoward reggae of \\"Pon De Replay\\" for a more urban sounding dance pop anthem.<br /><br />\\"S.O.S.\\" leads a string of other hits.  Following it is the incredibly strong \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\", one of the strongest of the entire album.  \\"Unfaithful\\" follows suit as the adult contemporary ballad.  The album falls a bit flat with \\"We Ride\\", but it doesn't kill the momentum  as the huge hit \\"Dem Haters\\" picks up the slack.  Later on, hits like \\"Break It Off\\" feat. Sean Paul and \\"A Million Miles Away\\" keep the album from dying where some weaker material lingers.  It is the weaker material that keeps Rihanna's album from being better than it is as the strongest material is incredibly KILLER.<br /><br />However, despite some inperfections, I think that fans will love Rihanna's second album, maybe even more than the first. I love the fact that Rihanna is keeping the tropical side of pop alive where many have opted only for American pop as opposed to the sounds of the Carribean and so and so forth.  Very nice album in my opinion.  3.5-4 stars.arribean and so and so forth.  Very nice album in my opinion.  3.5-4 stars.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception.  <br /> <br />Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a \\"60 Minutes\\" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer \\"Lowell Bergman,\\" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist \\"Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,\\" and Christopher Plummer as \\"Mike Wallace\\" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film. <br /> <br />There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It's simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann's \\"Heat,\\" except without the violence. <br /> <br />The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that's not surprising being it's about \\"60 Minutes.\\" I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program. <br /> <br />Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making
B00000294R|5.0|Lifestylez ov da poor and dangerous can be seen as an extension to the fact that the mid 90's was the golden era for hiphop. A Landmark in its own right, it put Big L on the map as one of the most potentially talented MC's around. Filled with superior and legendary punchlines, dark beats courtesy of hiphop legends like Diamond D & showbiz, & of course Big L's trademark witty flow and style this album CANNNOT be ingored by any fan of that NY hiphop sound. If you're looking for an album that hits you on first listen and makes you dive for the rewind button in an effort to re-live the supreme talent you thought you just heard, then Big L -Lifestylez ov da poor & Dangerous needs to be in your collection.

B000ESST6U|5.0|This is the fourth \\"Cesare\\" I watched.  It is the most complete of all performances on DVD - the music lasts nearly 4 hours, an hour more than the Baker recording. Sound and picture are excellent, sounds like a good cd. <br />William Christie conducts the wonderful score with expertise and flexibility. No need to praise the orchestra - they are among the best.  <br />We are in an age of countertenors, but the role of Cesare is given to an alt - Sarah Conolly. Her very good singing does not erase memories of Janet Baker, but her acting is more persuasive. All the singers are experts, and Cleopatra (Danielle de Niese) outshines them all. She leads a production of not only high artistic value, but also a great entertainment. <br />For this the credit must also go to he stage director McVicar and the choreographer.All in all, a first rate evening at the opera. <br /> <br />
B0002WYS6S|3.0|Yeah, these guys sure can play fast. But it would be great if there was more going on here than just finger burning speed. And Labrie could be singing in Japanese and it wouldn't make that much difference. If this band is ever going to attract more than a cult following then they'll definitely need a charisma upgrade. The only guy on stage who seems to be having any fun is the drummer. I swear these guys are so into their instruments that it looks like a rehearsal. And any singer who isn't playing an instrument definitely needs to get out from behind the mic stand. You can play every scale in the book but you still need a tune.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|king kong was one of my favorite movies of all time.  If you like emotional movies you will like this one too. I was sobbing at the end.  King kong, or \\"the beast\\" as jack black calls him in the movie, comes off, at first, as some sort of monster.  We see later though, as he forms a relationship with naomi watts, that he is capable of love and emotion.  I was in love with the movie by the time it ended.  I know you will be too.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|now im not telling you its so good you want to watch it over and over for fun but to figure out the complete story not that im sawing its a bad movie its great but kinda confusing. it all about time travle. not like back to the future time travle but diffrent. so still buy it or atleast rent it a few times.
B000BCKFWK|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Robert Rodriguez' \\"Sin City\\" is a highly stylized adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller (who, along with Quentin Tarentino, assisted Rodriguez in the directing).  The film draws its look and inspiration from those old film noir movies from the 1940's, the ones set in dark, rain-soaked, crime-infested cities and narrated in florid fashion by a world-weary private investigator or gumshoe.  \\"Sin City\\" has that in spades along with deliberately arch dialogue, self-conscious acting and a visual schemata designed to knock your eyes out.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" tells the episodic tale of three virtually unrelated \\"super heroes\\" (played by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke) who take on crime and corruption in what is, as the title implies, a veritable metropolitan den of vice and iniquity.  The three leads are supplemented by Rosario Dawson, Josh Hartnett, Benicio Del Toro, Elijah Wood and Rutger Hauer in various smaller roles.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is far more about style than it is about substance, and, indeed, the story is the least engaging aspect of the film, often becoming repetitious and aimless and devoid of cohesion and unity.  The look of the film, however, is what keeps us interested.  Filmed primarily in black-and-white, the movie adds splotches of color at key moments and for various thematic purposes and relies heavily on rear screen projection to give it just that right post-modern/retro look it needs to be effective.  As in the \\"Kill Bill\\" movies, the violence in the film is graphic but so highly stylized that we never take any of it very seriously, although there may be just a tad too much dismemberment for some people's taste - though, strangely, the people who are killed never seem to stay dead for very long in this movie.  The art direction is less sensational than it is in many of these comic book movies, but the streamlined simplicity of the look keeps it from overwhelming the film.<br /><br />The child molestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film.  Still, this is an intriguing and generally entertaining comic book movie that really does a good job recreating the look of the source material on which it is based.lestation theme that runs through the movie may be off-putting to some and it does result in a few queasy moments later on in the film.

B0000YEEGM|5.0|[Rainman]<br /><br />This was a profound movie about a completely bizarre outcome (a relatively erratic data point) in the phenomenon of what is loosely diagnosed as autism.  The savant Raymond is probably in the top five, best performances in film or stage, ever.  Dustin Hoffman is outstanding, a talent in class by himself.  Actor Tom Cruise is becoming more and more an interesting fixture on the American media scene; i.e. a public personality.<br /><br />The more elaborate, dictionary definition is `autism spectrum disorder', why such unique description?  Because it's such a varyingly spread, or spectrum-like ROY G BIV of impairment it is a medical cause still basically poorly understood.<br /><br />Somewhere along the way, this movie picked up enough popularity to become cultural literacy, and in turn distorted what the public really takes for understanding the disorder of autism.  Take the book:  \\"The thing about the dog and ...etc...\\"  by Marc Hadden (upside down black poodle on pink jacket, can't miss it); that author actually tries to capture some of the myth momentum generated by the film Rainman and other spotlight stories in the media showcasing the so called `idiot savant'--not a very humane, and I think out of use label.  True freak of natural capacity somewhere in them.  Yet not all developed memory stems from people who are otherwise, more or less mentally retarded, requiring supervised care.  Patrick Stewart, the actor, can read and act all parts of the Dickens play `A Christmas Carol', on stage, in person, from memory.<br /><br />You don't have to be `dumb', to be smart...let's remember...in case anti-intellectualism tries too hard to popularize that misconception.  There is no reason to surrender your unenumerated rights of conscience to a second class citizen status just because you will do your own thinking about things.  We have no idea what grave danger a society is in when the wheeze box of the media propaganda starts to manufacture such conformity for the people's raw intelligence.  This is what George Orwell wrote about in his novel \\"1984\\".  Oh yeeeeee'ees!--has come home to roost.  Otherwise anybody who thinks they know something is automatically dismissed, why?  Because they're obviously speaking without a license to do so and must therefore be some babbling mental incompetent.  Don't let the Snot's Sector for Immoral Abuses pull that con on you.<br /><br />Most autistics are not so unusual.  They form part of the population of challenged and exception people who struggle with enormous disadvantages each and every day--and not pulling off feats of extraordinary computation or selective recall; by in large, incoherent and unable to interact in the mainstream.  Fortunately there is still enough humanity in this society to provide substantial care giver support and a happier life for them, housing and activities, nursing and so on.<br /><br />The mentally retarded, portrayed in this false light of super-human intellectual skills, is a double disservice deception:  it tries to disguise epidemic casualty in epidemiology as some heroic fantasy (in order to go on manufacturing those victims with obvious mass population fluoropoisoning), while it recycles the aftermath to chide the idea the public has any recourse to reasoning.<br /><br />That is unfortunately how ugly the situation is where populations are being parasitized by predators lurking amongst them.  The predator does not want exposure it is preying and profiting through human destruction and ramified corruptions its dirt imposes on the institutions of law enforcement and government, even mainstream religious organizations, the health organization and disaster response professionals (who weren't `born yesterday' either).  Therefore that predator has to invent a conspiracy that no one can ever expose it for what it is.  Nobody else, (by definition), from that point forward, can have the intellectual capacity to fathom the mastery of its world-beateragenda.  They are Aldous Huxley's indulgent `Alphas', the favorite children of a malevolent system of socialistic fascism in the living novel \\"Brave New World\\"--there's more than one way to suffocate the perfectly manageable gradation of intelligence in the population.  But that industrial syndicate will inevitably be caught by its own avalanching evil exploits.  Too many epidemics, too many dead babies, too many rube-frauds so idiotic in pretense it makes people ashamed to see adult collaborators put on an act for it, like it's perfectly ok;  too much lingering advancement of knowledge leaking into public education.  `Who authorized they teach the autonomic nervous system in those worthless American public secondary schools, or any anatomy!?', the most grotesque opportunists are always in for their ultimate upending, especially when their operation requires closing down public education in order to insure the public doesn't think.  In the lah'lah land of Happy Valley Mormon Utah, that fantasy has obviously been too temptingly believable, that is why Utah is one of the escape patterns for that titanic political corruption's movement in America, a holed-up, out in nowhere hideaway, a sovereign haven where enormity might still be able to escape the light of day.<br /><br />Science, as it must be contorted to the whims of ultimate corruption, is centered on the authority to pontificate `intelligent design' to school kids, or for what the uneducated, at least unaware public will mistake for the only debate or branch of science.

B000002OHF|4.0|Argus was a hard record to follow.. My favorites on this one are Ballad of the beacon, and Sorrel. and a couple of others.. Being a fan I hate to knock them but only a few good ones  here, so pick them up on the \\"Time Was\\" CD...I did also find the sound quality kind of tinny (live sounding)on a few cuts, but not as out right bad as one previous review found it.. No doubt not a outstanding album/CD... Chris
B000062X90|5.0|This is my favorite of the bands material up to the Late 70's..The King will Come and Warrior have such searing drama and deliverly.. These two really do it for me and truely represents some of their finest work,, The rest of the songs are very good and the whole CD is listenable from start to finish..What can I say?  Wishbone Ash really has a style that is very relevent and will give most current groups a real run for their money.. Taste full guitar work and vocals that are unrivaled in the current rock scene.. I love most hard rock and metal but.. Wishbone has a class and style not duplicated by anyone else yet,, Did I mention they actually can sing!! Ya sing, not grabbing their crotches and yelling what or who the heck knows what!! ..Love those Guitars this CD has got them.. A great album/CD from a under rated talent that should have become bigger than they are but have  almost been foregotten, by the flavor of the month media, and crazy world of the music scene that has not recognized them for the super talent they have... enjoy.. this Cd rocks and talks...Chris
B000EULJLU|4.0|Since Tool are one of the best bands ever, and since they make new music about once every five years, I think it deserves to be a national holiday when a new Tool album is released. Ten years ago, Maynard and his band made their flawless junior album, \\"Aenima\\"; then, in 2001, they released \\"Lateralus,\\" which I consider to be the best hard rock/metal album of this millennium. And now, flash forward another five years, and we have one of the most anticipated releases of 2006, Tool's fifth disc, \\"10,000 Days.\\"<br /><br />Call me crazy if you must, but I expected better. Each new Tool album has been better than the last one, but \\"10,000 Days\\" is the first exception to that rule. It may be because we had to wait so long for new music from these guys, or it may be that it's over 77 minutes in length, but I kind of get antsy when listening to this C.D.<br /><br />\\"10,000 Days\\" continues the melodic path which Tool first chose to take on \\"Lateralus.\\" So, since their last two albums have been on the progressive side, it seems this band is becoming more and more experimental, and is thus kind of ignoring their heavy side. In fact, this might be Tool's softest album. Frontman Maynard James Keenan further explores his feminine side by singing in a very limpid voice, and his lyrics are quite a bit more sensitive (maybe even religious) than usual. Plus, even though guitarist Adam Jones sprinkles on a few good riffs here and there, most of the songs are quite slow and ambient. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, because all bands should evolve and change their sound, but \\"10,000 Days\\" ultimately seems like an overly long, largely anti-climactic and sometimes uneventful continuation of \\"Lateralus.\\"<br /><br />The album opens with two semi-heavy songs. The lead single, \\"Vicarious,\\" is quite awesome. It starts out slowly before a hefty, angular, almost explosive riff is injected into the mix. The song then descends and broods before again leaping in volume a little while later. \\"Jambi\\" features crunchy, churning guitars and a cool, robotic sound effect, but it ends kind of abruptly and doesn't really seem to go anywhere.<br /><br />The next three songs are very soothing and atmospheric. \\"Wings For Marie (Part 1)\\" has deep, supple, almost growly crooning by Maynard. But, unfortunately, the eleven minute long title track seems like a filler song and a \\"Lateralus\\" b-side. Track five, \\"The Pot,\\" boasts impressive, clean, almost falsetto singing and prog-ish guitar strings.<br /><br />\\"Lipan Conjuring\\" (which sounds Native American) and \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)\\" are both weird and somewhat creepy interludes. Tool had the right idea by putting the disc's shortest songs in the middle of the album like this (\\"10,000 Days\\" would probably be exhausting to listen to without these songs.)<br /><br />Next, \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" sounds like Tool circa 1996 (the \\"Aenima\\" era), because it features pounding riffs and a catchy, lurching/staccato rhythm. But even though this song (and all of the heavy songs on here) sounds quite awesome, Tool insist on plunging back into melodic territory for the proceeding song. \\"Intension\\" is sort of in the same vein as \\"Disposition\\" (track ten on \\"Lateralus\\"), because it has light, dwindling strings, soft hand percussion, and gentle singing.<br /><br />\\"Right In Two\\" might be the best track on this album. It is one of the few songs which actually has a memorable climax. Its  big crescendo makes the song gradually become heavier, and it finishes with big, stomping, almost Meshuggah-esque power chords.<br /><br />Lastly, \\"Viginti Tres\\" is a long outro which isn't worth listening to more than once because it seems like another filler song, and it goes in one ear and out the other.<br /><br />\\"10,000 Days\\" is a good album (it mops the floor with the vast majority of the other music released this year). But it fails to lift the bar for Tool (it might even be Tool's weakest record), it isn't instantly or completely satisfying, and somefans will surely be disappointed with it. So, for any other band, \\"10,000 Days\\" is a very good album, but for Tool, it's a sidestep.<br /><br />Also, be warned of one last thing: this album is a creeper. Having owned it for about a week before it was officially released, I know that this C.D. isn't very easy to digest, so it will thus take time (maybe several days of repeated listens) to fully absorb. But it will grow on you and sink under your skin a little more with each repeated hearing. So come prepared when listening to this disc in its entirety: be well rested, well fed, take some ADD medicine, and maybe even have a bed pan at your side.000 Days\\" is a very good album, but for Tool, it's a sidestep.    Also, be warned of one last thing: this album is a creeper.

B000EULJLU|1.0|Have the past 2 albums been an elaborate cruel joke?<br /><br />Lateralus made me laugh out loud. I merely assumed it was a rushed afterthought during the APC tour schedual and quietly hoped it'd be the last from TOOL so they could save embarrassing themselves further.<br /><br />Opiate and Undertow were brilliant and manifold. Aenima was Art. Lateralus was a joke. This album is a slap in the face. This mediocre piece of trash is an act of violence against fans that were there from the beginning and Maynard's lyrics wax like I imagine the diary of a 16 year-old goth girl sallies forth into the annoying cliche'd not-so-deep void of a contrived and generic sadclown soul with a limited vocabulary gleaned from years of other bad music and high-school dropouts for an emotional pipeline.  Though highly skilled and undeniably complex, this music sounds like the recycled crescendi of Lateralus and a few APC riffs with a touch of Audioslut meets the worst lyrics I've heard in years--worse than the latest cookie-cutter mainstream rap even and on the same footing as contemporary country music.<br />\\"So shine on forever silent vampire TV monster, etc.\\" or whatever verbally-handicapped nonsense you're vomiting over the rest of the band's hard work.<br /><br />The present over-all rating of 4+ stars is a perfect manifestation of how mindblowingly herdlike the general public is and how willing they are to blindly accept this tripe and line the laughing gladhander's greasy pockets. Here's to you Maynard. I don't blame you for what you've done, you're disgustingly rich now. Live it up. Plant your vineyards. [And] May you live for many many more years and put out 10,000 more lazy awful stanzas.  I just won't be subjecting myself to it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I am a big Tool fan, and although I do believe this album isn't as good as Lateralus or Aenima, it is not that far away.  After reading some reviews, I'm really not surprised some critics have bashed this album, but it is truly unwarranted.  Here are just some notes about the album that I've heard critics complain about:   <br /> <br />Although this CD does have many 'filler' songs, the length is nearly 80 minutes, and while these songs do take up a good portion of that 80 min, how many bands today put out a 40 min album?  In my mind, this should not be an issue, as every Tool album has these tracks that are not representitive of Tool's music, but of their uniqueness and interesting behaviors. <br /> <br />The music is still incredibly involved, so even if you do not like their music, it is absurd that anyone would try and bash it for not being good music.  Adam Jones, Danny Carey and Justin Chancellor are amazing musicians, and Maynard definitely adds a unique touch with his lyrics and voice.  Again, I understand not everyone likes Tool, but you can't say the music they put together is trash.  Although I don't agree with the whole list, there is a reason Adam Jones made Rolling Stone's top 100 guitarists of all time. <br /> <br />Compared to all the watered down rock that is out there today, Tool slowly crafts their music, which makes it better than some contemporaries, such as Disturbed and Staind.  In a recent review, someone compared this album to these bands, as well as Godsmack, which is somewhat insulting. <br /> <br />With that said, this is a very good album... my favorite song(s) is the Wings for Marie/10,000 days epic. <br />
B000EDWL82|5.0|Anyone who's really into this kind of music can spot the differences a mile away, between Editors and the bands they're often compared to. I'll spare you the name-dropping, since you only need look at 99% of the other reviews to see it. Be assured though, that they DO sound different. It just takes a few listens to realize it. While the guitar distortion and the vocal styles do sound a bit reminiscent of a few others, Editors distinctly have their own flavor. They use very different guitar work despite the similar distortion, they use interesting beats, they sing about different issues, and hey, get this...the singer doesn't sound like he's bored! Tom Smith belts out his tunes with *feeling*, a rarity today in bands like this. <br /> <br />Besides, if they're supposedly clones of a ton of other \\"noir rock\\" bands, then why do I like 'The Back Room' so much better than the other albums they're compared to?  <br /> <br />I think the people who dismiss them because of their sound haven't actually given this album a full listen or three. I \\"kind of\\" liked it at first glance, but upon repeated listens, this album grews on me so fast. I initially liked the single 'Munich' above others, but 'Bullets', 'Lights', 'Fingers in the Factories', 'Open Your Arms', and...well, the entire rest of the album has shown me that they're perfectly capable of putting forth a solid rock effort. <br /> <br />10 years ago, everyone at first said Stone Temple Pilots sounded exactly like Pearl Jam before anyone knew about 'grunge' or 'alternative'. How wrong they were then, and how wrong they are now; Editors have their own style, and 'The Back Room' is a gem.
B000EULJLU|4.0|TOOL is by far my favorite band and i would never question what they do but i think this album could have been heavier. Def doenst feel like they were listening to musshuga like they said they were. Too much quiet singing from MJK. Its def a headphones type of CD not a crusing down the street record. Vicarious, Jambi, and Rosetta Stoned, are the best tracks. Good album and obviously noe Aenemia but still TOOL through and through
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam is my all time favorite band with some of my favorite albums. They have suffered from very inconsistant records in recent recordings. Binaural and Riot Act both had songs that were some great but mixed with songs that were mediocre at best.  <br /> <br />Pearl Jam have again hit their stride. Its a great rock album. For those of you who prefer the slower more introverted style this album may not be for you. Its about time they regrouped and came out with a cohesive album. I think its the best since yield and better than no code.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is back with a vengeance!  This CD is a lot more raw and in your face than anything off Lateralus.  Below is my track by track review.  Enjoy!<br /><br />Vicarious - I've heard a lot of complaints about this song.  Personally, I think it is brilliant!  Some people have said that it is too assessable for it to be Tool material...Schism anyone?  This song fits all three categories that make up a Tool song:  It has rollercoaster-like speed changes, weird time signatures, and is like nothing else on the radio.  Excellent jump start to the CD!  ~9~<br /><br />Jambi - When I first heard the opening riff, I honesty didn't think it was Tool.  It sounded almost too heavy and not something that I'm used to hearing from Adam.  Then, when Maynard's smooth and clear vocals come in, it is a perfect balance to the song.  Adam also introduces a talk box for the first time, which turns out wonderfully.  When I read Adam's interview in Guitar World I was worried it would sound like Bon Jovi, but thankfully it doesn't.  He makes it still sound like Tool.  Great listen!  ~9~<br /><br />Wings for Marie - This song reminds me a lot of Parabol in a way.  Not that it sounds anything like Parabol, but it just paves the way to a better, similarly related, song.  It's also a lot longer than Parabol and goes heavy one time near the end.  Awesome guitar riff that you'll hear more of in the next song.  ~8.5~<br /><br />10,000 Days - WOW!  Now this is what I would call a masterpiece.  I dare you to listen to this at night through earphones with all the lights off and no distractions.  The rain and thunder in the background will suck you into the mood and Adam, Justin, Danny, and Maynard will lead you into a false sense of security.  The lyrics are amazingly heartfelt and probably Maynard's most heart wrenching work to date.  The song, as well as Wings for Marie, is about his mother, Judith Marie, who had a stroke and was in a wheelchair for roughly 10,000 days.  This one clocks in over 11 minutes, but doesn't seem that long when listening to it.  ~10~<br /><br />The Pot - If I would have written a review right after I heard this song for the first time I would have given it a 5 or 6 at most.  However, after giving it a little more time, I have come to love it.  It opens with just Maynard singing.  Very shortly after, the bass comes in with him to make for a very interesting start.  This is the only song on the CD in standard 4/4 and is probably the most radio friendly.  I expect everyone will be getting a dose of it on your local radio station after Vicarious has run its course.  ~8~<br /><br />Lipan Conjuring - Weird lead-in full of Indian chanting.  It's okay on the first listen, but quickly becomes a skipper.  I blame my short attention span.  ~2~<br /><br />Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) - Again, another lead-in, but this one is better.  It has a quiet guitar riff with feedback in the background and a doctor and nurse conversing near the end.  ~6~<br /><br />Rosetta Stoned - HOLY CRAP!  Now this song is wicked!  If you take \\"Ticks and Leeches,\\" \\"Hooker with a Penis,\\" \\"H,\\" and \\"Third Eye\\" and throw them into a blender, this is what you get.  It starts off with Maynard singing/talking so fast you can't understand what he's saying.  This is a monster song which sounds like two similar songs forged into one.  After Maynard says, \\"I didn't even graduate from f***ing high school,\\" it becomes a totally different piece.  It reminds me a lot of Third Eye from here on out, and even has a comparable riff with a slightly different time signature.  This song had to grow on me, but now is one of my favorites.  Be patient with this one, even though (like 10,000 Days) it does clock in at over 11 minutes.  ~9.25~<br /><br />Intension - Reminds me a lot of Disposition, but it's not quite as good.  It is slow with some barely distorted guitar playing and Maynard singing melodically as only he can.  While the song is good as a whole, it just hasn't grabbed me like the restof the album.  It sounds like this should have been on Lateralus or even a Lateralus B-side.  It just doesn't seem to fit with the 10,000 Days theme (my opinion).  ~5~<br /><br />Right In Two - This is Forty-Six & 2 and Jimmy's little brother.  It has a riff in it towards the end that is very similar to Forty-Six & 2.  Of course that's not a bad thing considering its big brother is an awesome track.  This is quite possibly the best song on the CD.  It rocks when it needs to and holds back when it needs to.  Danny's drumming is simply amazing and Maynard's lyrics fit the song like heated underwear fresh from the dryer.  They seem to touch on how mankind has a tendency to screw things up.  \\"Monkeys killing monkeys killing monkeys over pieces of the ground.  Silly monkeys give them thumbs they make a club and beat their brother down.\\"  Can't miss the Cain and Able reference.  ~10~<br /><br />Viginti Tres - Another space filler with weird Halloween type noises.  Scary, but skipped often.  ~2~<br /><br />Even though this album is not better than AEnima, it is my second favorite Tool CD.  I give the entire CD a 9 and I can't wait to hear some of the new material live!  My only complaint is there doesn't seem to be enough real songs on it.  I wish we would have gotten at least one more awesome song instead of three space fillers.  I would recommend buying it ASAP.  There maybe songs you don't like on first listen, but give them a chance because you will probably grow to love them.  Besides, its just music and music is supposed to entertain.  The entertainment level is high on this one and Tool does not disappoint!  I just hope the next wait doesn't last five years.d me like the rest of the album.

B000002HMH|2.0|The truth is Metallica I think are more in it for the money than the music. That wasn't the case back in the day. They were all about the music. Personaly I thought Metallica were fine just the way they were. Metallica were better as a metal band not what they are now. I respect that the band wanted to go a different direction for a little while but it is time to go back to their roots.In my opinion bands shouldn't change their sound. Once a band has a decent formula they should stick to it. But as far as Metal is concerned it is very much alive if you open up your eyes. If Metal was dead there wouldn't be bands like Iced Earth, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Metal Church, Helloween, Judas Priest and Moterhead. I could go on forever but you get the point. Also I wouldn't say that Metallica invented thrash. There were plenty of others that did thrash before Metallica did. To name one I would say Moterhead played thrash before Metallica did like their song Ace of Spades. Not to mention Anthrax came out around the same time as Metallica did and you can put them in the thrash catergory. But to get to this album this doesn't fall in the metal or thrash catergory it is more like grunge.  Don't get me wrong there is some good songs on here but they still fall short. The songs are lacking and song writings to me are weaker than in the past. I must say I do like Saint Anger better than this album and Reload because they went back to a heavier sound. but the downfall was poor production. I did miss the guitar solos on Saint Anger because Kirk Hammet is awesome on lead guitar. But after a feel listens I did not mind. But to get back to this album if you are a fan of classic Metallica you may not like this album. Borrow it from a friend before buying it to make sure it will be something you will like.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ill keep this short.  Great Album.  But you should allready know that.<br /><br />I believe this album sounds alot like Undertow, But with the prog-psych stuff from lateralus.  And it includes some really cool feedback stuff that sounded like a few from songs off Aenima.<br /><br />The 'TOOL' sound is definatly here.  Adventurous but listenable.<br /><br />Maynard is really stretching out on this album.  He does more singing, yet less singing, and a whole mix of really interesting and emotional things.
B000AA305M|4.0|Bought the album because I wanted something with a melancholic sound. Nice cover-art also contributed as I am not familiar with David Gray. At first listen the CD had some good songs and some ok. Some were really bad. This is a CD that requires you to listen 5 times through, and then they are all good songs. Highlights are: Hospital Food, Alibi and Ain't no love. If you like music that is easy to listen to, but still has its own sound, I can highly recommend it.
0887307280|5.0|I have owned a small business for over 1.5 years now, as a one-man web development shop.  For the past few months I have come to the realization that my current way of doing things will lead down one of two paths: frustration at working all the time for not a lot of money, or closing shop and finding a job.  A couple of business partners recommended this book to me within the last two months, and so I bought it.  I can only say that what happened next was the best part of owning a business for me so far ... reality checks and awakenings to what could be.<br /><br />As I read through the book, Gerber pointed out things about how most small business owners are \\"technicians\\" turned business owners; the problem, we may be skilled in what we do, but now we take on multiple jobs that we do NOT know how to do.  The problem continues as we immerse ourselves in the \\"technician\\" work, but never actually work ON the business, so many aspects of the business suffer (sales, marketing, finances, operations) or just plain don't exist.<br /><br />In the first part of the E-Myth, Gerber discusses finding the balance of our inner selves: the Entrepreneur, the Manager, and the Technician, and the responsibilities that each of these roles must take on to drive the business toward success, as well as some pitfalls that each face unless there is a cooperative effort by each within you to work ON, not IN, the business.<br /><br />The second part of the E-Myth talks about the Franchise Prototype.  While this sounds like Gerber is going to talk about how to build a franchise, it's not!  What he discusses here is the importance of setting up your initial (and perhaps for many, the only) company the right way ... YOUR way.  This will inevitably lead to the \\"prototype\\" company, so that, in theory, you can take that business system and replicate once, twice, 5000 times ... always running the \\"system\\" the same way in each business.<br /><br />The third, and final, part of the book guides you through the system that you will think through, the business processes that make up your business system, so that the business can run ... even without you in it!  It talks about this becoming your own turn-key solution so that you have a business model in place that your system can effectively reproduce, as you need to.<br /><br />I took about a week to read through the book and soak in much of what Gerber has to say in it.  Gerber includes interesting examples, and the book is very easy to read and understand ... and most importantly, incredibly enjoyable.  While some of the text in describing his interaction with a particular business owner is a bit over the top, it doesn't detract from the primary message of the book.  I will read it again, and have already begun to get my (new) business system in place.  I now have plans to grow my company, and have the vision of what my company will look like.  The fog has already started to lift, and the steps are being put into place to reach the success that I have been longing to reach.<br /><br />If you have, or are planning to start, a small business, this really is a fantastic book, and should be manditory reading.  If you have a successful business in place, and don't agree with this book, please remember one thing before you post a negative review ... you are in the absolute minority of small business owners due to the fact that most small businesses fail within the first 3-5 years; due in large part to NOT having a system in place that helps drive the business.  Most small business owners would most definitely benefit from reading this book, if for no other reason than the awareness of where they are and where they could be.<br /><br />Thanks to Michael Gerber for such an eye-opening experience, and a viable blueprint.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|It came in the mail today... always happy with the early arrival of a highly anticipated album.... <br /> <br />Opening the \\"Ten Club\\" package, I tried to suppress my concern in the choice of the album cover; however still excited to see it in the flesh (note= this is what I love about a real album. Touch, feel, smell taste-- in addition to the sound. I just haven't had a digital experience on any level like opening a real physical album - I'm open for any arguments though). It's a unique blue fade cover over a split open avocado. What gives? I still have not gotten the artistic point of this giant green-filled nut, but maybe it will hit me over the next few days. Also, I'm not quite sure of the point of the self-titled album title, \\"Pearl Jam\\". I guess the Beatles did this a few years into their career with the white album, but this isn't the Beatles. Only PJ. Apparently, the boys, I guess wanted to get back to their roots. Thus the simple, self titled title. The White album was the beginning of the end of the Beatles. Hopefully not PJ. We shall see. Maybe we can call it the \\"blue album\\", or the \\"avocado album.\\"  <br /> <br />Inside the album... typical PJ type-font for the lyrics and the standard hand-written EV style for the song titles and the song-writing credits... <br /> <br />The artwork is very dark... think: bald man meets CG drawn puzzle pieces in a dark semi-bloody scene from \\"Dawn of the Dead\\". The only discernable photo of the band is on the CD slip case (Oh, dig the packaging... very similar to the David Gilmour \\"On and Island\\" album; just with the slip holder instead of the rubber center holder- I love this type of booklet-album). The last photo is basically the heads of the band members... kind of creepy I guess... Its okay, I really am a bit more partial to their \\"No Code\\" picture collage. That is their best album cover / package design for sure. <br /> <br />Okay... onto the music.... <br /> <br />Life Wasted - Eddie / Stone tune. It rocks, good album starter... The boys have listening to quite a bit of Who lately... well, I guess they always listened to the who I guess. This song could have been written 20 years ago... I dunno, it has a nice heavy sound... Nice Guitar solo pre-second chorus... Can't wait to hear this live. Dig the slow groove as the bridge. Wish I heard more of these overall.... <br /> <br />World Wide Suicide - Yall all know the song. One of the top on the album. Love Eddies lyrics. <br /> <br />Comatose - Totally Guitar driven, yelled chorus, reminds me of spin the black circle ... \\"Feel it rising\\" Yea keep it rocking <br /> <br />Severed Hand- Reverse guitar on intro and goes into Matts tom drum workings. Then it starts to sound like the other three songs riff-driven rocking out Chorus has a nice decent progression. Arcade sounding guitar comes out during the second verses. It gets a little annoying after it comes in again. Great outro guitar solo!!! All over the place. <br /> <br />Marker in the Sand - More guitar riff over Matts Tom-hi-hat jam. Now you got both sides claiming killing in Gods name; but God is no-where to be found, conveniently. More great lyrics Eddie is on top of it, as always. I can hear the end of this jamming out live. It sounds very Who-ish at the end (this is going to be a common theme). Finally hear some Boomer organ at the end. <br /> <br />Parachutes- One of the few acoustic songs on the albums. Simple groove. Love the chords in the chorus, especially when Eddie hits high One of my favs right now. <br /> <br />Unemployable - Reminds me of a Sheryl Crow song maybe just the way eddie sings the verses. I cant pick the song, but Bret, youll know what Im talking about. This one just doesnt do anything for me. Well, the Oh-oh-ohs at the end are really catchy. Other than that to me, it is a B-side. <br /> <br />Big Wave - Vitalogy groove fun song. Just not crazy crazy about it.... <br /> <br />Gone - Acoustic guitar opening the song, nice ebow brings it into Eddies verse. Good organ runs. More bulls eye lyrics even talking about gas prices and the tough cost of driving (in more than one meaning) <br /> <br />Wasted Reprise - short chorus over organ re-run of Life-Wasted. I hope they do this in concert prior to performing life wasted. Wound be a nice build-up <br /> <br />Army Reserve - probably the most groove-downbeat song on the album. I like the tingle of the echo swelled guitar runs during all of the song. <br /> <br />Come Back- This one is going to be a great concert sing-along. Eddie, you got a whole lot of soul on that chorus! This is the one soul-song of the album!!! Mike, beautiful solo at the end!!!! (I think that is you Mike, maybe Stone. Isnt Mike usually left speaker?) This song is amazing. Best song on the album hands down.  <br /> <br />Inside Job - Very pretty Piano riff and Jeffs bass line over simply acoustic strum. Ebow feedback guitar over that. I used to try to kill love. These are maybe Eddies best lyrics, really great lyrics. Every listen I get into it more. Song builds up into a three-chord bounce before hitting the chorus (more Who trademark guitar) and then going into the traditional guitar riff foundation that makes this album and PJ. 2nd Best song on the album, hands-down.  <br /> <br />Album ends with a strange echo chimmy Edge guitar riff coming end and going out Not anything special <br /> <br />Im usually not one for orders of songs, but this is how I feel right now: <br /> <br />1. Come Back <br />2. Inside Job <br />3. Gone <br />4. Parachutes <br />5. World Wide Suicide <br />6. Life Wasted / Wasted Reprise <br />7. Army Reserve <br />8. Severed Hand <br />9. Marker in the Sand <br />10. Comatose <br />11. Big Wave <br />12. Unemployable <br /> <br />Final thoughts - Great PJ album. I havent really hitched instantly onto any PJ album since Vitalogy, but this is going to grow on me nicely The acoustic / mellow songs are usually the top on my list on any PJ album (Daughter / Soon Forget / Elderly Woman / Thumbing / Parting Ways / All Those Yesterdays)... This album doesnt have anything seriously acoustic; guess the boys wanted to rock... but they rock out very nicely Keep on rocking, you do it so well Only criticism I might have at this point is your choice of an avocado as the album cover. I dub thee king of avocado rock! Cant wait to see you live until next time... <br /> <br />Ohh... almost forgot... Because I ordered from the Ten Club, along with the album came a New Years Eve 92 album that I can't wait to play. I have a feeling I'll be spinning this a little more than the avocado album...
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll preface this review by noting that I was one of the few fans who knew about and had access to the leaked album, but opted to wait for the release.  OK, maybe not quite--I was able to secure the album from a local retailer a day early.  I'm glad I waited, because had I not, I might have been more likely to go in for the decoy album theory circulating on many Tool discussion boards, and would not have taken the time to appreciate the album I had in my hands.   <br /> <br />This is not to say that I wouldn't prefer having two Tool albums to one any less than the next guy.  But I think that a lot of folks out there did themselves and the band a disservice by immediately writing off _10,000 Days_ as some kind of hoax.  I've read a great deal of commentary about the record in the weeks leading up to the release, and I must say that now, having heard the album, I am shocked that so many who identify as fans of this band ignored the central tenet of any new Tool album:  give it time.   <br /> <br />I still remember the first time I heard the song \\"Third Eye\\" from 1996's _Aenima_.  I didn't understand what I was hearing, and it made me uncomfortable.  Some of the riffs sounded familiar, there were long instrumental breaks with little discernable function, the vocals were at times far back in the mix and hard to decipher...in short, most of the complaints so many bloggers have been making about _10,000 Days_, I could have made about \\"Third Eye\\" (and much of the rest of _Aenima_) after a cursory first listen.  But luckily for everyone, I didn't have access to a computer with enough memory to run much more than simple word processing software, and I certainly didn't have high-speed internet access, so I couldn't leap right to the keyboard to express my consternation and disappointment.  If I had, I'd have ended up dreadfully embarrassed a few days and many listens later when I discovered I loved every difficult, meandering second of the record. <br /> <br />Now, I'm not one of those reviewers who believes that anyone who doesn't immediately love this album \\"just doesn't get it.\\"  It is possible, presumably, that one could listen to _10,000 Days_, fully digest all of its complexity, and still hate it.  After all, not everyone in the world loves Tool, and while some of these people assuredly do not get it, some of them also just don't care for the band's style or the band members' quirky personalities and beliefs (Tool have beliefs?! *gasp*).  That's OK. <br /> <br />It could also be that one fully comprehends the progression of the band on _10,000 Days_, yet doesn't think the band had any business in going to this new place and is not interested in following them there.  For instance, there are probably people out there who wish the band had put out four more records just like _Opiate_.  And that's OK too.   <br /> <br />I don't think it makes any sense for me, or anyone else, to try to persuade someone who doesn't like the new album for one of those reasons.  I only wish to quibble with those who identify as Tool fans and who say they embrace the progressive, transformative qualities of the band's music while bashing _10,000 Days_ as the embodiment of neither.   <br /> <br />It is frankly very sad to read the comments from fans who are so quick to dismiss the album because they think it is A) too derivative, or B) Maynard's vocals aren't loud enough, or C) they think the segues are merely \\"filler,\\" or D) they don't like the lyrical subject matter of the album.  Since so many seem to hold _Aenima_ up as the standard by which Tool will be forever judged, many of these criticisms strike me as particularly odd.  A quick, by no means comprehensive refutation of each: <br /> <br />A) The band have always been consciously self-referential--see the quiet section of \\"Third Eye\\" and tell me the guitar riff doesn't remind you of \\"Sober.\\"   <br /> <br />B) Throughout _Aenima_, the vocals are heavily processed and employed as another instrument--see the intro to \\"Eulogy.\\"   <br /> <br />C) _Aenima_ has more segues than _10,000 Days_, and guess what--in both cases, they are meant to enhance the overall mood of the record.  Since when do open-minded music fans disregard anything without a steady drum beat or vocal melody as \\"filler\\"?  (Incidentally, \\"Lost Keys\\" and \\"Intension\\" are two of my favorite tracks on the record). <br /> <br />D) This is my favorite.  You take offense to Tool suddenly \\"telling you what to believe?\\"  Here's news, everyone:  the oft-exalted liner notes from _Aenima_ (without even beginning to mention the lyrics) are _extremely_ didactic.  \\"Believe in nothing\\"?  Isn't that a command?   <br /> <br />My hunch is that many bloggers feel threatened by the lyrics on _10,000 Days_ because they suddenly feel implicated.  It's OK if Maynard sings about rejecting religious dogma or investigating the principles of alchemy, because it allows all of our armchair atheists to rest comfortably in apathetic superiority while mocking the ignorant masses.  But God forbid he talk about politics, because then we have to think about the ways we are all complicit in our respective governments' horrific actions.  No, it's much easier to never take a stand on anything important--give us the safety of our keyboards and Tool message boards.  Vicariously we live while the whole world dies. <br /> <br />One caveat:  I've only listened to the album in full twice, and so by no means do I claim to fully understand everything the band are throwing at us.  During my first listens of any album, I consciously avoid analyzing structure in favor of appreciating the raw aural experience.  I'm not going to lecture anyone on the time signatures at use here, or the great fill Danny does at X time in Y song, or the subtleties of Maynard's harmonies in song Z. <br /> <br />What I can say is that my second listen, while still difficult, was much more rewarding than the first, and I expect my appreciation to grow exponentially withsubsequent listens.  The record is dense, and probably not what you were expecting, but the process of discovery is immensely gratifying (and not the sort of thing you're likely to get with many other bands).  I encourage everyone who buys this album to do what they have done with every Tool album, and should do with every album, period:  give it time. <br /> <br />Oh, and then go do something productive besides lurking on Internet message boards.
B000GFLKF8|4.0|INSIDE MAN opens with a bank robber, Dalton Russell (Clive Owen) explaining that he has just robbed a bank. The who, what, when, where, and why are questions that everyone already knows the answers to. What people don't know is the how. The movie then illustrates just how Russell was able to complete his master heist.<br /><br />Russell and his gang begin their caper by entering a premier bank in New York posing as painters. They shine lights at the cameras, lock the doors, reveal their weapons, and announce that a robbery is in progress. Confusion mounts as the robbers dress those in the bank in identical costumes. Along the way, a game of wits is played between Russell and Det. Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington). Frazier knows Russell is up to something but he just can't figure out what. Hired into the game by the owner of the bank, Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer), is independent &#34;fixer&#34; Madeline White (Jodie Foster). White's presence seems unnecessary for most of the movie, but she adds a wild card into the whole scenario that cannot be ignored. The fun part is trying to figure out just how it's all going to play out in the end and how Russell is able to escape with a fortune, but no stolen money and without being caught.<br /><br />INSIDE MAN has a great cast with some fabulous acting. Washington, Foster, and Plummer are magnificent as always, but stronger performances are given by some of the film's supporting actors, particularly Chiwetel Ejiofor as Frazier's assistant Bill Mitchell and Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh hostage who when released from the bank is at first thought to be a terrorist.<br /><br />For a heist picture, INSIDE MAN moves rather slowly. Yet, at the slower pace the movie never really drags. Also, scattered throughout the movie are moments of social commentary-such as when Russell speaks with a young boy in the bank during the heist about the hand held video game he is playing. Beside the commentary, these moments also provide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.<br /><br />Overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture. It's a movie that a wide audience can relate to. It isn't Spike Lee's best picture, but it is his most commercial.ide greater depth to the characters we see on the screen.<br /><br />Overall, INSIDE MAN is an enjoyable heist picture.

B000EULJLU|5.0|As everyone knows, this album was leaked about two weeks ago.  I, like most others, am a simple, simple human, and thus lacked the fortitude to wait the extra two weeks. <br /> <br />But I made up for it by buying two copies of this amazing production. <br /> <br />Tool fans often get ragged on for being very high-strung and arrogant about being a Tool fan.  There is some truth to this.   <br /> <br />But after opening this CD package up and looking at the art, as well as digesting the astonishing production and technique that this band exhibits, and reeling over the emotional landscape they cover, I can honestly say that there has not been an album like this ever made,  which ever way you look at it. <br /> <br />Tool is a constantly innovative and progressive band; none of their CDs sound alike.  This CD almost seeks to violate every assumption someone has about what makes something \\"epic\\".  The two-parter about Maynard's mother occurs on tracks 3 and 4, and the end of the album is a 5 minute non-song.   <br /> <br />But once you really sit down and listen to it, this album is quite simply Tool singing the blues.  I can picture the singer sitting on a Mississippi bayou writing the lyrics to this.  There are so many allusions to Christian mythology in an attempt to convey very simple human emotions.  The songs about drug use in the middle of the album seem to suggest the way we deal with tragedy and loss. <br /> <br />This is NOT Lateralus, both sonically and thematically.  The band shows such a progressive landscape, and whereas Lateralus emphasized Danny drums and Maynard's vocal, 10,000 Days showcases Adam's guitar and Justin's unbelievable bass playing.  He really has to be heard to be believed; get a good sound system for this CD. <br /> <br />Thematically, this album goes in the opposite direction.  Where Lateralus ended celebrating the potential unity of humanity (\\"we are all one mind\\"), this album ends with a song about humanity's dark side, aptly titled \\"Right in Two\\". <br /> <br />If the artistic direction for the CD package doesn't win an award, then there is no taste left in the music industry.  I will simply say that Alex Gray and Tool have changed the way I'll evaluate \\"liner notes\\" completely. <br /> <br />The entire spectacle of this CD has completely affirmed my \\"arrogance\\" at being a Tool fan, and I'm proud to say it!  Go buy this CD.  Now.  You will not f*cking regret it.
6305127697|4.0|In PRIMAL FEAR, Richard Gere plays high-powered attorney Martian Vail.  Vail is a defense attorney and one of the highest paid lawyers in the country.  He has a reputation for getting guilty people off the hook, whether it is by emotion or technicality.  Sometimes the accused are actually innocents, but the media never seems to recognize that.  Besides, many of Vail's trial have been huge public trials full of media circuses.  So when Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton), an innocent-looking, stuttering altar boy is accused of brutally murdering Local Archbishop Richard Rushman (Stanley Anderson), Vail jumps at the opportunity to defend Stampler pro bono.  Along the way, Vail becomes convinced of Stampler's innocence.  The evidence points directly to Stampler, but as the story unfolds it becomes apparent that someone besides Stampler killed Rushman.<br /><br />I've seen PRIMAL FEAR a number of times and though the initial shock of the film is dampened after the first viewing, the movie is still a powerful picture.  PRIMAL FEAR is a movie that offers viewers a glimpse into the nature of evil and how good people can become unwitting pawns in the games of life.<br /><br />PRIMAL FEAR was the motion picture debut of Edward Norton.  Norton is one of the most talented actors in the business.  His performance as Aaron Stampler is phenomenal and signaled the major player that Norton was to become.<br /><br />The DVD only includes the trailer as a special feature.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I was first stunned by the artwork of this album: Pearl Jam, an avocado, ocean blue to the end... Just open it to see. Until now I just can't believe this is them. This album is nothing like the previous ones. It looks different, it sounds different, it feels different... And it's all for the best!  <br /> <br />The sound is authentic as usual but the lyrics seem one star higher.  <br /> <br />\\"I used to be crustacean in an underwated nation\\" Dreams of salvation through ocean purification... <br /> <br />\\"And war,... Break the sky and tell me what it's for\\" <br /> <br />No need to say that any PJ album has its own flavor. From Ten to Riot Act, there is everything but monotony. And each time, our friends make sure that they tell us about the stories that affect them the most at that moment. They surely did this time, as they make us very well aware of their opinions. <br /> <br />\\"So this life is sacrifice\\" <br /> <br />If there is more to life than appearances, then there is some meaning to find in the few introspective sentences thrown at us all along.  <br /> <br />\\"By achieving levitation\\" <br /> <br />\\"Gone\\" or \\"Army Reserve\\" are nothing less than a desperate cry for change, which they make as usual, visually, calmly, without fear, both hopelessly and beautifully. <br /> <br />And among all the chaos and confusion, there is still room for some deep-blues call for love. \\"Come back\\" screams the hoarse voice of Eddie... \\"It's okay. It's okay.\\" <br /> <br />\\"How I choose to feel,... Is how I am\\" <br /> <br />\\"Inside Job\\" with the words of Mike, reminds us to close the circle, that we are free. \\"To shine a human light today\\" <br /> <br />Believe me, you want to hear this album. <br /> <br />HHHHH <br />
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|This is some marvelous heaviosity in the vein of classic rock giants Led Zep, Sabbath, and Deep Purple.  It's refreshing to hear NEW music that rekindles the spirit of those guys.  There are thick, thundering guitar riffs and massive bass lines (listen to \\"Pyramid,\\" for instance), plus the high, Plant-esque wail of singer Andrew Stockdale.  I like just about everything on this album, especially the bluesy \\"Witchcraft\\" and the swell stroke of \\"Colossal,\\" a song where everything comes together just right.  Only one tune put me off a bit - \\"Apple Tree,\\" with its White Stripe-ish shenanigans.  Overall, though, this is one of the best CDs I've heard all year - one Mother of an album!  (And at a great intro price too.)
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This one really stands out among Pearl Jam's impressive discography as one JAMMIN' album. Can't wait to see the boys this summer.
B00005MP58|5.0|Fans of Jane Austen and all others will find this rendition of Pride and prejudice true to the novel and true to its times. Colin Firth transcends his age disadvantage and gives a performance which will forever define his career, he has been typecasted as Mr Darcy forever and ever. You can feel his angst in every scene leading to the first proposal. <br /> <br />The love-hate relationship you feel for the other antagonists is only heightened by their superb performance. Even the nose of Lady Catherine de bourgh was condescending.   <br /> <br />After watching Julia Sawalha on Absolutely fabulous for many years, I was astonished by her giggly, childish performance as Lydia. No one could has played lydia better. <br /> <br />
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney Houston exploded onto the music scene in early 1985, signing a deal with Arista Records, under the guidance of Clive Davis. Her self-titled debut, released that year was the beginning of a fruitful career and lapped up some of Whitneys very best work to date.  <br /> <br />The debut extract would be the sparkling, vibrant ballad, You Give Good Love, produced by the divine Jermaine Jackson. Whitneys positively exquisite and exhilirating vocal delivery was astoundingly powerful, much in the shadow of the great, Aretha Franklin. Despite its glorious content, You Give Good Love bombed on the U.S charts and was therefore not even issued in the U.K through lack of interest.  <br /> <br />The slice of disco-pop in distinctly 80's style was the angelic, How Will I Know, a rather sappy and girly tune that hardly had the credibility of the previous single, but emerged as a winner where it topped the U.S charts, whilst storming its way into the U.K Top 10 charts. How Will I Know was produced by Narada Michael Walden who would go on to produce more of her work on future albums.  <br /> <br />Thinking About You was an electric affair with its startling electro-pop orchestrations whilst Whitneys vocal delivery is highly dynamic. More jamming pop follows with the upbeat, Someone For Me, where her rocketing vocal delivery is once again astoundingly strong.  <br /> <br />The genius Michael Masser who had produced countless soul classics with divine soul diva, Diana Ross, was involved in most of the project and worked his magic again with this breathtaking singer. The ballad, Saving All My Love For You is so uplifting and timeless. The full force of her vocal techniques floods out on this tear-jerker of a classic. Her delivery on here is almost mesmerising.  <br /> <br />She duets with Jermaine Jackson on the sugary, Nobody Loves Me Like You Do. There is a nice range of harmonies between these two fabulous singers and even a slight air of sexual chemistry between the two sizzles through. All At Once is another sweeping ballad where she is joined by a gospel backing choir on the exalting chrous. All At Once became another huge International hit to her credit.  <br /> <br />Theres another duet with Jermaine Jackson included with the exotic, late night R&B number, Take Good Care Of My Heart where their vocals are propelled into full effect and both sound equally as magnificent as one another. A timeless collaboration though failed to hit the U.S top 40 charts when released as a single there.  <br /> <br />Another one of Whitneys most definitive classics follows with her fantastic cover of The Greatest Love Of All where her wide range of spectacular abilities is displayed yet again.  <br /> <br />Hold Me is a sickly romantic ballad on which she duets with soul crooner, Teddy Pendergrass. Despite the overly syrupy content the track is actually exhilirating on just hearing these two fine singers like captured on record together. Always makes for a dynamic combination.  <br /> <br />This album is actually quite remarkable for a debut. Consistent, solid and high quality work from one of the greatest singers of our era, it is an indeed timeless classic and stands as some of her most memroable work.  <br /> <br />
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|It would have been nice to have been able to give this half a star becasue that is about all this movie deserves and that was for a scene and a half: the proposal in the rain - the rain was a nice touch, and the last tender scene between husband and wife. <br /> <br />A worse adaptation could not have been made.  By the time they reached the first ball - 5 minutes into the movie, I was sick. <br /> <br />Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She made Elizabeth into a giggly, silly girl who Darcy would never have fallen in love with.  All the gilrs looked greasy, unkempt, and illiterate.  i cannot believe the behavior.  Particularly when Elizabeth comes to Netherfield after hearing that Jane is sick, she just walks in the door, looks at everyone and then walks out like a petulant child.  Elizabeth Bennet would never have behaved like that, maybe Lydia. <br /> <br />Matthew Macfayden as Darcy.  Well at least he looks the part better than Colin Firth did seeing as how Darcy was only 26.  <br /> <br />The dialogue and the story is stilted because its been chopped up. Unless you've read the book you won't know what they're talking about half the time. They talk about Darcy breaking up Jane and Bingley and yet all they show is the two of them dancing once, never more. <br /> <br />And Wickham?  you never truly get the essence of his evil.  <br /> <br />I have to say Donald Sutherland as a loving husband to Mrs Bennet, just turned my stomach.  Where was the sarcasm, where was the dry wit, where was the disdain? <br /> <br />I have seen Brenda Blethyn in many movies and she is just way too nice to be Mrs Bennet. <br /> <br />Georgiana Darcy is so forward. In the book, she is so shy she can barely say two words together. <br /> <br />All the girls are way too thin.  That style of dress was designed to show off your bosom. Keira Knightley has the chest of a 12 year old and the dress does not help one bit.  you could see that none of the girls were wearing corsets.  It would have helped. <br /> <br />Don't waste a penny to see this movie.  if you get to see it free, go for it.  At least you'll have a good time seeing all the things that were done wrong.
B000001FT2|5.0|Following the excellent Warm Leatherette (1980) album, her debut on the Island Records label which saw her rewarded with more commercial acceptance, the outrageous and off-the-wall diva, Grace Jones returned to the recording studios in early 1981 for the unforgetable Nightclubbing project.  <br /> <br />Grace Jones second album on Island Records is possibly the greatest of her considerably short recording career and captured Jones at her artistic peak. It features a series of remarkable recordings, encapsulating a multitude of styles such as New Wave, Reggae, Funk, Jazz and Soul. She was again aided by the fabulous production skills of those reggae kings, Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare.  <br /> <br />Nightclubbing (1981)begins with the curiously compelling, Walking In The Rain, which sets a dark, atmospheric tone for the duration of the project. The hypnotic, trancey arrangements are ignited by a compelling performance from Jones who literally inteprets the lyrics into an interesting spoken interlude. This is one of her most bizarre and off the wall recordings, yet there is something fascinating about this recording despite its blatant weirdness.  <br /> <br />Jones then delivers what's possibly her very, very best recording ever - Pull Up To The Bumper. This funk-driven track, complete with spiralling rythms, is totally infectious. The lyrics are scattered with double entendres . In the U.S, Pull Up To The Bumper catapulted to No.5 on the Black music singles whilst shooting to No.2 on the Club Play listings. In the U.K Pull Up To The Bumper fell just outisde the top 50 charts though on its re-issue in 1986 zoomed in at No.12.  <br /> <br />Her cover of Bill Withers ,Use Me has a striking musical arrangement and holds a surprisingly strong and assertive vocal performance from Grace. Her unique version of Iggy Pop's Nightclubbing is a total contrast to the original, flowing with strange, synchronized sounds that was way ahead of its time.  <br /> <br />The New Wave sounds of Art Groupie is another interesting concoction, but the music steadily steers direction, driving into jazz on the eccentric but undeniably brilliant, I've Seen That Face Before in which Grace delivers both English and French spoken passages.  <br /> <br />The disappointment of the album comes in the lacklustre version of Feel Up - the reason being was that she did a far better version in her A One Man Show (1982).  <br /> <br />However the album soon gets back on track with the stomping rock track, Demolition Man which is ignited by tough, thrashing musical arrangements and a red blooded, ferocious performance from Jones who conveys a lot of spirit and fire.  <br /> <br />The album gradually winds down with a surprise in the jazz-soul number I've Done It Again. This number allows you to appreciate the surprisingly soothing qualities of her voice. Never have I heard her sound so effeminate as she does on this track.  <br /> <br />Nightclubbing is an ESSENTIAL Grace Jones album. It raced to No.9 on the black music album charts, whilst gliding into the U.K and U.S Top 40 album Charts. It was also voted album of the year by New Musical Express magazine.  <br /> <br />Ian Phillips  <br /> <br />June 2006 <br />
0800141660|5.0|Need a good cry, watch this movie. <br /> <br />There are about 4 or 5 scenes that will be forever burnt in your memory when you see this. most of them being scenes between the two elder sisters. <br /> <br />Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet give stellar performances of sisters that are almost completely opposite in personality and temperament. The perfomrances of everyone else plays off these two.  The bright, fun loving Marianne and the sensible Eleanor.  You truly feel their pain especially Eleanor because you know how hurt she is and you know she cannot let anyone know.  She is essentially the head of the family and must remain calm and sensible at all times. <br /> <br />It is a beautiful movie in every sense of the word.
B00007BKVC|5.0|A superb road movie with a difference! Director Ridley Scott shrewdly puts himself in the womens driving seat and depicts a tale of two long-standing friends who go on a weekend spree to escape their usual, monotonous small-town routines.  <br /> <br />What they both have in common are both are dissatisfied with their respective partners. However what is intended as a wild holiday turns into a virtual nightmare.  <br /> <br />Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) hit a nightclub on their first night of freedom. Thelma catches the eye of a man and before long, the two are drinking and dancing together whilst Louise hesitantly looks on. At the end of the night the man trys to rape Thelma. As he is just about to proceed with his vicious act, Louise catches him. After some verbal exchanges, Louise loses her temper and shoots the man to his death.  <br /> <br />Realising they hadn't a hope in convincing the police that it was an act of self-defence (especially adding to the fact that the entire nightclub had seen Thelma and the man dancing together all night) they decide to head toward Mexico to begin a new life.  <br /> <br />They are plunged into a series of adventures as they hastily head toward Mexico and it certainly is not without its complications as they dodge the police along the way who are hot on their trail.  <br /> <br />It is subsequently revealed that Louise herself was raped some years earlier which explains why she was so quick to shoot the would-be rapist. The film touches on the subject sensitivley and convincingly and Susan Sarandon puts in a carefully conceived performance.  <br /> <br />Brad Pitt also stars in the film in one of his earliest roles. Pitt plays J.D, where Thelma naievly succumbs to his somewhat cocky charm (however he soon robs both Thelma and Louise of all their money which they were using as their detour to Mexico).  <br /> <br />Thelma And Louise seemed to be a watershed for Brad Pitt as well as Michael Marsden (playingLouise's partner) and Harvey Kietel who both went on to star in the 1992 masterpiece, Resevoir Dogs. Both of their performances are effective and Harvey Kietel is fantastic as the understanding detective hot on the ladies trail who surprisingly displays a lot of empathy for the fugitives situation.  <br /> <br />As Thelma And Louise neatly unfolds it seems to steer along the voyage of self-discovery. The rich dialogue is complimented by superb, highly effective and concentrated performances from the versatile Susan sarandon and the bubbly Geena Davis.  <br /> <br />There are also many magnificent, eye-catching shots of the Grand Canyon along the way. The soundtrack is equally enthralling including tracks from the likes of soul superstars as Martha Reeves and The Temptations and all add to the effect of this classic masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Whilst there are some laughs along the way to endure (such as the pair blowing up a foul-mouthed van drivers vehicle up), Thelma And Louise stands as a compelling and riviting drama.  <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Another great album from Tool.  As with most Tool albums, you'll grow to like the album more and more as you play it through a few times. <br /> <br />Very pleased and highly recommended. <br /> <br />-T
0805066691|5.0|The author of the book does not describe the process of destruction (mass murder) of the Indians in North America. It just tells the tale of the annihilation of some tribes. As it does not fully describe the conditions that led to this annihilation, some readers may not understand the whole process and, perhaps, get a somewhat blurred picture. <br /> <br />Even then, some important facts are stated: <br />1.- There has been a displacement of the original population (Indians) by the newcomers (Whites). <br />2.- Most of the Indians have been killed (famine, murder and war). <br />3.- The Indians have been treated in a way that, nowadays, would made everybody blame the government of the USA: To move by force large masses of population from their original places to new ones, to assign to the Army the mission of controlling civil population and the denying of human and civil rights to the indians would be considered a scandall. Most people would think such acts were more typical of a Comunist government in Cambodge, China, Bosnia Herzegovina (Yugoeslavia) or the Ingush and Chechen territories (Yet another Stalin massacre).
B000EMGAGW|2.0|The album is cool, it's alright, and it would be a solid effort if this was a rap duo's first album.  But Mobb Deep has been around for 6 albums before this and this album does not show improvement or true veteran status.  I hate to say it but I enjoyed more of 50 cent on this album than Captial H or Capital P.  I'm dissapointed with this effort there is not a whole lot of range in rhyme ability or lyrical disversity on this album.  It's your basic rap disccussion matter such as: girls, sex, drugs, and f*cking someone up for looking at you wrong.  Well be that as it may there is still isn't any rhyming on the part of Hollywood Hav or V.I. P that particulary stands out. The duo is either overshadowed by a G-Unit soldier, a struggling beat so you go to the next track, or by comparing them to their earlier material. There are some descent tracks such as \\"Put them in they Place\\", \\"Creep\\", and \\"Pearly Gates\\".  But 3 out of 16 is not enough to make for a solid album.  There are a few brights spots here and there, but the album on a whole is lacking.  The remix's to \\"Have a Party\\" and \\"Outta Control\\" should have been hidden or bonus tracks.  It's like these two songs were just thrown on the album to give it more commercial appeal.  This is not necessarily a good or bad thing but it removes the potential for Hav or P to add two additional songs that could have made for a better album. We don't want to hear from 50 or any other G-Unit soldier.  We would like to hear from the Queensbridge natives.  By just putting these two songs into the official tracklist of the album it says to me you have given up or you're lazy.  It's a shame I was looking forward to a standout album from these guys.  They talked so much about it not being overrun by G-Unit.  I guess at the end of the day General Jackson has the final say.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is a great album. All the old GNR hits with all the ORIGINAL members. I have a lot of their cds but this has almost all my favorite songs of theirs on here. I would definitely reccomend this cd to anyone who has been a GNR fan or is just beginning to be one.
B000BYA5GO|4.0|First, let me say that I loved this film. I loved it despite the underlying message about how evil the arms industry supposedly is. This was an anti-gun movie in the same way that 'Full Metal Jacket' is an anti-war movie. It didn't broaden my social awareness as much as it made me want to begin trading in illegal weapons. As one witnesses the character's inevitable, 'Goodfellas'-style downfall, one isn't concerned with his illegal profession so much as how he could have done his job better and come out ahead if only he didn't degenerate into such a womanizing, drug abusing lowlife, whose conscience only seems to surface when he's coked out of his mind.<br /><br />This movie is a thrilling look at the profession of gun running, and I highly recommend it. In fact, for those interested in running guns themselves, it might be looked upon as a recruiting film. I recommend not buying the 2-disc edition however. The second disc is just more preaching from Hollywood, Amnesty International, and UN representatives who take pot-shots at America and believe that taking weapons off the market will suddenly make evil people play nice.

B000EULJLU|5.0|i think far too often people hold an idea in their head of how something should sound, or should be. what's so amazing about tool is that they don't allow me to do that. with every album, tool evolves into something deeper, perhaps richer. i'm so turned on right now... you have no idea. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCT|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, then this is a no brainer except with deciding which set to buy.  So, I hope that this might clarify issues that you might have.  A friend of mine keeps on harping about the big difference between widescreen and fullscreen.  My own ignorance had me assuming that big black bars on the top and bottom were annoying.  Also, I had to squint to see the details since everything was squished from the top and bottom.  Well, that's obviously wrong and you should check out some frames of widescreen vs. fullscreen on the internet.  Now with movies without the jaw-dropping views and scenes, there is not much that you are gaining with widescreen.  But, take the capture of Princess Leia's ship in \\"New Hope\\" or the Millenium Falcon chase in \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" on fullscreen.  The image that you are left with is basically a chopped off version of the original film to fit on your computer or TV screen.  If you keep the same film reel format in widescreen, then you will get the black bars on the top and bottom with the entire frame intacted.  So, if you feel that you can do without black bars, then go ahead and get the fullscreen.  Otherwise, get the widescreen to enjoy the trilogy which is the way it was in the movie theaters.<br /><br />The bonus disc could be a toss-up depending on how you view chipping in another ten bucks.  In my opinion, you might as well go ahead and spring for the extra disc.  The price of the trilogy is already over $40 dollars and you can't just buy the extra disk separately later.  Plus, you get alot more features in learning about how the film was made and some of ideas/thoughts from writers and visual/sound effects specialists at Lucas Films.  The simple 3 disc set without bonus disc was released just recently to attract buyers who didn't want to purchase such an expensive set.  Well, it's your decision but make a choice that you can look back without regret.  My favorite parts of the disc was the whole idea about how to create the character of Darth Vadar and his whole heavy breathing that we all remember quite vividly.  Also, who can't remember all those wonderful sounding lightsabers that whoosh when Luke or Obi-wan were swinging them.  Well, those people who created the effects and sounds talk about it.  Kinda interesting and you'll never see it on TV.<br /><br />The quality of all the films are first rate but my only gripe about the trilogy is the special edition treatment.  We get these silly additions of a digitally created Jabba the Hut and also scenes of Hayden as young Darth Vadar.  Taking a classic film and then getting a do-over is just ridiculous.  It's like having a writer say Mark Twain looking over Huck Finn and then going back to change bits and pieces on the plot of Huck and Jim.  It's done and finished so don't mess with it.  Art should be a finished form after it's done no need to keep on polishing it over.  You just ruin it for the future generation and people just get confused.  So, if you just ignore all those additional scenes from George Lucas (which goes for those who actually lived through the original 80's trilogy), then go ahead and purchase this.  I doubt that this trilogy will ever be released in its original form without all those digitally enhanced scenes.eate the character of Darth Vadar and his whole heavy breathing that we all remember quite vividly.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I first listened to Tool when they released Lateralus, and it is still one of my favorite albums. Every song is brilliant and the album flows very well. 10,000 Days is Tool's first album since then, and I think a lot of fans were expecting more. Lets start with the packaging. A lot of the imagery is reused bits from the Lateralis liner notes and the Parabola video. There are lenses so you can look at the liner notes in 3d. Didn't they do something similar to this on Aenima? Definitely lacking in originality.    The first song is the single Vicarious. It starts off really well, a great intro, and then Maynard starts singing. His vocals on this track are hard to hear and lack any intensity. The lyrics are bad in spots, with such lines as \\"I need to watch things die from a distance\\" and \\"I own a TV 'cause tragedy thrills me\\". It picks up near the end and has a pretty good climax, but overall this is an average song that sounds as commercial as the media they sing against. 7/10    The next song is Jambi, this one is fairly slow, Maynard's vocals are better here but the song is very disjointed. It sounds like they are all playing different songs. Weird time signatures are nothing new, but the song has no flow. Very good vocals over a really boring chugging guitar chord in the middle. This goes on for most of the song, there is a semi-solo, and then the song figures itself out and ends fairly well. But they wasted most of the song with the same chugging chord and boring drums. 6/10    Wings For Marie (Pt 1) is about Maynard's mother, there is nothing to figure out here. This song has a really beautiful guitar part, and despite being very slow is one of the best songs on the album. Near the end it speeds up into a crashing (but short) riff and some cool drums, and flows into a slow ending. 9/10    The title track, also about Maynard's mother, is gloomy and slow. There are some thunderstorm noises in the background, the lyrics are good but obvious, he basically tells us about his mother who had a stroke and had to live \\"10000 days in the fire\\". Some weird religious stuff, then there is an awesome instrumental section through most of the second half. A really great climax and then about a minute and a half of slower lyrics. 9/10    The Pot is next. Maynard shows his vocal range at the beginning, and the lyrics start out great. There are great drums all the way through this track, a bit like Parabola from their last album. The lyrics start to get a little silly: \\"head up a**hole, whatchoo talkin 'bout\\" and some pretty obvious political statements about the war on drugs and \\"f***ing hypocrites\\". But it's hard to hate this song because it's just so catchy. Did I mention they swear a lot more on this album? 9/10    The next song is a short filler track called Lipan Conjuring. Sounds like they are meditating with tambourines. 2/10    Lost Keys is an intro song for Rosetta Stoned, basically a doctor and a nurse conversing behind a slow guitar riff and some weird ambience. I'm not sure what the title means. 4/10    Rosetta Stoned is the best track on the album. The lyrics at the beginning are almost impossible to hear because it is so fast, but they include things like Krispy Kreme donuts, the X-Files, E.T., Sunkist oranges and some other insane ramblings. Tool show their sarcastic tone here, some guy thinks he met an alien and becomes the \\"chosen one\\", or maybe he's on drugs. The song is heavy, angry and just brilliant. The climax is beautiful and then unbelievably intense. One of best songs Tool have ever done! 10/10    Intension is a song they could have easily shortened or put something better in it's place. Seven minutes long, it's interesting but very slow, starting with some weird metallic clanking and a slow melody. It's strange and a little experimental, like a longer version of Disposition from their last album. 6/10    Right in Two. This a really good song if you don't mind some terrible lyrics. Some crap about monkeys and angels and free will. The second half of the song is excellent, heavy and just plain awesome. 8/10    Viginti Tres sounds to me like dragons spewing fire, but I have a feeling you have to slow this one down, maybe to 23 seconds and you will hear a secret message or something. Or I heard that from someone. Anyways it's 5 minutes they could have done something better with. 2/10    This album is nowhere near their previous releases, and the lyrics are spotty but it has it's (many!) moments of brilliance. Overall a pretty good album from a band that are still awesome after 15 years.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is PJs best since Vs... it's actually BETTER than Vs. Go get it, go listen, go rock. <br /> <br />BTW- I hate when reviews don't ring true, like DissidentMan's one star review... all the songs are forgetable? Please haters, stay away.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|Same M.O.B.B. murder music.  Doesn't really have that G-Unit feel which is a good thing.  ALOT of hot tracks... not a single one that I would skip.  This CD reminds me of Amerika's Nightmare.  Hot to Death.  Peace
0671004107|4.0|It fascinates me to learn that this book was written by *the* Carl Sagan.  I had seen the movie when it first came out, at a very early age, and one of the things my parents and other adults told me was how unrealistic it was.  Despite their comments, I adored the movie.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when years later, I learned that the book was written by him.  Carl Sagan, for those of you who don't know, was extremely involved with the scientific community's search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including being one of 11 attendees at what is probably the first conference ever held on the possibility of extraterrestrial life.  Another reviewer mentioned Drake's Equation, the equation that projects the possible number of advanced civilizations in the galaxy.  What they didn't mention was that Sagan was actually present at that first conference when Drake's Equation was first unveiled and discussed, which is a fascinating story in itself.<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand me.  Contact, at its core, is still a science-fiction novel.  But its roots are a lot deeper in science than many believe.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I am a huge Tool fan, but what I've learned since laterlus and 10,000 days came out that most tool fans are very stubborn towards giving an actual REAL opinion of a Tool album.  People are saying that this album is a masterpiece.  This album sucks!! Come on, who are you fooling.  Theres really only five songs on this album.  And there really not that good, they have their moments, but thats about it.  Opiate(EP) great, Undertow is their best work, Aenmima, great, Laterlus is where it all starts, APC and too put together, I like Laterlus, but after I heard this album I really like Laterlus.  How can Tool fans get this album and give it 4-5 stars, Let me guess, you liked Metallicas St. Anger too just because it says metallica on the cover.  Don't give albums credit just because who makes them.  This album is a 5 song EP and the songs aren't really that great.  Theres not one song on here thats better than the outsider on APC thirteen step album.  Thats sad.  This album blows, you want a hear a real band, go get Pearl Jams EIGHTH studio album.  FIve years for 78 minutes of garbage. <br />I'm out
B000EOTAM6|2.0|Now this is very bad indeed. There is no real plot. OK, C Theron is a great actress but this movie even manages to look cheaply done. Avoid at all costs
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I've listened  this new album and I must say that It's very good!!!<br /><br />All the songs are good, good lyrics with powerchords, also the balladas are beatiful.<br /><br />Thanks Pearl Jam for doing good music.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Mobb Deep's seventh album is \\"Blood Money\\" (2006). The duo of Prodigy and Havoc have released some excellent albums over the years, my own favorites being \\"[[ASIN:B000002WR5 The Infamous]]\\" & \\"[[ASIN:B000002X0Z Hell on Earth]]\\". This is also Mobb Deep's first release since they signed with 50 Cent and aligned themselves with G-Unit. I think this disturbed a lot of old time fans- and maybe with good reason. My opinion has always been it doesn't really matter where Mobb Deep is at as long as they are making quality music. Guest appearances on this release come from G-Unit's: Lloyd Banks, 50 Cent, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, with Mary J Blige and Nate Dogg also providing contributions. After the intro Mobb Deep get things going with the single \\"Put Em In There Place\\", it's a decent track but the beat and hook are the type that I find to get repetitive real quickly. \\"Stole Something\\" and \\"Creep\\" fall under skip material for me, Lloyd Banks is especially bland on the first cut, both tracks have all parties sounding sluggish. Mobb Deep step things up a little bit for the ominous \\"Speakin So Freely\\". \\"Backstage Pass\\" is hurting, why would anyone care to hear about Mobb Deep talking to their groupies. Young Buck and Tony Yayo do little to elevate the next two cuts. The hardest hitting track on this release for me is \\"Pearly Gates\\", 50 Cent laces this cut with an impressive chorus, while Havoc lays down the first two verses and Prodigy finishes it with his own anti religious thoughts (which may piss some people off). \\"Daydreaming\\" is a sort of rags to riches joint where Mobb relish the fact they have made it, the next tracks are really the same format in that they are about getting paid. \\"It's Alright\\" has the makings of a commercial single, Mary J Blige and 50 Cent drop in on this cut, I have never really been a fan of Mobb Deep love related cuts don't feel its a genre that works for them. \\"Have A Party\\" was used on the Get Rich or Die Trying Soundtrack, not a track I like at all. The \\"Outta Control\\" (Remix) was the first 50 Cent/Mobb Deep collaborations I heard, it is a feel good track and my favorite on this release. Standouts for on this release include the remix closer and \\"Pearly Gates\\", I am not impressed by the majority of G-Unit contributions found throughout this release although 50 does help out on the standouts. Maybe a new generation who never listened to the early classic Mobb albums can pick this one up, and love it. And their will be some long time fans who will feel the same way. Personally to me, Mobb Deep seem watered down, and simply tired lyrically for the most part. That raw street hunger that I loved about them has now been replaced with the: we are getting paid, and own this etc. I am happy to see Mobb Deep is making money but I don't need to hear about it for a whole album.  I heard that the Mobb will be helping produce Sam Scarfo's debut album I am looking forward to that one.  I think opinions will vary a lot on \\"Blood Money\\", this is one of those rare cases where I recommend people give it a full listen and judge for themselves.
B000EULJLU|4.0|TOOL - 10,000 Days  -  Let's be honest folks... none of us can give an accurate representation of a Tool Album especially not on its first day of release.  (Well two weeks if you count the leak.)     There seems to be a very difficult thing for people to absorb: it is the fact that Tool may not reproduce another Aenima or Lateralus... Now does that mean this album is garbage?  Certainly not! This album still has its moments, however there is a certain echo of past works which seem to see Tool treading on familiar ground.      Now I'm not going to say it shouldn't I mean Lateralus echoed what Aenima started and even to a smaller extent Aenima held some hints of the harder rocking Undertow days.  10,000 Days seems to be more based on atmosphere then any of their previous works... with hints of Post-Rock felt throughout a good portion of the album.      The Musicianship is more subtle on this album but no less fantastic... Danny Carey is still one of the finest drummers in modern music... Adam Jones is still a guitar virtuoso... And Maynard is still my favorite modern vocalist.  Now you may be asking what about Justin Chancellor?  Well this, my friends is the highlight of this albums musical ability.  Justin's bass work shines through out the CD, though he once took more of a back seat in skillful terms, this album will convince non-believers he is one of metals finest bass players.      As far as the `Filler' conversation goes... it's not the first time Tool has used filler but it certainly does seem a bit sub par compared to some of their older works such as, Message to Harry Manback or the quirky Intermission.     And as far as waiting 5 Years... I can't help but be a tad bit disappointed especially since my other favorite band Opeth has released 8 albums in 12 years, (5 of which are absolutely stunning but all are great in their own right)  and Tool has been around for 14 years and only release 4 full lengths and an EP.     All in All I am content with this album and feel it will take some time to absorb... Also before this review forum terms into a Warfield with loyalist reviewers arguing that people just don't `get it' Let's keep in mind this is music and everyone is titled to their own opinion.    Favorite Songs: Right in Two, The Pot and 10,000 Days (Wings for Marie Part II)   -4.5 Stars.  (With potential to become 5 stars after it absorbs.)

B000002LK1|5.0|I love prog rock and hate dance music with a passion because it no talent corporate crap!! However Depeche Mode write tunes that are thought provoking and have something about them that draws you in and takes you on a ride. This effort is a masterpiece of song writing skills in every way. Melody and texture are certainly this efforts strong points and it just has a certain vibe that really kicks in right from the start and never lets up. Anybody who knows anything about writing music can't deny this releases status as a definitive cd. Certain albums/cd's have the power to really get into your psyche and this is one of them. It's just that good and a must have for any music fan.<br /><br />I hate Dance music with a passion, but I absolutely love what Depeche Mode has put together here.<br /><br />This is truly a sonic awaking for the masses!!
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This amazingly, beautifully done movie was at the top of my Christmas list in 2005.  I saw it in the theater and was blown away at how lifelike much of the movie appeared.  I just couldn't wait to own my own copy of this movie.
B000EQ4G5K|3.0|Rihanna is a wonderful find for those of us who are bored with the run of the mill R&B artists. With an adorable personality, a cute accent and much more worldly it seems, than most American artists nowadays, and also with more than usual good album tracks than are found in a typical pop album in the US. <br /> <br />With her first album \\"Music of the Sun\\", \\"Pon de Replay\\" hooked me and I eagerly awaited her first album. Unfortunately with that album, I found exactly 2 album tracks I liked, and could barely sit through the other songs on the album with it's forced Reggae songs with the same beat, and ballads which are trying compensate for her lack of range, which just shows off that fault in her vocals even more.  <br />When the completely infectious first single of this album, SOS, came out (sampling one of my favorite songs, but not taking a part of the melody. Which allows me to like it, as other songs which sample parts of a song's melody or main opening always makes me want to listen to the sampled song, not the one I'm listening to already. And thus, ruins the whole aspect of enjoying the new song.), my hopes shot up again, and again waited in anticipation for the CD, and thankfully, I am not nearly as disappointed with this one.  <br /> <br />With this album, comes a much needed improvement. The reggae songs (which again, take up a good portion of the album) are not nearly as run of the mill, nor do the beats sound exactly the same. And one of the best improvements I find, is that Rihanna's vocals are much more in the tune with the songs, instead of standing out: and with Rihanna's limited vocal ability it is a much better way of presenting the songs, making them listenable. There are 2 stand out songs which are typically reggae, but with very interesting and good usages of different styled infused with the style. \\"Selfish Girl\\" has some great use of big band trumpets, and \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" is a great reggae/rock mixed song. <br /> <br />In addition to \\"SOS\\", \\"Break it off\\" is absolutely fun and listenable. Unfortunately, those two are really the only 2 pure dance songs.  <br /> <br />However, the dull run-of-the-mill far-too-large ballads with oddly placed R&B beats in the background are frequent. \\"Unfaithful\\", the second single, is one of these. While nicely masking the beats by using acoustic percussion instruments, the chorus is far too large for her vocals, and doesn't compliment her at all. However, \\"Final Goodbye\\" does not over use her voice is complimented by the quite feeling the acoustic guitar gives. <br /> <br />Overall, a more solid album than most. And with the extra pictures and changeable packaging of the limited edition really makes this album a step above her first album.  <br /> <br />Stand out tracks: SOS, Kisses Don't Lie, Final Goodbye, Break It Off, Selfish Girl
B000ETQRCM|5.0|By the time Riot Act came out, I thought Pearl Jam had settled into a comfortable if underwhelming groove. But from the opening moments of \\"Life Wasted,\\" it looks like they were just saving up their mojo for especially hard impact.<br /><br />This isn't the langorous, sometimes muddy PJ of yore. This album is tight, energetic, and rough around the edges -- in a good way. While bands like Tool are apparently content to root around the confines of a studio soundscape, PJ sounds like a band jamming in a garage, but with excellent production that allows Vedder's voice to come through clearly over the mix. It's timeless rock, with some punk mentality that still retains their indelible soulfulness (and hopelessly cryptic lyrics, natch). It owes no alleigance to current trends or styles. Often this is a bad thing, but PJ makes it work here, with impressive effortlessness.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the CD-holding device is a pain in the neck. I almost split the disk in half before it grudingly popped out. You can't just push down on the button -- that does nothing. So beware. In fact, I'd recommend swapping out to a spare jewel case. On a side note, the art inside the jewel case is pretty dark and alarming. Don't know quite what to make of that.
B000E5N62U|5.0|I had heard there was a new album on its way and filed that info for later. I put back three cds (R&B, Alternative and Rap) that I already had in my hand to purchase when I saw \\"Morph The Cat\\" on the shelf. I have been a Steely Dan fan ever since I would find their music mixed in with a group called \\"SteelEyeSpan\\" in my L.A. neighborhood record store decades ago. <br />I have everything between Fagen and Becker that was released, except any video. My first dvd was \\"Everything Must Go\\". I bought that twice because I purchased the cd without the dvd. I just did the same with \\"Morph The Cat\\". They don't appear in front of the camera very often, like another favorite of mine, Joni Mitchell, so I have to get back to the store to purchase again. Whether together or apart, they never disappoint!!!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I'll keep this fairly short since a lot of other reviews on here basically echo how I feel. <br /> <br />This is a really excellent album, no doubt about it.  \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"The Pot\\" are really heavy and awesome metal songs.  Then you have their really good progressive stuff like \\"Wings for Marie / 10,000 Days\\" and \\"Right in Two.\\"  Maynard's lyrics are excellent and everyone's musicianship is absolutely stellar.  If you're a Tool fan, you will love this, there is no reason not to. <br /> <br />However, the thing I most loved about Tool (besides their ridiculously good music) is how all of their main albums were so groundbreakingly different.  Undertow, Aenima and Lateralus all sound NOTHING alike, in any way.  This is what made the extremely long wait periods in between tolerable -- because you got something so beyond your expectations that it was truly worth it. <br /> <br />However, I really think this album sounds a lot like Lateralus.  The songs build the same way, you've got really similar ideas in the music, and the atmospheric quality sounds almost EXACTLY the same.  It sounds like Tool could have recorded this not even a year after doing Lateralus. <br /> <br />Does that make the album bad in any way?  Absolutely not.  Again, this is a GREAT album.  It's just that it certainly stops Tool's progression of sounding nothing alike on each successive release. <br /> <br />If you are a Tool fan, or interested in progressive metal, do not hesitate to buy this album at all.  It is superb.  Just don't expect something much different from Lateralus, if you've already heard that.  As just for the record, I'd say I like Lateralus more too.  Nothing here seems to reach the ridiculously high peaks of \\"Schism\\" or the \\"Parabol / Parabola\\" duo. <br /> <br />As an extra note though, this album probably has the best packaging I have ever seen.  The artwork is extremely cool and when you combine it with the 3D-like glasses, it's really blowaway stuff.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I never really got into Tool. I wasn't a huge fan of the anti-god messages and such, but I did enjoy a few songs. Upon listening to the leak of this album a couple weeks ago, I really didn't like it. However, I kept going back and listening to it again and again. I didn't know why, but the more I listened the more I wanted to listen. It's like an addiction of sorts, and the more I listened the more I liked what I was hearing. It is now to the point where I have never liked a piece of music as much as I like this album. From start to finish it is an expierence, and is highly experimental. Definetly get this, and really give it a chance.
B000E97X66|5.0|What a great concert, this is probably the best live album released by Bruce. Let's hope there are other gems like this from 1978 in Sony's vaults.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam has been around for over 15 years. That statement makes me feel a bit old, so I can only imagine how old it makes the band feel. Back in the early nineties, Pearl Jam was on top of the emerging grunge scene and even surpassed Nirvana as one of the biggest bands in the world. Since 1994's \\"Vitalogy,\\" however, Pearl Jam has had a hard time reclaiming the rock world that they ruled. Through a string of relatively well-received, yet financial disappointing, albums, Pearl Jam has pushed on, continuing to evolve in the process.<br /><br />The release of Pearl Jam's self-titled album marks the band's seventh major studio-release in 15 years. Typically, a self-titled album is usually a statement about how the artist perceives themselves. With \\"Pearl Jam,\\" the band is clearly making a statement, saying, \\"This is who we are. Like it or leave it.\\" However, Pearl Jam dows much more than make this brazen statement. They back it up with a truly refreshing addition to both their catalog and the mainstream rock scene.<br /><br />\\"Pearl Jam\\" begins with the song \\"Life Wasted,\\" the band's triumphal re-entry into the CD players and iPod's across the world as Eddie Vedder sings, \\"I've tasted a life wasted. I'm never going back again.\\" It is a good starting point for the album and one of the best Pearl Jam tracks to date. Transitioning from blazing guitar solos and Eddie Vedder's (trademarked) almost-drunken shrieks to half-time soft-rock balladry is no easy feat to pull off, but the band does it amazingly and capture the true versatility in their music. The remainder of the album can best be described as \\"unpredictable,\\" featuring a wide assortment of songs and influences that only goes to further the notion that Pearl Jam is a band worth indulging in for hours and days on end.<br /><br />What the band accomplishes with this album is more than creating a 13-song revival of sorts. On the contrary, Pearl Jam has proven that in the flimsy, here-today-gone-tomorrow world of nineties rock, at least one band has proven they are more than an early nineties genre-fit.<br /><br />Pearl Jam has risen from the ashes of grunge-rock and put their heart and soul into one of the best albums to come out so far in 2006.<br /><br />Though ecclectic at times, one cannot simply dismiss the raw talent and raw emotion that went into the making of this album. Granted, it may not be Pearl Jam's best, but it's definitely towards the top of the list. There are a handful of tracks on this album that could easily be argued as some of the band's most impressive, and that is definitely an accomplishment.

At more than 15 years into their career, Pearl Jam has proven that they still have a lot to say and a lot more songs in store for us...if we are lucky. <br /> <br />Key Tracks: <br />1. \\"Life Wasted\\" <br />2. \\"World Wide Suicide\\" <br />3. \\"Comatose\\" <br />4. \\"Severed Hand\\" <br />5. \\"Come Back\\" <br /> <br />4 out of 5 Stars

B000002GGW|3.0|After a 2 year hiatus from Hodgson's major turn of decision to leave the band that gave birth to his formidable career, co-founder Rick Davies decided to move on hooking up with Supertramp's remaining band members - taking total charge of the band's musical direction and songwriting chores - came up with this six-tracked LP, which initialized Davies' complete handling of Supertramp, characterized by his continual lyrical innuendo regarding Hodgson's flight from the group - guised in the maneuver of wooing back a woman's affection of sorts, which is first encountered in a more evident way on Supertramp's previous Lp, the final one with Hodgson entitled FAMOUS LAST WORDS,  the song \\"Waiting So Long\\".     Quite peculiar - the album cover features Darwin's infamous diagram for the evolution of man, which extends to the inner sleeve picturing Supertramp's four remaining band members -- it seems to connote a certain kind of complimentary symbolical iconography of sorts for their then-driving force Roger Hodgson perhaps; that obviously, somewhat needless to say (and yet I'd state it anyhow as such) - SUPERTRAMP without Hodgson is indeed a major issue to serve as a gap for a missing link of sorts concerning the band to pull through in order to work out well.  It even kind of resembles The Beatles' 'official' final album, ABBEY ROAD which symbolically depicts the group to bury Paul McCartney out of the gimmick instigated by the late John Lennon - which turn out that Lennon had to eat up his word by telling McCartney not to play in the band in response to McCartney's words that they can't go on arguing all of the time if they are to continue on working as a unit (as heard on the supplementary for the LET IT BE album reissue \\"NAKED\\"), that it winded up as a significant representation of the Beatles' trasistion to disband -- whilst with this Supertramp album cover : it's the transistion of moving on without Hodgson.    Commenced with its 7 minute single feature track \\"Cannonball\\" (one of such as those that's most passable to ever come out from Davies) - it reflects a very sad constituent for the direction of the band, in particular to Davies' perspective prospectively regarding the band's direction without Hodgson; and yet Davies in his own right, was still able to pull through with a number of exceptionally good tracks for this Lp - such as the second track \\"Still In Love with you\\", and what follows \\"No Inbetween\\", and \\"Better Days\\".    The album coming out as the first to present what would turn out for the band's route under the direction of Davies' tutelage for Supertramp, it features guitar works from Marty Walsh - along with THIN LIZZY's Scott Gorham (who, by the way is an in-law to one of Supertramp's members who've then referred Gorham to the Phil Lynott group), in particular to the album's title track, wherein the album being guised as packaged with no gaps between the tracks similar to a concept album in the veins of Pink Floyd's DARK SIDE OF THE MOON (kinda like a revamp of sorts to Supertramp's CRIME OF THE CENTURY (that spawned the first Lp with the full classic line-up of Hodgson/Davies/Siebenberg/Thomson/Helliwell); which had that better spunk to beat the said over-rated Pink Floyd album anytime) - in this case, Davies also incorporated Floyd's guitarist David Gilmore, whilst Davies' songwriting apparently turned into something that appears very akin with Roger Waters of Pink Floyd's style of ode-like narratives in that respect for the majority of the tracks within this album, which is characteristically met further on with Supertramp's next releases from this point on.    The album however ends poignantly with a very hopeful yet sad ballad \\"Open Every Door\\", which is rivaled similar but in a more light-hearted way on the closer for the band's 1997 release SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE (the album being quite link-able to christian stuff anyway -somewhat), the song \\"Where There's A Will\\", which is quaintly humourous to also slotin melodically a faint and subtly executed interlude of the traditional church hymn \\"Amazing Grace\\", which is a better developed album of sorts, comparatively for what fallowed this one - the album FREE AS A BIRD.
B000F2C87Q|5.0|This is a great EP and more than worth the money it costs. You need to keep in mind though that this is not your typical Black Keys album. It actually sounds more like their first album The Big Come Up than their last album Rubber Factory. This album has the rawness of their first album and is not as polished as Rubber Factory. To me this is a good thing though. I love rough and raw music. This is also why it is so cool that they are doing Junior Kimbrough songs. Kimbrough is probably one of the rawest blue artists ever and the Black Keys really capture his sound and even take it a step further by using their distorted guitar and raw backbone drumming. If you don't know Junior Kimbrough he is really worth checking out but you need to be aware that some of his songs \\"wander\\" a bit, meaning that they aren't clean, concise, and under three minutes. The same is true for the songs on this album. Overall though I think this is one of the best efforts the Black Keys have offered yet.
B000068FXX|4.0|Kinda like similar to Allman Brothers Band's BROTHERS AND SISTERS album - Opening with one of Supertramp's best songs \\"Give A Little Bit\\" written by Roger Hodgson, Supertramp's 7-tracked album comes as a magnum opus of sorts, delivering a package that packs a wallop on its own way. <br /> <br />Long before the heyday of Christian rock groups, this Lp in the veins of Roger Hodgson's songcrafting-forte, gives an impression that perhaps influenced by ex-Beatle George Harrison's Hari-Khrisna days have delved well in the topic of spirituality and about one's longing for the Divine (so much as similarly an explored thematical territory on Hodgson's ballad found in their best-selling BREAKFAST IN AMERICA album - the song \\"Lord Is It Mine\\"), that went forth with the title track, to the second side opener (on the Lp) \\"Babaji\\", down to the final track/album closer - the 10:51 minute long ultimate filler-track epic \\"Fool's Overture\\", which speaks of an allegorical narrative about the great prophet who've come to lead a path for retribution, but was scoffed and executed by the world's masses in general - sort of echoing a certain stance about the Messiah found in the records from the book of Isaiah in the Bible's old testament scriptures. <br /> <br />The album also contains Rick Davies' decent although lengthy track \\"From Now On\\" (quite a coincidental peculiarity - the band being a popular hit in France, and while during on being in the missions training at a certain time back then, I've come to read a Christian book written in French with the same title,,, hm.), and Davies'  \\"Downstream\\" is not that bad at all, but is quite a fine palatable piece of track for an album-filler's sense of a way. <br /> <br />Supertramp's EVEN IN THE QUIETEST MOMENTS... (coming out from 1977 - this , with STAR WARS!) quite stands as one among the most remarkable album in the art-rock/progressive bands genre. A worthwhile classic. <br /> <br />  RATE = 9 out of 10 <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|3.0|I have been a huge Tool fan for a long time, and I really expected more than this.  there is nothing on this album to blow the listener away, while there is plenty to be annoyed by.  Overall, this album has very repetitive songs, there is not nearly enough sonic adventurousness to compete with previous albums.  Adam Jones is actually copying himself in half the songs, the guy needs to learn there is more than a D minor penatonic scale. i forget which track, but there is one song where he is totally playing the intro riff to Lateralus.  Maynards vocals are all over the place, with the speed-talking part on Rosetta Stoned (#8) being the most grating stuff I have ever heard, not to mention the fact that the band is playing a very boring riff underneath.  The singing on the beginning of track 5 is, ummm..., not that great.  Lyrically, though, Maynard does a great job 99% of the time.  so yeah, it sounds like I'm totally trashing the album, but it is honestly still better than 85-90% of the rest of music being made.  However, when compared to their back catalogue, it is very disappointing.  it could have-should have been so much more than this.  I'm gonna go listen to Lateralus now...
B00000JR29|5.0|\\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" is Tears for Fears at their finest.     For me, this album epitomizes the eighties. The tracks have the catchy hooks I love in 80s pop songs, but are also very introspective. Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith were very interested in psychology, especially Janov's \\"Primal Scream\\" theory, which is evident in \\"Shout,\\" \\"Mother's Talk,\\" and other tracks. The title of the album itself has some psychological meaning, although I don't remember what it is at the moment.    Roland Orzabal, the primary songwriter, is at his peak, providing such finely crafted, Beatlesque melodies as \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Head Over Heels.\\" The album itself is well produced and the songs are very intricate and layered. To demonstrate this, \\"Shout and \\"Head Over Heels\\" took six months to produce.     The album contains two US number one hits, \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Shout,\\" and a number three hit, \\"Head Over Heels.\\" The album itself held the top spot for three weeks.    My only complaint is the extra tracks, which are not really worth listening to, except the remix of \\"Shout.\\" But all of the original tracks are spectacular, and \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" is certainly worth buying.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is simply awesome. Now, let me state right from the beginning: I don't listen to music for the 'meaning' of the song. I listen to it for the beats, harmonies, and the general vibe I get from the music. If you are one who analyzes the meaning of every word of a song, I can't comment on whether or not you will like this album. <br /> <br />Danny Carey (the drummer) is amazing in this album. Listen to almost any song on this album (Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot, Rosetta Stoned, etc) and just focus on the drums. Try to tap it out - you can't. He is just too fast and he is doing so many 'unnatural' beats, yet it all comes together in a perfectly 'natural' way. <br /> <br />One of my favorite song combos on the album is the transition from Lost Keys to Rosetta Stoned. A mysterious patient has entered the hospital and he won't speak to anyone. The doctor ends Lost Keys by saying to the patient, \\"What's happened? Tell me everything.\\" And then Rosetta Stoned begins with this mentally disturbed patient rambling to the hard riff of the guitar and Danny doing his thing in the background. <br /> <br />It's impossible to say if this album will have the lifetime of Tool's past albums - which I still listen to quite often (Opiate being 14 years old still has a place on my 4GB iPod mini). Also, was it worth 5 years of wait? I cannot say yet. <br /> <br />My all-time favorite Tool song is Lateralus. I believe that was Tool's most technical song, and I think many of the songs on this album have the potential to be in that same category. The entire band has brought their A game to this album. <br /> <br />If you're already a Tool fan, you will not want to miss this album. If you are a tentative Tool fan, I would recommend purchasing a few of these songs off of iTunes, giving them a listen, then purchasing the whole album and listening to it in order - it flows very well. If you're not a Tool fan, what are you doing reading this review?
B000EULJLU|1.0|I have been a Tool fan for a long time, and I must say this album is by far one of the worst albums I have ever purchased. There is not ONE song I could get into. Maynard's singing and lyrics are absolutely HORRIBLE! I could not believe the rest of the band could possibly allow this to happen. The bass is simply bad and at times sickening. On one track I nearly puked from seasickness! The guitar does not make enough appearances and is not energetic by any standards. My boyfriend, being Native American, was offended by the chanting track. Not because it was chanting, but because they had to make a mockery of it. The drums are the best thing going for this album besides the Alex Grey artwork. <br />  If you are searching for the inspiration Tool has provided in the past, you will definitely NOT find it here! If you are new to this band, DO NOT start with this album. If you are a die-hard Tool fan, please show your support by NOT BUYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP!  <br />  I must say I was very excited to get this album at first. I even went to a release party and stood in line for no less than 2 hours to get one of the first copies. I am warning you, if you love Tool, do not even listen to it, it will make you want to cry.  <br />  Tool was the last hope for good music this generation, and they blew it. I feel very ashamed to have to say this, but like every other HAS BEEN, I liked the earlier stuff better. <br />
B00000IPAX|4.0|Now im not saying that this is a crappy CD but its defintly worth buying. And this band is funny and so are thier jokes. Theres not alot of other bands liek this. Every song on the CD is good. Aliens Excist and Whats my Age are VERY catchy and the Party Song gets stuck in ur head and makes u wanna sing it all day. Best songs on CD are What's my Age Again,Wendy Clear,Adam's Song and Party Song.
B00004STPT|5.0|This soudntrack REALLY brings back the incredible film. I you have seen the film, you need this music. I am a Zimmer collector, and this is one of his greatest scores, (next to The Last Samurai, and Pearl Harbor) This settle mourning of track one, to the bold spectacle of track 9, this is a must buy.
B000EULJLU|5.0|and when I say \\"effort,\\" I am referring to the 5 times or so I had to listen to this album before I stopped hating it. Then I had to listen to it a few more times before I started loving it, which I do now. 10,000 Days is not the type of album that will appeal to those on the first spin. You really have to give yourself time to absorb this album. Once you do though you will not be dissapointed as this is Tool's best album. My one complaint is that I wish there had been 2 or 3 more \\"real\\" songs instead of the weird instrumentals or filler tracks as some refer to them as (Wings for Marie Part 1 and Lost Keys), but most of the actual songs are great, especially Jambi, the Pot and Right in Two. Considering how bad the music scene is these days, 10,000 days is the right album at the right time. Hopefully we will not have to wait another 5 years for their next CD.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is a terrific album and worth the wait for all Tool fans and a must listen for anyone looking to get into some terrific music. As some reviewers have noted before me, this is an album that needs to be savored in its entirety for a complete experience. I stress the word experience because 10KD is a mindblowing audio trip.  Initially I wasnt blown away, not disappointed but the songs sounded like \\"Tool\\" (if you know what I mean) but a  <br />couple of listens in, I was completely hooked. The sounds kept reverberating through my head.  Tool has scaled new heights with this album.  <br />First the etymology:  <br />Maynard explains that his mother Judith Marie Garrison (November 22, 1943 - June 18, 2003) suffered a stroke that left her partially paralyzed and wheelchair-bound. The length of time between her paralysis and her death was 27 years, or approximately 10,000 days.  <br />Track listing and times:  <br /> <br />1. Vicarious  - 7:08  <br />2. Jambi - pronounced \\"jam bye\\" - 7:30 <br />3. Wings For Marie (Pt 1) - 6:13 <br />4. 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2) - 11:15  <br />5. The Pot - 6:24 <br />6. Lipan Conjuring - 1:13 (*) <br />7. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) - 3:48 (*) <br />8. Rosetta Stoned - 11:13 <br />9. Intension - 7:23 <br />10. Right In Two - 8:57 <br />11. Viginti Tres - 5:02 (*)  <br />* - soundscapes.   <br />As noted, all the songs are well over 6 minutes !! A terrific prospect for any prog metal lover and Tool more than delivers. The longest songs \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"Wings for Marie\\" are easily amongst the strongest tracks in the album.  <br />Its a showcase not only of MJK's fabolous voice (he indulges in interesting vocal effects on songs such as Rosetta stoned) but also the rest of the band's awesome musical talents. Danny Carey has really outdone himself and in addition to his (usual) fabolous drumming, he seems to take advantage of interesting percussion sounds such as the tabla that shows up in some songs. Adam Jones and Justin Chancellor provide great support with signature Tool chords and rhythms. <br />Lyrically, the band continues some of the dark themes, satire and use of metaphors to convey their own version of social and lyrical commentary. Imagery in \\"Right in two\\" - \\"silly monkeys give them thumbs they make a club and beat their brother down\\" seems very Roger waters-ish in its darkness and cynicism. They also dont miss a shot at the \\"law\\" with lines like \\"Who are you to wave your finger?\\" and make no secret of which side they're on with \\"Ganja please\\" at the end of \\"The Pot\\".  <br />I must add that this album amply substitutes for the need for any synthetic mood enhancers.  <br />All Tool fans have by now gotten used to the soundscapes that seem to be segues for songs.   <br />My ONLY grouse with the album are these pieces . Lipan (an Apache tribe) Conjuring is a Native American chant that kind of disrupts the flow of the songs. I cant seem to get into Viginti Tres (which luckily for me is at the end of the album) <br />I actually like \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)\\" which has a rather eerie soundtrack of a nurse talking to a doctor. <br /> <br />In some places, the chords sound remarkably similar to earlier Tool songs and I found myself almost breaking out into the other song. But thats cool since those songs were terrific too !!!  <br />Finally a word about the CD itself. Fans of Tool have always loved its artwork and this album is no different. The album art is pretty cool and seems to further explore the themes seen in Lateralus (not surprisingly the artist is Alex Grey) <br />I salivate at the prospect of seeing them live this tour.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|Amazon.com. A great music resource that unfortunately is flooded with rabid fans who have difficulty objectively judging new music by their favorite artists. Here I will present my relatively unbiased fan's perspective on Pearl Jam's new self-titled album. Overall, it is a good album, but far from the return to greatness that some would have you believe. \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is indeed a terrific song with great energy (it will kill live), and it fits up there with the best of their work. However, other than a few other tracks nothing much comes close to what we have come to expect from Pearl Jam. \\"Army Reserve\\" has a catchy, driving groove but ultimately lacks any remarkable qualities. \\"Marker in the Sand\\" is a little more successful as a complete song but somehow doesn't draw one in like a good Pearl Jam song should. \\"Come Back\\" is something of a departure for Pearl Jam, but honestly this sort of '50s soul has been done much better by Sam Cooke, Percy Sledge, and other such greats. \\"Life Wasted\\" although effective lyrics-wise, is overshadowed musically by the brief but poignant \\"Wasted Reprise.\\" Perhaps the second best track on the album is \\"Inside Job,\\" a moody piece that starts melancholy and subdued and eventually turns into an energetic rocker. Sadly, the rest of the album is largely forgettable and will not stand the test of time. Now, before you rush to click the \\"unhelpful\\" button listen to a copy of this album and ask yourself how well any of the songs here (other that \\"Suicide\\") can match up to past Pearl Jam triumphs such as \\"Corduroy,\\" \\"Black,\\" \\"In Hiding,\\" \\"Dissident,\\" or \\"Love Boat Captain,\\" just to name a very few; I could list numerous PJ tracks that stand out as superior to most anything on this album. That isn't to say that 'Pearl Jam' isn't worthwhile, its just not as good as the majority of their output. Despite my disappointment, I have no doubt PJ has a few more great albums left in them.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I'm not a Tool fan -- in fact this is my first Tool album -- but I kinda like it. It's a bit of a mixed bag for me. Some songs like \\"The Pot\\" and \\"Vicarious\\" are really good. Others like the title track are just too long. But maybe they'll sound better the more I listen to them.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|50 shoulda let havoc and alchemist produce the whole album <br /> <br />70% of the beats here arent gritty at all...wtf?
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Wolfmother is an up and coming band from Australia. Andrew Stockdale's voice and guitar is awsome. His vocals blend Ozzy, Robert Plant and Jack White into one. All 3 members of this band are awsome. They are a throwback to the hard rock of the late 60's amd 70's. You can hear who their influences are all over this album and the main influence is Ozzy's Sabbath, some Zeppelin and a little White Stripes with various other bands mixed in. The whole album sounds great, but the highlight tracks are Dimension, White Unicorn and Mind's Eye. If you don't have this album get it! I will be listening to this cd for a long time to come.  mixed in.
0060512806|5.0|Its got math, science, adventure, treasure-hunting and hilarious ramblings - I'm definitely reading Quicksilver soon.
B000EMGAGW|1.0|Mobb Deep Blood Money 1/2 Star    Talk about an gangsta rap album without gangstas, Blood Money The 7th in the series of Mobb Deep albums is dead in the water.    The Original Mobb Deep from 1993-96 (Juvenile Hell, The Infamous, Hell on Earth) remains a classic, dark pacing, morose beats and rapping from prodigy & Havoc are forever ingrained in hip-hop history,     The Others    Murda Musik, Infamy (with the exception of amerikaz's nightmare) need not be discussed.    Keep that in mind that in each album, mobb has progressively gone from worse to worse, now they signed to 5-0 & his stupid group (G-Unit)    Come On.    The Songs are completely horrible here, the rapping is really bad now especially prodigy, the beats are not impressive (poor havoc wasted in this thing), the lyrical content is atrocious even the front album cover is fake.    11 Years ago they did a song called there's a world going on outside no man save from (Survival of the fittest)    Now they have their own careers need to be saved after this piece of junk    Only the cadillac escalade on the video is preventing this mess from giving it a zero star rating.    Blood Money is a horrible disaster and the worst album of mobb's already stagnating career.    Already the top contender for the worst albums of 2006, no doubt about that.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I don't see what the fuss is all about for this album, to me I think its great.  I'm not a huge tool fan but this sounds a lot like there older stuff and I don't see what the problem is with that.  The only problem with this album is that it took 5 years, and again I don't see a problem with that either, Lateralus nearly took 5 years and its being hailed as TOOLS BEST ALBUM but that is just an understatement because I think this is Tools best work since AENIMA which was released 10 years ago.  So if Tool needs to  come out with an album every 5 years thats fine with me as long as they can pull it off and with this album I think they did so stop your bitchin and really listen to this cd, ya it does take time to listen to it but as other reviewers said, once you get into this album you will really like it.  Personally, I think this album is better than Lateralus but thats just me.
B000EULJLU|5.0|That is surely the question on the mind of all you Tool fans out there. Does this effort justify the 5 year hiatus after their previous effort? My answer, and I daresay yours will be as well, is that 10,000 Days is Tool's new crowning glory. <br /> <br />Maynard James Keenan said before this album that this piece of music came from a much more angry Tool, angry at Bush, angry at the state of politics, and by GOD, it SHOWS. Gone are the 'Eon Blue Apocalypse' interludal sojourns into softer textures, and in come juggernauts such as the 11 minute title track, the 11 minute 'Rosetta Stoned', and a smattering of 6-8 minute tracks. 'Lipan Conjuring' is the only Tool track here that clocks in at the brief span of 1:08. <br /> <br />Yet, these are mere facts and figures. The music here, is much more visceral than anything Tool has done in recent efforts. It has a much more direct \\"heavy metal\\" feel than the instrumental textures of both Lateralus and Aenima. I'm daring to say that Tool has got the blend perfect for a self-professed \\"angry album\\". It will have no problem sinking in with progressive and heavy metal fans, as compared with Lateralus (a much harder to digest album). Of course, SPARE the radio and mainstream pop fans PLEASE, their heads are liable to explode after the first 3 time sig changes. <br /> <br />10,000 Days leads off with an excellent song, Vicarious, which truly sets the tone for the entire album. Whereas MJ Keenan sounded spiritual on Lateralus, the harshly throat-voiced opening line \\"Eye on the TV...\\" is more vicious, as well as abandoning some of their more lofty intellectual lyrics, for \\"impact\\" lines, words that we all can immediately identify with. The album is finely paced, too. The propulsive metal moments of 10,000 Days pop up in the trinity of \\"Vicarious\\", \\"10,000 Days\\", and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\", all carefully timed crescendos of the album as a whole composition of music. Personally, I'd say the composition and timing of 10,000 Days surpasses even Lateralus. <br /> <br />Should you buy it? Absolutely. 10,000 Days might just be your most treasured album of the next ten thousand days of your life.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Just wanted to say this album is simply amazing. It takes a few listens to truly appreciate. Upon first listen I thought it was pretty good. But after a few more listens you start to hear the brillance in the music. It takes time, it was like lateralus. I thought it was ok to start, then starts to grow on you. That is why their music is so layered.  <br /> <br />Buy the album and support Tool.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I picked up the album today and have listened to it twice already. I really don't understand why people keep saying they have to \\"warm up\\" or \\"get used to this CD\\". There is nothing to get used to this album is by far the best Tool album to date. The only reason I think people think they have to listen to it a few times to appreciate it is those that think Anemia was there first album. True Tool fans get it the first time.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album gives me feelings that i have never felt before. Inside Job blows my mind along with the rest of the album. Ive been waiting a long time for this, and ive not been let down. Goodday.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|After putting up with albums recently that had a handful of great songs, and much filler, Pearl Jam is back with a full album! This is what fans have been waiting for. <br />Welcome back Pearl Jam.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie was an amazing medley of sci-fi, action, and  romance. The director put together an amazing storyline, put together with great visual effects, and brilliantly brought out the characters. This movie will keep you up long past your bed time, and will entertain your entire family, again and again.
B0000028M7|5.0|'Dirt' (1992) is Alice in Chains 2nd studio album, and by far their best.    Now, as a huge hard rock fan (the main reason why I'm even on this site) I've never been big into grunge (I'm more into heavy metal, progressive rock and classic rock), although I utterly hate the poser grunge bands of today such as Creed, Nickleback and among other crappy bands like these, and I also think that Nirvana are extremely overrated. But I also never thought much of Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots and Soungarden. AIC is the only grunge band I really like. However this is really a damn goooood album! I got it about 6 or 7 years ago when I was around 10 and I still listen to this today. Layne Staley was THE BEST vocalist in the genre (sorry, Eddie Vedder) and is also one of the best of all time, to me, Layne sang with more passion than any other grunge singer. Mike Starr who left after this album was a great bassist. And Jerry Cantrell was a cool guitarist (although slightly overrated, IMHO) and an awesome songwriter. Everyone on this band was great. I like every song on the album, standouts are the opener 'Them Bones' (like you don't know this song), 'Dam That River', the slow-paced 'Rooster' (same thing as TB), 'Angry Chair' and 'Would' which is my favorite song on the album, the solo is nice, the riffs are amazing and one of the best choruses I've ever heard.    All in all, if you're a fan of rock in general, you'll love this.  It also gets my vote for the best grunge album ever, Nerdvana's 'Nevermind' doesn't even come close!    Rest in peace Layne Staley :'(
B000EULJLU|2.0|I like many that have written reviews of this album am very disappointed.  In fact, this is the one album I have been anticipating more than any other so far this year, and it has been a disappointing year. <br /> <br />Track 1 starts things off well, had to get a Raleigh station to actually hear it before the release, and track 2 is good as well.  The trouble really starts when you get to track 3.  The song reminds me of the end of AEnima or even Undertow, sort of a collage of sonds but not really going anywhere.  Interesting to listen to, but gets a bit repetitive and is more of a soundscape than a song.  If I want soundscapes, I'll go buy Yanni.  You get interesting bits and pieces through the Marie epic, but it is boring droning on, no real song, and a lot of chanting and verse reading.  Track 5 gets better, a real song again, like a breath of fresh air.  ^ is filler, 7 is filler with some bad medical movie dialogue (I do this for a living, do I need to hear it on cd?).  Track 8 is another good song, and then it just sort of loses speed past there.  Tracks 9 and 10 are plodding, but don't sound cohesive somehow, and then they end it all with fuzz and noise on track 11, much like the last album. <br /> <br />THere are really only 4 songs that you'll want to listen to. <br />I did buy the new Pearl Jam CD today and after listening to both of them, if I could only buy one, I'd buy the Pearl Jam.  ANd I bought Pearl Jam just because I had an extra $10 burning a hole in my pocket, haven't been a fan of theirs since high school. <br /> <br />In summary, if they spent more time actually working on this disc instead of side projects, claymation videos and gimicky packaging straingh out of the old cracker jack prizes (what's next, Tool tattoos or the game where you get the little balls in the holes where the band's picture is cut out?) they'd have put together something special.  If you liked the dull remakes of emotive, you'll like this album.
B00005JO1P|5.0|For the duration of this film 'Walk The Line', asks one pretty easy question and any girl would usually be dying to hear what Johnny proposes, and answer in the affirmative. \\"Will you marry me?\\", or \\"One day I am going to marry you.\\" Followed closely by an ecstatic \\"YES!\\" Only for struggling song-writer Johnny Cash life hasn't been so kind and when he meets June Carter this task will be easier said then done. After a stint in prison on drugs related charges, and the death of his brother in a sawing accident, of which he feels responsible, when treated with contempt by his father Ray (Robert Patric who starred in James Mangold's earlier film 'Cop Land' and James Cameron's 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day) who has left issues between himself and his living son unresolved for years. It is while in jail, and after his release, where Johnny Cash decides unusually to make music for those in prison, because he can relate to them the most I guess, and because he's had first hand experience there, and so he dismisses most concert stages in the process. It is during a live function Johnny attends while trying to break into the music industry, around the time of Elvis, and make a name for himself that his eye is taken instantly by a girl called June Carter. It's the two leads lively, often witty repartee that got my interest and kept it. I felt very much like Johnny Cash, as well as feeling like I was back in high school, where feelings are hightened, when any girl could catch my eye, or anyone's for that matter, and  playfully make promises of staying together forever, but for some, drifting apart is the most likely of outcomes. I have to say I really admire the determination of Johnny Cash as he pursues the girl of his dreams and her refusal makes Johnny more determined then ever to make her his.<br /><br />At the start of the film I thought, 'Walk The Line' felt like something out of 'The Andy Griffith Show' intoduction, because it has a fishing poll in it, just obviously without the infamous whistling tune that accompanies Andy Griffth and a little Ronny Howard walking down to the river with their fishing poles.<br /><br />I saw a special sneek preview of 'Walk The Line' weeks before it hit Australian cinemas on February 2nd 2006. Instead I saw it on 25th January 2006. 'Walk The Line' marks my second special screening of a Reese Witherspoon film before the official release date. The first film I saw of hers before everyone else was 'Legally Blonde 2: Red White and Blonde'. So I felt very fortunate and honoured to be part of another special screening. Before seeing the film I really knew nothing about the real-life late singers Johnny Cash or June Carter and where their lives lead them on tour after tour. It is a story of love, but also many others that this 'Walk The Line' film travels along, and sometimes crosses over, as it explores the entertaining life of Johnny Cash. At times it did feel a little like 'Ray', which is a great movie, I just felt 'Walk The Line' was much better.  All I knew of this film before I saw it, was the poster art of Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon in a passionate embrace, as they bask in the warmth of the spotlight together; both bodies totally consumed with desire for each other. As well as one preview for the film, which includes a totally cool still of the actors of today as their characters in a black and white comic book black line drawing sketch, as their names appear on the screen giving the preview a really neat edge.<br /><br />It took seven years for 'Walk The Line' to come to the screen. It fortunately had the blessing of both Johnny and June and they both worked hard with director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted) to get the film right. One of the best things about 'Walk The Line' is the real people also got to pick who they wanted to play them in the film. Joaquin Phoenix was the ideal choice for Johnny Cash, who decided on him after enjoying Joaquin's performance in 'Gladiator'. The only thing I know about June's choice was that she wanted Reese Witherspoon, and that they never got to meet. June Carter you certainly know talent when you see it! One of her family told Reese her breasts weren't big enough, but that's never a concern for me, and it thankfully wasn't for anyone making the film. Amazingly to some both actors really sing and play, and it was equally hard at times for each individual actor, but both Joaquin and Reese really smoulder together, and it's a real joy watching them work together. Even though initially Reese hadn't planned on singing in the film, I knew she could sing beautifully after watching her in 2004s 'Vanity Fair', and she really doesn't disappoint here. I'm so glad there is a soundtrack featuring the actors singing themselves. It was something I hoped for while watching the film. I also really enjoy Reese's scenes with the autoharp even though that was a difficult instrument for her, however you'd never know because she pulls it off effortlessly. I'm already a huge fan of Reese Witherspoon's work, but here all her excellent work in previous films is put to the test and she succeeds with a performance I'm very proud of. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheonix are the only two actors I imagine in these roles. There is no one else. Although now I'm certain there are girls everywhere hoping for a 'Walk The Line 2'. I never see it happening, but just for fun, and to prove how popular this movie seems here are a few examples. I read Kirsten Dunst was hanging out with Joaquin Pheonix around the time of this film, so maybe she wished she was Reese. I wouldn't blame her if she did wish that. I read an article about Amanda Bynes, who loves physical comedy, but during an interview for her film 'She's The Man' wanted an Oscar one day like Reese Witherspoon recieved for 'Walk the Line'. Amanda Bynes says... \\"She won a role in 'Walk The Line' where, though it's serious content, she was playing a goofy character. I feel I could easily do that.\\" - Amanda Bynes. Accept no imitations or substitutes! 'Walk The Line' goes it's own path and takes it's time getting there but it's worth the long haul. Purhaps best of all is the fact you don't have to love country music to enjoy this film. This is a film worth waiting in line for. I'm sure the DVD commentry with director James Mangold will be very informative and a delight to listen to. I've no doubt in my mind 'Walk The Line' will become a classic in years to come. I feel the real Johnny Cash and June Carter would commend this film and be so proud of their choice of actors, who keep their spirit alive, as both actors step out onto the stage and glow like the angels the real singers have now become, they are forever immortalised in the warm radiant glow of bright lights on the silver screen for all to now admire, desire, and aspire.une's choice was that she wanted Reese Witherspoon, and that they never got to meet.

B000EGCITG|4.0|I never heard 'Try This', so I can't compare it to her last CD.  What I can say is that it is great, catchy and it's easily the best CD I've bought this year(so far).  The attitude, the lyrics... it's all there.  There is nothing quite as personally jarring as \\"Family Portrait\\"(my favorite Pink song) but Pink has definitely topped herself with this CD.  The biting humor in \\"U + UR Hand\\", \\"Cuz I Can\\", \\"Leave me alone(I'm lonely)\\" where she sings 'no you can't hop into my shower/all I ask for is one f*****g hour', and the tirade against George Dubya in \\"Dear Mr. President\\" stand out.  Pink, after introducing the song, sings with her Dad on the final 'hidden' song \\"I have seen the Rain\\" that her Dad wrote while in Vietnam is also interesting.  Another thing that stands out is her constant use of the F word, which I personally don't have a problem with but all the wal-mart Mothers buying it for their 12 year old daughter might(they flipped out over the Evanescence live CD if you remember).  It's in almost half the songs -or at least it SEEMS like it- Nonetheless, a great CD.  Highly recommended.
B0000E64TR|5.0|But it does not play on all CD players due to it being a SACD. <br /> <br />There is false advertising stating it plays on all CD players. -- Just not on PC players! <br /> <br />False advertising!!!  Very disappointed.   <br /> <br />Please make sure you put that in your description Amazon and smoke it! <br /> <br />Otherwise a great album indeed!
B000002P2W|5.0|Unlike The Who's three previous albums, Tommy, Who's Next and Quadrophenia, Who By Numbers is stripped down, back-to-the-basics rock and roll.  There are no themes, no operettas, no stories running through multiple songs.  Instrumentally, it's comparatively bare-bones; most of the songs are just guitar, bass and drums, played to perfection.  Lyrically, the album as a whole is as good as anything Pete Townshend has written, though much more understated, thematically.  Even the album cover, John Entwhistle's connect-the-dots drawing, is almost child-like in its simplicity.  It's as if the band intended a 180 degree turn from high-art aspirations of their previous three albums (of original material), not unlike the Beatles' original approach to Let it Be.<br /><br />Whether the simplicity of Who By Numbers was accidental or intentional, it produced The Who's best album.  Tommy is great as a concept album, but if you're just interested in hearing good rock and roll tunes, the story line, and the extra songs needed to round out the \\"opera,\\" get in the way.  The same is true, to a lesser extent, with Quadrophenia.  Who By Numbers, short and to the point, has no such faults.<br /><br />\\"Dreaming From the Waist\\" is brilliant, a clever but mature description of the effects of raging male hormones and uncontrollable lust.  \\"Blue Red and Grey,\\" a celebration of life, just Pete and a banjo, is maybe Townshend's most beautiful song ever.  \\"They're All in Love\\" is an open letter to the band's recently departed managers, a rather caustic parting shot. \\"However Much I Booze\\" is an admission of Pete's - and maybe Keith Moon's as well - struggles with alcohol (and whatever other substances.)  Oddly enough, the album's weakest tracks are its biggest hits, \\"Squeezebox\\" and \\"Slip Kid\\".  Both are fine songs, but they're eclipsed by their sisters on this album.<br /><br />The 1996 re-issued CD has three bonus tracks, \\"Dreaming From the Waist,\\" \\"Behind Blue Eyes,\\" and \\"Squeeze Box,\\" all live.  They're nice freebies but the album stands up well on its own without any bonus material.<br /><br />Most Who fans would recommend one of the big three, Tommy, Who's Next or Quadrophenia, as essential Who albums.  In my view, Who By Numbers beats them all.  Not only is it a great rock album, it's more honest, more autobiographical and real than those three.  While Townshend, no doubt, showed bits and pieces of himself in those previous albums, he hid behind characters or concepts.  Who By Numbers is his soul laid bare, but without the bellyaching or self-pity of people like Cobain.  Not until Empty Glass, his first major solo release, would Pete be so transparent with his audience.<br /><br />If you love straight-forward rock with intelligent lyrics, this album - whether you're a Who fan or not - is an essential work.ox,\\" all live.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Please do not pay attention to the history lesson, these other reviewers are posting about the Waters/Gilmour controversy.<br /><br />These reviewers are forgetting that the point of a review, is that you are supposed to rate and review the album.<br /><br />Roger Waters is a lyrical Genius. This album proves that.<br /><br />Hands Down, this is Pink Floyd's BEST Album.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Here's my review of the album after my 4th listen. <br /> <br />1. Life Wasted - 9/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: I love the bridge. This is probably my favorite track on the album. <br /> <br />2. World Wide Suicide - 8/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Mosty unintelligble <br />Comments: Good single. The music for the verse is awesome. Contrasts nicely with the chorus. <br /> <br />3. Comatose - 8/10 <br />Music: Good <br />Lyrics: Good <br />Vocals: Fitting to the song. <br />Comments: This song feels like classic Vs. or Vitalogy. It's good. Intro is AC/DC. <br /> <br />4. Severed Hand - 8/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Good <br />Vocals: Much too shaky, but they get better near the end. <br />Comments: I like the softer part of the song. <br /> <br />5. Marker in the Sand - 8/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Pretty good. <br />Comments: Again, the softer part of the song outdoes the heavier part, but it makes for good contrast. <br /> <br />6. Parachutes - 6/10 <br />Music: Awkward at parts, clich? at others. <br />Lyrics: OK <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: Good attempt at a ballad, but I don't really like this song yet. Least favorite on the album. <br /> <br />7. Unemployable - 7/10 <br />Music: OK <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: I like the lyrics, but the song just seems average to me. <br /> <br />8. Big Wave - 8/10 <br />Music: Good <br />Lyrics: Good. <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: It's a nice break to hear a song with no message. <br /> <br />9. Gone - 9/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Too shaky at times. <br />Comments: I love this song. \\"Gas in the tank fills like money in the bank.\\" <br /> <br />10. Wasted Reprise - 8/10 <br />Music: Dammit they stole my chords. <br />Lyrics: Good <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: Just a short reprise of Life Wasted. <br /> <br />11. Army Reserve - 8/10 <br />Music: Good <br />Lyrics: Good <br />Vocals: Pretty good. <br />Comments: A good average song. I like the transitions between 6/8 and 4/4 time signatures but most people won't notice that. <br /> <br />12. Come Back - 8/10 <br />Music: Good <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Good <br />Comments: A more successful attempt at a ballad. It's too long, but I dig it. <br /> <br />13. Inside Job - 9/10 <br />Music: Great <br />Lyrics: Great <br />Vocals: Pretty good <br />Comments: I don't really like the vocals that much during the soft parts, but the awesome song makes up for it. Good closing song. <br /> <br /> <br />OVERALL: Probably my 3rd favorite PJ album at the moment. In my opinion it doesn't outdo No Code or Ten. I love the cover though. I'm going to start calling this album avacado. Album 8/10.
B000EULJLU|3.0|There is one great song off this album, '10,000 days'.. That's it.  The rest of the album is mediocre, that's it. <br /> <br />Tool could release a cd of them going to the bathroom & you sheep would give it 5 stars. <br /> <br />Lateralus & Aenima were both excellent.. This is just pointless, the music DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE.. It barely evokes emotion or thought. <br /> <br />Tool aren't genius, not everything they touch is gold, quit trying to convince each other otherwise.
0895260131|1.0|Dont buy this book. It is a hate book. Whatever you read here is biased and without any notion of serious historical study. Again, THIS IS A HATE BOOK. It promotes hatred based on false and erroneus assumptions made by someone without historical knowledge. BEWARE.
B000002L82|4.0|\\"Blue Monday\\" probably stands as the very best techno-pop dance song that New Order ever did, and, indeed, must be considered one of the best songs of this genre.  But \\"Blue Monday,\\" and its instrumental (and somewhat redundant) counterpart \\"The Beach\\" are only a part of what makes \\"Power, Corruption and Lies\\" such a strong album, the second in New Order's discography.  A much different song, but just as compelling, is \\"Age of Consent,\\" with off-beat lyrics and bass line you can't get out of your head (copied, by the way, by \\"The Jesus and Mary Chain,\\" towards the end of their classic \\"Head On\\").  These two songs alone would probably make this a worthwhile album.  Other strong tracks include \\"586\\" (I would have cut out the introduction and just gone right into the danceable part), the ethereal \\"Your Silent Face,\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone.\\" <br /> <br />P.C.& L. does have it's moments where it sounds dated.  Synthesizers in the early 80's, of which New Order (too?) often heavily relied upon, could sound cold and tinny.  I'm also not usually crazy about drum machines.  But there are moments where Bernard Sumner and Peter Hook really play the heck out of their guitar and bass repectively.  Sometimes you hear a little \\"Joy Division,\\" and other times \\"The Cure,\\" but, after all these years, New Order has remained a unique band who has evolved, but kept true to its own voice.  I might be in the minority, but I think that the band's best albums have been their last three (\\"Republic,\\" \\"Get Ready,\\" and \\"Waiting for the Sirens Call\\") which have a lusher, more melodic sound than their predecessors, with Summers' voice continuing to grow better with age.   <br /> <br />New Order has remained relevant and productive for over 25 years, and that, by itself, says everything.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I did not download the leaked CD.  I decided to show respect for  my favorite band and wait until the release date; I got it only hours ago.    First let me start by saying that this is indeed a brilliant CD. In fact, if it were some other softer sounding band I may have given 10,000 Days 5 stars.  But this is TOOL, and if Lateralus is a 5 star CD (I consider Lateralus to be one of the greatest works of musical genius I have ever listened to) I have to use Lateralus as the \\"Gold Standard\\" to compare this CD to.    I am not going to review every single track on this CD as many others will, I am instead going to review 10,000 Days as a whole.  Many others will write long reviews for each track.    TOOL is my all time favorite band, since Undertow. It pains me greatly to rate a TOOL CD 3 stars but I must do so for the following reasons:    1) I feel that the \\"it sounds like APC not Tool\\" criticisms are justified. If this had been an APC CD I probably would have given it 4 or 4.5 stars.  Indeed, it sounds a lot more like APC to me than Tool.  I do like APC but for the record, although I think APC is great, I think Tool is perhaps one of the greatest bands of the past 2 decades from a pure genius standpoint.    2) I think Maynard's vocals were BURIED. I read Adam Jones's interview in Guitar Player magazine and he said this was done intentionally so the vocals would not bury the band. In this regard, I believe that Lateralus was an absolutely FLAWLESS mix of vocals and guitar, bass and drums. In 10,000 Days by contrast, Maynard gets pushed WAY WAY WAY too far back. For some vocalists this may be OK, but Maynard James Keenan is not one of those. He is a vocalist who MUST be out front. Not in a way that should bury the band but in a good, balanced mixing. Unfortunately, this extremely powerful vocalist we all enjoy so much ends up sounding like a whisper on most of 10,000 Days compared to what we are used to.  I am not suggesting they needed to create a CD which sounded exactly like Lateralus, but balance exactly like Lateralus would have been in order because that CD was in absolutely perfect balance.    3) This is a SOFT CD. That is not necessarily a bad thing, but again this is Tool and not APC. Much of 10,000 Days one could peacefully meditate to. Literally, Vicarious is by far the heaviest song on the CD and even there, Maynard's voice is pushed back to far.    The highlights for me were certainly Vicarious, and also Wings for Marie parts 1 and 2 which are extremely moving.    This CD is still absolutely worth buying for every Tool fan.
B000000OUJ|5.0|from the very second you start this it's awesome. hell, it uses clips from shogun assasin, which is the first two lone wolf and cub movies edited into one. if you're interested in getting these you should get the individual movies rather than shogun assasin. oh, this was what they're watching in kill bill by the way. anyway...back on track.  <br /> <br />When the MC's came, to live our their name <br />And to perform (forrrrm) <br />Some had, to snort cocaine (caiiinnne) to act insane (sannne) <br />with before Pete Rock-ed it on, now gone <br />that the mental plane (plaaanne) to spark the brain (brainnn) <br />with the building to be born <br />Yo RZA flip the track with the what to guy <br />Check em check chicka icka etta UHH <br /> <br />absolutely the best hook ever!!!

0553588486|2.0|Poorly written, puerile, and formulaic.  Within the first page, Martin displays all his weaknesses.  Perhaps it gets better as one goes along, but Martin handles exposition so poorly that one becomes tired of his hamhanded efforts to introduce characters and backstory.  The world he populates resembles a thinly developed D&D game from 1984, and the characters are the sort of adolescent cartoons that poorly-educated fantasy buffs probably think of as \\"complex\\", when they are in fact amorphous blobs of fatal contradiction.  A very silly book from an author who knows the gimmick of marketing crudity as subtlety.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|I never expected that I would see the film again as a sequel of the newest Star Wars series more than 20 years after I saw it at first. Even in this newer edition of the 1977 classic you can find some of the discrepancy from the Anakin Skywalker trilogy.<br />Never mind. It's part of the fun and another reason to watch this film again.<br /><br />First of all, I felt the first half of original 1977 version a bit dull and with the exception of a few of the scenes such as  Princess Leia's hologrammed message recorded in R2D2 had remained in my memory. But thanks to Ani-trilogy I am more eager to watch the first scenes  particularly the re-appearance of Obi-Wan kenobi introduced by Luke Skywalker as Old Ben.<br /><br />After the appearance of Han Solo a Hollywood counterpart of Captain Harlock, the show begins and I can never take my eyes away from the scene until the end. Some of the scene was added to this newer one. But not much to ruin the old classic.<br /><br />Verdict: Fourth episode finally found a home in the entire series.<br />Rating: 90 out of 100<br />Recommended for wide range of sci-fi movies fans.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|This CD reminds me of the line from \\"This is Spinal Tap\\" - something like: \\"the musical growth of this band cannot even be charted.\\"  I have reflected in other reviews how refreshing it is when an artist is not caught up with the need to progress and change, but continues to make the good music that made them successful in the first place.  In Gilmour's case, however, the lack of progression is fatal.  \\"On an Island\\" sounds like the second half of Gilmour's first solo album.  The fact that almost 20 years separates the two efforts is dismal testament to Gilmour's lack of creativity.<br /><br />Now, I'll be the first to agree that Gilmour is a marvelous guitarist - his phrasings are without peer, and his versatility is incredible, particularly his ability to alternate tremelo & vibrato.<br /><br />But left to his own devices, or without a template to copy, Gilmour creates the most forgettable, empty music that could be imagined.  \\"On an Island\\" is where this CD should be played - some unpopulated island that is.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Is that a good thing or a bad thing? I think it's good. This is not Tool's best album, but it's definitely their most different. After reading all the hype that this was going to be their heaviest album yet, 10000 days does not live up to it. \\"Ticks & Leeches\\" or \\"Hooker with a penis\\" is heavier than the whole album (whatever that means!). But, heaviness aside, there is a great trait that only this album has. They're finally loosening up. They're jamming. You can tell by listening to \\"The Pot\\". They're finally starting to enjoy simple music making, and not think about how many layers of significance they intentionally have to put in each song; but just writing what comes to mind and making it a song. If only for that reason, it's worth buying. But be warned, you won't appreciate that facet of the album if you're not willing to let go as well..
B000003TAR|5.0|In 1991, Nirvana exploded into the rock music scene with Nevermind. Two years later, Nirvana were still the most powerful band in the world with millions of records sold and millions of fans across the globe. During this time, Kurt Cobain, the band's frontman, was growing tired and weary of the media's exploitation of Nirvana. The price of fame was on his shoulders, and only his shoulders, to pay. <br /> <br />In 1993, Nirvana returned with a massive rock album that, to many Nirvana fans, sounded better than its predecessor. The album delivers some of Nirvana's finest tunes: the crunching opener Serve The Servants, the hardcore Scentless Apprentice and Rape Me, the elusive Heart-Shaped Box, the heartbreaking Dumb, the melodic Pennyroyal Tea, and the beautifully written All Apologies. <br /> <br />2 months after the release of In Utero, Nirvana recorded an awesome edition of MTV Unplugged in New York (the session has been released since 1994 and is titled Unplugged In New York). 5 months after Unplugged, the band, Nirvana, was no more.  <br /> <br />In April 1994, Kurt Cobain committed suicide. Cobain's troubled mind and despair can be felt clearly on the tracks of In Utero. Troubled as it may be, the album remains to be one of the best rock albums of the 90's. <br /> <br />Recommended <br /> <br />A-
B000ETQRCM|4.0|It is always very difficult to find an appropriate review of any Pearl Jam album. There is often a disrespect by pop-oriented listeners for anything that can't be cut into a 3:30 radio single or doesn't sound exactly like the preceding album. Often there is also a neglect by listeners to remember that along with music being a commercial entity, music is an art-form; experimental tangent albums like No Code and Vitalogy are misconstrued as \\"self-indulgent\\" when often they are attempts from true musicians to regain creative form instead of becoming cookie-cutter machines for a corporate sales executive (see: creed, everclear, blink 182).    Pearl Jam will always be judged by their high water marks of Ten and Versus.  In many ways these albums were as much luck as talent. The lyrics to these albums ring with solid significance due to their extremely personal nature to Eddie and the rest of the crew. The music resonates with solid talent as Mike McCready explosively asserts himself as a guitarist of note. Then there is the fact that Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament had two previous ventures (Green River and Mother Love Bone) to establish their ability to write a song together. The music is energetic, anthemic, and personally touching. However, the music manifests the ironic history of the band. Much as the original Mookie Blaylock demos were Eddie voiced-over Gossard/Ament songs with McCready solos, the albums and thus band were not cohesive. Vitalogy clearly demonstrates this, as it was the first album without a large portion taken from the original demos. Eddie attempts to exert his abilities as a song-writer (a drive that continues through No Code), Mike almost disappears into the background due to his personal struggles, while Stone and Jeff struggle to figure out the true identity of the band.  After an explosive entrance in Ten and Vs. the band struggled to become a band and to become songwriters. Yield clearly demonstrates their success in both these ventures, whileregaining their ability to be both energetic and anthemic. Yet yield seemed to lack the creativity and musicianship that had been seen earlier. Binaural seemed to struggle to repeat that initial formula while quietly producing some very memorable songs. And so the struggle has continued. From Yield through Riot Act and now Pearl Jam they have clearly demonstrated the band's attempt to adhere to their classic rock roots with such songs as Given to Fly (Led Zepplin), Breakerfall (the Who), You Are (the Animals), and Parachutes (the Beatles).    Pearl Jam is cohesive from beginning to end. It opens with a hint of Yield's brilliance; Life Wasted is reminiscent of Brain of JFK and World Wide Suicide flashes back to textures of U. Comatose flashes back to No Code's Habit and their dedication to the Ramones. Songs like Gone flash into the anthemic constructions like In Hiding. Ultimately the bass-lines and brilliant riffs on Inside Job remind us of the musicianship housed within the band members. Finally Army Reserve flashes us back to the early years of the band and songs like Mystery which, while they never made an LP, are etched in the memory of fans everywhere.      Ultimately Pearl Jam continues what Riot act started: an attempt to combine the band's unparalleled talent into well-written songs in hopes that the energy of their earlier years has not completely dissipated. While by no means the best Pearl Jam album ever, this album reminds us how stale and uninspired modern rock has been for the past few years. Unlike today's mainstay bands that were heavily influenced by the glam-rock, sustenance-less bands of the eighties, Pearl Jam boasts their classic rock (and derivatively blues) origins along with the cutting edge energies of the 80's underground metal and punk scene. Thus the true musicianship and talent shines through in a solid album that will remind us that rock doesn't have to be bland to be mellow or lacking in talent to be energetic and loud.
1400079179|5.0|Obviously, many of the people writing negative reviews are unable to sit down and enjoy a piece of fiction for what it is...FICTION.  Most fiction is written based on facts that are woven into a story, emphasis on \\"story\\" here, that is intended to entertain you and perhaps provide a little escapism in our stressful world.  I thought this book was highly entertaining and being a Catholic myself, took no offense to Mr. Brown's insinuations of the Church or the Vatican knowing that I was reading a piece of FICTION.  Personally, I thought Angels and Demons was better but this one kept me turning the pages all the way until the end.  It has become a successful book because it is well written and full of drama, twists and turns and that is what people appreciate in a good FICTION book.  If you are reading it in order to dissect all the hidden meanings or to throw stones at the author for using poetic license to write a story, then don't bother...you don't need to be reading fiction, but non-fiction.  Then you can complain all you want about what was written and prove your point.  Read to enjoy and escape...not to dissect and disparage.
B00004U45G|4.0|musically this is a wonderful c.d, not hardly a bad song in the bunch and the black crowes are a marvelous band. this c.d. would be 5 stars if not for jimmy pages poor guitar playing, his solos are well thought out and interesting but his fingers won't respond anymore, very sloppy playing with missed notes and woefully out of tune bends. if a young guitarist was listening to jimmy for the first time they would wonder what all the fuss is about.
B000E97Y6K|3.0|okay flick.  the action was pretty cool but with this type of flick its obvious that it's all fake so the awe for me is wondering how the filmakers pulled this stuff off.  the bigger and louder the effects and action sequences got, the more detatched i got from them cuz we all know that it's smoke and mirrors.  that said, the bit where the dinosaurs run down the gully and then trip and fall over each other - and the actors trying not to get squished - that was very cool.  <br />my major complaint:  the characterizations of the players didn't work for me.  why did they play the captain as dark, mysterious and scary?  for that matter, why was he suprised to find the chloroform on the ship? it's his ship! where did Jimmy come from?  why was he supposedly \\"more wild than half the animals down here\\"?  was he from skull island? offspring of some unholy union with one the the natives?  And Jack Black's Denham:  was he the comic relief?  was he the villain?  after all, he's the one who kept trying to make the movie no matter how many crewmembers were eaten, squashed, or mutilated by natives!  By the end of the flick we're meant to root for kong, and Denham is the one who ultimately is responsible for getting kong killed.. and he (denham) lives and in fact has the last line in the flick.  i don't get it.  The only relationship that made any sense to me in this flick is that of Kong and Anne.  <br /> and what was with all the sweeping swooping camera moves?  remember when Driscall types 'Skull Island' onto his typewriter and the camera goes all wonky.. wha?  the more i think about it the more this film reeks.  but whatever.  Thank god there was no 'I love you' seen between Anne and Kong' <br />and the bit on the ice skating rink?  Not Good.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Gritty and raw! PJ's best work in quite some time.  They keep getting better as time goes by.  I am just so happy that they are promoting the heck out of this one.  True fans will not be disappointed!
B000EMGAGW|4.0|This C.D. is a solid purchase for any rap enthusiast. It's the classic Mobb Deep sound, and classic dope Mobb Deep Lyrics and production their fans are used to with G - Unit members on the tracks. The album has plenty of great songs but I felt it was missing the classic song. Similar to \\"Shook Ones\\" or \\"Quiet Storm\\". 50 cent's influence is obvious on the album, and rightfully so he is the executive producer. Which contrary to an increasingly popular belief this is not a bad thing. 50 cent and Mobb Deep have a solid C.D. on their hands, and because of their collaboration more will be exposed to the infamous than ever before. I strongly suggest this C.D. to anyone who considers themselves a fan of rap music.
0151003084|5.0|What can you say about the quintessential Edward Gorey book that hasn't already been said? <br /> <br />I sent this to my friends' one-year-old for Christmas last year as her first ABC book.  In it I wrote that she ought to forget all the rainbows and unicorns and pixies like in all the other childrens' ABC books - that this is what life is REALLY like. My friend, who has a dark sense of humor, loved it as the book has been a favorite of hers from years ago.  Her husband, who had never encountered Gorey before, now wonders about the state of our mental health.  He also said that \\"it explains a lot...\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|Everyone has mentioned the Music. While the music is great it's also subjective. Personally I like it, not breaking any new ground but good non-the less... <br /> <br />I'm going to focus on the CD case. How friggin cool. They have blown the doors off of CD packaging. 3-Friggin-D MAN!!! I love Alex Grey any way and Love what they did with Lateralus, but this is over the top!!! Very Cool, worth the 10 bucks right there.  <br /> <br />You can get an Alex Grey signed copy off of Cosm.org and you will be supporting the Sacred Mirrors exhibit. For those of you that have seen a recent show you will recognize them. I don't think I could shower enough praise on Alex. It's great to see a spiritual band mix the spiritual art of Alex Grey, very insightful. WAY TOOL!!! <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|I wasn't sure whether Tool's new album would EVER come, but it is finally here and I could not be more impressed with the direction of the album.  Each track stands out on its own, but the whole album works like an intricately designed machine.  The brilliant way that these four musicians integrate their sound is probably what impresses me most about their music.  The new album is highly recommended and should be listened all the way through a few times to appreciate the entire effect.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Each and every Tool album is a masterpiece unto itself. Each and every Tool album is an experience unto itself. Each and every Tool album needs to be fully absorbed through a great many meduims to be fully appreciated.     '10,000 Days' starts off with a bang and just never stops progressing from there on out. It's a story, and each second of this album is important to the story. If you're a fan of Tool you know that they put a great deal of time and effort into their art form, and it shows here. They take it seriously as a band and it's put together in a way that pays a great amount of attention to detail. You don't get this from other bands these days, so it might explain why some just don't get it.     Do yourself a favor and pick this album up. Sit down and pop it into your CD player, pour yourself a glass of wine, dim the lights, put on some high quality headphones, press play, close your eyes -- and just listen.     I'm so glad that Tool isn't afraid of stepping out of it's area of comfort. That is what progression is all about -- the willingness to risk failure, but Tool always scores big.     Stop looking at '10,000 Days' as a culmination of past works and start looking at it as it's own entity.    TOOL IS BACK!
0553296981|5.0|In school, I was required to read \\"Anne Frank:  The Diary of a Young Girl\\", which was a great book, but I felt the writing was far beyond Anne's years when she wrote it.  It was refreshing to read the definitive edition and see the text as it was originally written.  Moreover, it gives the reader a much better insight as to who Anne really was.  She was a typical teenager with the issues that many have dealt with at her age at one time or another, and is by no means dated in this area.  In Anne's case, her diary was her sole refuge to pour out all her deepest feelings.  If you want to know who Anne Frank really was, the definitive edition is the version you want to read.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Im not really the kinda guy to become a huge fan of any band in particular, more just albums and songs. And I must say, I love how tool has progressed in their sound. It just sounds like theyre continually growing spiritually and musically and that's simply what makes them a great band. They depict what theyre feeling and what they're thinking so well. Its not about how fast the music is or how good the lyrics are or anything like that. If that's the case Id just stick with Aenima and be done with it. It's the fact that they never stay on the same topic, they continually try to use their ever-expanding knowledge to create new sounds, and they dont tippy-toe their way into new sounds. Compare every Tool album from the last and they're continually going deeper and deeper, learnin to swim. Everyone here is just writing a buncha biased crap cuz of the people that like or dislike tool... thats bull. Buy This Album, Its Worth It
B00007AJF9|5.0|I first noticed \\"Elizabeth\\" during the Academy Awards for 1998.  I believe \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" was a big hit that year and I passed them both off as costume dramas.  I watched \\"Elizabeth\\" last night and discovered that this is NOT your traditional costume drama.  It is, at times, a dark look at the intrigue of royal politics while, at other times, a bright view of a young lady coming of age in a variety of ways.  The intrigue is well-presented.  We don't always know exactly what's going on but, then, why should we be any different from the participants.  There is enough blood and guts to suggest a warning for those in search of a romantic movie.  Yet this is blood and guts with a purpose.  This is England in the midst of one of its' greatest crisies and we are reminded that, with the stakes so high, the ruthlessness rose as well.  Much of the history of the early reign of Elizabeth was new to me and I'm sorry to say that.  We know of how she led England to its' greatest level of power but I certainly wasn't aware that it all got off to such a fascinatingly fragile beginning.  I took a moment to check my old English History textbook (Willson) and found enough brief mentions of characters and events to let me know that this is a biographical movie based in fact.  I won't elaborate but you will probably come to the same conclusion as I did that there were a number of poetic licenses issued in the making of \\"Elizabeth\\".  I was enthralled with the way this lesser known history was presented. <br /> <br />The subject, of course, is in the movie's title and it is the development of this young lady that is its' crowning (sorry) achievement.  Elizabeth discovers that, when you can trust no one else, you have to learn to trust yourself.  This development in her is brought out in a convincing series of personal glimpses and events.  I kept hoping that this was actually a three or four hour movie because I realized time was running out and I wanted to watch this development continue much further.  In the end, the writer and director gave us just what we needed to realize that Elizabeth had reached the level of maturity and self-confidence that would take her into the realm of greatness.  The rest, as they say, is history and one that I was pretty comfortable with.  Regardless of the accuracy of every detail in the movie, \\"Elizabeth\\" gave me a greater appreciation of just who England's greatest queen really was.  To have done so in such an entertaining manner was a most enjoyable icing on the cake.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Simply beautiful. They say a picture paints a thousand words. With Pat Metheny, 10 seconds of music paints a thousand pictures. Too good to describe... I First listened to this CD in my car and I swear the sun felt brighter and the grass seemed greener listening to this CD. For anyone looking to get into modern Jazz, or breakthrough progressive music, its all about Mr. Metheny and his all-star line-up. Also, I must comment on Antonio Sanchez's' awe-inspiring playing. More musical than any modern drummer I know. Buy This CD !!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I just got done listening to the cd for the first time and, I don't know, the best way I can put it is it seems like I just went on a trip to hell and back. This has to be one of the most depressing cd's ever(that I have heard of course) and when it was over I just kind felt...empty or something lol if that isn't cliche. There is deffinatly no signs of hope in this cd what-so-ever. One song goes right into the next and they all stay so down tempo I just couldn't help but get depressed :/.  <br /> <br />With the last song being a segue(sp) I kind of want to try playing the cd in reverse just for the heck of it. With the songs that have personality at the beginning and then quickly going into this very deep sense of depression after jambi it just seems reasonable. You know, finish the cd on a little lighter note rather than feeling like there is no hope, or whatever this cd made me feel like after the first listen. <br /> <br />Yeah it isn't very extensive or anything but I just wanted to post more what I felt after hearing it rather than going into technicalities. <br />
B000EMGAGW|4.0|If you see a bad review, please keep in mind who Mobb Deep is now signed to. Many opinions are hate motivated because of their signing to G-Unit. Anyway, this is a solid G-Unit debut for the Infamous. It provides some of the classic Mobb with a little bit of the G-Unit flavor, which is obvious and expected. <br /> <br />Backstage Pass - 3/5 (The beat sounds like suttin Pharrell would produce, and I'm not a fan of Pharrell's beats. Otherwise, they rap about their encounters with groupies, etc.) <br /> <br />Capital P, Capital H - 5/5 (Classic Mobb.) <br /> <br />Click Click (feat. Tony Yayo) - 4/5 (Decent track with a hard beat. Tony Yayo's verse is average.) <br /> <br />Creep (feat. 50 Cent)- 4/5 (You may have to grow on the somewhat annoying beat but killer verses provided by Prodigy, Havoc, and 50 Cent are the highlights of this track. 50's verse is classic 50.) <br /> <br />Daydreamin' - 5/5 (Classic track about their \\"rags to riches\\" story. Great beat.) <br /> <br />Give It To Me (feat. Young Buck) - 3/5 (The commercial track of the album, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that. They got to sell their album somehow. Personally though, I didn't like it and Young Buck's verse was average. I've seen A LOT better from Buck.) <br /> <br />Have A Party (feat. 50 Cent and Nate Dogg) - 5/5 (Classic song for the clubs and parties. Catchy hook by Nate Dogg as usual and a nice beat.) <br /> <br />In Love With The Moula - 4/5 (This song has a nice concept and they rap about money as if it were their girlfriend. Nice beat.) <br />It's Alright (feat. 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige) - 4/5 (A nice song; song for the ladies.)  <br /> <br />Outta Control Remix (feat. 50 Cent) - 4/5 (Even though it's old, the song is still great for the club or a party.) <br /> <br />Pearly Gates (feat. 50 Cent) - 5/5 (Very strong views and verses provided by all 3 artists.) <br /> <br />Put 'Em In Their Place - 5/5 (Classic Mobb track. Gutter lyrics and hook.) <br /> <br />Smoke It - 4/5 (Solid track with a great hook. The beat is interesting also.) <br /> <br />Speakin' So Freely - 5/5 (Classic track with a laid back beat.) <br /> <br />Stole Something (feat. Lloyd Banks) - 3/5 (O.K. track but a bit too boring for me.) <br /> <br />The Infamous (feat. 50 Cent) - 4/5 (Nice beat.)
B000EULJLU|5.0|If Lateralus was Tool's foray into prog, then 10,000 Days is the closest they've been to post-rock.  Layered harmonics, distortion and (as always) complex rhythms backed by Danny Carey's outstanding drumming combine to make this Tool's most atmospheric work to date - they've ditched the new-age styling of Lateralus while keeping the elaborate song structures and combined it with the heaviness of Aenima and Undertow to create what I think is really a \\"Best Of\\" album of original work. <br /> <br />One the other hand, this isn't an easy cd to enjoy.  Tool have an enormous reputation to live up to and I'll admit that on the first few listens I was disappointed that it wasn't better than Lateralus.  The lyrics are more straight-forward and Maynard's voice has certainly been pushed to the back of the music but expecting it to be better than previous releases is missing the point.  10,000 Days is Tool heading in a different direction, like they always do, and it takes a lot of open-minded listening to come to terms with that.  People say that they hear a lot of A Perfect Circle in this recording.  I'd say to them that the influence goes the other way, and they've heard a lot of Tool in APC which is understandable. <br /> <br />Highlights of the cd for me are the epic 10,000 Days (Wings Part 2), a very personal and intimate tribute to Maynard's mother, as well as Intension and Right In Two, both rueful looks at the state of humanity and human nature itself from an outside perspective.  The final verdict?  Give it a chance to sink in, not as a new Lateralus, not as a new Aenima, but as new Tool.  I can guarantee it'll be worth the effort.
B000025802|3.0|Although decades old, the two analog sets of Dvorak symphonies from Kertesz and Kubelik remain front-runners. From the mid-Sixties onward Decca has been so satisfied with the groundbreaking Kertesz cycle, the first to bring Sym. 1-6 to the general listening public outisde Czechoslovakia, that the company has rarely re-recorded any but the last three, most famous symphonies. DG, on the other hand, didn't release Kubelik's Sym. 1-6 until the digital era (1988, I believe), keeping them in the vaults and out of competiiton with Kertesz.<br /><br />Now both sets are offered at basically the same price on 6 mid-line discs, with deep discounts on the used market. The difference between the two is quite marked musically. Kertesz communicates the thrill of discovery in the early symphhonies. He had never conducted them before, and their vibrancy and inner life lift my spirits every time I hear them.  The LSO didn't know these pieces, either, but play with rousing commitment and vivacity.<br /><br />By comparison, Kubelik sounds rather correct and staid. He often chooses marginally slower tempos, and his enthusiasm for letting the dance rhytyms turn exciting is limited. The Berlin Phil. seems not to catch on to the Slavonic folk idiom, which gets played far too straight (Dvorak had the same problem with Greman orchestras in his lifetime and was only accepted in Vienna and Berlin at first as a kind of naive provincial Brahms). As to sonics, the Decca set holds up well, being a bit bright at times but otherwise detailed and forward. DG, unforunately, gave Kubelik's later symphonies (#7-9) harsh, glaring sound that makes his readings sound brash; there's an unpleasant sting to the sound at higher volumes. This problem seems less in the earlier symphonies (the cycle was recorded over a longer period than Kertesz's and thus has more variable engineering). I don't know if the current reissue also includes remastering.<br /><br />It's regrettable that in the interest of economics Decca has cut out several of Kertesz's most interesting fillers, such as the Hussite Over., though they can be found on other CDs from him. We get the Carnival Over. on both sets, after which Kertesz gives us the \\"My Homeland\\" and \\"In Nature's Realm\\" Over., while Kubelik offers the Scerzo capriccioso and The Wild Dove tone poem, both performed by his Bavarian State Orchestra rather than the Berliners.<br /><br />As msut be obvious by now, I don't feel the two sets are equal artistically. Kubelik was a major conductor and dedicated himself to Dvorak, but his best work isn't consistently here. Kertesz, although not native born to the composer as Kubelik was, found a special affinity for Dvorak, and his cycle is one of the small miracles of Sixties recording. Perhaps not so minor considering that no one has bettered him in the early symphonies for forty years.cca has cut out several of Kertesz's most interesting fillers, such as the Hussite Over., though they can be found on other CDs from him.

I have to say that \\"10,000 Days\\" blew me away like all Tool albums. I listened to every track and when I was done I listened to them again. This album is not as good as Lateralus, but it is my second favorite Tool album. Ignore the negative comments about this album, just go out and buy it you will not be disappointed.

B000005JA8|5.0|I first heard the 2LP version of this album in the late 80s while having it on loan for a week from my local library.  I was sufficiently impressed by what I heard to buy it on CD in 1992.  I used to play a cassette copy of it in my Walkman back then when I worked days and evenings at the bank.  I finally decided to look it up here today at Amazon.com in hopes of finding it available in digitally remastered form.  But no-o-o-o-o-o-o!  Whoever's calling the shot to avoid remastering this album needs to be forced to listen to it as much as I have for the past 14 years in a single, solid week.  Maybe then they'll take a clue and get the hint.  I'm so disappointed with him/her/it I could serenade them with my own rendition of \\"Moonlight In Vermont\\".

The first time you see those depth charges drop and the whole submarine shake, and the crew is sweating, you're there with them. The second time you see it, you're there, but less scared for the crew. The third time, you  don't really care. You downright want to get it over with. Wolfgang transformed a fast-paced masterpiece into a slow-moving test of patience. I'm not sure if this was intentional (to relay the boredom felt by the sailors on the boat) or if he just loved every shot too much, but the film loses everything in timing.
B000F0UV0E|4.0|I find it hard to see how anyone could not be excited to learn that Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris were releasing a CD together.  On one hand you have arguably one of the best guitarists and songwriters of all-time.  On the other is an absolutely beautiful voice that flows seamlessly throughout each tune.  A perfect combination, right?  Judging from this CD, yes. <br /> <br />Let me first say that I'm a huge fan of all of Mark Knopfler's work, from Dire Straits, to movie soundtracks, to his solo albums.  From the very beginning of this CD, you know Knopfler is there.  His distinct guitar playing style shows up on the first track, \\"Beachcombing,\\" which happens to be one of the best on the CD.  \\"I Dug Up A Diamond\\" sounds like it came right from Knopfler's \\"Sailing to Philadelphia\\" album.  \\"This is Us\\" and \\"Red Staggerwing\\" are two of the catchiest tracks.  They also include the usual slower songs and ballads, which are all great.  \\"Love and Happiness\\" and \\"All the Roadrunning\\" are beautiful, and both accentuate Emmylou's voice.  \\"If This is Goodbye\\" is a heartfelt and emotional ending, inspired by the events of 9/11: <br /> <br />\\"my famous last words/could never tell the story/spinning unheard/in the dark of the sky/but I love you/and this is our glory/if this is goodbye\\" <br /> <br />From start to finish, this CD is beautiful.  Knopfler and Emmylou are indeed a perfect duo.  I dug up a diamond when I bought this CD.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I have to admit, there were probably a lot of us tool fans that were expecting an album to wow us like lateralus did. I know i was. Upon listening to this i actually bought into the rumors that were around calling this album a big hoax because of the overall lack of quality, especially considering the amount of time it took for the release. I think they are finally out of ideas. But who can blame them? I mean honestly if you look at all great rock bands in the seventies the quality of the releases goes down over long periods of time. So all in all i believe lateralus was the last great release from tool so we can appreciate that at least. there are at least 5 good songs on here, making it a good EP, so ill give it 3 stars for an attempt.
B000DWMYQ8|4.0|I had reservations going into to see this movie because the running time is so short, but I was pleasantly surprised.  <br /> <br />I think what really connected to everyone was the emotional element in the film where the Chicken Little character struggles with his desire to do grownup/big kid things yet people don't seem to have faith in him.  <br /> <br />It was a great movie!
1400079179|2.0|If you write fiction, you have the license to basically make up anything you want even if it defies logic or reality. But when you put a disclaimer at the beginning of your novel that says every document, piece of artwork, and description of ritual is FACT, you give away your right to defend yourself with a \\"hey, it's just fiction, or, it's artistic license.\\" Especially when others have PROVEN your descriptions of several things are NOT fact.<br /><br />I don't know hardly anything about religious or artistic history, but even I know he gets the description of the Virgin on the Rocks wrong. Brown's character Langdon says Leonardo painted two versions and that the first one was rejected because it had Baby John The Baptist blessing Jesus instead of the other way around, and that Mary had a threatening claw-like hand over John's head while Ariel had her finger pointed like a dagger cutting the neck of the imaginary head Mary was grasping. But Mary's hand wasn't over John's head, it was over JESUS' head, and there is nothing threatening about the poses of either woman.<br /><br />Nobody has time to go into all of the information he gets wrong. That would take a book in itself.<br /><br />But what is DANGEROUS about The Da Vinci Code is once again Brown's claim his information is accurate and historically correct. This presents a situation where most people can't determine where the truth stops and the lies begin. I didn't know whether the PHI thing was real or not thanks to Dan Brown's lie about every description being FACT.<br /><br />He is libeling the reputation of real people and real organizations for the sake of telling a story, but isn't being upfront about it. Once again, he could cite artistic license if not for his self-imposed disclaimer of FACT and ACCURACY at the beginning.<br /><br />In fact, one could argue that since The Da Vinci code is an \\"historical novel,\\" artistic license doesn't apply anyway. In an historical novel, you are obligated to be accurate about the historical information.

B000F6IOC0|2.0|Boring! Dull! Lack of character development! Lack of flow! This is what the first 30 minutes seemed like. I couldn't watch anymore even though I was kinda' tryin' to force myself. Pero, no, I don't think it would have been a good movie.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Got the new album and have already listened to it numerous times. <br /> <br />It shows why TOOL is the most creative, growing and experimental band out there.  The tracks are long and involved.  There are lots of \\"movements\\" throughout, and like Mars Volta's \\"Frances the Mute\\", it plays like one long captivating story.  I truly applaud TOOL's ability to evolve, even if it may turn off some of their \\"radio-friendly\\" fans or old metal-heads.  I think, overall this album is a bit more interesting than Lateralus, and has more of a \\"flow\\" to the overall experience.  Can't wait to see this material live. <br /> <br />The only negative thing I can say about TOOL's direction (and it certainly won't prevent me from continuing to support them) is that I do miss some of the more straight-ahead deep groove kinda songs like Sober, Prison Sex, Crawl Away, Eulogy, H, Jimmy etc.  I love the experimentation and odd time signatures, and wierd effects etc. on the past too albums, but alot of those techniques take away from those truly MONSTER grooves on their earlier stuff.  Also the sound nowadays almost has a sci-fi feel to it, whereas the earlier albums (Undertow especially) had a dark, sinister feel that was just creepy as hell, and I do miss that real simple raw sound. <br /> <br />That said, this is still an amazing album, and I'm glad that TOOL does whatever they want instead of worrying about our opinions too much. <br /> <br />Thanx to Maynard and the gang for another inspiring LP. <br /> <br />\\"I'll keep digging\\"
B000EMGAGW|2.0|I used to like Mobb Deep before they signed to G-Unit now they act different and 50 is on almost the whole CD I mean damn it might as well be his CD.BlackWallStreet GGGGGGGGGG-Unot.
B000002JNJ|2.0|While i am sure that real metalheads dig this album, I found it pretty lame. There is no creativity in the songwritting, the production is not happening, and the music isn't hard enough.
B00005T5YK|5.0|This is the only way to listen to this album..... <br />Where are the rest of their releases?
B000EULJLU|5.0|I remember when Lateralus first came out 5 years ago. Initially I was disappointed since I was expecting it to be as good as Aenima (which at the time was my favorite album) and I just didnt feel like it lived up. Most of my friends felt the same way. After months of listening to it, though, I began to appreciate Lateralus as being just as good as Aenima, but in a different way. Lateralus surrounds the listener like being in the eye of a hurricane; the music is fuzzy and grinding but extremely powerful. <br /> <br />My initial impression of this album is better than my initial impression of Lateralus. It has a piercing feeling to it. The structure of the songs is somewhat similar to Lateralus, but in spirit it almost reminds me of Undertow- albeit way less convential and more sprawled out. Its got a more a bass heavy, precise sound. Maynard sounds angrier, although parts are meditative. Some of the filler stuff seems a bit odd, but I feel like it fits in well with the album.  <br /> <br />There's nothing as immediately striking as Third Eye or Aenima (the song) here, but as a whole it comes together in an amazing way. <br /> <br />My only reservation is some of the lyrics felt less developed than the direction tool has been going on, but Ive only listened a couple of times. I'll save judgements on that until Ive listened more. <br /> <br />Overall, a great record- both familiar and groundbreaking at the same time.
B00069FLC2|5.0|Who would have thought these guys would be so on the <br />money with this excellently recorded dvd....Even if you <br />don't really know these guy's material..The playing and <br />number choice is well worth the listen!
B00005JOQT|5.0|just to balance things out from the earlier flaming. Let me just say that reviewing this item, particularly slamming it, many months before it comes out (heck, before the movie even comes out!) is sheer lunacy. Can we please wait and review once we've seen it? <br /> <br />Amazon, why do you allow people to review these things so far in advance when it's impossible for any of them to have seen it? <br /> <br />In other news, the official trailer came out today and it looks very good! I like the art deco look and it seems like the movie will have a good balance of drama, action, and humor. We'll just have to wait and see for ourselves.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|This album is alright, not nearly as good as infamous, but you can see some parts of that album in this one with at least half of the songs. The production and lyrics are much like infamous and if some tracks were cut, it would have been a classic album. The songs are jazzy, with saxophones. Grimy  beats with equally grimy lyrics remiscent of infamous. The other half of the album consists of generic club songs, a couple of love songs, the gay have a party song, and outta control remeix, none of those really fit with the album but i guess if it helps it sell... Im not sure whether or not this album will debut well or not beccause of the lack of activity for their song and video for put em in their place but since it has the 50 cent and g-unit name plus all the hype surrounding it, im sure it may do as well as tony yayo's did, which wasnt really well because it went gold, which aint up to interscopes or g-units standards.
B000EULJLU|3.0|After listening to the album a couple of times, I am somewhat dissapointed. It's definately not bad, it's just not great either. I really liked the mellow direction they went with Lateralus (which is reproduced here to some degree), but it doesn't have the same feel. It just feels forced to me. I don't think this album deserved the kind of hype it got. <br /> <br />It's worth buying, but I doubt it will be in regular rotation for me personally.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Those that are into spirituality, medetation, buddihsm may have an easier time understanding this album, its complex, as usual, and amazing, as usual. i expect so much from Tool and the exceed that every time with every aspect of this album being deep, right down to the actual case, i am amazed. i love this album from start to finish, even the soundscapes, mostly in part because i do soundscapes with my own music. i love tool.
B00005V9HH|5.0|When this movie first came out most people did not know Kevin Spacey. He had been in several films, but none where he played a key character with such an interesting role. Those of us that saw \\"The Usual Suspects\\" knew he would go on to make other great movies. Why he wasn't awarded best actor for this is beyond me. This was not a huge hit because of the violence, but nonetheless it is an exceptional movie. When a group of criminals is hired for a heist by an unknown leader, the mystery begins. A methodical plan for their crime and the successful results is expected, what happens to them afterwards is far different than any other crime movie and what makes it unique and excellent. Their unknown leader has a history that intertwines with the whole story and unfolds in a way that will soften even those that like the hardest movies. A twistng plot and almost funny secrets that only we the audience are let in on make it very unusual.  Fans of movies like \\"Snatch\\" and \\"Formula 51\\" should enjoy it the most. Any fan of Kevin Spacey should not miss this stellar performance, bloody or not. All the support cast is a powerhouse of talent and could not have been cast better. Kudos for directing, sets, and music as well. This is not a family movie. I recommend it to adults that enjoy hard etched movies like those I mentioned.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The Lateralus album seemed to be themed about birth and spiritual enlightenment, this one seems to speak more of death and an apocalyptic event which they have been warning us about, it's a lot different and it took me a few listens to get used to, but I think it is a masterpiece in its own way.
0316776963|5.0|I normally don't make snap judgements or broad statements.  Normally, I am a \\"live and let live\\" kind of person, able to understand and consider vast differences of opinion.  That being said, in this case, anyone who didn't almost wet themselves laughing at this book is either dumb, or completely lacking a sense of humor.  I've never laughed so hard at anything in my life.  I lent a copy to someone at work, and never got it back.  Usually, when that happens with a book or a CD, I let it go.  Not this time.  I went right out and bought another copy.  This is a Desert Island book, as in \\"pick three things to have with you on a Desert Island, and only three things.\\" <br /> <br />I can't understand anyone who doesn't think this book is genius.  You might as well speak another language.
B000001FS6|3.0|..this is really quite a good album. If I had written this review several years ago, I probably would have given it 2 stars at the most. The passage of time I suppose... <br /> <br />This album has a good deal of soul...perhaps understated at times. I'm not a terrible fan of the covers but prefer the originals. Some favorites include \\"All I Want is You\\", \\"Angel of Harlem\\", and \\"When Love Comes to Town\\". \\"All I Want is You\\" is a wonderful ballad. The latter two have a good blend of rock and R&B sounds.  <br /> <br />However, my favorite on the album is \\"Love Rescue Me\\". The song is a bit slower than I'd like, but its lyrics are unbelievable. The song speaks of despair and of coming to a crossroads. But in the end - as evidenced by the final verse - it's a song of redemption.  Unfortunately, the album version doesn't do this song justice. The live version of this song - as a duet with BB King - is fantastic. What power! Inspiring! Bono sings this song like one possessed by a gospel singer. The live version brings \\"Love Rescue Me\\" to its rightful place: a gospel revival!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I wish i could simply echo what others have said. This album is worth more than hundreds out today. Very unique, yet very simplistic. ART!
0385504209|1.0|Dan Browns research is false. He has no direct evidence but just speculations. Hopefully no one will mistake this with solid historical fact. Such as Davinci did not give the painting of Mona Lisa her name. Rather a biographer of Davinci named her.
B000001DQG|5.0|Next to \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\", this has to be my favorite Elton John album.  His musical creativity is matched only by Taupin's clever lyric writing.  The album's mood ranges from the aggressive rock of \\"The Bitch is Back\\" and \\"You're So Static\\" to more melancholy songs like \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me\\" and \\"Pinky.\\"  The last song on the album \\"Ticking\\" is a very chilling and eerie song, especially in light of the Columbine tragedy.  Other creative highlights on \\"Caribou\\" would include the honky-tonk \\"Dixie Lily\\" and the strutting blues song \\"Stinker\\". Ah, if only his newer stuff were as inspired as this one! If you want a sampler of Elton at his high point, I heartily recommend this album.
B000002BMV|5.0|Released in 1981, \\"Escape\\" went on to multi-platinum status and solidified Journey as one of the top acts of the 1980s arena rock era.  Led by Steve Perry's multi-octave vocals, Neil Schon's searing guitar, Jonathan Cain's melodic keyboards, and Steve Smith's booming drums, Journey mesmerized millions of fans with their combination of vocals and insturmentals. <br /> <br />This CD is packed with great songs, and three, \\"Open Arms\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin\\", and \\"Who's Crying Now\\", landed in the Billboard top ten.  My favorite song on the CD is the title track, \\"Escape\\".  This song really shows off Neil Schon's guitar and Steve Perry is once again in top form on lead vocals. <br /> <br />This CD has stood the test of time and has remained popular for well over twenty years.  I give this CD my highest recommendation.  Having been in high school when this album was first released, it brings back a lot of memories for me.  Listen to \\"Escape\\" and hear Journey's best work.
B000C65Z1G|4.0|In the tradition of \\"Z,\\" \\"All the President's Men\\" and \\"The Quiet American,\\" \\"The Constant Gardener\\" is a political message movie that comes packaged as a taut, gripping whodunit.  The \\"message\\" in this case is about how pharmaceutical companies often put profits ahead of patient safety and human life, especially in the Third World where many of the drugs are tested - on the assumption that the people there are somehow more \\"dispensable\\" than people in the West.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes plays Justin Quayle, a British diplomat sent to Kenya along with his new wife, Tessa, a human rights activist played by Oscar-winner Rachel Weisz.  When Tessa suddenly turns up dead, Justin begins to wonder if perhaps his wife had found out a little bit more than she was supposed to know regarding a huge drug company's dealings in that part of the world.<br /><br />Even though I have no clue as to whether or not this story is even remotely plausible (though I suspect it most likely is), \\"The Constant Gardener,\\" nevertheless, works very well as both a nail biting political thriller and a  complex human drama.  Running along both tracks simultaneously, the film opens our eyes to the possibility that the people and institutions we trust with our lives and our futures may not, in actuality, have our best interests at heart.  As Justin follows the clues to his wife's murder, a depressing picture of ignoble motives and corporate malfeasance slowly emerges.<br /><br />But it is as a human drama that \\"The Constant Gardener\\" truly excels.  Justin is a man who, even though he has thrust himself onto the world's stage as a potentially major player, is actually little more than a bureaucratic cipher, content to go through life doing other people's bidding, causing no ripples and spending his time nurturing and cultivating the plants in his garden.  Tessa, on the other hand, is a fervid activist, quick to speak her mind on issues of social injustice and unafraid of taking on the powers-that-be, even if that means upsetting the applecart and endangering her own life.  Based on the John Le Carre novel, the Jeffrey Caine screenplay turns Tessa into an enigmatic figure who fascinates us with both her beauty and her air of mystery.  Even Justin doesn't always know what to make of her, but we can certainly understand why he and most of the other men in the movie are hopelessly drawn to her.  Weisz, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this performance, does a beautiful job capturing the many moods of the character, and Fiennes gives his usual outstanding performance as the naturally passive man ultimately jolted by circumstances into taking a proactive stand against injustice.<br /><br />As with any adaptation of a Le Carre work, \\"The Constant Gardener\\" may be a trifle too slick for its own good at times, but excellent writing and acting help to bring the message forcefully home.tting the applecart and endangering her own life.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Being a fan of new and old rock and roll, i constantly have to listen to my high school friends complain about how todays rock and roll sucks. Since i'm listening to new music, i stumbled on to Wolfmother way before them and passed the word on. Needless to say they were hooked, and often quoted how \\"rock and roll was back\\" even though it really never left. This is clearly a work that rock and roll fans of all kinds can celebrate. Great songs, one after another. Mind's Eye, Woman are solid downloads if you're looking to explore while with White Unicorn, Where the Eagle Have Been, Joker and the Theif they are all single worthy material. The album starts and doesnt stop. The lead singer says in White Unicorn \\"we can live in another time, we could live together\\" and with this record rock and roll fans can, and they can feel happy as hell about it.  <br />
B00005JOE8|1.0|I have loved V for Vendetta for over 20 years. I first read the story - at least the first 2/3 of it - in 1985 when I bought all 26 issues of Warrior, a black-and-white British anthology magazine. V for Vendetta was originally serialized in Warrior from 1982-'85. V for Vendetta is divided internally into three \\"Books\\" or acts. Warrior was cancelled right at the end of the second Book. Three years later, DC Comics reunited the series creators, writer Alan Moore and artist David Lloyd, to finish the story which was published in 10 issues of a monthly comic in 1988-'89, then collected in 1990.    V for Vendetta the comic is perhaps the best-written, most emotionally affecting, heart-breaking and involving piece of fiction I've ever read. As many of you already know, Alan Moore tried to block this movie from being made, and had his name removed from its credits. Part of this was because, I'm sure, after reading the script he realized what a turkey it was going to be. Also I suspect Moore was still immensely P.O.ed that the Wachowski brothers' final battle between Neo and Agent Smith in the Matrix movies was such a blatant rip of the fight between Marvelman and Johnny Bates from Moore's Marvelman. I mean, my God, they didn't even bother to file off the serial numbers. Moore actually ended his relationship with DC Comics when they refused to retract statements (i.e. lies) saying he supported the movie.    Within the first few minutes of watching this film, I knew something had gone horribly wrong. Let me make this clear: I'm a comic book fan. Unlike some fans, I don't think you can automatically fault a comics based movie for making changes from the source material. I realize that transferring an idea between media will necessitate changes. Sometimes those changes will even be improvements. (A good example would be the first Spider-Man film. Yes, they made changes to the origin. But in every instance the changes smoothed away logical inconsistencies in the 1962 story.) I**do** think you can fault changes from the source material when what was already there is infinitely better than what it was changed to. Every time there's a change in V for Vendetta the movie, it's for the worse. For instance:    Comic: The Voice of Fate is an eerie, disembodied radio personality.    Movie: The Voice of Fate is a fat, raving televangelist.    Comic: Evey Hammond starts out a weak victim. When accosted by the fingermen, all she can do is whimper and beg for mercy. Evey is a metaphor for the person so beaten down by life, and existence within a totalitarian state, she has no guts, almost no individuality to speak of. At heart V for Vendetta is the story of how V, none too gently, forces Evey to face up to the evil in the world, to care, to find herself, and the strength to fight back. Evey is an experiment for V. Because he believes that inside even a born victim exists a potential hero. You just have to brutalize them enough first. This only works if Evey is weak initially.    Movie: Evey is feisty to start with. Which leads to the ludicrous image of Evey, when surrounded by fingermen, threatening them with a canister of pepper spray. What depth! What wit! What garbage. She's supposed to look terrified and helpless - not silly.    Comic: While rescuing Evey from the fingermen, V quotes a long passage from Shakespeare's Macbeth which begins, \\"The multiplying villainies of nature do swarm upon him.\\" It's witty and literate. (Moore reports his use of this dialogue as one of those bizarre synchronicities that sometimes occurs during writing. A copy of The Collected Works opened at random to a page containing this passage which matched, line for line, the actions he'd already decided on for V in his first clash with the forces of law and order.)    Movie: V's speech is alliterative gobbledygook in which he shoehorns in as many words beginning with \\"v\\" as possible. \\"Vichyssoise of villainy,\\" indeed.    Comic: V taunts and bedevils the fingermen, and sweeps Evey away, in the process killing one of the fingermen with a bomb, leaving appalled survivors staring at the gutted, charred remains of what, but a few seconds before, had been a human being. Admittedly the way he does this (the fingerman grabs V's hand to arrest him, and the fake hand detaches before exploding) is hokey but the nucleus idea of a great scene is there. I would have liked, in the movie, this conflict to be much more brutal - just a bit of tweaking and it could have been great - but that's not what we get, either.    Movie: V's fight with the fingermen is a Keystone Kops routine, complete with him pulling one man's pants down around his ankles. It's so bad it's painful to watch.    Comic: Evey's first reaction to V is awe. The expression artist David Lloyd puts on her face is rapt, almost mesmerized. One of the creepier things about V for Vendetta is just how easily and instantly V pulls Evey into his world. This goes back to the idea that, to start with, it's almost as though Evey really has no will of her own. It's like she's been waiting to exist, for something, ANYTHING interesting to happen in her life, to wake her up. V might be homicidal and possibly insane - but he's definitely interesting.    Movie: Natalie Portman, showing all the emotional range and acting skill of a wooden mannikin, stares at V with an arch \\"Who is this freak?\\" look on her face. (Or maybe she's just appalled at the dialogue?) Where is the talented actress who showed such immense early promise in The Professional? I ask, because I haven't seen her since. More importantly, where is the awe on Evey's face showing how completely V fascinates her? Natalie's expression in this scene commits the cardinal sin in a comic-to-movie translation: it condescends to the material (like the dropping trousers of a few seconds before), gives the impression \\"Yes, we know this is all really rather silly\\" during a moment that should be played perfectly straight.     You see what I mean? Every change trades emotional depth for shallowness, brutality for slapstick, the weird exchanged for the ludicrous. These are only examples from the movie's first few minutes. I truly got the sense, watching this film, its makers had no real insight beyond a surface level of what was actually happening in the comic, were absolutely clueless regarding the internal dynamics, the deeper issues, that made it great. Rarely has such a bad movie been made from such excellent source material.
B000002G87|5.0|I've listened to most of the stuff Eric Clapton's done over the years, including Cream, Blind Faith and his solo works... and never really liked any of it,thought it was kinda dull and dry  (except for a couple of tracks on the Blind Faith LP). So naturally I ruled Eric Clapton out and never gave this album a chance. But then, just a couple of weeks ago, I stumbled upon an  old vinyl copy of this Derek And The Dominos album. 0:50 into the second song \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" I knew I was hooked for life! This is the ultimate blues rock masterpiece and I can't believe I totally missed it for so long! If you like \\"Layla\\", well, there are at least 7 other songs on this album that are even better! And I agree with the reviewer below, it's really a shame this album's not getting more attention today. So my advice to all fans of early 70's rock/blues (or just good music in general) who haven't yet heard this gem; BUY IT... NOW! (And pick up Little Feats 1972 'Sailin' Shoes' album at the same time.. another overlooked masterpiece)
B000002JSP|5.0|There are those that say that this is Led Zeppelin's most uninspired album.  I vehemently disagree.  True, it doesn't have the rock and roll R&B feel like their first two albums, but it is one of my personal favorites nonetheless. The main difference between \\"In Through the Outdoor\\" and their other works is that John Paul Jones takes the creative lead instead of Jimmy Page.  The result is a more melancholy, keyboard driven, sound.  \\"In the Evening\\" is one of the more jammin' songs, while \\"All My Love\\" is a bittersweet ballad about Robert Plant's departed son.  They even take an ambitious stab at synth pop with the song \\"Carouselambra\\".  \\"Hot Dog\\", which has a hillbilly sound to it, is the only song I don't really care for.  Overall, I can't think of a better way to end a colossal musical career than to depart from the norms that Led Zeppelin themselves established in the world of hard rock music.
B000EULJLU|2.0|If this album was nothing but static noise I'm sure a lot of the Tool fans giving positive reviews for `10,000 days' would still give it five stars. Just because it's a Tool album and all your cool friends like Tool, doesn't mean this is any good. There are only four real songs on `10,000 day' and the rest is just unenergetic snaky guitar rifts and stupid filler. Where is all the solid fast passionate guitar work of the past? These guys have one of the greatest drummers in the world and it hardly seems he's doing any thing. I don't really understand why the band bothered to put half the songs on this CD let alone name them; they really should have named song 11 'static noise filler' because that's all it is. Maybe the band thought the cool album cover with the glasses and trippy pictures would cause fans to over look the rest of this steaming bowl of elephant piss.
0307120007|5.0|I got this as a gift and didn't really understand its charm at first.  Both of my kids love it, however, and pore over it over and over again.  I don't know if it is the flap they love best, or  the little bunny book, or it may be the scratchy whiskers, or the plain \\"bye\\" \\"bye\\".  Whatever the reason, it appears to be a winner.
B000EULJLU|5.0|obviously tool went in a direction nobody expected, but that in itself was very expected, i think this album is great, it has the tool essense but a new tool sound, i dont see how everybody doesnt like this album, it is mellow and heavy at the sametime and the art work alone is mind blowing, i suggest this album to people who arent even tool fans, its great, if u think its not good or anything i suggest u atleast respect its song writting and individuality, cuz u think ur mind is that complex? i really doubt it, so atleast show respect.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|Almost 2 years since their last group album, the M-O-BB is back.  I know a lot of people are hatin' cause they on G-Unit but this album is still tight, and although I'd rather them noty have signed to G-Unit I like it cause they might finally get the multi-platinum sales their albums deserve.  Of their 8 group albums, it is on the lower half in quality, but still worthy of 4 stars and close to 4.5, and if this is one of their worst and it's almost 4.5 yo know it's still gotta be good!!  With 16 songs, 14 new ones, it's nice to hear from some of the real street gutter rappers again.  Of the 16, 3 are almost classic material, 1 I skip, 4 are ok, and the other 8 are good.  Guests ar eon about half the songs, and I'm a little angry that it's all G-Unit rappers on here.  I wish they'd have put on their usual homies, Big Noyd, Littles (even though he and P ain't cool), Infamous Mobb, Cormega, Tragedy Khadafi or someone from QB, and 50 is on 6 of the 16 songs!!  Production is decent, I'd have liked to see more done by Havoc (he did 5 and co-produced 2 with Sha Money XL) & ALChemist (1 song) and Dr. Dre, Fredwreck, Chad Beat, Profile, Product, Exile, K-Lassik beats, and Jonathen rotem all did 1 song.  A nice album for fans of the Mobb but not near their best albums of the mid to late 90's.    #1 - 8.5  #2 - 8  #3 - 7.5 (f/ lloyd banks)  #4 - 5 (f/ 50 cent -- horrible beat)  #5 - 8.5 (nice beat)  #6 - 7  #7 - 8 (f/ young buck)  #8 - 8 (f/ tony ya yo)  #9 - 7 (f/ 50 cent -- a lot of Prodigy's verse is edited)  #10 - 8  #11 - 9.5 (deeper song about their dreams as kids)  #12 - 9.5 (f/ 50 Cent -- great beat)  #13 - 8 (clever song talkin bout money)  #14 - 7 (f/ Mary J Blige & 50 Cent)  #15 - 9 (f/ 50 Cent & Nate Dogg -- also on the \\"Get rich or die tryin soundtrack\\")  #16 - 9.5 (f/ 50 Cent -- tight beat)    HAVOC -- Kejuan Muchita -- b. around 1975 --- Queensbridge, NY  PRODIGY -- Albert Johnson -- b. 11/2/74 -- b.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Having been a fan of Batman since seeing my first Batman cartoon as a child I was thrilled when they decided to make Batman with Michael Keaton; it was everything I had hoped it would be.  Then the series began departing from what had made that first movie so great and became downright silly. Batman Begins brings the series back to its roots.  Batman never was intended to be a light, simple character, he's called the Dark Knight for a reason.  Christian Bale does a wonderful job of taking the audience through Wayne's transformation from an angry child into the avenger of Gotham.   <br /> <br />This movie revisits the loss of Bruce's parents in a much more intimate and profound way.  You know what they meant to him personally and the lessons his father was teaching him about life, both by example and by instruction.  Fate and the intervention of a friend redirect his life away from simple hate/revenge into a need to understand the murder of his parents, resulting in his walking away from his privileged lifestyle to enter the world of criminals.  While learning more about his own nature and the nature of criminals he still struggles with his anger and uses his new lifestyle as a means of acting out that aggression, but without any real purpose.  He comes no closer to understanding the criminal mind and is unable to find any solace from his pain.  He finally ends up in prison, reveling in the constant conflict. <br /> <br />The introduction of Ducard into this dismal world provides Bruce with a source of focus and a redirection for that anger.  Through his training with Ducard he learns to control his own emotions and become more than a scared child wanting to avenge his parents. He becomes a man, a man with a purpose and the ability to fulfill that purpose.  He is still fallible, he still struggles with his loss and his new role, but he is learning from each new struggle and failure.  He learns to rely on those who have proven their loyalty and trust in himself.  Eventhe realization that he not only trusted, but actually saved the life of the man intent on destroying Gotham does not shake his new strength and resolve.   <br /> <br />Christian Bale's portrayal brings Batman's dark, conflicted nature back to the screen, but this time the audience has a greater understanding of those conflicts. He shows us what drives Batman to devote his life to protecting the citizens of Gotham from evil while sacrificing the ability to have a real life of his own. <br />
B000002H97|5.0|Like many Metallica fans, I long for more albums like 'Master Of Puppets' and '...And Justice For All'. As much as I tend to disagree with those who claim that the 'Black Album' is total and utter commercial rubbish and is not even worth a listen, I do think that Metallica lost some of their magic when they made this record. No more amazingly complex guitar solos and mind-boggingly pacey drumbeats, instead...much slower and more structured songs which are also considerably shorter. However, I have still decided to give this album five stars purely because despite everything I have just mentioned, it still contains some truly amazing stuff. <br /> <br />The album begins with 'Enter Sandman', Metallica's most recognisable song to date, which contains one of the most recognisable guitar riffs to date. Interestingly, Kirk Hammett wrote the riff at 3 in the morning in a hotel room, drunk out of his skull. This song is also Metallica's 2nd single release with an accompanying music video. Next up, 'Sad But True'; Yet another classic riff, with great lyrics. 'The Unforgiven' is a strong ballad which features great acoustic guitar play from Hetfield and an extraordinarily epic solo from Kirk Hammett. 'Wherever I May Roam' is reminiscent of the bands' previous release '...And Justice For All', with a powerfully progressive guitar riff following on from an atmospheric introduction played on a Sitar. Every classic metal band manages to write one emotional masterpiece. Led Zeppelin's was 'Stairway To Heaven', Megadeth's was 'A Tout Le Monde'...Metallica's is 'Nothing Else Matters'. This heartfelt ballad contains delicately finger picked guitar melodies, superb lead vocals aswell as an amazing guitar solo from Hetfield. <br /> <br />If you're considering getting into Metallica but don't really know too much about metal music in general, this is a great place to start. It can really get you hooked on this band, but at some point you will have to be prepared to embrace some of their earlier masterpieces. I hope this review has been helpful.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|This was a wonderful movie, coming from a teenager's standpoint. I never really and don't usually listen to Johnny Cash, but Joaquin's performance was so heartfelt and tortured, it was amazing. I can definitely see why he was up for an oscar. Reese... Reese was so funny and adorable. \\"Johnny Cash's GUI-tar strap!\\" lol that was perfect. And I loved seeing Elvis and Jerry Lee too, everyone was great! This was a really good way to see Cash's journey...<br /><br />\\"Hello -- I'm Johnny Cash.\\" He got over stage fright quickly. :) Enjoy it!
B0002V7O3S|5.0|\\"Fire in the Sky\\" opens with a quotation from the Greek dramatist Aeschylus: \\"Thus does chance make a plaything of a man's life\\"-pretty highbrow stuff for a sci fi flick about an alien abduction. In fact, the opening quotation of this excellent and underrated screenplay by Tracy Torme is aptly chosen and deftly introduces the deeper, metaphysical  underlying themes of the movie.  <br /> <br />Far more than an exploitation film about UFOs, the film not only raises fundamental questions not about whether mankind is alone in the universe, it also portrays an almost Shakespeareanesque tragedy. The film reveals deep conflicts between the five witnesses and their community over the community's absolute denial of the witnesses' version of events, against all evidence.. The community simply cannot reconcile this version of events with their understanding of the physical world. Intertwined with the disbelief of this impossible-but-true presentation of the case is a very human story between Mike Rogers and Travis Walton--best of friends whose friendships are strained by controversy and resentment.  <br /> <br />The Travis Walton abduction case remains to this day a classic UFO case, among the best documented on record. The genius of this film is that it begins with the premise that the case is absolutely real and portrays the incident in a stark, chilling, documentary-like sequence. Only then can the really interesting questions surface, What does it all mean, do we have the courage to ask and to face the truth, whatever the truth may be? <br />

B000BW7QWW|5.0|This AMAZING movie was made from a cancelled TV Series!  <br />What you say? Someone actually made a movie from a series that didn't even make it on television? YES Universal did.... And with any hope there will be many more to come.  <br /> <br />This movie can be enjoyed as a follow up to the series \\"Firefly\\" or on its own. It is an amazing adventure you can watch over and over again. The story hits hard and fast, soon after introducing the wonderfully deep characters. The story will leave you enthralled, inspired, and in shock. Though the actors names are not yet well known on the big screen, they are the next up and coming big stars in my opinion. Do not base your decision to purchase this movie on the fact that Tom Cruise didn't play the main character... <br /> <br />I highly recommend both Serenity and Firefly to everyone! <br />Buy it now.... and while you are at it... get Firefly too! <br />You won't be sorry!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Just wanted to address all of the armchair critics who say that Sigur Ros sound like no other band in this galaxy. <br /> <br />Admittedly only having heard Takk..., I can still say that's false.  Bands like Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance were making exactly this kind of music over 20 years ago. <br /> <br />Having said that, I *LOVE* this kind of music and am happy to include Sigur Ros amongst that company.  Takk ... is a beautiful, captivating, delicate mood-setter of an album, and it's made a new fan out of me, an old fan of ambient alternarock like Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance.  I hope it does the same with others, and vice versa - Sigur Ros fans should check out those old bands as well.  Let's share the love!
B0000029LG|3.0|HIStory is Michael Jackson's attempt to \\"stick it to the man\\".   \\"Scream\\", the first track on disc 2, provides all the revenge Michael Jackson needs. This song carries a infectious beat from HELL. Michael, by right, could have sung this song alone. But as a duet, with sexy sister Janet, -made a even bigger statement; which gave this song its magic. -Also, we must not forget, that  this song was able to provide us with the most expensive, gorgeous and futuristic video of its time.  However, Michael's negative opinion of the press is made to much on this record. Listen to \\"tabloid junkie\\" and \\"they don't care about us\\".   -On \\"Come together\\", -I believe Michael barely makes it through this song alive!!-In my humble opinion, he should have not remade that song.   -It is featured and done poorly at the end of \\"Moon Walker\\" the movie too. As I type this review, -John Lennon is rolling over in his grave, right now!!-PISSED OFF!!!  -\\"You are not alone\\" is a sweet and tender ballad. But doesn't hold a candle to \\"I can't help it\\" or \\"lady in my life\\". Which both should have been on disc 1, The \\"greatest hits\\".   Disc 1 does nothing for Michael's true fans. It is the same walk down memory lane, where we try to remember the good in a performer gone astray.  -Overall, this double CD set is slightly above average. There is a different Michael here. Are you ready?? His sound has changed. His music has changed. His attitude has changed.   -I say, forget the press, maybe we all have something to do with this dramatic difference in Michael Jackson music.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Well, Pearl Jam is back and the guys are at their best. If there is something that I missed on previous 4 albums it's pure raw energy, high speed and rhythm so typical for Pearl Jam's first albums. In my mind it's useless to point out their best album(s). Each one is diffirent from the others and there is no such PJ album I could mark as a weak one. However, this new effort seems to be one of the \\"Big\\" PJ albums, and maybe even a commercial success (I wouldn't be surprised if they did a new video). This band is like whiskey: the older - the better. Don't hesitate to get this album. It's musical perfection, vitality... and evolution.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Sorry, I don't get all the bad reviews here about this film. \\"Camp-fest?\\" No, not really. Not at all. Maybe that's someone's wishful thinking?  \\"Juvenile lesson in pseudo-Catholic salvation?\\" Huh? Methinks perhaps the movie hit too close to someone's bone? It's an action thriller, and a very good one. Even the bad reviews about Keanu Reaves don't make much sense to me. Yeah, it's Neo again, and thank God, he's not doing any Kung Fu this time. Those Matrix movies deteriorated from the first one into the most dismal action films of all time. I rate the third one as perhaps the worst movie of all time, so it was fine with me if the original Neo cool is resurrected out of that ashheap in a fresh new universe devoid of all that spinning-off-the-walls kick boxing. So what if it's deadpan Keanu? It works. This character is a man who understands that life and the emotions are ephemera and are to be experienced mostly for their desperate opportunity, and that redemption in the end is a very iffy proposition, so yeah, he's not flexing the emotional muscle a lot-it's not on his mind. When the movie was almost over, it suddenly occurred to me that no kiss had taken place. Wow, what a fantastic accomplishment that was and how great that Keanu didn't insist on one being written into the script! That alone says something to me about Keanu as an actor. Do you think any of the other major male star's agents would have let a pucker on Rachel's thick blooms slip away? No gratuitous romance! Thank you! I get enough of that everywhere else.    On second thought, maybe I do understand the negative reactions and confusions of other viewers. You have to have some knowledge of the mythology that the Bible was initially built upon to understand the events in this movie--although of course, that mythology has been transposed in this movie--sometimes ridiculously as per the genre--into a comic book situation with a comic book main character. In this day when, for good or for bad, most young Americans probably know more about the traditions and details of Star Trek than the details of the so-called great books of their culture, it should probably be no surprise that the clues to meaning in this film are completely unfathomed by perhaps the majority of its viewers. Many of the Judeo-Christian references are probably no more comprehensible to many, if not most viewers, than if the details were based upon the Indian Mahabharata.    I found the film intriguing--a really fascinating play with the Judeo-Christian mythology. I've not read the comics, nor even seen them. Why would I need to? This is a tight script. The universe of fallen angels and a uniquely redeemed mankind in a rigorously ruled chess match where some are trying to cheat. This is pure Book of Genesis undertext with Miltonian coloring. This is the universe that bred mainstream American Christian culture. Like I say, you need to be Biblically literate to understand it. The Book of Job would be a good place to start, and Genesis, of course. You might even start with Milton's \\"Paradise Lost.\\" It's all part of the Genesis \\"myth\\" as it has evolved to today. And then, there are a few details which come out of the \\"popular\\" mythology rather that the great book itself.    Being familiar with the mythology, I found nothing confusing about this plot, and no wasted imagery.  The special effects are spectacular. The direction is fine, and some of the acting absolutely superb. Tilda Swinton was a crisp delight as Gabriel (oh those wings!) and Rachel Weisz, yes, she was great as everyone says, but Peter Stormare's Satan was pure genius. People who think this film poorly directed should really study that Satan scene. That was a difficult character and very difficult scene to pull off successfully without flopping back on the stupid old overblown stereotype and required extreme precision by both actor and director to keep it original and as intense as it needed to be. Had a great, unexpected laugh in that scenetoo. Maybe Keanu's not the best of actors. I don't know, and wouldn't care.  Maybe he's the Gary Cooper of our day. Keanu carried me through this film from beginning to end and I enjoyed the whole trip, so he did a great job as far as I'm concerned. I was captivated by this fresh fleshing out of the Genesis-Revelations myth, much the same as, say, I enjoy the fleshing out of the vampire myths by Anne Rice. It gave it a tactile, up to date reality. A mix of \\"The Matrix,\\" \\"What Dreams May Come,\\" \\"The Sixth Sense,\\" and \\"The Omen.\\" Terrific. Recommended for viewing pleasure.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll keep this short. This album expands the consciousness of Tool like none other. Whatever you have to pay to obtain this album it is worth it 100 fold. This album is a beacon of light in a desolate land of radio-rock garbage.
B000089RVX|5.0|i am so happy to have this cd it is amazingly perfect for someone who likes \\"deep rock\\" i guess you would say. amy lee can actually sing and she doesnt just scream of be totally unoriganal. shes got something different that i would suggest listening to and she has a real voice. she aint no poser and she sings like she means it. amazing.
0805076476|4.0|I will preface this review by admitting that I have not seen the movie, and I am not sure if I will.<br /><br />I almost never progressed past chapter three.  The chapters seemed disorganized, the thoughts scattered, and the plot undecipherable.  Somewhere around chapter 4, I began to figure it out, and from there I could appreciate what this novel is supposed to be.<br /><br />Palahniuk articulately conveys the desperation of a modern American male, longing to define himself in a world designed to despise him.  His central character, whose complete name is never revealed to the reader, shines a blinding light on the life of \\"quiet desperation\\" that hides behind the eyes of so many people that pass us each day.  The formation of Fight Club, as a vehicle to explore a more primitive masculinity, is completely plausible - as is the wildfire manner with which the club catches on.<br /><br />What is compelling about this story is that it works on two levels.  On one is the *gotcha* way with which the novel's big secret is revealed - I won't give away what the secret it, but I had that part figured out pretty early on.  While it is the *secret* that (I suspect) attracts and engages a younger reader, the more compelling part of this novel is the subtext:  the pain of the character.  The raw, unrefined emotion of a man who cannot figure out how to be a man in the world with which he is presented.  It is painful.  It is poignant.  It is revelatory.<br /><br />Teh four star rating represents the subject matter.  The writing itself is rather awkward in many stages, which is the reason that I can't award a 5th star.  That said, this is a book that will haunt me, as I'm sure it haunts others.
B000A2RRF4|3.0|Live in Bucharest showed Michael Jackson's incredible talent to perform-but not to perform. Anybody that really knows the \\"70's and 80's Michael Jackson\\" can relate to what I am saying. I'm talking before \\"Thriller\\". <br />-Back in the day, -This guy could make dance moves so fast that you'd wish you had a slow motion button in your brain.-His voice sounded amazing, soulful, and REAL. Listen to \\"I can't help it\\" on the \\"Off The Wall\\" LP. -and then, -you will hear the real MICHAEL JACKSON!! -This song is remarkable, underated and unknown to most of Michael Jackson true fans. This song is a hidden gem. With out \\"Off the Wall\\" there could have been no \\"Thriller\\". But between these two land mark recordings, something happened.  <br />-WHAT??-I'll tell you, It was MONEY and FAME!! <br />The Victory, Bad, Dangerous, and History tours, all pale in comparison to the Mexico, Destiny and Triumph tours. Give me the young Michael Jackson anyday of the week; The old Michael Jackson (Bucharest) seems to have too much trouble singing live withoout help (Human Nature, Billie Jean). Sure, his dance steps are inventive, but they lack raw power on stage, mainly because of his goofy looking background dancers!! <br />-Michael Jackson's shining moment comes at the end of the concert, while singing \\"Man in the mirror\\", where he stands alone and allows you to get a little peek of the performer he once was.

B000FFJYCU|4.0|This Grand Prix DVD and a Widescreen TV are a match made in heaven.  There are certain movies that get better with size, and this film nearly leads the pack. <br /> <br />Just a technical note. Grand Prix was actually filmed in something called `Super Panavision 70mm'. It's a 2.20:1 aspect ration, but when first released, as noted by others, the film was shown on the old Cinerama curved screens. There are perhaps only two widescreen formats that provide a more extravagant presentation, Ultra Panavision (only a handful of films) and Cinerama itself. <br /> <br />About a dozen movies have been filmed in Super Panavision 70 (among them Lawrence of Arabia and My Fair Lady). They were spectacular in a theater setting, but, except for the above films, and perhaps Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang, none have been satisfactorily transferred to DVD, including 2001: A Space Odyssey and the recent Ice Station Zebra. Grand Prix appears to have been completely resored by MGM and includes a load of extras.  This is a great example of the blockbuster-style movies that are becoming very rare, and a must have for movie fans.   <br /> <br />As for the story itself, Grand Prix is miles ahead of other racing movies, but that's not saying much. Winning, Lemans, Red Line 7000 were tedious, and Days of Thunder and Driven should qualify for ticket refunds. Grand Prix is worth watching in this special edition, even if the storyline is merely good.
B0002OERI0|3.0|ok, this albaum wasn't Green day's best. This was sad compared to the other work they have done.  This album though will be loooked at by the posers as a cult icon. Screw that! I you want to hear good Green Day, check them out before they became sellouts. This album has about 6 good songs on it. take it from me, I'm a true fan, this doesn't come close to their old work. It'll make a fine additoin to your collection, but after a while you'll get bored of it, and it'll grow dust.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I just loved Christine's vocals and Gerard Butler's deepness.I thought the plot was good,and although I didn't even finish watching this movie,it was touching.I would recommend buying this movie.A story about love,and  an ethical dilemma.I love the character casting,the music,and the pictures.5 stars.
0062502182|5.0|This is an amazing book. It is a story of a young man who has a dream of hidden treasure. It is a book that alludes to that fact that all of us have a purpose and a dream. Yet many settle and give up their dream, and lose their passion for life. In this book it is stated again and again that each of us has our own Personal Legend, a quest; \\"When you pursue your personal legend the universe will conspire with you to make it happen.\\" You will follow Santiago on his adventure and during the process be challenged to think about your goals and dreams and what you would have to do to pursue them.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|The anger in Eddie Vedders voice on this album speaks for itself. You can hear the passion of they're message in every track of this album. Ive been a long time fan since i was 10, and Pearl Jam has yet to dissapoint me. What a classic, this world needs this album now. Great timing.
B000002HMH|5.0|It is true that load could be said to mark the end of metallica as they were known before. The thrashing riffs and tearing solos have disappeared and the band is finally shedding the \\"metal head\\" image to produce a muchy more mature, dark and personal album than ever before. Load shows the real nature of metallica, dark and yet innocent, mysterious and terrified of their own instabilities.
B000AMJG4Y|3.0|english menus would have been a welcome feature of this DVD. <br /> <br />Other than that the CGI is beautiful, the story is excellent but IF you're not familiar with the FF7 story you're going to feel left in the dark. <br /> <br />Action scenes were nice but extremely fast paced (maybe a little too fast paced) & I know it's fantasy but I just don't dig the whole \\"magically suspended in the air as long as I'm swinging a sword\\" aspect.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|In \\"Jaws\\" you are placed in a sleepy little seaside town on Amity Island off the coast of Massachusetts some time in the early 70s. A group of teenagers is partying on the beach and one of the girls goes off for a swim. The guy who just tried to pick her up is too drunk to follow her into the water and collapses on the beach. Now the camera shifts to an underwater perspective, there is something menacing there, it's closing in on the girl... <br /> <br />Jaws is basically divided into two parts, the first half shows life on Amity and focuses on the struggle between the new chief of police Martin Brody and the townspeople lead by Mayor Vaughn. Brody is a city person from New York, who was looking for a quiet life in Amity and now has to confront his own fears of the ocean, while his sense of responsibility leaves him with no alternative but to call for a hunting expedition for the Great White Shark that will include him. As Brody tries to convince people around him that there is a killer shark out there that has to be hunted down and the mayor stalls, afraid to lose more summer business, the number of victims continues to rise, finally forcing the mayor to act.  <br /> <br />In the second half of the movie Brody, the 1960s student movement type ocean researcher Matt Hooper and veteran fisherman Quint, the prototype of the anti-hero, set out to catch and kill the beast. Soon they are confronted with something far bigger than they expected or Quint's rickety boat was designed for and the hunters become the hunted, locked in a life and death struggle with a 20 foot shark, all communications to Amity cut off. <br /> <br />Jaws is one of those movies you can watch again and again. The reasons for this are a compelling storyline, convincing acting and an excellent job at editing the movie down to only include scenes that are absolutely essential to developing the plot, this movie is literally not a minute too long, no section is superfluous. <br /> <br />In contrast to present-day movies you don't have spectacular and unrealistic CGI generated action sequences, both the human actors and the shark are believable. For the first half of the film you don't even get to see the shark directly, you just feel its menacing presence, much the same way a swimmer at the ocean may. <br /> <br />Personally I also enjoy being transplanted back to the US as it was 30 years ago, when in a town like Amity you could still leave your house door and car unlocked.
0062515675|5.0|This is an interesting story. It is a story of a lawyer who appears to have it all - the corner office, the life style, the cars, women, ... Then he gives it all up and tours the East. While there he comes across this strange monk and monastery. He comes to live life in a much different way. Yet he is challenged by the monk who has trained him to go back home and share the message he has learnt, with the West. Julian, our main character, returns to his old law firm and to his prot?g? John. He tells him a parable; then the rest of the book explains the parable and how it relates to different aspects of our lives. The parable is rather simple and a little strange but as it is explained you will never forget it. Read it to find out how a garden, lighthouse, sumo wrestler, pink wire cable, stopwatch, roses and a winding path of diamonds are symbols of timeless principles and virtues by which to live your life. This book could help raise the quality of your life to a new level.
0425188809|5.0|Lovely story about a smart dog and his saviors. The characters are very attaching, especially the smart dog. Classic Koontz, one his top three.
B000EULJLU|2.0|After the five year wait, I was expecting an experimental album slower in pace than Lateralus, with the sound being taken in new directions. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that this album achieved that at all. The biggest issues for me are: <br /> <br />* Derivative work. This album does not move forward from their earlier work. In fact, much of it sounds like outtakes from previous albums, and bits of Grudge, Lateralus and Third Eye (including a flawlessly reproduced minute from the latter) show up in parts. <br /> <br />* Uninspired lyrics. They are in any way obtuse or challenging - moving towards a more preachy, direct style. Tool themselves have previously quoted Timothy Leary's \\"Think for yourself, question authority\\" line and I'm disappointed that they've moved to telling us what we should think when listening to them.  <br /> <br />* Filler. There are *large* amounts of filler. Quite apart from the 10 minutes of tracks (including an ER-style section not unlike parts of Guns'n'Roses \\"Coma\\") that are meant to be filler, some tracks just drag on and on in repetitive, quiet pulses or sequences. <br /> <br />* Commercialisation. Three of the tracks seem to be a move towards a more MTV/emo-friendly style, including one, Right In Two, which heavily depends upon a riff only one note altered from a recent Staind song. The lyrics are pointlessly emo/teenage, especially in the lead single. Other bands do this stuff far better and it's not why I buy a Tool record. <br /> <br />The only real saving graces are the drumming of Danny Carey - brilliant as always - and the artwork, like Lateralus by the artist Alex Grey, which is truly amazing. The track 10,000 Days is growing on me, but is still vastly inferior to previous work. <br /> <br />I fear that one of my favourite bands has lost their raison d'etre and that the mantle of developing this sound into something new for 2006 and beyond rests with other artists. Unless they prove me wrong in albums to come, it seems that they have run out of ideas and are chained by their past success and creativity. The album \\"Quicksilver Meat Dream\\", by I Mother Earth in 2003 with Tool's producer, is a better bet for now until something else develops.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Oh for gawd's sake - this is the soft core version of 'salo' - total fantasy [for the vaguely immature] and quite a waste .....
B000EHRVP6|2.0|Maybe. This film has PLENTY of each depicted in explicit, oozing, Burroughs-esque detail. Many of the classic horror/slasher film tools are incorporated: deception, loss of control, subjection to pain, maniacal bloodthirsty antagonists, young naked (vulnerable) victims. But there is more to it then just a gore-fest. <br /> <br />Other people are to be exploited as a means of pleasure. That is the view challenged by this pseudo-gripping film. A group of tourists (2 Americans and an Icelander) bounce about Europe, frequent brothels, get high, and party until their fun is stymied by an encounter with Elite Hunting, an evil secret society which profits from the abduction, torture and then murder of (mostly) tourists. Much like the prostitutes these boys encountered in Amsterdam they were held against their will, their bodies encroached upon in a most heinous manner for the gratification of others and their bodies discarded. <br /> <br />This viewer felt the film was fairly well done with the exception of the ending. The ending sucked enough to reduce my rating by a full star. Its almost as if the executive producer informed Roth, \\"we are out of funding so lets wrap this up in one week, shall we?\\" And we are left with a serious lack of resolution. This film deserved a more thought provocing conclusion. I look forward to Roth's next film.
0062513346|3.0|This book was not easy for me to get through. You are being told that it is a true story but parts seem extremely hard to believe. Not that he isn't telling the truth but maybe it just wasn't being told in the best possible way for you to find it believable. Maybe there wasn't a message for me to get out of this book. And maybe there will be a message for you to get out of this book. Coelho's books are always sprinkled with messages. As a fan of his work I was compelled to read it. I may read it again in the future and who knows I might think it is the most brilliant book written.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Did Amazon ship early? The CD was released today and I recieved it today from a pre-order that I placed like 5 days ago. It was in transit and I could have got it yesterday according to shipping details. It was within range. Amazon made a mistake but it came on May second.....anyway the cd. <br /> <br />I am in the middle of the experience. I have never liked a Tool CD from the onset, not even Undertow, but I have grown to really like all of them. <br /> <br />I am also an impatient person to a degree and each time I listen to new Tool and dislike it I temporarily convince myself that this is the one. This is the one that will not grow on me.....yet already after some forced listening I am starting to get in a mental and listening groove with this. <br /> <br />When I first opened the package and popped it in I was thinking..... What is this noise? What happened to Maynard's voice? Why is he so subdued? Even some of the lyrics sounded generic and familiar. Something about it reminded me of Peter Gabriel. The opening vocals in The Pot sounded like that Levine guy from Maroon 5. I did a little panic and discarded the knowledge of the learning curve I used with the other CD's.  <br /> <br />I thought \\"this sucks?\\" but deep down I knew better. I knew I was jumping the gun. Believe me nothing tangible was telling me I was overeacting. I had to rely on my trust for Tool. Trust in the knowledge that despite initial misgivings the preceeding albums had grown on me.  <br /> <br />Still, I put it down without even listening all the way through only liking Vicarious and maybe Rosetta Stoned. Then sure enough after several minutes I had an internal urge to listen again and using Vicarious and Rosetta Stoned as faith stepping stones I ventured out a little and listened a little deeper to a few other songs and walked away liking Jambi, Right in Two and Intension as well...just as I had done with Undertow, Aenima and Lateralus. Building and building, accepting more and more songsuntil I enjoyed everything. This takes a while though. Several hours if not days of intense listening. <br /> <br />I am still not yet embracing some of the other songs on 10,000 Days but I know I will. I can tell that I will. I can feel it. On Lateralus I went from only liking Schizm and Parabol to loving every single song but Ticks and Leeches which I just like for the drumming. <br /> <br />It got me thinking that if I gave other bands as much of a listening chance that I give Tool.....Would I like them as well? Then again I have never felt an urge to go back to something I disliked at first from another band.  <br /> <br />I am not one of those Tool fans that thinks that Tool has reinvigorated my life or inspired me to do something or whatever. I just see Tool as a little soulful and provocative escapism. <br /> <br />People keep saying listen all the way through and that is the way to hear it. I am not able to do that yet without losing sustained interest. I cannot do that yet but I am sure one can enjoy this by listening through a little and then skipping around and then listening in succession a little again and etc, etc. <br /> <br />I recommend first hearing it as background and let it imprint upon you. Like type out something on a message board and let it play in the background first mentally bouncing back and forth between the music and what your typing. Then take it by itself and listen. That always helps me get into it. <br /> <br />By the way the CD for me is not a 5 at this second. I give it a 5 because I know after I listen to this and really pour over the material, it will be a certain 5 and able to stand next to the other albums if not surpass them. <br /> <br />I say surpass out of trust now. Nothing I feel right now leads me to believe that I will like this better then Undertow or Lateralus, but I felt the same way about past albums compared to other past albums. I just have faith that I will or may someday like this better then the others. <br /> <br />I swear it grows on you if you give it a chance. <br />
B000A32KJQ|1.0|EMC, a label known for polished recording and production fails on this bum production. Listen to any sample and try to remember that this is an EMC release, and I'm not a huge fane of the label, but this music is what they should play for recovering cancer patients in the hospital.  Plane and simple, this music sucks, and that's coming from a mid-twenties musician with 3,000 jazz recordings -K.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|A power trio hailing from Australia, Wolfmother is going somewhere, fast.  As previously stated, the best comparison to the vocals is Jack White of the White Stripes, with half of the song \\"Apple Tree\\" sounding like it came right off of a White Stripes album.  The sound of the rest of the album, however is a rocking combination of the top rock/metal bands of the early 70's.  Many of the riffs sound like Black Sabbath, especially the thundering \\"Woman\\" which, in this reviewer's opinion, is probably the best track on the album(Rolling Stone called this track \\"generic,\\" but be sure to listen and make your own opinion; I believe they are underestimating this band).  A couple of tracks go from slow folky acoustic guitar sound to heavy rocking riffs very remeniscent of Led Zeppelin epics.  There's also the occassional organ riff ranging from the Deep Purple chord banging sound (Woman) to the more complex Uriah Heep sound (Joker And The Thief, Mind's Eye).  There's even a Jethro Tull-like flute solo (Witchcraft). <br />There's not a song on this album that I don't like; all strong, well written songs.
0061091480|5.0|I have read this book at least a dozen times. It filled with timeless information that anyone of any age can read, comprehend and incorporate into their lives. Highly recommended.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|\\"A Fever You can't Sweat Out\\" is easily the best cd I've purchased this year. It's rare to find a cd you can throw in the stereo and just let it play. I could listen to this album a million more times and still love it. If you like Fallout boy you will no doubt love Panic! at the Disco. What a great album.
B00028HBKM|2.0|Being raised Christian and learning about the Crucifixion was always something that was important to our family. The Passion of the Christ was a beautifully made movie(a least for the first 15 minutes), using Aramaic and great settings, that brought the story to life. Yet, the excessive blood and violence made the Passion something out of a Freddie Kruger movie. The more blood and gore that could be squeezed into every scene was done so. The movie is definitely not for anyone under 10 and will most likely disturb anyone over 10. My suggestion, rent it, it is not something that is worth watching a second time!
0307276902|5.0|I finally read A Million Little Pieces by James Frey. I did not and still do not understand what all of the controversy is about. When there is an accident and you ask 10 people to witness it, you will get 10 different perspectives. The author was giving his perspective when he was overcoming horrendous physical and emotional addictions. He also had to keep individuals anonymous and tweek the details to sufficiently cover many identities from the same time and place. I found his writing compelling and indicative of a mind that may not be able to process a complete thought or sentence. I particularly appreciated the strong comparison from when he was first in treatment and when he was finishing treatment with respect to his thoughts and actions to others. His reconciliation with his parents, his ability to make friends and be concerned about them as his recovery progressed showed his ability to relate again, very slowly to the world around him. Would that be an imperfect perspective? I'm guessing it might be an imperfect perspective given the healing and change that his mind and body were going through. How can anyone else dictate how the author's perspective should have been at the time or how his perspective should have been later as he was remembering his own life? I know someone who has taken a year off to write her memoirs and since this incident, has decided not to finish writing it. I am very concerned about the ability of readers to have editorial power and almost sensorship control over a book meant to help others or maybe even just facilitate a self healing of the author. Why should anyone be able to dictate the perspective of a life? What was their motive in finding \\"errors\\"? Are our American History books perfectly adjusted to facts? Sadly no, and these are factual books taught to our children, not a story that is meant to bring hope and/or healing. I feel so strongly about this debate that this is the first time I have ever written a review. Of course there may be someone who will find that I wrote a book review in High School once and that will discredit my entire writing.
B000EULJLU|5.0|On the surface, \\"10,000 Days\\" may appear to be a bit of a phoned-in effort. Even its title reeks of recent radio-rock banality. Is this a Disturbed record? 3 Doors Down? Take a peek inside, however, and you'll find an album that twists and turns in unexpected ways and pushes Tool's sound to the next level. Taken individually, the songs may sound like your typical Tool affair, but thrown into the context of the album and sequenced just right reveals a true brilliance that is rare this day in age.<br /><br />Since 2001's \\"Lateralus,\\" the five members that make up Tool have grown stronger, sounding perhaps more cohesive than ever before. Guitarist Adam Jones steps up his game in a big way, delivering intoxicating yet complex riffs in the form of \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and the lead-off single, \\"Vicarious.\\" \\"Jambi\\" is truly his shining moment, as he busts out the talk-box for a very un-Tool-ish solo that somehow fits perfectly. The rhythm section of Danny Carey and Justin Chancellor is just as tough as ever, providing the constant energy and time shifts that the band has become known for while frontman Maynard James Keenan remains forever the oddball. His vocals are in top form, but his lyrics seem more cynical than ever and at times, completely alien (see the previously mentioned \\"Rosetta Stoned\\"). Together, the band brings a dynamic and multi-layered package that ensures a payoff upon repeat listenings.<br /><br />Now, is this the best album Tool has to offer? Hardly. Surely, the band have more expansive and grandoise efforts to offer, but what \\"10,000 Days\\" does is deliver a perfectly well-rounded and dense experience unlike any other. Give it time, take it in and resist the urge to complain. Even if 10,000 Days pass between Tool albums, it will always be worth the wait.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Perhaps that is where the inspiration for the cover art came from because the self titled latest release is gritty, uncompromising and hard core back to basics Pearl Jam.  <br /> <br />The five shot opening foray of 'Life wasted' through to 'Marker in the sand' is as in your face power fuled sonic overload as anything the band has done since 'VS' or 'Vitology'.  <br /> <br />Eddie growls, mumbles and roars through each track like a man on a missison and as the guitars soar in and out they take over on most tracks and add solid grunt and a real rock tinge that wasn't as apparent in the bands latter day releases such as 'Binural' and 'Riot Act'. In fact this is the most straight ahead rock they have been since they played with Neil Young on the Mirrorball album. <br /> <br />The tempo slows for 'Parachutes' and 'Unemployable' with the former being the closest offering to acoustic Pearl Jam on the album  <br /> <br />It seems like wartime brings out the best in Pearl Jam because the band has some bones to pick and though the \\"talk disguised as news\\" journo's will be dissapointed that Ed dosn't name names it's pretty obvious in which direction most of the vitrol is aimed. That said in 'Marker in the sand' both sides are taken into account \\"claiming killing in God's name\\".  <br /> <br />The war isn't the only political topic under scrutiny <br /> 'Unemployable'speaks to the marginalised American's who are not part of the bottom line 'Army reserve' to the families who face the real fear of the unknown outcome of their loved ones 'Life wasted' is a self parody warning of the trappings of excess <br /> <br />The album ends on a hopefull note with 'Inside job' which will be huge in concert. It starts quietly and then begins to soar and has more than a little in common with Zepplin's Stairway to Heaven. Eddie promises not to lose faith and in doing so gives us a tiny glimpse of the possibility of something better. <br />
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I don't usually feel so strong about a recording to write a review, but I need to say that it doesn't get any better than this CD.  Great song writing, musicianship, and the voices are so great. The 6th work - \\"Love and Happiness\\" has brought me to tears it is so gorgeous.  I hope Mark and Emmylou start working together on \\"All The Roadrunning Part II.\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|you know if someone is a slave to that crap known as \\"death metal\\" (i.e.  Nailed To Gold) then proceeds to give a terrific album like this a bad review, you know something's up. NTG, stick with your death metal and don't bother reviewing albums such as these because obviously, your brain is too far gone to even comtemplate the beauty within 10,000 Days.
B000002HMH|4.0|Now just about every one of these reviews for \\"Load\\" are complaining because Metallica aren't as hard as they used to be.  Well, that's because the members of the band have half a brain.  If they'd not changed their style/image they wouldv'e fallen off the face of the earth with every other metal band that didn't change with the times.  Megadeath, have you heard their new one?  How about Sepultura, have you heard their new song on the radio?  What about Anthrax?  The answer to all those questions is \\"NO\\", you haven't heard anything worthwhile from them in a long time because they didn't change.  They all died with the 80's.  Now I'm just like most people, I love Metallica's first 4 albums.  \\"The Black Album\\", \\"Load\\", \\"Reload\\" & \\"St. Anger\\" aren't anything at all like the earlier albums; but Metallica's still here aren't they?  Now alotta you are all saying Metallica sold out, well ya, of course they did, when you get to their age, you stop the whole rebellious thing & start thinking about your future.  They were smart in realizing what sells & what doesn't sell.  There are only a few bands out there that've survived; Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, & Metallica are 3 that right away come to mind.  All are still here because they've changed with the times.
B000EULJLU|5.0|A good Tool song is like a multi-course meal, prepared by an expert chef and with the best ingredients.  Each course is very good, but is made with few ingredients.  The chef is so good though that even though each individual course may not say much (even though it is awesome), he is able to tell a story by how the courses are arranged.  As the courses progress the flavors are lingering, and you experience all the flavors in the right proportions when you finish the entire meal.   <br /> <br />The best Tool songs I believe are like this.  Tool uses the dimension of time to their advantage; they paint a beautiful picture when the song in its entirety is considered, not just one point in time.   <br /> <br />This album has a few real good songs, which have been mentioned in other reviews.  Also, the album art is almost worth the purchase of the album by itself (stereoscopic lenses!!!).
B000002UA9|5.0|Every Beatles album showcased a new phase of music--for them and often for popular music. \\"Please, Please Me\\", their debut, is unique:  Most of their recordings are very slick and accomplished.  This recording only represents the latter.  It's hallmarks are well documented, however.  The title track and their rendition of the Isley Brothers' \\"Twist and Shout,\\" are unforgettable classics.  What makes this C.D. so worthwhile are the songs seldom heard.  \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" (with McCartney at the vocal helm) used to be a standard song, but now is seldom heard even on Oldies radio.  It is a great rocking song.  More power can be attributed to other nuggets, such as a cover of the Shirelles' \\"Boys,\\" and their own composition \\"There's a Place,\\" (sung with admirable gusto by Ringo and John respectively).      Otherwise, there is a subjective element for evaluating this C.D.  Many songs from these sessions have a fifties feel to them (their own era afterall).  Their covers of \\"Baby It's You,\\" \\"Anna,\\" and \\"Taste of Honey\\" seem old, but this is a description, not a criticism.  (Some selections are an acquired taste.)  They also demonstrate more than a mastery of good, hard-rocking songs. Their originals \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret,\\" and \\"Love Me Do,\\" showcase a variety of forms which they were beginning to master.  \\"P.S.\\" and \\"...Secret\\" are gems, but \\"Love Me Do,\\" seems subjectively like a slow start for such a remarkable band.  (Although, it does broaden the scope of the album with a folkie feel to the love song.)      Anyway you assess it, \\"Please, Please Me\\" is a remarkable and unvarnished debut by what we know as a historical band.  Here they start off with a sense of urgency and great energy.  Later, John Lennon would quip, \\"I hope we passed the audition.\\"  He was referring to \\"Get Back\\" from \\"Let It Be,\\" a song and an album that undoubtedly tried to recapture the spirit of this record.  They indeed did pass their first major public auditionwith \\"Please, Please Me\\".
B000EULJLU|5.0|RIGHT IN TWO IS POSSIBLY ONE OF THE BEST TOOL SONGS EVER!   <br />WHO CARES THAT EVERYBODY IS BASHING THIS ALBUM...THERES ONE REASON FOR IT...THE WAIT.  WHEN YOU HAVE TO WAIT 5 YEARS AFTER 2 CLASSIC ALBUMS...THEN YOUR EXPECTATIONS BECOME TOO HIGH, AND YOU START IMAGINING WHAT THE NEXT TOOL ALBUM IS GOING TO SOUND LIKE.  THEN WHEN IT DOESN'T FIT YOUR IMAGINATION, YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED! THATS THE CATCH 22.   IF THIS WAS RELEASED 3 YEARS AGO PEOPLE WOULD BE HOLLARING CLASSIC!  TRY TO LISTEN UNOBJECTIVELY AND YOU WILL FIND THIS IS DEFINATELY BETTER THAN 99% OF THE \\"MAJOR LABEL\\" MUSIC COMING OUT TODAY!
B0006Z2KIY|5.0|I had heard of this movie before but there was no way I was going to watch a mushy love story.  After someone recommended it, I decided to watch for myself.  To my surprise, the movie was really good.  It shows what true love is all about.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|You know how every couple has \\"Their Song\\"? People use songs to vent, to cry, to love, to live. That's what I like about Avril's songs, they're about every aspect of Life. Each of her songs brings a new emotion into view, there's slow songs, fast songs, angry songs, and the melancholy songs we want when we're depressed. They're all real life, anyone could find one of her songs that they can/could relate to. She sings from her heart, through her soul and with passion. I love her voice because it flows through the slow songs, and rocks it out on the fast songs. She's got a voice to envy, with a skill to write songs that just touch your heart. <br /> <br />This artist is one of the few where I can listen to each and every song on her album and enjoy each one the same. They're all just great in their own way, and so deep... or emo, whatever the word is now-a-days. That's why I like them so much, I like to relate to songs, I like songs that give a message. Hers give a message. Five stars!
B00006LWSF|5.0|Eminem has proven once again that he is unsinkable.  With a brilliant ensamble here he also has proven to be a suitable producer as well, boasting a label with talent like 50 Cent and Obie Trice, both of which have blown up now, but at the time of this release they were small potatoes.  The album track list reads like a whos who of the best in the rap industry, everyone from Nas to Jay-Z to Xzibit, all of whom lay down decent tracks, but the shining star is none other than Slim Shady himself, with more than a few killer cuts like the blistering anthem 'Lose Yourself' which stands alone as Shady's most glorious moment.  D-12, the Dirty Dozen who up until now have ceased to impress me actually hold there own on 'Rap Game' while 50 serves up a luke-warm track dissing none other than Ja-Rule on 'Wanksta' but he makes good for it with 'Places to Go' while Obie Trice stands out on 'Adrenaline Rush' and makes it obvious why he's been signed to Em's label.  I do want to point out that while I don't know why Macy Gray was included on the roster, to answer a question from one reviewer, Boomkat is here because the lead singer Taryn Manning was in the film and as a favor to help boost her career Eminem gave her a track...that's why she's here, although she doesn't quite fit the bill.  The best track here is the closing track 'Rabbit Run' where Eminem freestyles a track with no hook, just straight in you face 'look at me now' type lyrics that grab the listener and let them know what this album, what this movie and what Eminem, the man, is all about.  Great album and great boost for the unsinkable Eminem!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|What defined Pearl Jam's greatest albums was their ability to release an entire disc without one moment of filler.  Ten, Vs., Vitalogy all could be defined that way.  But then came the years of experimentation and self-indulgence that often plague great bands.  We got a string of albums that all had moments of brilliance, but increasingly were turning into albums of filler.  \\"Riot Act\\" was the pinnacle filler album, where the songs were more like half-formed musings than actual pieces of music that grabbed a hold of you and never let you go.  Almost every song on \\"Riot Act\\" felt like it could possibly go somewhere, but alas, sank down with a quiet thud.  As a result, the ensuing tour suffered, weighted down by the muddled sounds of the album.  A shame, because live on stage is where PJ usually redeems itself. <br /> <br />Along comes their self-titled album, chock full of trademark head-kicking Pearl Jam riffs, melodies and songs with some serious things to say.  Most importantly, Eddie has woken from his slumber and decided to get angry and in our faces again, rather than stand in the corner and mumble.  And do I hear Mike McCready torching the place with punk riffs and lightning-speed solos?  Yes, I do!  If you're not smiling after the one-two-three-four punch of the first quartet of songs, then you need to have your pulse checked.  Severed Hand stands out for me, as they have melded the best of Corduruoy and Porch into one very cool rock song. <br /> <br />Welcome back, boys.
B000E97Y6A|5.0|I must admit when I first looked at the cover and saw that it was three hours long I thought I would have to watch it an hour a day.  The first hour was incredibly slow since the title is King Kong.  However, the first appearance of King Kong is shown close to the second hour.  After that, the movie will have you glued to the screen. <br /> <br />This movie is filled with action.  From King Kong fighting with dinosaurs to him constantly trying to save Ann, you will not get bored.  The use of technology is definitely an improvement from the original movie.
B000EULJLU|5.0|i've spent the whole day listening to this album, and needless to say... it is artistry personified! Truly an aural experience...<br /><br /> oh sure its not like Opiate or Undertow, but that is what Tool is all about in essence, growth and progression. If they catered to all the closed minded Tool \\"fans\\", they would be just another mediocre band for the masses. All the people who give this album, or any album in general, poor ratings; need to open their minds and embrace artistry... if you so called fans are so \\"open-minded\\" and you \\"think for yourselves\\"... then strive to understand artistry. could you paint the same picture 1000 times over? so then why do you think a band, especially one so talented and free-willed as Tool, would want to make the same music over and over again?...watch the weather change... and dig on the incredible soundscapes, the INSANELY UNBELIEVABLE drums and percussion, rock out to the heavy emphasis on killer guitar work, and OPEN YOUR MIND to some new instrumentation like a sitar<br /><br />and for those of you who care, the packaging alone is worth the money! trust me!!!!
159413023X|5.0|I hear everywhere, that the beginning of this book is the best but honeslty, I think it's so boring. The whole first 15 chapters seemed as if the book was going no where. But....I stiked to it and it got sooooo much better. It's a very intense book and opens up a lot of doors. Ironicly, one of my schoolmates died while I was finishing this book. It really eases my mind about where she is now. I definatly recommend this book to those who have lost someone in there life. (It's not religious at all).
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has never been an \\"easy listen\\" Sunday music.  <br />Not a single Tool album satisfied me after the first listen. <br /> <br />I've listened to 10 000 Days for last 8 hours non-stop. with every passing hour, with each ray of sun less, with each minute into the night, the tangled web of 10 000 days becomes clearer and clearer, what seemed to be an echo of past Tool works becomes an anchor in the ship sailing where Tool had never been before. Maynard lyrics are one of the best pieces of writing in rock ever. The rhytmic section is powerful as never before.   <br /> <br />It will take me 10 000 days to get bored with it.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Under the radar no more, Pearl Jam is back! Back to the basics on this self-titled album. The Life Wasted, World Wide Suicide, Comatose, Severed Hand, Marker in the Sand is a 1-2-3-4-5 punch that rivals any of their previous records. Parachutes is a melodic tune that will grow on you and Unemployable is a great pop song. Gone is an incredible mid tempo rocker with some great lyrics. Big Wave and Army Reserve are upbeat rockers with great song writing and great musicianship again. The last two songs may be two of their best ever, Come Back left me with tears after the first listen and Inside Job is another one for the record books. <br /> <br />I am a Pearl Jam fanatic but this effort will satisfy not only the diehards but also attract the casual PJ fan and newbies as well. Honestly, there is not a bad song on the album and anyone with any interest in Pearl Jam or even good Rock N Roll will love this album. 5 stars!
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Another band with the exact same sound as every other emo band to come out of the same exact place... America. Are Americans really that depressed? <br /> <br />WHEN will it all end??!!
B000ETQRCM|1.0|It's an election year. <br />What does that mean? <br />Pearl Jam releases another, *yawn*, album. <br />Of course we get the obligatory, vitriolic, whining of the self righteous malcontent Eddie Vedder. I swear, this man has no range in vocals. It's either: sneer, growl, or mumble. <br />The lead guitarist tries his best to steal lame licks from the School of Hendrix. <br />Didn't this over-rated Seattle schlock grunge go out of style circa. 1998? <br />Virtually every Pearl Jam album is interchangible. They've been cranking out the same, tired, schtick for at least 12 years now. <br />And, of course, while their time has come and gone (they hardly make a dent in the charts anymore), their mind-numbed fans eat up this worn out crud. <br />I'm sure my humble review will raise the ire of the fans of the band. But it is the harsh truth. The outside world has changed. Bill Clinton is no longer president. Time to step out of your bubble and smell the fresh air.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'm a moderate pearl jam fan. I have a couple of their albums, but I never really got into them fully. I got this cd with some hesitation. I loved the single World Wide Suicide, so I decided to pick this up, and I'm glad I did. This cd is great! Every song is good. I cant stop listening to the cd. The first 3 are straight rockers, and that sets the tone of the whole album. This will be one of the best rock cds of the year, maybe of the decade.
B00004WKII|5.0|Some of songs on this boxset are the best versions you'll ever find. Put all 4 discs in a CD changer, let em play, and get your mind blown. Some instrumental only songs are absolutely mesmerizing. My personal favorite is Cherokee Mist, a song that shows the true mastery of Jimi's guitar playing. He is one with his guitar, allowing the soulful, powerfully moving music in his head to come through beautifully to those blessed enough to hear him play.     With that said, I would recommend this to someone just getting into Hendrix, or even someone who had never listened to him before (shame on you). I purchased a best of Hendrix when I first  started listening to him, but this boxset really had me hooked. I bought every single studio release by Hendrix shortly after, and later added  any rarity i could find. You'd do the same if you heard the incredible range and intensity displayed on this boxset.    Highly Recommended.
B000EULJLU|4.0|After reading articles saying that this CD is going to be insanely heavy and influenced by Meshuggah. I was very surprised in what I was hearing after track one, very mellow. I mean this wasn't the direction I was hopping for but over all it is a very well done excellent CD. I guess we will have to wait another 5 yrs to see what's next.
B000EULJLU|5.0|First off, I am getting sick and tired of reading reviews by supposed \\"Tool fans\\" saying that they are dissapointed with Tool's latest release.  First off, it is 2 days after the release and any Tool fan knows that it takes a hell of a lot longer than that to appreciate the full artistry of a Tool album.  Tool deserves more than that from you, after giving you beautiful and spiritual music for almost 15 years.  How many times have you supposed \\"Tool fans\\" listened to all of their previous releases before they hit you with full impact?  A lot I am guessing, so stop giving this band that has enriched your lives that much more 1, 2, or 3 star reviews saying that it isn't as good as anything they have done before, or that they dont have it in them to record a heavy album anymore.  Hey, you ever heard of a saying called \\"with age comes wisdom\\"?  Maybe you should listen to that and stop grading Tool on initial feelings toward them.  Too anyone reading this, do Tool a favor, will you?  Write a review of 10,000 days, giving it a 5 star review, doesn't have to be much, I just think Tool deserves more than these 2 star reviews.  Even if you do not like Tool's style of music, you have to appreciate the raw talent of every band member in this band.  You don't have to like Tool's style of music to appreciate their talent, so HAVE A LITTLE RESPECT!  Click yes if you appreciate everything that Tool has done for you over the last 15 years.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I originally thought, \\"how could Tool outperform their previous albums?\\"  THEY DID IT!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Do not listen to all these kids who believed this record was going to be Lateralus Part II and are calling this an album of b-sides. If you are an actual fan of the band, you know they make insane amounts of progression from record to record (Opiate EP to Aenima, Aenima to Lateralus, etc) and this album is no different. I am absolutely satisfied on a level not measurable by any band today at Tool's ability to not only produce mature, interesting, \\"progressive rock\\" (I can't decide what genre they are, it's too debatable) but the intensity of the music does not cease to amaze me. Pay no mind to these mindless drones who like music to \\"crowd surf to.\\" Tool has been out of that music since 2001, and everyone knows it.    The first time I heard Lateralus, I was very inept and was in love with Schism. I listened to it on repeat for a while. Once that bored me, I moved on to the first 7 songs. (I know, very lame) Then, about 2 weeks later, I let it play through the whole way on a road trip. It had finally clicked...this record was the best of 2001. There was no comparison to this music that had been forged since Aenima.    I will not \\"rate\\" the tracks like most reviews on Amazon do; however, I will say this: if you do not OWN this album, you are not a fan of this band. Being a Tool fan has meant many things; if you know anything about the band's discography you know that they will push the limit and take you outside of your comfort zone to appreciate new forms of art. The band's progression since Lateralus has been nothing short of revolutionary. My 24 year old brother, who gave me Lateralus for free since \\"Tool made him depressed,\\" purchased this album after getting a listen (I later purchased Lateralus again to give Tool their due). If I can convince an old school punk fan to buy 10,000 Days, what's stopping you?
0802130208|1.0|Hated every page. Boring. Impossible-to-like characters, annoying dialog, and very little plot. I suspect that Ignatius J. Reilly describes the late author; he was indeed an extremely unhappy young man. I hope I never pick up drivel like this book ever again. That this book was given any literary prize whatsoever is flat-out astonishing.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Deep.  Tool's music holds a certain degree of longevity that I have rarely seen in other bands.  Albums such as Aenima and Lateralus are some of the deepest albums of all time.  Both of those albums took me awhile to get into, the layers of music unfolded every new listen.  Months were spent until I really began getting into these albums, until finally years later I can say they are two of the greatest albums of all time. <br /> <br />With 10,000 Days, I took my past experiences with Tool albums and came to the conclusion that this album probably won't blow me away for weeks.  My first listen, although nothing special, was a joyous occasion just for the sole fact that I was actually listening to new Tool material.  Listens passed and the album (surprisingly) unfolded much quicker than I thought.   <br /> <br />The sonic landscapes, the long instrumental passages, and beautiful lyrics are all there.  It reminds me so much of past Tool albums yet at the same time nothing like them.  Recurring themes can be noticed throughout the album which some people claim to be lack of creativity(which I find hilarious.)  Perhaps my point of this review is to take it as you will, with an open-mind.  Many seem to not like it (how you can judge a Tool album within weeks is beyond me.)  Some of my personal favorites are exclaimed as being filler while ironically the same songs that are my favorites on Lateralus were also claimed filler.   <br /> <br />The experience this time around with 10,000 Days seems to be more dark.  The unity consciousness seems to be pushed aside for a more personal introspective theme (you will find the theme of duality throughout most of the album.) The production is crisp and the musicianship tight.  Danny Carey plays his heart out with off-time, tribal, and electronic beats.  The guitar is much more out in the front than past albums, adding a heavier crunch to the music.  The bass is fantastic.  And of course, Maynard James Keenan, as usual, shines lyrically and vocally like no one else.   <br /> <br />Buy it, in time, you will not be disappointed.
006054094X|1.0|This is not a well written book.  The evidence is just not there to support the writer's thesis. <br /> <br />However, the not extinct \\"warrah\\" of the Falkland Islands was a fascinating aside.  Could it be that the Chinese actually reached the Falklands but no further?  If not, what is the origin of this strange creature?  It certainly looks like a cross between a dog and a fox to me.
B000ENC67S|5.0|One of the truly great American films has been made by a Chinese director, an Argentinian composer, and an Australian lead actor.<br /><br />Ang Lee has captured the loneliness, intolerance, and violence of the American west as no one else has. There may be a few tiny false notes, mostly in plot devices fleshing out the short story, but Mr. Lee has created an intimate, genuine, masterful, epic film which portrays a region, time, and two star-crossed lovers who find each other in 1963.<br /><br />The film follows their passionate, private, and devoted friendship for 20 years. Jake Gyllenhaal is extraordinary as rodeo cowboy Jack Twist, who begins as a sweet, soft-spoken, sensuous young man, and grows into a loving, self-assured man who knows what he wants.  Heath Ledger paints a deeply moving portrait of the taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar, whose still waters run very deep, indeed.  Yet he cannot satisfy anyone -- himself least of all. Torment is etched on his face, but can be verbalized only in extreme circumstances.  His passive/aggressive character triggers all the major and minor tragedies of this multi-level, heart-breaking story.<br /><br />The musical score is gorgeous, and perfectly complements the magnificent photography and scenery. Be sure to watch the credits, because Rufus Wainright's beautifully simple accompanying song sums up the entire film with remarkable sentiment and heartfelt aplomb.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is not Opiate, Undertow, Aenima, or Lateralus . . . but it is TOOL.  Heavily influenced by everything else they've done to date, 10,000 Days is simply a masterpiece.  The lyrical content is truly outstanding - MJK has really outdone himself.  The mix is incredible - every instrument, even Maynard's voice, is even.  So, the vocals are pushed a bit to the back, and the guitar and bass are strongly brought to the front.  This IS the kind of CD that keeps growing on you - many fans will wish Amazon had a \\"6 star\\" rating so they can come back and update their review after a few more listens.  The packaging is probably the coolest single CD I've ever seen.  I don't mind if I have to wait another 5 years until the next Tool release.  This one will tide me over just like Lateralus and Aenima did in the past.
B0000VAFO0|3.0|Vampires and werewolves, lycans for short (and it actually only means wolf), have been at war with one another for centuries.  The vampires think they have almost won the war completely.  Things have been going their way ever since they eliminated the lycan leader Lucien.  But a vampire Deathdealer (Kate Beckinsdale) discovers there may be more lycans than they thought and they may be better organized.  To make it worse, the lycans have also managed to get a hold of some nasty weaponry that is deadly to the vampires.  But none of the other vampires seems to believe the threat that Kate knows is out there so she disobeys orders and investigates on her own. <br /> <br />She learns that the lycans were following a human for some reason.  Kate tries to figure out why and along the way she develops feelings for the human.  Things really heat up when one of the vampire elders is awakened and has to deal with the changing situations.  Plot and counter-plot abound and we learn more of the history of the two races and their feud.  In the end the whole movie seems more like the first part of a much larger story.  I have not yet seen the sequel so I don't know how well it continues the story. <br /> <br />The effects for the movie were pretty good although there are few clear shots of the lycans.  Most of the film almost feels black and white as there is very little color.  There are also many references to the histories and the war and it seems like the numbers get a little confused.  But this is an action-thriller and details like that often suffer so one expects it.  The only real problem I had with the film was the way it felt like it was setting up a larger story.  With the success of the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies one can certainly believe that such an attempt could be possible.  We shall see.  One thing I really liked was they way the two societies were portrayed.  While equally intelligent the vampires acted like aristocrats while the werewolves were far more bestial.  Check it out.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is very similiar to VS but then charters into Riot Act territory and beyond. The first five songs are awesome. The slow ballads are great too. This album was great from the begining. It didn't take time to get used to like Yield did.(although Yield is a great album also and the first single I liked immediately)I guess the President did something right.
B00005JKHN|4.0|ALL of the short film Extras are on the Second Disk.  If you want any Extras, be very careful to order the TWO Disk Set.<br /><br />Here are some of The EXTRAS on Disk TWO...<br />\\"Disneyland\\" (1954), Once Upon a Dream: The Making of Walt Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' (1997) (V), Grand Canyon (1958), 4 Artists Paint 1 Tree: A Walt Disney 'Adventure in Art' (1958)
B000EULJLU|5.0|I think the most important thing to keep in mind about this album is that it is NOT Lateralus, it is NOT Aenima, it is NOT Undertow, and it is NOT Opiate. 10,000 Days is it's own entitiy. Its 10,000 Days. Before listening to the album you need to remove your preconcieved notions of what you THINK it should be, based on the other albums. Many people try to compare it to Lateralus but you can't do that. When Lateralus came out everyone stated that there was nothing to compare it to and that still remains. 10,000 Days should not be compared to anything but itself. Whenever a new Tool album comes out I generally have to listen to it repeatedly for a period of time before the subtle complexities and sheer gravity of the album sink in. The same is with 10,000 Days. I think that after listening to it over a period of time everyone who doubts the amazement of this album and think Tool have feel off will come to realize what a phenomenal album it truelly is.
020530902X|5.0|It was a requirement that I have this book for one of my English Literature classes at University. However, I was pleased to see the amount of knowledge and helpful writing tips that the author provided. I never returned it. I still have it on my bookshelf at home!<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!
B000002JPA|5.0|This CD doesn't need my review but I am throwing in my two cents worth because it is one of my top five.  It has amazing vocals and amazing instrumentals, some almost unbelievably complex which is typical of DT.  This is their finest; every track is a winner and they all can be listened to over and over without becoming tiresome.  I find Metropolis - Part I the best cut and it might even be the best song of all time; it definitely has the best instrumental opening that I've ever heard.  (Please see my profile for a brief discussion of my rating philosophy.)
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|There is no parallel to this animation.  The story is wonderful picking up where the game left off.  And you get to see all your favorite characters again!  If you like the final fantasy's and VII was a favorite, DO NOT MISS THIS !!!

B0001AP12G|5.0|In the industry, all eyes are on Kanye right now. With two incredibly successful albums under his belt, guest appearances on what seems like everyone's tracks, and notable social and politcal commentary (Mr. Bush?) fueling his fire, it seems like Mr. West can't be stopped. <br /> <br />Kanye covers so much over the course of the album, it's really too much to take in after one listen. I found myself playing the songs over and over, studying his lyrics and the message behind them. Having said that, let's break down the tracks and see what makes this album so good (I'll skip the skits). <br /> <br />We Don't Care - The beat dropped, chorus kicked in and I was hooked, I knew I was going to be singing this one all the time. West comments on the inability of kids to succeed in school, who have to resort to hustling just to make a living. Love this song. (5/5) <br /> <br />All Falls Down (feat. Syleena Johnson) - We've all heard this one many times I'm sure, but this is still a great song. The different guitar lines West uses in the beat sound so good; chorus fits the song real well. And Kanye's lyrics really hit home: <br />\\"It seem, we livin the American dream <br />But people highest up got the lowest self esteem <br />The prettiest people, do the ugliest things <br />On the road to riches and diamond rings\\" <br />I admire an MC who is able to admit their self-consciousness, and West does so on an excellent song. (5/5) <br /> <br />Spaceship (feat. GLC and Consequence) - Beautiful use of the sample of Marvin Gaye's \\"Distant Lover\\". Some friends of mine have said the chorus is cheesy, but I love it. I can relate to the hardships of working and making a living that they express. The only thing holding this song back is it's formula (chorus, verse, chorus, verse, etc). (4/5) <br /> <br />Jesus Walks - Much controversy surrounding this song. Musically, it's phenomenal. The use of the drums and samples very nearly envokes a religious feeling in me. My props to Kanye for speaking on a hardly-touched subject in hip hop. It is ironic that he says: <br />\\"If I talk about god my record won't get played?\\" <br />And we all saw how much radioplay this song got. Very good either way. (4/5) <br /> <br />Never Let Me Down (feat. Jay Z) - I like the vocals West uses in the chorus, but honestly, what hurts this track is Jay's appearance. Nothing special about his verse, and he is overshadowed by Kanye without a doubt on this song. (3/5) <br /> <br />Get Em High (feat. Talib Kweli and Common) - This is a hype song done right. When the beat drops and Kanye spits his first two bars, sick is the only way to describe it. Kweli holds it as well, but Common sounds out of place. His verse sounds more like an unsharpened freestyle. Good otherwise. (4/5) <br /> <br />The New Workout Plan - Really hilarious. In step with the previous track, West provides some comic relief, talking about the desire of women to attain men (a prelude to Golddigger anybody?). The most unique beat on the album I think, good stuff. (4/5) <br /> <br />Slow Jamz (feat. Twista and Jamie Foxx) - Another smash hit. Before I heard this I had no idea Foxx could sing. If the beat doesn't make you move there's no soul in you. With everything we've seen so far, from comedy to pure lyricism to social commentary, West can make club hits too. (4/5) <br /> <br />Breathe In Breathe Out (feat. Ludacris) - This is one of my favorite songs on the album. The beat is pure fire, and West takes a shot at mainstream rap before breaking into his hype-filled wordplay: <br />\\"Golly, some more of that b******t ice rap I gotta apologize to Mos and Kweli <br />But is it cool to rap about gold if I told the world I copped it from Ghana and Mali? <br />...Always said if I rapped I say somethin significant <br />But now I'm rappin bout money, h**s, and rims again.\\" <br />Brilliant stuff, and Ludacris really brings it on the hook. (5/5) <br /> <br />School Spirit - The chorus is hot, and the same goes for the beat, except I notice West uses the same drum samples for several of his songs (the ones used here are the exact same as he used for Ludacris' \\"Stand Up\\", and I've heard him use them on other tracks as well). That said, we hear more about Kanye's view of school, and how he achieved success without it. My problem with this is the example it sets for kids, possibly encouraging them to follow West's path and become school dropouts themselves. Mr. West, your words have tremendous power, use them wisely. (3/5) <br /> <br />Two Words (feat. Mos Def and Freeway) - A real hardhitting and powerful beat, that vocal sample brings chills. I really like the rhyme pattern the MCs use in their verse (using two words as the title entails). Real good to hear Mos on the album, very good song. (4/5) <br /> <br />Through The Wire - We finally get to hear from Kanye firsthand about the accident that he's referred to throughout the album. As an MC myself, I really admire Kanye for actually recording a song with his jaw wired shut. His words sound very sincere, feeling remorseful towards his mother and his girlfriend for what they went through as a result of the accident. Much respect to him for giving props to the seatbelt. He uses the Chaka Khan sample to perfection. (5/5) <br /> <br />Family Business - It's uncommon to hear an MC talking about their family like this. West gets candid with us: <br />\\"You ain't have to tell my girl I used to pee in the bed.\\" <br />His words are heartfelt, and the beat makes me feel reminiscent. Great song. (5/5) <br /> <br />Last Call - Kanye shares his thoughts on being with the Rocafella camp and the process of working nonstop until he was signed. Many have deemed West cocky, and I agree, some things he has said have been over the top. West himself expresses: <br />\\"I use my arrogance as a steam to power my dreams.\\" <br />West's personality aside, you cannot deny the power of his music. (4/5) <br /> <br />And so we've come to an end. West has taken us ona journey through problems with school, sexual desires, faith in religion, ambition (or lack of in some cases), hope, arrogance, love, fear, excitement, tragedy and family, all on the same album. Despite a few bumps along the road, mainly created by lacking guest appearances and West taking things a little too far in some cases, this album is a masterpiece. West remains lyrically powerful, and his messages are always clear and relevant throughout the album. The College Dropout is worthy of being placed alongside albums like Nas' Illmatic, Biggie's Ready To Die, and De La Souls' Stakes Is High. It is that good. In an age where rappers use their position in the public eye for so little, Kanye's voice is one that needs to be heard.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|While some are hailing this as the return of pearl jam the fan's of the band know that they never left and have been putting out great music even after '94. It must also be said that this is the band's best work since their masterful album \\"No Code\\".  <br /> <br />The thing that's different on this release than the band's last couple of release's is that this one doesn't have any filler. Every song is great. Cannot say that about too many albums I own. It rocks hard and also caresses gently. From the the fast rocker \\"comatose\\" to \\"come back\\", pj really found a good balance on this album. Here's my song by song review:  <br /> <br />Life Wasted, great lyrics and rocking music. Definitely a good opener.  <br /> <br />World Wide Suicide, while I'm sure most have heard this one on the radio already it is still one of the best on the album. Great lyrics from eddie.  <br /> <br />Comatose, the opening makes you immediately think of \\"the who\\", one of the best rockers pj has made since the Vs. album. I wouldn't be suprised to see this one make it to radio, especially with it clocking in at just over two minutes.  <br /> <br />Severed Hand, tell's the story of a man going to a shaman for an out of this world experience. Excellent lyrics and the album keeps in form with another rocker. One of the best on the album for sure. One of the best pj songs ever for that matter. <br /> <br />Marker in The Sand, reminds me of \\"betterman\\". I don't think anyone could complain about that. A great catchy chorus hear and also strong verse lryics. Some of the best eddie has written in a while. Sounds somewhat of a prayer..\\"God, what do you say? I'm calling out! What do you say?\\". Great lyrics from ed here. <br /> <br />Parachutes, this one will catch you off guard. If comatose is the who rocker then this is the beatles love song. Something different from the band at it works really well.  <br /> <br />Unemployable, lyrics that I'm sure most people that work for a living can relate to. The only song I really can't get into on the album but it's far from bad.  <br /> <br />Big Wave, I'll admit I didn't like this song at first but it's kinda cool after a couple of listen's. Lyrics are decent and music is average.  <br /> <br />Gone, starts of dark sounding and just explodes into a big chorus. The best song off of this album in my opinion. Great lyrics and the music matches them perfectly. Reminds me of \\"In Hiding\\" with the soaring vocals. Two thumbs up on this one. <br /> <br />Life Wasted Reprise, 53 seconds long. I think it would have worked well as a prelude..maybe the album opener. Pretty good for being so short. Just repeats the chorus from it's namesake song.  <br /> <br />Army Reserve, awesome lyrics and a big chorus. Definitely have to sing along to this one. Another masterful song. \\" <br /> <br />Come Back, wow. This song is awesome. Bluesy and soulful. One of ed's best vocal performances in quite sometime. Once again proves that pearl jam can do a heck of a lot more than just big stadium rockers. Not quite as good as yellow ledbetter but has the same bluesy feel to it. Going to be great in concert for sure. A little long on the album though. <br /> <br />Inside Job, slow build up into a great song. Written by mike mccready and I must say he did a great job. It kind of reminds me of \\"immortality\\" the way it starts out quiet and just builds into a huge sound. A great album closer.  <br /> <br />I don't see this album as putting pearl jam back on the map (that they never left) but more of an album that proves they have been making great music all along if people would only stop and listen.  Buy this album. <br />
B000ERU5EK|5.0|This CD really shows how great music can be made in trance. How come it has not really caught on in the US? Well it is inexplicable given quality albums like this. If you want a preview of all the tracks download, their preview podcast on iTunes, it is quite good. Something like the audio version of a DVD movie with commentary, and it is a full 25 minutes long! The podcast really gives you the idea of the motivation behind each song, that each song is not just a bunch of random words thrown to a danceable beat. The trance beats and vocals are inspired by emotions that a lot of music is inspired by: lost love, fear, despair, hope. My favorite tracks are \\"World on Fire\\", \\"Alone Tonight\\", and \\"Hey You\\", which the group helpfully says hey can be replaced by any four letter word you wish to substitute. Also \\"Air for Life\\", which won at the Miami WMC Global Trance Awards this year, and was rated as the best track on Armin Van Buuren's State of Trance radio broadcasts last year. A quality purchase for anyone new to trance and any experienced trance addicts who want a very diverse album.
0553213105|4.0|This review was written by my class's literature circle group:<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen, was a humorous tale of love and drama. It all starts when Mr. Bingley, a rich man moved to town. His friend, Mr. Darcy, moves in with him. When they attended a ball they meet Elizabeth Bennet, a very prejudice woman, and the story changed drastically.  Will they ever set aside there differences? Will they ever fall in love...?<br /><br />In this book the characters vary a great deal in their personalities. Elizabeth Bennet is the very prejudice character.  She often will voice her opinion but she normally won't show her true feelings when she likes someone. Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy is very proud; partly because he is rich and partly because he is very argumentative. He, like Elizabeth, doesn't show his true feelings toward someone. Jane Bennet is the character that is always in a good mood and tries to see the silver lining of any problem. Mr. Bingley is a rich man who is good natured and is a very welcoming person. He has very good manners and is very gentleman like. All of theses characters make this a very unique, well thought-out book. The author, Jane Austen, makes this story believable because things that happen in this story are just like real life.<br /><br />The plot of this story was definitely the love and drama of life.  It shows the tough spots you can have in life.  An example of the main theme was when Mr. Darcy tells Elizabeth he loves her and his affection is denied by the young girl. This book shows how life isn't perfect. There is definitely going to be rough patches along the way. That is why this book is so great, is because it isn't a fairy tale where every thing is perfect. That is why we believe this book is such a wonderful classic.<br /><br />The main style of Pride and Prejudice is old English. The author,<br /><br />Jane Austen, made this very clear early on. Some of the things that happen during this book, because of the style, leaves great pictures in your head. Jane keeps you interested in this book by making believable when she uses real life situations. That is what makes this book a one of a kind story.<br /><br />  We rated the book Pride and Prejudice around 4 stars. The old English language in this book is harder to understand and must be fully understood. The many humorous parts in this book help make it a classic. Jane Austen helps you connect to the women's point of view in the 1800's. The author did very well on this book by showing how to love and be loved. We would recommend this book to anyone who can understand the style of Pride and Prejudice. This book is not only for the women, but wonderful for men, because in our book circle we have four boys and they each enjoyed this book as much as the girls did. This book is  truly a timeless classic that can be enjoyed by all.

B0001US62I|5.0|As far as film making goes, there was not a great deal of attention to detail in this one.  Look for modern-era cars in the 1955 street.  There was no Mickey Mouse club ('Wednesday is \\"Anything-can-happen Day\\"') when this story took place.  In spite of this, the movie is one of the best, if not THE best, \\"Devil\\" pics around.
B0001HAISG|5.0|I am Hannah (age 9)and I think this is a cool movie. I enjoyed this movie very much.Good acting. This director is good so buy it now!
B000CNFC76|5.0|Take a bit of the golf spirit in The Legend of Baggar Vance and the nostalgia in Seabiscuit; shake them in a bag; and you have a great nostalgic sports drama.  That is exactly what this movie portrays.  A young boy follows his dream despite being told that he does not fit according to the societal values of the time.  This movie blends the right amount of historic perspective, excitement, and great sports drama.  The acting was superb.  The movie set and scenery likewise were well presented.  As an added bonus, this movie is based on a true story.  I am not a golfer, but I think golfers will really enjoy this movie along with the historic extras on the DVD.  Super flick.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Plain and simple, Pearl Jam have been releasing quality albums for years, which pretty much is only known by those really following the band closely.  However, there is something different with this album that we haven't seen in the last few years.  There is an edge and an appeal that's present with this album that I think will draw casual observers in.  Eddie and the guys rip it up on this very solid effort, and you get a very good vibe after the first two or three tunes, and, it get's better with each track.  The tour will be incredible.  Many will call it a comeback, but it really doesn't apply.  Buy this album.  Long live PJ.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have had plenty of time since the release of Lateralus to get deeply acquainted with the many sides of Tool. If there's anything that can be said it is that each album is immensely unique in its own right, and despite a common thread connecting each it simply does not do one justice to criticize it based on any other. Furthermore, the idea that anyone can dismiss a Tool album without giving it enough time to discover the depth and complexity it holds is asanine; think about what you're saying -- are you really disappointed that Tool isn't immediately accessible? Shame on you.    Like a previous reviewer stated, hearing the leak is not the way to approach this album. Any loyal fan should know better, as I know personally I have indirectly waited for this day for five years now... two weeks is nothing. On top of that I was able to get tickets to one of the upcoming shows that sold out 5,000 seats in one minute. My point is that this album could not have been built up on a higher pedestal.     Nonetheless, I heard 'Vicarious'. At first I was more confused than anything; yes, the instrumentals were all there, but the vocals sounded more characteristic of Maynard on A Perfect Circle than Tool (I'm not one of those people who blurs the edge between the two... I don't compare Tool to APC but I do compare Maynard to Maynard). Still, I gave it time, and after a few listens I knew '10,000 Days' would require patience but I couldn't wait to get started.    So here we are. I don't know what all the gripe is about the quality of the album art; it's 3-D Alex Grey, what more could a Tool fan want? And here's an interesting note: as an English major, we're taught that we view text (including songs/lyrics) through unconscious 'lenses' or theoretical perspectives. That's an intriguing metaphor when Tool includes stereoscopic lenses to view the album art... as if saying, 'Here; look at our album in a different perspective'. But the esoteric spiritual artwork is a bit decieving: thisalbum is much more carnal than I expected. It is possibly their darkest album, filled with turmoil of the basest emotions. My first time listening I got the feeling that something was trapped inside and desperate to get out. It is a completely different style both lyrically and instrumentally. There's also a lot of noise about how much 'filler' the album has, when in fact it's the 'filler' that stands out and adds the most atmosphere to the album. I'm not going to critique each song, but there are elements that are both reminiscent of the Tool you know and love and then those that go beyond expectations -- like the electronic percussion of 'Intension'.     For those who doubted, the album is real and it's here: stop complaining and get over it. Don't be discouraged after a few listens; if it didn't take any work to appreciate then it wouldn't be Tool. As one reviewer said, 'It's not what you've been expecting, but it's exactly what you've been waiting for.'
0393317552|5.0|I started this book interested in the scientific foundation of the development of human societies.  Jared Diamond does an excellent job of distilling the vast complexity of development into a few manageable trends.  He uses a compelling mix of data from around the world to illustrate that these major themes are responsible for much of the variety we see today. <br /> <br />In contrast to the statements by some reviewers, he does not arbitrarily ignore the role of other individual factors; instead, he suggests that these factors represent small variations in the larger trends.  It is possible for an individual to accelerate or slow the development of technology (or any other major trend), but an individual alone cannot reverse the overall trend of technological development. <br /> <br />In a more specific example that has occasionally been attacked, Diamond suggests (I believe correctly) that the unification of China, by limiting the potential for competition among individual states, was the aggregate trend responsible for slowing China's technical progress.  The fact that a single Chinese Emperor disallowed a particular technology did not make that individual the critical factor; other kings tried to do the same thing in a fragmented Europe and failed.  Instead, the failure of an edict by the European King to slow technological progress was due to the fragmented and competing nations in Europe, not the particular virtues (or lack thereof) of the individual.  In this sense, individuals may be the proximate cause of many events, but it is the macro-circumstances which are largely responsible for their success and the fact that their actions have been recorded in the annals of history. <br /> <br />While the science was interesting and compelling, I found the history of the migration and displacement of human populations the real eye-opener.  Our modern history records, with much moral fervor, the subjugation of Native American, South African, and Australian populations by European conquerors.  This book reminds us that these are only the most recent chapters in a human history full of such displacements.  South Chinese into the islands of the south pacific, North Chinese into south China, Black Western Africans into the southern half of Africa, and only more recently the better known European conquests.  More amazingly, the book does not make a moral judgment on any of these events; instead, it unemotionally tells the story of human history.  Indeed it even helps us understand why the Europeans were so successful in the regions where they are now the dominant population and so unsuccessful in other regions. <br /> <br />This book is not light reading, but I believe it successfully rises above modern racism and politically correct debate to address the major trends which have shaped the human populations of our planet.  Do not read this book for solutions, it has none.  Read the book so that you will understand the problems which you wish to understand or solve. <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|Wow. This album is so diverse. And so weird.<br /><br />It's quite the masterpiece, no matter how jumbled up it is in order. Unlike many rock and roll fans, I utterly detest the lyrics --nonsense for the sake of nonsense isn't really my cup of tea. \\"Glass Onion's\\" opening lyric makes me want to vomit.<br /><br />But all the accomplishments this album has help me see past the lyrical standpoint. There is a vast collection of soft, heavy, slow, and upbeat songs that helped define music for the next forty years. \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"Birthday\\", \\"Yer Blues\\", \\"Everybody's Got Something to Hide Except for Me and My Monkey\\", and \\"Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da\\" are incredibly fun, and are very instrumentally diverse. All of these recordings have so much packed into them, without sounding squashed!<br /><br />Vocal melodies on \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", and \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" will blow you away. Oh, and \\"Revolution 9\\" is good for any indie-artsy avante-garde kids.<br /><br />Musically, \\"Revolution\\" is the best, most complex composition, and works the best in my mind.<br /><br />That's all.<br /><br />Buy this album! It's epic album of the world's epic band!
0446677450|1.0|The most disturbing thing about this book was what appeared to me to be a spirit of meanness and an attitude of downright contempt toward his real father for being poor.  In addition, I don't think the useful concepts are well explained or in other cases completely explained.  Overall, I think this book is a poor oversimplification of the wealth process that has probably done more harm than good.  If you want something that is more edifying, but still fairly simple with some useful straightforward advice try \\"Secrets of the Millionaire Mind\\" by Eker.  I'm also sure you will find many other useful titles scattered throughout other reviews of this book.  I actually got a bit physically ill when I read this book, which sums up my overall opinion of this author's work.
B000002TLX|5.0|Richard Marx is fantastic.  His voice is beyond description.  He is so underrated when he shouldn't be.  His music is stunning (and he pretty much writes it all) and that combined with his voice is a fantastic combination.   <br />This cd is full of some great songs.  Some weren't as big as hits as his fans think they should have been, but there are a few number ones (Right Here Waiting etc).  My favourites here are Endless Summer Nights, Should Have Known Better and Touch Of Heaven (from what I think is his best album ever - Flesh and Bone) and Until I Find You Again.  The song Keep Coming Back has background vocals by the late great Luther Vandross so of course I love that, but I'm telling you - Richard Marx is so fantastic, you have to treat yourself to this cd by one of the best singers ever.
0060763280|3.0|Harv Eker does a good job of describing the inner game of creating wealth.  What I most like about this book is that it is focused on some good core values.  For example, one of the wealth principles says, \\"If your motivation for acquiring money or success comes from a non-supportive root such as fear, anger, or the need to \\"prove\\" yourself, your money will never bring you happiness.\\"  I think that's a true statement and a pretty good message to be putting out along with all the other advice on becoming wealthy.  It provides balance and this is one of a number of examples of similar responsible statements.  I very much believe it is possible to become wealthy serving others and the communities in which businesses operate.  Unfortunately, it is also possible to become wealthy and leave a path of devastation behind.<br /><br />Admittedly, many of the ideas in this book are very simple and even clich?s.  However, it is entertaining and gives one a sense of what it takes to get wealthy and how to do it without compromising important values.  While the advice is simple, the application can be very difficult.  I think the golden rule falls into this category.  The deeper question is how can I live up to the golden rule?  In a similar way, Eker leaves me wanting to know more about how one would rise to the occasion and change deep-seated behaviors that undermine a person's ability to apply the simple principles he describes.<br /><br />Ideally, I would love to see everyone who reads this book also read \\"American Mania\\" and perhaps \\"A Brief History of Everything.\\"  I think having more money implies having more responsibility to use it wisely.  I think the same can be said of technology.  Technology is great in its place, but a society must have the wisdom to use it to its advantage.  As we all know, more technology in itself doesn't always improve a situation.  This aspect of the technology game is often neglected as is the ethical aspects of acquiring wealth.  I applaud this author for keeping some of these things in mind while providing some good practical advice on increasing one's net worth.<br /><br />If you are interested in the metaphysics underlying economics, you might enjoy reading \\"Small is Beautiful\\" by Schumacher.  Other books that take an ethical approach to business practices include \\"The Ecology of Commerce\\" by Paul Hawken, \\"A Better Way to Think about Business\\" by Robert Solomon and Stewardship by Peter Block.  The subtitles of the last two books capture the essence of each of them well... A BETTER WAY TO THINK ABOUT BUSINESS - How Personal Integrity Leads to Corporate Success and STEWARDSHIP - Choosing Service Over Self-Interest.  It would be nice to get these things right so we can keep providing a great example for the rest of the world and leave it an even better place for those that follow us.d this author for keeping some of these things in mind while providing some good practical advice on increasing one's net worth. <br /> <br />If you are interested in the metaphysics underlying economics, you might enjoy reading \\"Small is Beautiful\\" by Schumacher.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|It is well about time for a new statement from the Seattle boys. Time to hit the road with a new album!  Eddie Vedder sounds raw and energized and his lyrics are full of piss and vinegar in as timely a fashion as ever.  Matt Cameron gets better each time out and really kicks it up a notch.  Clearly the right wing's attempt to hijack America has inspired the band to their best efforts.  The songs styles are very familiar, a tad too much so if the songs weren't so damned good.  The first two cuts are as good as any Pearl Jam album has ever opened with, the first with a blistering Stone solo and a headbanging crescendo, the second with a catchy hook that just screamed 'make me the single'!  The closers are the stylistic breakouts, a soul ballad that builds and builds followed by another ballad with lovely Mike-Stone-jeff interplay.  The closers show this band is still growing.  The lyrics show they have not forgotten their roots.  Very encouraging.
1896597890|4.0|Usually I am not a fan of graphic novels.  But as I do have an interest in North Korea and its lunatic regime, I could not help but be intrigued by a cartoonist writing of his experience there.  One cannot feel anything but sorrow for the poor people trapped in such a God-forsaken place.  Yet humor has always been used to illuminate serious situations and few places are more ripe for or deserving of ridicule than North Korea.    Delisle puts a humorous twist on the most absurd and dehumanizing aspects of life in Pyongyang.  Most notably, Delisle captures the atmosphere in which government propaganda is literally everywhere.  The most acclaimed museums in the nation are filled with knick knacks given to current head of state Kim Jong Il and his father Kim Il Sung, as well as obscure newspaper accounts of the two.  The radios are preset to state stations again filled with nothing but propaganda.  The movie studio regularly churns out movies about the bravery of North Koreans against the imperialist Japanese and Americans.  Delisle cannot escape the constant barrage even while sightseeing in the mountains, as an homage to the nation's dear leaders is chiseled into the side of a mountain itself.    Perhaps even more illuminating is the interactions Delisle has with his guide and interpreter.  Reading past the humor are some serious tidbits, as when Delisle lends his guide a copy of George Orwell's 1984 which Delisle has snuck into the country.  A couple weeks later, the guide almost soils himself when Delisle asks him what he thought of the book.  It does not take Sherlock Holmes to put some pieces together as to how the guide's superiors took his latest reading interest.  Other interactions are a bit spookier, as when Delisle asks what happened to a North Korean animator his guide mentions in passing.  No response is forthcoming.  In North Korea, such silence most definitely does not mean that the guy packed up and moved to South Beach.    The one question everyone has, including Delisle himself, is how much the citizens actually believe the propaganda not only that they hear, but that they repeat robotically.  In such a hermetically sealed society, there is no way to tell.  PYONGYANG may be a light and humorous book but it is about one seriously scary place.
2913903878|5.0|For the \\"Newbie\\" or the \\"Veteran\\" collector.  This is a wonderful reference showing great color pictures of nearly every piece of U.S. Military uniform and equipment.  The great thing about this guide is it explains and shows the differences in a particular piece comparing it to later issues of the same piece of equipment.  Lists items with pictures and dates of issue and use.  This book is invaluable in preventing a person for buying an item that maybe represented as original or from a particular year's production when it may in fact be a later version. I highly recommend this book.   Oh yeah...for those modelers that have trouble determining what colors to paint uniform items on their soldiers..this book is a godsend.

B000EHRVP6|1.0|As mentioned in so many other reviews,  why didn't I rent before buying!  Should have taken it as a clue when Blockbuster had only 2 rows of the movie that it wasn't worth the time.  Interestingly enough, the nudity, while ample, wasn't even that well done.  And in the context of  a horror movie, well, we tossed it in the trash (literally) after seeing it the first time.  $20 down the tube.  I wouldn't subject my worst enemy to this flick as it is probably against the Geneva Convention.  I would wait to see this movie until it hits the dollar racks (which shouldn't take more than a week or two).
B000EULJLU|5.0|Simply not enough can be said about this album. From it's opening track \\"Vicarious\\" this album grabs ahold of you and brings you directly into it's world. From there it's just a continuos spiral deeper into singer Maynard James Keenan's perception and mind with songs such as \\"10,000 Days(Wings Part 2)\\" which depicts the holy redemption of a damned soul embodied with sounds of thunder and rain.  Most of these songs have somewhat disturbing lyrical content which to most Tool fans is what we've come to expect.  From songs about the foretelling of the end of the world, to Maynard's confession of needing to watch violent television, to the lyrically brilliant track \\"The Pot\\" bashing upon the legal system that prosecutes drug offenders, these songs are a masterpiece and surely some of the best Tool has produced in many years and do not disappoint. This album is very infectious and will leave you wanting to listen to it more and more. This album is more or less an opera of sorts and is best listened from start to finish, I've found it sort of hard to just jump into the middle of it, it's a whole experience and needs to be taken in as one. I'd give it a good 4 or 5 all the way through listens before just going back to certain songs although it's pretty hard. This album is a must not only for the die-hard fans of Tool but fore someone who is just getting into them as well. This is the complete Tool experience for sure that will show you what they are all about. This is what we've been waiting for, for 5 years.
B00005JNEI|1.0|It's very easy for a director to twist truths to convey a particular point of view.  All Moore has to do is selectively focus on and magnify events and interviews that back up his point of view while ignoring massive evidence to the contrary.  And, hey while you're at it, why not only show clips of those you disagree with that are unflattering. <br /> <br />They should get some ugly close-ups of Moore stuffing his plump face with a Big Mac, food particles flying out of his mouth, and then have the caption underneath read, \\"Michael Moore supports corporations that are making our kids fat and destroying their health!\\"  Hey, other filmmakers could play the same game too... <br /> <br />There is so much evidence against Moore's points in this movie it's ridiculous. <br /> <br />Hardly a \\"documentary\\".  I might have given great review had it presented the topic without such an absurd left-leaning slant.  Please file it under the topic \\"Propaganda\\" not Documentary. <br /> <br />Maybe he should do some film work for Fidel Castro.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Like the other albums before it, 10,000 days is truly a work of art.  Amazingly, while most bands make one or two decent albums then try to \\"hang on,\\" Tool's albums just keep getting better. Not many bands seem to make music that appeals to your emotions anymore, but Tool does exactly that.  They make music you FEEL. Tool is one of the few \\"major\\" bands that doesn't seem to give a damn about commercialism, being played on the radio, or about how many albums they sell.  They seem to care about making art for its own sake.  Once again, they have succeeded.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|No doubt this is one beautiful movie to look at, that's where it ends. Fight scenes are so fast and all over the place you cant even keep up, it's flashing pictures going so fast it gives you a headache!!!!! And the plot, let's not even go there, because unless your some Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic you dont know whats going on, you feel like you walked in the middle of a story and your job is to figure it out. Sorry but unless your part of the Final Fantasy Zombie Fanatic FAN BASE you might wan't to stay clear of this one.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For anybody thinking about picking up this album, PLEASE DO! It is an amazing piece of art, but you do have to get used to it, at first many of you will be dissappointed, however, if you give it 5 or 6 listens, it will amaze you. <br /> <br />Songs to look for: <br />Vicarious, Wings for marie, 10,000 days, the pot, rosetta stoned, right in two <br /> <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and pick this bad boy up!
B00005JOYA|4.0|This was an interesting experience for me as it's the first time I've ever been in the position of a videogame fanboy seeing a movie adaptation of something I've gotten really into.  Considering the overall history of videogame movie adaptations, I was worried, but considering how cinematic Silent Hill was, I figured it wouldn't be that difficult to pull off.  However, when I saw the trailer and noticed that there would be a side-story involving people outside Silent Hill, I was heavily disappointed because one of the key things that makes Silent Hill the game so great is the fact that it feels utterly futile to think of any world outside of it.<br /><br />Well, my disappointment was misfounded, they actually did that sidestory pretty well, and it didn't affect the overall grade of the movie at all.  All in all, this movie exceeded my expectations for it, though it still left me craving for a little more.<br /><br />A big dilemma in the creation of this film is the fact that it seems almost required to hold some of those coded horror-genre elements that tend to be a turn-off to even the average film-goer: horror-film style acting (sure they can scream, but can they pronounce emotion otherwise?), some very campy dialog at points (Cop: \\"They say this town is haunted.\\"  protagonist: \\"I think they're right.\\" Audience: \\"Ughhh...\\"), and the decision over what would be more scary, to actually show the terrifying elements or allow the audience's imagination to go wild.  Sometimes it was successful, sometimes it wasn't.<br /><br />I can say this about it: it could have used a bit less audio, both in terms of dialog and music.  Sometimes it just felt like the music was making it less scary, and some of the expository dialog was pretty much unnecessary: most of the dialog between the male cop and the husband, or that moment when the protagonist looks at the smudge on her finger and says \\"Ash...\\"  Yeah, we know it's ash.  Now on with the imagery and off with the sound!<br /><br />Also, Pyramidhead's appearance was glaringly gratuitous, for no other reason than the plot didn't fully develop his character and thus he was pretty much there for the Silent Hill gamer fan to say, \\"All right now on with the good stuff!\\"  It must be noted, however, that it was some very, VERY good stuff, so his appearance wasn't totally wasted.<br /><br />But all in all, it gets enough of the mood, enough of the setting, and enough of the imagery in that it's a pretty decent film.  Enough might not be enough in that I would really like some more...  *HEAVY DUTY SPOILERS HERE* For a film with skin-ripping and barbed-wire raping, it seems to be pretty needlessly reserved in other parts, like pretty much refusing to show the entire crucified janitor *YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EYES NOW*.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|...PJ's sounds is unforgettable to any keen listener. This album, in my humble opinion, is the band's best work since Yield (my all-time favorite). The guitars and EV's unique vocals have made Pearl Jam the best album of 2006. I decided early on that I would not listen to any leaks on the Internet and I am glad I didn't. This album is worth all the hype and atypical promotion the band has been giving it. I know I will wear this CD out in no time as I have not stopped playing it yet. <br /> <br />My favorite songs so far: <br /> <br />Gone <br />Parachutes <br />Come Back <br />Marker In The Sand <br />Inside Job <br /> <br />Support the band that we all love by buying their new CD today. I mean, who else has been around for over 15 years with solid efforts on each record? (maybe Green Day)
B000ETQRCM|5.0|For once in a long while, the masses are correct: Pearl Jam has released their best album in ten years. While spectators are sure to draw the similar response, \\"Well, it's no Ten!\\" they will no doubt enjoy the raw energy and rusty distortion that has been lost since 1993's Vs.<br /><br /> This is an album of pure emotion.<br /><br /> As a fan of 2002's Riot Act, the simplicity of harmonies and the epic melodies that danced over guitarist Mike McCready's riff work or bassist Jeff Ament's subtle bass fills were gorgeous. \\"Love Boat Captain\\", albeit a ridiculous title, and \\"Can't Keep\\" became instant favorites, but admittingly this was an even softer side of Pearl Jam and one that had become even lighter than it's previous releases Binaural or Yield.<br /><br /> Stripped down and still moving ahead, Pearl Jam is nothing but the band.  This is their core, as it's album cover implies featuring half of an avocado with the empty hearth on the back. As an eighth studio release, this should have been their fourth or fifth-it sounds like it too.<br /><br /> Back is the punk rock energy that harkens on vintage 1991 grunge in songs \\"Comatose\\", \\"Life Wasted\\", and \\"Severed Hand.\\" \\"World Wide Suicide\\", their first successful single in a long time, brings the more recent political angle of frontman Vedder with his more melancholic rage. When he sings, \\"Medals on a wooden mantle/  Next to a handsome face/ That the president took for granted/ Writing checks that others pay\\", it comes out coughing rather than clean. Vedder's mumbling couldn't come at a better time when the world is so confused and headed toward disaster.<br /><br /> Pearl Jam also brings some lighter highlights that will eventually draw as crowd pleasers. The alternative, feel good, \\"Gone\\" chimes in at perfect timing and the \\"Wasted Reprise\\" will have everyone scratching their heads and wondering if this is a concept album. It's uplifting, soulful, and hopeful-can you say that about anything these days?<br /><br /> The album closes with the next \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\", \\"Inside Job.\\" Imagine the build up of \\"Freebird\\" without the fantastic guitar solos at the end, but still with the same feeling. Maybe throw in a little Zeppelin into the mix, there's definitely hints of it. The progression of the song is right out of a Nancy Wilson score for a Cameron Crowe film; it just takes your heart and warms it in the microwave.<br /><br /> Perhaps this is a concept album. The minimalist cover art might consider this a simple rock band which is maybe what Pearl Jam is trying to convey. They were labeled as grunge when they clearly drew from classic rock and since then they have maintained to stabilize their heritage without ever selling out.<br /><br /> They're revolutionary, they're rebellious, and stripped down they're what every rock band sets out to be. Perhaps this album is a concept of that. Whatever it is, it works and this is by far one of the best albums to come out in a long time for the band.<br /><br /> Pearl Jam fan or not, this one's for you, rockers.r\\", \\"Inside Job.\\" Imagine the build up of \\"Freebird\\" without the fantastic guitar solos at the end, but still with the same feeling.

B000AMJG4Y|3.0|First off... the cgi is absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Now to why this only got three stars from me. This movie is close to two hours long, and in that time I feel that there was almost no movement in the story. It is almost completely filled with overdone fight scenes, and in focusing on the fights there are places where you end up scratching your head because something just happens with no explanation as to how or why.<br /><br />Also the story itself is fairly flat. Where there was the oppertunity to have some depth, it wasn't exploited. This left me a little disappointed since I am a huge fan of the games, and I know that the story writers are capable of much more.<br /><br />In the end, if you're a fan if the FF series it's probably worth buying. Or if you really want to see excellent cgi, it's worth it. But if you don't play the games or have another reason to buy it you'll most likely be disappointed.
B000EULJLU|5.0|As none of us plebians here have authoritative say over how well you love and interpret this new offering from the best hard rock band on the planet, let it be said that whatever your interpretation, whatever YOU feel when you hear this album, then that is what it is for you, don't let any Amazon review change that or let it take anything away from this experience.  I bought the album at 8 am today and went home, couldn't believe the awesome packaging, what a treat to look through the sweet glasses at the amazing art while listening to kick ass hard core TOOL.  If you cannot appreciate this album then you have ADD and cannot sit still long enough to let this music seep in . . .  seriously you need to relax and let this one swarm around you.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Surprisingly I first watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail while I was in high school. Now when I say I was in high school, I mean I was actually sitting in English Lit class as a learning experience. Not surprisingly, this class was taught by the same teacher who gave away beer mugs, which he tried to convince everyone were milk mugs. Needless to say this was the greatest class I had in my educational career. <br /> <br />But the great thing about Monty Python I that it actually works on an educational level with high brow comedy that the uneducated may not get. There were plenty of references that dealt with obscure British history may not get so while watching it in class we would watch a scene and laugh at it's sophomoric humor, then the teacher would rewind it and point out the little things that us, the uneducated wouldn't get, then have a laugh at the deeper meaning. <br /> <br />Yet it is still the silliness that draws people to the Monty Python franchise, and there is plenty of that in the Holy Gail. In addition to the French dude that uttered the title phrase, some of my personal favorite parts are, the Black Knight who wouldn't die, the Holy Hand Grenade and the Knights Who Say Ni. And as part of the English Lit class, we learned the \\"Ni\\" was actually a curse word back in olden times, so for me that added to the humor of the scene. <br /> <br />And unlike virtually every DVD released, the all the extras are worth checking out and also boasts what I think is the only movie that offers for your listening pleasure a \\"Mono soundtrack in glorious old-fashioned mono!\\" Plus as an added bonus there is \\"A glorious 24 seconds absolutely free!\\" although don't ask me where that is from. There are also there rare audio commentaries that are actually interesting, one with Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones and another with John Cleese, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin. Also there a plenty of great documentaries, three sin-alongs, and a cast directory to keep track of how many characters each actor played. And if you can't get enough ridiculousness, you can watch the film in Japanese with English Subtitles as they search for the holy sake cup and even a Lego version of the film. No seriously, well at least a scene of them. And there's even an educational film on to use your coconuts. And really, what else do you need in your life?
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Luckily I woke at 7 this morning and was at the store by 8 AM to pick up the new self-titled Pearl Jam disc which has 12 brilliant tracks (+ 1 reprise) that even in my tired haze sounded impeccable.  As I lay on my bed, headphones on, bobbing my head and kicking my feet to the new Pearl Jam disc, I felt like I always have when a new album by them comes out: exhilerated.  It is difficult to imagine a world where I can't look forward to a great rock band like Pearl Jam coming out to save the day, to lift the stormy clouds that hang over mainstream music like a plague, forcing the mediocre into our lives and ears.  While all that fades away, each of these tracks will automatically be entered into the canon of great music.  Their raw talent is still with them, Eddie's smoking somehow hasn't taken his angelic thrash away and when you swirl Ament's ever intense slapping, McCready's unforgiving ripping, Gossards on-time crunching punch and Cameron's perfect rock-drum-blasting in with the lyrics that our whole world should be reading and heading, well, then you have my favorite band and their brand new album.  Thank you boys, I'll see you in Chicago.
B00000FCBC|2.0|Ok so now Metallica decides Hey lets ripe off some more people because we can't do our own stuff without it sucking! You do know that Dave from Megadeth wrote all of there good songs. Without Dave around they sucked!!!!! I have sat down and tryed to rock out with this one because one of friends had it and I would just like to for the most part this thing sucks!!!! The Misfit's song they did was the worst cover ever!!!!! Hell COF does a way better cover of a Misfit song. If your looking for some band like to make money off of other peoples work then get any of there cd's. Now if your looking for some real metal then go get everything from Slayer, Megadeth, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Dimmu, and even COF because these bands are way better then anything they have ever put out!!!
B000046PVN|5.0|I can easily give 5 Stars to one of John Williams best (my favorite) scores of all time.  This is the version of Williams' score you want to have.        Now...onto one of this summer's highly anticipated soundtracks, to accompany and enhance this summer's highly anticipated Super-blockbuster, releasing nationwide June 30th...\\"Superman Returns\\".  Composer John Ottman (another John) will be using a few of John Williams finest cues (including the majestic and powerful \\"Main Title March\\").  SoundtrackNet \\"scored\\" a \\"first-look\\" interview with the new composer...and here it is:     \\"When X-Men director Bryan Singer left the franchise to helm Superman Returns, he faced a difficult task. The project had been floating around the halls of Warner Brothers for almost a decade, and had seen such directors as Tim Burton, McG, Michael Bay and even Brett Ratner (X-Men: The Last Stand) on board. The various screenplays had been written over the years by folks like Kevin Smith and J.J. Abrams, but ultimately it was X2: X-Men United screenwriters Mike Dougherty and Dan Harris who would deliver the final product.      Singer also brought along his usual suspects (pun intended): cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, production designer Guy Dyas, costume designer Louise Mingenback, and of course editor/composer John Ottman. Starring as the \\"man of steel\\" is relative newcomer Brandon Routh, with Kevin Spacey playing his nemesis, Lex Luthor. After a lengthy shoot in Australia, during which time Ottman was editing dailies as they came in, the production moved back to Hollywood where Ottman buried himself in his work along with co-editor Elliot Graham. After a few months of editing, Ottman went back to Australia to help oversee additional photography. Upon his return, he dove back into the editing process until things had progressed enough so that he could finally swap his editor's hat for his composer's hat.    After months of writing (and editing), recording of the score began on April 10, 2006 at the Todd-AO Scoring Stage in Studio City, California. A 97-piece orchestra was led by orchestrator/conductor Damon Intrabartolo, and over the next two weeks (with a little break for the Easter holiday weekend), eight days of recording would ensue. In addition to the orchestral sessions, two choir sessions were planned: a sixty-person mixed choir, and an eight-person boys choir.    There has been plenty of rumor and speculation about whether Ottman would be using John Williams' classic theme from the original 1978 film, and in past interviews, it was made clear that he would certainly be using the main \\"Superman March\\". Now that the sessions have taken place, it's clear that Ottman also references the \\"Leaving Home Theme\\", the \\"Krypton Theme\\", and the \\"Lois Lane Theme\\" (aka \\"Can You Read My Mind\\"). In addition to that, Ottman wrote his own new themes, including one for Lex Luthor, and an emotional one for Superman.    Ottman's music team was comprised of the same gang that had worked with him on many of his previous films. Score mixer Casey Stone would make sure that the orchestra sounded crisp and clear. Larry Mah was in charge of ProTools recording. Music editor Amanda Goodpaster was assisted by Joe Bonn. In addition to Intrabartolo, Frank Macchia, Lior Rosner, Kevin Kliesch, John Ashton Thomas, Rick Giovinazzo and Jeff Schindler contributed orchestration duties.    During the first week of recording, many of the cues were of the dramatic and emotional variety, with the large-scale action saved for the second week, just to make sure things were running smoothly. With six hours of recording every day, progress through the score was going at a steady and productive pace.    During one of the bigger days, the original prologue and main titles were recorded. At the time, it was planned to be basically a re-creation of the original opening from the 1978 film, with the curtain opening, comic book intro, and then flying through space as the John Williams march played. (Things have changed now, and a new prologue will be recorded instead.)    It was during that time that director Bryan Singer showed up to the scoring session with lead actor Brandon Routh (Clark Kent/Superman) and Sam Huntington (Jimmy Olsen). Routh, who had played trumpet for years, was invited by the brass section to show a bit of his skills. (pictured left) In the end, he didn't play on the score, but was kind enough to pose for photos with Ottman, Singer, and the trumpet players.    Overall, things ran pretty smoothly during the sessions. There are about two hours of score in the film, and most of it was recorded in the two weeks scheduled. Thoughtfully, Ottman invited John Williams to visit the sessions, however due to the Juilliard Centennial celebration, he was unable to attend - but appreciated the offer. Two choir sessions were held at Warner Brothers. Led by Bobbi Page, the first was a mixed choir of sixty voices, and the second was an eight-member boys choir.    After the choir sessions, a B-orchestra session took place to record a bunch of smaller cues, as well as string overdubs. Also recorded was a bit of the Superman fanfare to place on top of the Warner Brothers logo at the front of the film - but it remains to be seen whether it will appear in the final film. (Ottman had recorded a bit of the X-Men theme to play on top of the 20th Century Fox logo, but it ultimately was never used.) It was a fast-paced session, starting at 7pm and running until midnight. They were able to get through it all, and celebrated at the end with champagne and cake.    A few days after they finished, a tiny recording session was held at the Eastwood Scoring Stage at Warner Brothers for some small source cues that will be heard in the background of the film, including a bluegrass tune that will be heard coming out of a small radio during a scene. George Doering (pictured right) performed multiple guitar instruments for the cue.     Currently, they are finishing up mixing the score at Warner Brothers, but there is still one more day of recording planned for early May. A few pick-up cues need to be recorded, as well the new prologue and a major sequence that was dropped from the film - but will be on the DVD release later this year. \\"I had written the score for this sequence early on,\\" explained Ottman, \\"and I was really looking forward to hearing it scored - but then we cut it out of the film and I didn't bother to record it - but now it turns out that we have to have it done by early June. It's a big expository musical journey, which I had used to set up themes that appear later in the film, and was a lot of work, so I'm glad it will be heard on the DVD!\\"    Combining a classic theme with original music isn't an easy task, and from what we've heard at the Superman Returns sessions, Ottman has written one of the largest scores of his career, and paid respectful homage to a film score classic. A score album is coming in June from Rhino Records, which will contain about an hour of music from Ottman's score, so stay tuned to SoundtrackNet, and look for a planned First Listen before the album is released.    ***The soundtrack to Superman Returns will be released on Rhino Records on June 27, 2006. The film opens three days later, on June 30th, in theaters.***    Special thanks to John Ottman, Damon Intrabartolo, Amanda Goodpaster, and Debi Streeter at Warner Brothers.\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|After 5 years waitting all I have to say is it's about time!!!! It was also well worth the wait. This tool cd comes witha 3-d book inside and that is a really cool part about it. The cd is also really good. It's kinda dif then all the other ones but still sounds like tool at the same time. All I have to say is this cd will be in my cd player for along time.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I've come and gone from the Tool camp as a fan.  When they peaked in popularity, I was too \\"hip\\" to like 'em and then I got over myself. Lateralus came out, Alex Grey perfectly conveyed the phenom vibe and I was back in.<br /><br />Now, we have 10,000 and I'm just going to say...nothing. It's another work of art that will have ALL metal and prog afficinados speechless.  And the packaging is beyond clever.<br /><br />'nuff said!

B000EMGAGW|4.0|Blood Money is solid from beginning to end. Ever since I heard the single \\"Put Em In Their Place\\" I've been waiting for the release of the album. The Cd Features 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, and Mary J. Blige. Production Ranges from Havoc(Most of The Album) , Sha Money XL, Alchemist, and Dr. Dre (Outta Control RMX). The production is good lyrics are not as good as in the \\"Imfamous\\",\\"Hell on Earth\\" or \\"Murda Muzik\\"  but way better than \\" Amerikas Nightmare\\",\\"Free Agents\\", and \\"Infamy\\".     Prodigy, steps his game up with powerful lyrics example:  \\"Yo, I was schooled by the hood, raised by the wolves  Trained by the pain, adopted by guerillas  Gotta tank for a car, ice for a arm  Got tattoos wit' skin and scars from brawls  Gotta buildin' for a crib, Manhattan for a backyard  Skyscraper ladies, they f*** me when they man gone  Kings of New York, I'm one of the few of those  Difficulties to come, it's gon' be funerals\\"      Havoc has always been better at making beats than spiting lyrics and thats no secret. But his hooks are still tight. His production is ill too, Examples in tracks like Speakin So Freely, Click Click, Give It To Me and It's Alright.    Track list:    Smoke It 4/5 nice beat, good way to start the album.    Put Em In Their Place 5/5 hot single. hot video. crazy beat. insane lyrics by prodigy.    Stole Something Feat. Lloyd Banks 3/5 prodigy has a good flow. havoc does a good hook but a rather anoying beat, but banks seems to be off.    Creep 5/5 good beat. 50 cent stops the singing and steals the show with some nice lyrics, some may consider the beat annoying but the lyrics by all 3 artist are hot.    Speakin So Freely 5/5 hot beat, with some hardcore lyrics.    Backstage Pass 4/5 hot beat, with ok lyrics but a rather weak hook and over used topic. im prety sure even though it dosen't say 50 cent is in this song.    Give It To Me Feat. Young Buck 5/5 hot beat. nice lyrics. most likely the second single.    Click Click Feat. Tony Yayo 5/5 hot beat (similar to Put em In Their Place). good lirycs the old yayo returns in here.    Pearly Gates Feat. 50 Cent 5/5 one of my Favorite songs in the album because of the nice beat. really nice hook by 50 and havoc. exept I do consider prodigy's verse ofencive. he should keep god out his mouth g-unit already has enough beef as it is but now they dissing gad and jesus.    Capital P, Capital H 4/5 regular mobb deep beat, stating their new names Havoc as Hollywood Hav and Prodigy as V.I.P.    Daydreamin 3/5 seems to boring for me. the beat sounds to me like a cheap version of candy shop. and lyrics are about how they were poor and now the hav money, power, and women. and now no longer need to dream about it.    The Infamous Feat. 50 Cent 5/5 the second single of the album. legendary mobb deep producer Alchemist produces a hot beat. Proigy rips it, 50 Cent does a nice hook, and Hav does his thang as well.    In Love With The Moula 4/5 not bad, the song is dedicated to their new found money, hence $$BLOOD MONEY$$.     It's Alright Feat. 50 Cent and Mary J. Blige not bad production is regular at best. MJB does a real nice job.     Bonus:  Hava A Party 5/5 hot PARTY song  Outta Control 5/5 good song. Ill beat.  Maybe 50 cent should have saved both of these, and added them to the album. Instead of releasing them on two diferent albums and then putting them here. It makes it look like they were just trying to take up space.    Top 5:    1.Creep  2.Put Em In Their Place  3.Pearly Gates  4.The Infamous  5.Speakin So Freely
B0000013GT|5.0|Yo the so called Ufo's and So called Greys enough said this Album is Serious
B000006NPY|5.0|I wouldn t write a review on this record unless it was a seriously good effort from SP, or if it were worth anyone s time to listen.  SP is worth anyone s time to listen, at anytime, and almost anyday    Like many, groups, they touch and taste different styles throughout their life as a ' group '.  And in this album it is very successful.    I happened to get to know this album as it came out in the summer of 98 as a friend and I embarked on a 3 week journey following the rest of the Grateful Dead ( known as the other ones ), from Atlanta, thorugh the east coast and then back to the middle west - where we were from.  That bit is, you could say a personal anecdote that to me is important.  Especially if my friend who travelled with me reads this .. ever.  ( I know you re out there somewhere Jeff = )    Tracks 1, 2, 5 and then 9 through the end are what many of us seek as musical bliss, or perfection ( to the ears - aural perfection ).    I wonder .. I  d love to meet B Corgan or interview him and see what made them turn in the path of electro pop ala Cocteau Twins, Talk Talk w lots of reverb.  It sounds good.  Like a nice refreshing change.    What events in their lives in that year and the preceeding made them choose those paths.    Comparing this album with others, there is no resemblance of anything prior.  No connection to Mellon Collie, or Siamese dream .. or Gish.  The only constant genious here is the songwriting, which is untouched throughout the album and their career, which begins in 1990 and stems up to the early 00 s.    I saw them live in 1991 and 93.  Ames and IA City respectively.  And their music carved a nice bunch of memories of me and friends in our late teens ( I m 31 now ), enjoying that time and then the 20 s.  And mainly a group ( SP )that was capable of sucking you in time after time with their irresistible style.  And D arcy was quite irresistible also = )  Apologies to D arcy s husband on that one.    God bless SP
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has been missing from us for quite some time now as Maynard went off to work on his other group Perfect Circle to make some angry political music.  Now, Tool is back and better than ever.   <br /> <br />When Vicarious first blared onto the airwaves on the local alt rock channel, I was enthralled.  Heavy, competent drumming, terrific guitar riffs, and Maynard's voice and lyrics mixed to form a song that not only is heavily terrific, but also lyrically important.  Things don't let down, either, as Vicarious ends and Jambi begins, keeping the pacing and the feel blistering. <br /> <br />Of course, it's Tool and there are 11 minute songs; two in fact.  Some people will like it some won't.  I do think the 11 minute songs here are more exciting to listen to than some of their long songs from the past.  They change it up a bit when it comes to The Pot.  The Pot is a great song that begins with Maynard's voice and it is a very interesting listen.  I really like the feel of the song.   <br /> <br />If there is one sore spot for me, it is the dreadfully long and uninteresting last song, Viginti Tres.  Less a song than atmospheric sounds, it is the only song I don't really care for.  However, I'm sure I'm in the minority.   <br /> <br />Overall, though, 10,000 Days welcomes back Tool with thundering sounds.  It is probably my favorite of their albums, overall.  While there are songs from earlier albums I like better, I haven't been as enthralled from beginning to end (well to the penultimate song) with a Tool album since Undertow.
B000EQ4G5K|1.0|Before discussing the beastly new album by Rihanna, let's just reflect on her propitious debut album Music of the Sun.  Though it did have a couple garish tracks, Rihanna defined \\"Music of the Sun\\" with reggae-inspired songs all full of vim and vigor.  Even if you only heard her radio hits, it was incontestable that songs like \\"Pon de Replay,\\" \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want,\\" and \\"Let Me.\\"  Nonetheless, Rihanna's new anthem \\"SOS\\" exemplifies the type of under-produced music on A Girl Like Me. <br /> It was hysterical reading fans' reviews of this craptastic album, as they claimed many more genres were explored on this album than the last, or that her voice is reaching new heights, or other lies.  The truth is there are probably 4 tracks that are even plausibly acceptable.  The rest of the album reeks more and more with each awful second that passes.  I haven't heard an album this bad since former American Idol William Hung's Inspiration, which was, at the very least, laughable.  A Girl Like Me isn't a laughing matter at all. <br /> A Girl Like Me is like heaven for the cynically inclined - appalling production, horrendous lyrics, heinous vocals, and loathsome impersonations.  Seal would be embarrassed after hearing \\"Final Goodbye,\\" Rihanna's faux-imitation \\"Kiss From A Rose.\\"  The possible club joint \\"Break It Off\\" features an indifferent Sean Paul shouting random lyric over an overly digitalized beat.  Why did Rihanna feel inclined to include to remix \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\"?  For some reason, I think a Casio piano and midi samples were a major part of the production.  The worst track on this album (though it is debatable) is coincidentally Rihanna's next single \\"Unfaithful.\\"  The lyrics \\"I feel it in the air/ as I'm doing my hair\\" should tell all without me having to point out the whiny vocals or the overdramatic piano and simulated violins.  Or maybe the worst three minutes of my life were spent listening to \\"A Million Miles Away,\\" which features a piano and guitar duet (as many other songs do).  The difference here is that this song would have been a real power ballad if it hadn't been for the fact that Rihanna was singing it.  Her vocals wreak havoc upon this poor defenseless song. <br /> Reggae was a major production tool with Rihanna's debut CD.  However, every single attempt at reggae on this album fails.  \\"Dem Haters\\" is just boring.  Rihanna attempts a bit of slow ska on \\"Selfish Girl\\" and \\"Crazy Little Thing.\\"  Attempts.  Both songs sound like futile versions of No Doubt's \\"Underneath It All,\\" lacking an energetic horn line (as well as energy altogether), not to mention actual instruments, and pleasing vocal harmonies.   <br /> After all of that harping, decent songs (though few) do exist on A Girl Like Me.  \\"Kisses Don't Lie\\" is a relaxing flashback to Music of the Sun with its reggae influence and bright chorus.  Formidable bass supports the amiable acoustic guitar and reminiscent Rihanna's nostalgic tone in \\"We Ride.\\"  A luscious flute fits compactly into the aforesaid musical formula during \\"P.S. (I'm Still Not Over You).\\"   <br /> So, what did I learn from wasting my time on A Girl Like Me?  Rihanna's can't sing, write lyrics, and doesn't know what a good song sounds like since she has turned the art of making music into an unimaginative color-by-number portrait.  I have also learned that I would never want anything to do with a girl like Rihanna ever again.
B00005MP58|5.0|Most people have seen at least one version of Pride and Prejudice and this is a very enjoyable one. It's a little long as it was a mini series rather than a movie but because of the length, there is more detail. Colin Firth makes the BEST Mr. Darcy. Smoldering and broody and very very attractive.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is not an album which many tool fans will instantly like. But having listened to it quite a number of times now, I'll have to say that it does grow on you.  <br /> <br />The feel of this album is very different compared to their last album Lateralus, often reminescent of Aenima instead. There are a lot of lush soundscapes here - the segues and songs like Intension, Wings for Marie and 10000 days. At the same time it hits you full force sonically in songs like Vicarious, Jambi, The Pot and Rosetta Stoned. This is a rollercoaster of an album, exploring diverse themes and sounds, at times even intentionally referencing their past work. Tool have never sounded like this, with lots of experimentation in the vocals, drumming and even the guitar (e.g talk box in Jambi).  <br /> <br />As usual, Danny's drumming is at its monstrous best, while Justin's bass work has risen up another notch. My current favourites from this album are Jambi, 10000 days, The Pot and Rosetta Stoned. In sum, this is a very intense album, requiring a lot of patience and an open mind from its listeners.
B000E1ZBGS|2.0|I love Pride and Prejudice.  It is one of my favourite books and I must have read it at leat 10 times (so far!!!).  The BBC adaptation was just perfect.  This film was just neither here nor there.  I hated the drab set I don't know where they got the idea of the wandering pigs and geese, the Bennets lived on an estate not a farm.  and they were gentle folks not farmers.. their future problems would have stemmed from the estate being entailed after Mr Bennets death not from poverty during his life.  Keira Knghtely was just plain silly and McFadden just a sulk not a proud man.  I hate adaptations that think they know better than original creator... if you don't like Ms Austen's handiwork.. just go ahead and make your own.. just don't call it Pride & Prejudice!!..  Give me the BBC version any time!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|This album marks the return of Pearl Jam that I thought disappeared on the Riot Act album. I found myself liking almost every song on this album within the first couple listens. Every member truely shines here. Eddies vocals are amazing, Stone, mike and jeff are tearing it up on the strings and Matt is really rocking on the drums. I feel that this is the album that should have come after VS or at least come after Binaural.
0321344758|5.0|This book was well written and has excellent examples.  It's an easy read so it's easy to pass around the office.  It was nice to give this book to 2 fellow employees who were on the task force to update our site.  After reading it, we all were on the same page.  I've read many books on designing web sites and this one was the best.
B000EMGAGW|2.0|Seriously people wake up Mobb Deep have not had a good album since \\"Hell On Earth\\". Prodigy is a much better producer than rapper and Havoc....give me a break.This Album will sell because its on G-Unit and thats the whole point but as far as skills Mobb Deep hasn't been the same since Pac ripped them a new one and that was 10 years ago. So if you are a Mobb Deep fan I don't know what you're complaining about this album sounds like all the garbage they've put out this decade.
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is easily Nirvana's best effort. It blows away Nevermind by a million miles. The guitars are heavier, dirtier, and less calculated. Kurdt really disliked the production to Nevermind and wanted a less polished album. Well that is exactly what they got. The album is nearly perfect but beautifully flawed. In Utero starts out with the tuneful Serve the Servants and then flies right into their heaviest song Scentless Apprentice, which is one of my favorites. Rape Me is an absolute classic and I always enjoy playing it on my guitar. Another awesome track Frances Farmer describes how well Nevermind could have been if it was less produced. Nevermind is still a great album, but it does not come close to In Utero. If you don't have this album get it now!
B000EULJLU|2.0|This album is ok for Tool, it has like 3 good songs, but the rest is mostly the ambient/experimental stuff that they used as filler before.  On 10,000 days, there are only 5 actual songs out of 11.  Opiate was a good, raw start to Tool's music.  Aenima was in my opinion their best, full of mysterious ambient rock songs.  Lateralus was a very impressive album, very precise and uniquely stylish.  10,000 Days kind of sounds as if Tool just spent a couple of weeks in the studio rehashing the styles of Lateralus and Opiate together...not very impressive.
B000002B2T|5.0|The combination of Layne Staley and Mark Lanegan on the songs I'm above and Long Gone Day still send chills down my spine today. Hell, I thought Jerry Cantrell complimented Layne extremely well, but with Mark it was something else. Layne and Mark Lanegan were my two favorite vocalists of the Seattle era. Mad Season's above has a classic metal and hard rock feel to songs like Lifeless Dead, X-Ray Mind, and I don't know Anything. The musicianship of Mad Season is as awesome as anyone can expect. My personal favorite River of Deceit is simply one of the best songs Layne even sung. I wished like many others that there was another album from this supergroup. Great album, just about as good as AIC at their peak period 1992-1994. It ranks with one of the best recordings of 1995. It would have been nice if Mark and Layne would had done a project together. For anyone who bashes this album for not rocking hard enough, don't compare this to AIC. Judge this album on its own merit!
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Heath Ledger proved his versatility as an actor in 2005 by playing very diverse characters in four different movies. Hot off the heels of his gay cowboy role in the 1960s in Brokeback Mountain, he went on to portray one of the world's greatest lovers of women in Casanova. With his matinee idol good looks, Ledger is well-cast in this role.<br /><br />Ledger has a lot of fun with the role, much in the same way Johnny Depp did in Don Juan DeMarco. He gets to play a legendary seducer of women and showcase a deft touch for light comedy. Sienna Miller also does a good job as Ledger's romantic foil. Up until now she has had small roles in films like Alfie and Layer Cake but it is this role that finally gives this up and coming actress some serious screen time. The comic irony is that Francesca's suitor is played by the very unromantic acting and awkward looking Oliver Platt. Of course, he doesn't stand a chance against the dashing and witty Ledger.<br /><br />Casanova explores the conflict between marrying for love and marrying for what others want. He is torn between marrying for business so that he can stay in Venice and following his heart which lies with Francesca. She is torn between marrying a man that will get her family out of debt but whom she does not love. Despite their pragmatic exteriors they are ultimately romantics at heart. Hallstrom has made another pleasant period romantic comedy a la Chocolat, although not quite as endearing as that film. Casanova is a well-made piece of entertainment.<br /><br />\\"Creating an Adventure\\" takes a look at the making of Casanova. They shot the film entirely in Venice which had not been done in 35 years, even shooting in some places for the first time.<br /><br />\\"Dressing in Style\\" examines the gorgeous costumes made for the movie. Inspiration was taken from classic period paintings. This department also had the daunting task of dressing over 400 extras for some scenes.<br /><br />\\"Extended Sequence - `Hidden in Plain Sight'\\" features additional footage of Casanova and Francesca on the run from the Bishop's men.<br /><br />\\"Visions of Venice\\" takes a look at this historic city. Much of its classic look has been preserved so exploring it is akin to going back in time.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Lasse Hallstrom. He mentions what was shot on location and what was done on a soundstage which tends to get tedious after awhile. This is a fairly bland track that could have been better if he had someone else to play off of.ain Sight'\\" features additional footage of Casanova and Francesca on the run from the Bishop's men. <br /> <br />\\"Visions of Venice\\" takes a look at this historic city.

B000001F3C|3.0|U2 wanted to broaden their musical horizons and vary their styles. U2 does make a very talented and varied record with War. Instead of putting out the blockbuster everyone says this is supposed to be, War just finds U2 in transistion sounding at times confused and unfocused. Sunday Bloody Sunday gets my hopes up and it is my all time favorite U2 song. Seconds and New Years Day keep the hope alive. The next two are pretty good and I am still optimistic this will be great. Well my jaws drops when I hear the second half of the album, just horrible. Refugee is a genuine attempt at something different, but fails miserably. Bono sounds awful and the instrumentation is all over the place. Two Hearts beat as one contains no real melody that is complete. The rest of the album is rather forgettable. War makes a valiant attempt establish U2 as a band who will be around for a long time. This feels like they were not sure what direction they wanted to take. They would struggle to find their niche until their breakthrough Joshua Tree. I am a U2 fan and owned war, so get the album you will probably love this album. I am one of the few that just was not sold on War. Not a bad album, but I wished it was better.
B000ETQPYM|3.0|This is a unique tale of love, death, and the cruel and healing sides of the passing of time.<br />I found it sad, tender and hopeful. The story of Holly is a love story; but her love life seems to be over on the very first page; however, we get to see glimpses of the love and the life she had when her husband Gerry still lived. Gerry left her a \\"list of things to do\\" to help her get by and put her life back together when he was no longer with her. This list he carefully crafted and mailed to Holly's parents' house before dying, will force her to face life, let her grief go and it'll warm your heart and make you sad but it'll inspire you and make you think of the many things you would do to lessen the heartbreak of the ONE you love for as long as you remain breathing.<br />This book makes you feel human, vulnerable, surprised and full of faith in those tiny miracles of love.
B000006045|5.0|With Blue lines they made the start. It was a massive success. With Protection their music became even darker. For some of their fans it was some sort of a dissapointment but for others it was a masterpiece. But Mezzanine... oh men that is the true MASTERPIECE. It's a perfect album from every aspect. Its' mood is sensual, hypnotic and druggy. It's a theme for relaxation and for late nights. Its' songs... every single one of them is great. The opener track Angel is probably the most recognisable song of this album. I have no words to describe the next three tracks: Risingson, Teardrop and Inertia Creeps. Just amazing. Exchange is the only instrumental song on this album. It's a really cool track. Dissolved Girl was used on the matrix soundtrack. The beat is really stylish. Man Next Door is the the only song in this album that, in my opinion, reminds of Blue Lines. Really great too. The next three songs: Black Milk, Mezzanine and Group Four are just unbeliavable. Massive Attack is genius. And that leaves us to the last track of this album: (Exchange). It's slightly different from the 5th song and it also has vocals in it. A perfect ending for a perfect album.  <br /> If you wanna get into trip-hop this is the album to start along with Blue Lines (of course!), Dummy from Portishead, Maxinquaye from Tricky and Endtroducing from DJ Shadow. <br />  <br />
B000E1YVZU|2.0|I like operas, voice, stage design arts, orchestra, and custom...  I watched it because it suppose to be the modern version of La Boheme.  The film was okay, I'll say just about average, but it's not something that I'm going to watch again.  If you like \\"traditional\\" style opeara, you won't like it much.  Those of you who liked this film, go watch Franco Zeffirelli's La Boheme, you'll change your mind.
068483605X|5.0|Admittedly the premise of Watership Down by Richard Adams is a little silly, especially when you try explaining to people that you are reading this absolutely wonderful book that has adventure, romance, frightful villains, bravery and sadness-- and then tell them that the book is about a bunch of rabbits.    However, by the time you finish reading the third page, you have forgotten that the characters are rabbits and you fall in love with Hazel and his brother Fiver. Fiver has always been a little odd, and he has a vision of a great danger approaching the pleasant little warren where they live. Although Hazel and Fiver try to warn the elders of the warren about the danger, the elders refuse to listen.    And thus begins the amazing journey of Hazel and Fiver and their small group of believers as they cross dangerous territory filled with fierce dogs, a vicious, piratical rival rabbit's warren, and a great river to make a new home at Watership Down.    Richard Adams has so convincingly created a society, legends and language for the rabbits that you absolutely believe that rabbits do think, feel, talk, and act as they do in the book. Along the way they pick up some unusual allies, not the least of whom is Kee-har, an injured bird the rabbits rescue and nurse back to life. Kee-har repays the kindness of the rabbits in many ways and also adds some welcome humor to the often tense and frightening scenes.    If you have ever wondered if there is something better around the bend, and if you believe in friendship, loyalty and courage, try reading Watership Down. It is so much more than a book about a group of rabbits. It is one of the best books I have ever read.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|Do you like to laugh? Well you're going to need to strap yourself in and throw away the key to get through this movie. Otherwise, you'll be reaching for the remote about 90 seconds in. It's true that I might be the world's biggest Adam Sandler fan. It's also true that I lie to get attention. What I am trying to say is that Adam Sandler and Chris Rock = hijinks. Hijinks that come not in the form of laughter or delight, but in a knowing nod to each other that the paycheck they're getting for thisis bigger than the annual adjusted gross export $$ of Thailand. So, prepare for a joyride of comic proportions, but know that that preparation will serve no real purpose because this film is weaker than Calista Flockhart at bench press competition. However, it's still better than 50 First Dates, so put that in your shoe and step in it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|After 5 years of waiting Tool have returned.<br />Excellent album, the track 10,000 Days alone is worth the price of the CD.  I hear many people comparing this album to Lateralus and I dont think it can or should be.  Dont compare Tool to Tool, compare them to the current music scene.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that the album does not have enough tracks.  I think it could have had 2 or 3 more actual songs, this isnt exaclty a negative since they could have had 20 tracks and it still would never be enough.  The only other downfall is that a new TOOL album always reminds me of how bad the music scene is, no one can even come close.  No Im not a \\"fanboy\\" or a crazy fanatic TOOL fan (ok maybe a little bit), it just happens to be the truth.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool Fan #1: <br />First off, all of you 10 year olds trashing this album need to go search for more sratch n sniff stickers at the bottom of the pool. This album is amazeing. THIS is still Tool. \\"Oh, but it took them 5 years!\\" This comment makes me sick to my stomach... I can't even believe why more than 1 idiot has the nerve to say something like that. Yes, MJK made a few GOOD albums with APC and toured with them for some time (i know from experiance i went to the shows). Did that not take up the majority of his time? Adam Jones went on the record in saying that it took Tool a little over 1 year to create 10,000 days. Stop crying about the album being released 5 years later. Weren't albums like Lateralus and AEnima good enough to continue to dominate the disk changers in your steros for the past half of a decade anyways? Their music still sounds good. MJK's vocals are still off the hook. Yes, Adam Jones is still the man! This album needs to be bought, and i can only reccomend that all the haters sit down and burn one before listening the to the album again. This album is unique, and needs not be compared to Tool's albums in the past (Some of the songs allreay have that covered). Buy this album! <br /> <br />Tool Fan #2 <br />I've been listening to these guys for a long time now (actually, I don't even know how long), and I must say, they are still creative, and they are still amazing. This album does not sound like previous albums. I really don't think that they would create a piece of music that sound similar to their previous records, they are always doing something new. Now, about the album....my view is that the album takes you off on a different direction. When you go from Undertow, Aenima, and then Laturalus, you get a feeling that you take a \\"mystical\\" journey from below the ground and up into space. But with these new provocative sounds in \\"10,000 Days\\", you are definately in a new world. Almost makes you feel like your \\"trippin\\". LOL, anyway, I would highly recommend this album to any \\"real\\" Tool fans or any other progressive rock fans. By the way, stop joking around with the title by saying thats how long it took to make the album. 10,000 days is 27 years, duh, and if you read more into it, the number is actually reflecting something to do with Maynard's (lead singer) mother.....................idiot.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Pearl Sham is so 1991.  Eddie Cheddar (oops, I meant Vedder) can't sing and is actually really annoying.  Nick Lachey is coming out with a new album soon.  It's already getting rave reviews.  Save your money and wait for that disc soon.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When you look at a picture of the Grand Canyon, you may very well see how majestic and beutiful it is, but unless you actually go there you don't really get to experience it.  This album is like the Grand Canyon.  You can listen to it, or you can experience it. <br /> <br />Personally, I'm looking for the experience.  Can't wait to see them live.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|Rihanna is already poised to be as big a star as Beyonce.  She's getting a LOT of buzz and she's getting excellent reviews everywhere.  Watch out, because this girl is gonna be BIG.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I knew this movie was going to contain grotesque and graphic scenes all of which bothers me in the least.  I was more interested in the self-proclaimed \\"most horrifying movie\\" and how it was supposed to be so scary.  However, the movie is not scary but yes it is horrifying due to its story.  It tries to develop the plot where one can pay an incredible amount of cash to fulfill their hack and slash animal side at the expense (and pain) of tourists.  Yes we all know that humans can be utterly merciless but there are more dramatic ways of reflecting this on the screen.  Unless you cringe at the sight of blood or faint at envisioning someone slicing a piece of achilles tendon, then maybe this movie will frighten you.  Otherwise, with its customary young teens on a sex binge, naked women and breasts galore, the only thing scary about this movie is why I even bothered to watch it.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I am not going to sit here and tell you I know what the band is singing about, I am not going to sit here and tell you I understand the concept behind the album. What am I going to tell you? This is a solid album by a band who is known for soundscape music and jarring lyrics. Compared to past works, yes Tool has failed (not as bad as Andrew a few reviews down from me would like you to think, then again I'm sure Andy still has his tickets for the club show). I'm sure my last statment will catch the ire of some Tool fans, but hey Adam and Danny said that this album was going to be a throwback to Opiate and Undertow days, if claims like that are made regardless of artistic merits, your fans will hold you to it. The music is not as epic as it should or could be (thanks in part to the long interludes), then again with Tool the game always changes. So as a stand alone album? Yes, 10,000 days gets 4 stars, but compared to the previous albums, sorry, 3 stars. I do think there are some solid songs, such as Jambi and Rosetta Stoned (which is to me at least a reminder of old Velvet Underground work). I know some people are saying that Tool is tired and worn, they aren't even coming up with original riffs (if you listen yes they are playing stuff from previous albums), but I pose these questions: Considering the overall apporoach of Tool, do you really think they are lazy and worn? Don't you think there is a purpose for repeating certain riffs?   Once again I don't know, and don't pretend to know, but I like it regardless.   And at least the package is cool.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Take one part Sabbath, one part Zeppelin, and one part Jack White, and throw them in a blender and the delcious contents you pour out will sound like Wolfmother.  This is an amazing debut cd from this much-hyped band, and they are mostly deserving of the praise they've received.   <br /> <br />Some of the print reviews I read compare these guys to the Darkness, which I think is a bit off... the Darkness definitely ape classic rock (a cheeky british AC/DC first album, then a less cheeky and less successful Queen impression on their second), this is an honest attempt to create a classic rock sound without becoming parody - at least it seems that way to me. <br /> <br />As far as stand-out tracks, the album is pretty even and solid throughout - I personally like Apple Tree, which definitely sounds lifted off a White Striples album, albeit one with a good drummer and full instrumentation - but I think the top three are White Unicorn, Woman, and Colossal. <br /> <br />This cd is also very cheap - I picked it up for under $10, so if you pick it up this week at a big box retailer, its quite a bargain.  Pair this album up with the new Eagles of Death Metal and you have two great rock cds in the span of a few weeks... how unlikely in 2006.
B00005U2LM|4.0|..didn't like this album at first but I've been listening to it all the way through a few times over the last few days. First got it about a year ago so I was surprised to find myself liking it. Some of the lyrics aren't as good as some other Wu-Tang stuff but the whole thing is pretty tight. <br /> <br />Most of the members shine throughout the album actually, especially GZA, Inspectah Deck, Method Man and U-God. <br /> <br />Beats aren't typical Wu-Tang stuff but they're banging, some of them may have to grow on you though. I hated Chrome Wheels, Radioactive and Soul Power at first for example. Overall it probably has to grow on you, but its a really nice album. <br /> <br />Top 5 songs: <br />Uzi <br />Radioactive <br />Ya'll Been Warned <br />The W (Bonus track, full version of interlude from The W) <br />Babies
B000E1155E|5.0|Let me get this off my chest first:  The Arctic Monkeys share exactly two common traits with The Beatles and Oasis - They're all British, and they're all rock bands.  Let's end the comparisons there.  No band will ever be the Beatles, and Oasis have two great albums while the Arctic Monkeys have only released one album to date, and its a totally different style and sound than Oasis.  Comparisons to either of those bands are fruitless and unnecessary. <br /> <br />So what is this album then?  Overhyped? Probably.  But its most definitely a contender for album of the year.  Why?  This album takes everything that's good about the current crop of British bands (stop-start guitars, great hooks, catchy and danceable bass lines, great lyrics) and then turns it up to 11, so to speak.  Lyrically, this band has the most in common with The Streets, replacing white-boy rapping and home-computer beats with extremely strong musicianship.  What I like the most is that you can train your ear to listen to any of the parts of this band - the drumming is solid (far more so than say, Franz Ferdinand), each song is driven by terrific guitars and bass that will stay in your head as long as the lyrics will.  THAT is what makes this album so impressive to me - the sum of its parts is stronger than any album I've heard in a long time. <br /> <br />Another point to make is that this album honestly has no weak tracks at all.  Zero.  Every song is, at worst, above average, while most could make equal claim to single of the year to this point. <br /> <br />Examples?  Fake Tales of San Francisco, with its driving bass-line, shout-out chorus, and great lyrics... The View from the Afternoon, a perfect opener that sets the tone for the rest of the album... the unabashed rock and roll of Perhaps Vampires... in fact, this album ends so strongly that its ridiculous, with the great lyrics and varied sound of When the Sun Goes Down... probably my favorite track, From the Ritz to the Rubble (brilliant chorus, fantastic guitars, f&^cking brilliant... \\"You couldn't have done that on a Sunday, of course not!\\")... and finally the album closer, a Certain Romance with its opening drum and guitar attack before settling into a perfect UK retro-rock dance groove with a totally different sound, and great lyrics condemning the vapidness and bad behavior of today's youth even as the singer admits he has friends who are the same... this song has one of the best lines you're likely to hear this year:  \\"Cause over there theres broken bones / There's only music so that theres new ring tones / And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes / To see its a little different around here\\" <br /> <br />I understand the backlash against this band (and so does the band, if one listens to their new EP), as they have seen an unfair amount of hype and hyperbole.  The idea of comparing a band to the Beatles, after one album, is ridiculous.  I understand the Oasis one a little better, as they are a more recent band, and Whatever People Say I am, Thats What I am Not has a similar quality to the first two Oasis albums, in that its hard to believe a band can burst onto the scene already sounding this polished and this distinct, and drop an album that is so solid front to back.  So in theory, I get it.  But musically this is an entirely different band, and they DESERVE to be hyped more than their compatriots (with the exception of Bloc Party, who are as good, but are an entirely different sound with a different mission).  This band has no social or political mission to impart on us.  This cd is, simply put, a great rock album, possibly the best of this millenium.  Don't compare it to the best bands of all time, compare it to the current crop of what's out there - these guys absolutely blow away Hard-Fi, the Rakes, the Editors, Maximo Park, We Are Scientists, Kaiser Chiefs, etc etc.  All of those bands have great albums and are some of my current favorites, but they aren't really traditional \\"rock\\" albums perse.  The Arctic Monkeys have taken elements from all of these bands and infused it with what can only really be called traditional rock and roll, and I think that's what makes this cd so incredible. <br /> <br />
B000BKDOCA|5.0|BRITNEY SPEARS DID IT AGAIN! I LOVE ALL OF BRITNEY SPEARS SONGS HER VOICE IS SO REFRESHING AND BEAUTIFUL TO LISTEN TO. THE REMIX CD IS A TREAT I LOVE REMIX CDS. THIS REVIEW IS NOT GOING TO BE THE MOST HELPFUL BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE MUCH TO SAY ABOUT IT I JUST SOUGHT OUT A REVIEW TO SHARE MY OPINUIONS WITH YA'LL
B000EULJLU|5.0|So I have spent the last few weeks reading about how Tool has lost it and that this album in comparison to the rest of their body of work is a failure. I can only imagine that the folks who wrote those reviews had parents who wrote the same type of reviews for Sgt. Pepper, and The Wall. One cannot listen (the key word with this album - listen)and not see the depth and growth this band has taken. I am of the opinion that the album opens with Vicarious as a statement of \\"here is where we were when we last left you\\"....and then here is where we are. Listening to Wings of Mary, and 10,000 Days you cannot help but here Roger Waters of The Wall era.....and I say that in a good way. We get a building story complete with some of the most atmospheric guitar work and interesting drumming to date. This album from point A-Z needs to be experienced with headphones over and over. Sure it lacks the - windows rolled down rocking Aenima era songs - but it replaces that with depth, and the ceation of a listening experience.   <br />As an afterthought I also must say that many Tool fans struggle to \\"know\\" the elusive Maynard. Here is this album, especially with the tracks Wings of Mary, and 10,000 Days he has given you that glimpse into his soul you desire and you pan him for it.....shame on you.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|Now...This Is Mobb Deeps cd, not 50s or G-unit. Stop Bashing them because they are signed to G-unit...Yea, I don't like it either, but we all gotta get over it sometime right??? I don't see how its that strong to hate on the mobb because of that...especially when this is a good album...Just Accept it...It's not a \\"The Infamous\\" Or \\"Hell On Earth\\" or even a \\"Murda Muzik\\", but its still a good album... now that Im done saying my word about the unnessacary bashing, lets get on with the review.    Blood Money...it deserves 4.5 stars. its a step further more then amerikaz nightmare. P stepped up from him fallin off last album...and it shows...    1. Smoke It- 4.5/5 Great Start To the album. Hav shines production wise while P shines lyrically.    2. Put Em in Their Place- 5/5 The First Single. Straight Fire! P does destroy this track. Hav comes nice also. classic Mobb.    3. Stole Something- 4/5 Nice Track. All Three Shine(Lloyd Banks is Featured). Nice Beat    4. Creep- 3.5/5 Now...this is what we feared...A pop song for the mainstream to appreciate... Well The Lyrics is straight piff...50 even shines. Prodigy could've brought more heat tho. Its just the beat is pop as hell...Too bad. If only Hav stepped up on this beat, it would be a 4.5/5. oh well    5. Speakin So Freely- 4.5/5 Nice Track. Nice Beat while P and Hav shine.    6. Backstage Pass- 4/5 Lyrics is good, talkin bout the groupies...but the beat again...kinda pop. Its okay tho.    7. Give It To Me- 4.5/5 A Club Joint. I like it. Features Young Buck and All three shine.    8. Click Click- 5/5 This Song is straight gangsta S***! P's bridge? I love it! Tony Yayo comes back hard also. Classic Mobb    9. Pearly Gates- 5/5 This Joint might turn heads...Its deep. Especially Prodigy's verse. Hav and 50 are talking bout their hardships on earth and hopefully \\"talkin their way into Heaven\\" while Prodigy just straight says F*** God's Son...Don't worry tho, P's vuglar lyrics toward religion is reversed, so u wouldn't reallyknow what he is saying...Like I said, Some might turn their heads on it, but this is their mindstate...    10. Capitol P, Capitol H- 4.5/5 nice song. They Talk about their new names and y they change it. The beat is good, Nice job on creating a song everybody could feel.    11. Daydreamin- 4/5 Nice Song. They are reminsicing on their old days while welcoming their future. I like this beat also...    12. The Infamous- 5/5 Classic!!! Alchemist blesses the mobb once again with a killer beat...P delivers, Hav Delivers, 50 delivers the hook...What more to say? classic Mobb!!! Sample was also used by AZ on his latest album, A.W.O.L.    13. In Love with The Moula- 4/5 Nice Beat by J.R. The Mobb is referring money as their main wifey...it was done before, but is still good.    14. Its Alright- 4.5/5 Great beat Hav! You did better sampling it then Alchemist did! Mary J Blige and 50 stop by for the hook while Prodigy and Havoc puts down verses about a certain gurl in they life...    Now...my only real gripe about the album other then none of their old collabs(not even Noyd!!!)...the bonus tracks... Why is \\"Have A Party\\" and \\"Outta Control RMX\\" on here??? Like we haven't gotten tired of them already...bad move...I agree with one of the past reviewers said with how 50 should've not put those songs on any album and just put them on here. but...its not a bad thing I guess...Tho I would have perferred \\"Cobra\\" over \\"Outta Control Rmx\\"...    There u have it...Blood Money. 4.5/5. Hope my review was helpful.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Final Fantasy VII is one of gaming's most important masterpieces. SquareSoft's mega-hit re-launched the American RPG scene back in 1997 and the Sony PlayStation gained even more steam as the world's leading game console. One could argue that without Final Fantasy VII, gaming as a whole would be vastly different in its existence today. The three-disc epic was soon enough over, though, and its story left many with tears in their eyes and a want for more. For years, SquareSoft (now Square-Enix) has worked on what IGN.com calls a \\"fan service\\"; a film that continues the events of the video game, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. <br /> <br />I will try to summarize Tetsuya Nomura's plot without ruining too much from either Final Fantasy VII or Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children itself. Taking place two years after the monumental ending of Final Fantasy VII, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children continues Cloud Strife's story and the struggle between the Planet and the evil forces trying to destroy it. The Life Force, a stream of life that circles throughout the planet, is a source of energy that the evil Sephiroth tried to use and control before he was defeated by Cloud. <br /> <br />Low and behold, Sephiroth couldn't be completely destroyed because of special cells that run through his veins and as an interesting plot device, certain people were born with these cells infused into their blood. Cloud, of course, is one of these people. In Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, a wily threesome of Kadaj, Yazoo, and Loz want to revive Sephiroth's evil form by finding the elusive blood that fueled his hatred. When Cloud learns of this, it is his job (alongside some of his friends) to stop the destruction of the Planet that would ensue if that were to happen. All the while, inhabitants of the Planet are inflicted with a strange sickness known as \\"Stigma\\". <br /> <br />The only negative thing I could possibly say is that Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children tries to wrap up what should be another 40-hour RPG in 1 hour and 41 minutes of bridges that lead to fight scenes, and of course, intense fight scenes. Of course, the effect of this isn't completely negative; Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is as much Final Fantasy as could possibly be crammed into 101 minutes of delight. <br /> <br />What must be clarified is that Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children is one of the most beautiful computer graphic works of art in history. It's amazing to look back at the Tyrannosaurus Rex in Jurassic Park, which was one of the first CG marvels, and then watch Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, which is entirely done in CG. Everything, from the ruined landscape around the industrial city of Midgar, to the intricate detail woven into Cloud's shirt, looks eerily real. There were times throughout Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children where I lost a grip on the CG reality and thought that I was watching a live-action film. <br /> <br />Now, that isn't to say that the Final Fantasy VII art style isn't recreated. The bug-eyed, anime-styled protagonists are back, alongside the stick-proportioned Reno and the thuggish Rude of the Turks gang. Their wispy hair and realistic skin makes the CG even more deceiving. It is also safe to say that Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children has some of the most impressive animated battle scenes in film and gaming history. If you thought some of the battles found in The Matrix or Dragon Ball Z were interesting, you'll be knocked off of your seat by the events that unfold in Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Without ruining a single piece of action, I don't think there are faster-paced or higher-flying battles anywhere in entertainment. Let me just say that when a certain beast was summoned from the skies during one of the film's more pivotal moments, I beamed with fanboyish delight. <br /> <br />Without an amazing score by Nobuo Uematsu, any Final Fantasy project wouldn't be complete. Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children carries that score, mixing everything from the classical Final Fantasy VII theme to larger-than-life metal and electronica tracks that pulse through your veins alongside the emotion drawn from the on-screen battles. The soundtrack almost always seemed to be playing, especially near the end of the film. I noticed myself wondering if the music would stop, not in anticipation for it to stop, just in utter amazement that a composer could put on such a score for such an extensive amount of time. <br /> <br />Another addition to the excellent audio is the spot-on voice acting, where not once can I find a character to complain about. All ears will of course be on Cloud and I was happy with the job Steve Burton did here. Although he did a great job in SquareEnix's Kingdom Hearts series, he really shines here, where the emotion is allowed to flow out of the characters a little more than in the Kingdom Hearts games. Vincent Valentine is decidedly dark and mysterious in his voice, which was also done rather well by Steve Blum. And Rachel Leigh Cook captures the powerful but beautiful voice of Tifa in almost every line, though I wish Tifa had a stronger role in the film. She has a few minutes to shine but for the most part, she's a supporting role and a critic of Cloud rather than her own powerful being. <br /> <br />For those of you who aren't familiar with Final Fantasy VII, the bonus features included with Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children include \\"Reminiscence of Final Fantasy VII\\", a clip devoted to filling in the storyline up to the events of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. Also included on a second disc are clips of upcoming games like Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core and Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of Cerberus. Final Fantasy fans will giggle in excitement and those who aren't familiar just might find out what all the fuss is about. <br /> <br />Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children isn't the best film ever made, but it is definitely the best one related to video games and quite possiblyserves as one of the more important CG pieces ever created. It's a landmark in animation and a gift to gamers. It's a treat for action fans and a delight for drama lovers. Thank you for this gift, SquareEnix. This is better than anything a publisher has ever given me.
B000301YY8|1.0|The lyrics quite literally could have been and sound as if they were written by a love-smitten 13 year old.  I suppose, however, that as long as love is a concept that hits home, there will inevitabley be \\"artists\\" like this, monopolizing on it with their own pathetic 10 tracks of heart-wrenching \\"bedlam.\\"  If you often describe your musical taste as \\"generic\\" or \\"simple,\\" this is unequivocally for you.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|As we all know, Heath Ledger has been in many, many bad movies.  Will he ever live down The Order?  I don't think so--not with me, anyway.  So I was a little worried about this movie because, even though it looked exactly like the sort of thing I would like, Heath Ledger was in it.  BUT--so was Oliver Platt (is he making a living out of being in every movie about Venice or what?).  So I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Basically, this movie is GREAT!  It's a romp--a romp, I tell you!!!  Ledger is actually really good and believable (never thought I'd say that) as Giacomo Casanova, the guy who wouldn't be able to avoid getting into trouble if he tried, which he actually does for about five minutes.  The screenplay is very well-written and near-flawlessly plotted, and leans more toward slapstick who's-on-first type comedy than romance, which is good because it works.  There's also a twist at the end of the movie that I never saw coming.  Everyone loves a twist.<br /><br />This movie also gets props from me for the scenery.  I love watching a movie and being like, \\"Oh, I've been there!\\"<br /><br />The movie does its down sides:  the ending doesn't really make sense (how did Victoria learn how to duel???), but did you really expect it to?  Also, I find it hard to believe no one's pissed at Casanova--but oh well!<br /><br />There are so many great characters in this movie that it's difficult to pick just one that I totally loved, but at this point I'm going to vote for Victoria, the lustful virgin.  Hilaaaaaarious.  Of course, Oliver Platt was also great as the rotund, slightly dense, yet lovable lard merchant.  And Jeremy Irons (you didn't think this movie would be without Jeremy Irons in it, did you?) plays the 18th-century version of Pat Robertson.  Ha ha.<br /><br />The only downer in this movie is Casanova's real life.  I kept waiting for him to be imprisoned in the Doge's Palace and for his true love to die of consumption while he's there.  Poor guy.  But if I hadn't known about his real-life adventures, I never would have expected the ax to drop, so to speak.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really great movie.  If you like movies like St. Ives or The Scarlet Pimpernell, you will definitely enjoy this one.But if I hadn't known about his real-life adventures, I never would have expected the ax to drop, so to speak. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really great movie.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Being an 'OG' from '92, I have seen all my Gen-X bands run out of ideas, get stale or sadly - die. THANK THE CREATOR, whoever that may be, that Tool can continue to put out great music.<br /><br />For old school Tool fans, 10,000 Days is a culmination of their previous catalog while still moving forward and still staying unpredictable and left of center.<br /><br />For detractors - all Tool albums have historicly been received poorly, so give it a couple years. After all, looking back 10 years - is AEnema dated? No. It still sounds better than anything that's out now and is equally influential. How have other bands held up now that time can tell? Is Creed dated? Is Godsmack? Type-O Neg? Sevendust? They sound silly now. If 10,000 Days is not a breath of fresh air and stimulating experience - put it to the side, get the new Pearl Jam or RHCPs and revisit Tool in a couple years. Or, listen to the radio in a couple years and what you hear will be a poorly emulated version of this CD. Example, Nonpoint 2003 -vs- Tool 1995.<br /><br />Rock on gangsters.
B000EULJLU|1.0|I knew this would happen.  Lateralus comes out in 2001 and is a complete masterpiece.  Then Tool takes five years off. <br /> <br />Meanwhile Maynard starts with his other band A Perfect Circle and makes 3 soft albums (compared to Tool) with them. Then he decides to come back and make a Tool album. <br /> <br />What do you think is going to happen?  Of Course. Tool has become A Perfect Circle.  10,000 Days is soft and weak.  I'm a huge Tool fan and I am severely disappointed. <br /> <br />The rest of you can keep trying to convince yourselves that it's good, but it's not.  Remember, it has been FIVE YEARS.  They had five years and this is the best they can come up with?  It sounds like there was two weeks worth of thought put into this album. <br /> <br />You guys can go on and explain how this album is \\"different\\" and \\"challenging\\" and \\"takes time\\" to like.  Tool fans didn't want something different from AEnima and Lateralus.  They wanted something similar.   <br /> <br />If by \\"different\\" you mean bad then yes, 10,000 Days is different.  If by \\"challenging\\" you mean, \\"I challenge you to find three good songs on this album,\\" then you're right, it's challenging.  If by \\"takes time to like it,\\" you mean five years then yes, it'll take me five years to like this album, because that's when the next album will come out and I can forget this disaster. <br /> <br />If you think APC is better than Tool, get this album.  But if you think Tool is better, just stick with AEnima and Lateralus, these albums are great, the way Tool used to be.
B00000255F|5.0|After his first two album sold very poorly this would become his make or brake sessions.  Springsteen could hardly pay his band anymore and his legendary scruffy look of the time  had more to do with him not being able to buy new clothes than carefull image building.

Not everybody was confident he could make it at the time, even in his innercircle. After recording the Rock & Roll classic Born to Run his drummer and keyboard player left the band. The Born to Run sessions found Springsteen plagued by insecurity but determinate to hit big. He stripped down his writing creating songs that had a cinematic quality to them.

6303168507|5.0|Liam Neeson supurbly portrays the delightful scoundrel Oskar Schindler who by guile and cunning cheated the nazis of over a thousand Jewish lives. Like the main character of the Music Man this scoundrel redeams himself in this story while trying to make himself a fast buck but in the end sacrifices all for things more important. And more happy, this one is for real though I am sure all of us would prefur that this whole episode of history had not happened.    <br /> <br />Spielberg truly did  wisely filming this movie in Black and White much as the moral standing of what happened is stark in Black and white.   <br /> <br />The supporting cast did a good job. Ben Kingsley in peticular.
B0000024ZT|4.0|1972 was the year a young kid from New Jersey was discovered by John Hammond sr. Springsteen had been in various bands by then. He did some recordings for his first the Castilles and Steel Mill, none of which got any serious circulation or is available today. At the time of his discovery Springsteen had retreated in the coffee house circuit to focus on his songwriting. Being a scruffy looking kid with an acoustic guitar, Hammond mistook him for the new Bob Dylan. Springsteen himself wasn't so sure which direction his career should take. It wasn't halfway till through the sessions that Hammond discovered Springsteen was a mean electric guitarist as well and an early E-Street band was hastily assembled. The haste and uncertainty shows on the record. The end result is an elective affair of rock, soul, jazz and folk, a mixed blessing.    At the time Springsteen wasn't yet the troubadour of the working class he'd become a few years down the line. Asbury's dense lyrics dealt with growing up in Asbury, dreams of making it in music and city life. The colorful characters Springsteen portraits he'd meet on the Jersey Shore and were often highly romanticized.     On Asbury Springsteen offers us an opportunity to grow up with him. \\"I stood stone-like at midnight suspended in my masquerade, I combed my hair till it was just right and commanded the night brigade\\" he sings as he gets ready to hit the Jersey night. \\"I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not need my urgency, I came for you, for you, I came for you, but your life was one long emergency\\" he moans at young and unrequited love. \\"By the time we made it up to Greasy Lake I had my head out the window and Janey's fingers were in the cake, I think I really dug her 'cause I was too loose to fake, I said, \\"I'm hurt.\\" She said, \\"Honey let me heal it\\".\\" Springsteen sings only moments later when he does get to enjoy the magic of adolescent sex. This clearly another Springsteen than we would encounter a few years later, this punk is headstrong, determent to make it yet still discovering himself and the world around him, not yet ready to leave his surroundings.     Only the soldier in Vietnam asking \\"Have you thrown your senses to the war or did you lose them in the flood?\\"\\" betrays the Springsteen to come. But that is another story altogether. Although Asbury got rave reviews is was a commercial dud. It would only pick up sales later when Springsteen broke into the big league.
B000094J5T|5.0|This is the story of one man in his efforts to live and those who along the way assisted him including one kind German. A fully assimilated Polish Jew who was one of the ten percent of Poland's Jewish population who saw themselves as Jewish Poles, not that that did any of them any good with the Poles before or during the war. <br /> <br />He lost his family. He lost his friends. He saw his parents, his brother and his sisters shipped off to the death camps along with many others yet he by luck escaped and survived.  <br /> <br />It begins with him playing the piano just before the war. His dayly life in the ghetto and ultimately ends with at war's end surviving. <br /> <br />An inspiring story of struggle to survive against the odds.

B000001DYD|2.0|I adore PJ Harvey. She is a genius,an original, and in a league all her own but Rid Of Me (her second album) left me disappointed. I love all her other albums especially Dry and Stories from the city, stories from the sea but Rid Of Me is not catchy. I don't mind indie albums but this one has no production quality, too under-produced and I can bearly hear her amazing voice and cool lyrics. I only like two songs which are the title-track and Missed. Skip this album, not much to it.
B000EULJLU|1.0|I feel like a TOOL for buying this album. What a waste. It took 5 <br />years 2 write 1 good song. WOW, 1,825 days for 1 song.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is the best and most creative album by the Queen of Pop, all hail Madonna. Her songwriting, her voice, and the music is amazing and inspiring here. Gorgeous, full of life, and empowering. All 13 tracks are great. Sky Fits Heaven, \\"Traveling down this road watching the signs as I go...\\" Frozen, \\"Love is a bird she needs to fly let all the hurt inside of you die...\\" The Power of Good-bye, \\"I was your fortress you had to burn...\\" Swim, \\"Children killing children while the students rape their teachers, comets fly across the sky while the churches burn their prechers.\\" Little Star (about her daughter), \\"God gave a present to me, made of flesh and bones...\\" Mer Girl, \\"I ran from my house that cannot contain me, from the man that I cannot keep, from my mother who haunts me even though she's gone, from my daughter that never sleeps.\\" And so many more interesting tracks, Ray of Light won a Grammy for best Pop Album, much-derserved I think. Producer William Orbit is a genius, he redefined Madonna's sound into something more edgy and sophistcated as well. Beautiful album from a beautiful and gifted woman.
B000ERU6QC|4.0|OK--I am giving it 4 stars, which is great, but as much as I love this CD, I can't give it 5...too much QOTSA, not enough chicks with moustaches. <br /> <br />This new version of Eagles of Death Metal (we'll call them EODM Mach 2) is vastly different from the group of musicians that put their first CD together.  Jesse Hughes is still the main man, but Josh Homme has moved from drums to bass and part-time guitar.  He also co-wrote quite a bit of the music this time around.  Joining the duo are: Joey Castillo (Queens of the Stone Age, Desert Sessions), Alain Johannes (QOTSA, Desert Sessions), Troy Von Leuwan (QOTSA, Desert Sessions) and a slew of other QOTSA collaborators, including Jack Black, Dave Catching and Mark Lanegan.  Queens of the Stone age are my favorite band in the whole world, but with \\"Desert Sessions 8&9\\" being released (which is QOTSA with PJ Harvey) along with \\"Lullabies to Paralyze,\\" and now this...it seems like Josh Homme and his merry band of muses have taken over yet another studio, and more importantly, taken the Eagles of DM from Jesse Hughes, glitzed it up, and gave it new life.  Well, I for one enjoyed the hell out of the first CD.  This one is awesome, but it sounds more like Jesse collaborated with QOTSA to help make a CD for them, not vice versa.   <br /> <br />What's missing from the first CD?  Well, only one of the most important aspects of the band--THE HAIRY MOUSTACHE CHICKS!  Where have they gone?  Live, they are incredible...the \\"moustache riders\\" made the show!   <br /> <br />Let's talk about the good things.  The songs are catchy as ever.  The drums are vastly improved, now that JC is in charge of the sticks and skins.  Also, the addition of a bass guitar makes a world of difference.  <br /> <br />It is a great CD, but there's too much of a \\"Queens of the Stone Age meets Presidents of the USA\\" feel to it, as each song tends to tug an influence form one of those bands or the other throughout the disc.  The only diversion, \\"Eagles Goth,\\" sounds like an old Bauhaus song.  If you loved \\"Peace, Love, Death Metal\\" as much as me, and loved seeing Josh beat on the drums, you'll be happy you bought this one, but it won't hold a special place in your loins like the first one.  It's pre-meditated fun, unlike its spontaneous predeceser. <br /> <br />Highlights include: \\"Cherry Cola\\" the best song on the CD, kinda like \\"Speak in Tongues\\" from the first CD; \\"I Got a Feelin\\" great tune which could have ended up on a QOTSA CD; \\"Dont Speak\\" which clearly draws influence from the Presidents; and \\"Chase the Devil\\" which sounds like the only song on the CD that Jesse came up with all by himself.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is chilling, provactive, and the best film of 1999. Kevin Spacey and Annette Benning are fabulous together. Sorry, Hilary Swank but Annette deserved the Oscar more than you did for Boys Don't Cry. Spacey respectedly won his little statue, what a talented actor he is. Chris Cooper is so creepy in this film, I love his acting as well, such a natural, he picks roles no one dares to play. The tagline for this film is \\"Look Closer\\" which is perfect because you think people who live in the suburbs have it all, a nice car, beautiful house, and the perfect family and this film shatters all those myths in two hours. This film is gorgeous to look at, all bright colors flash from frame to frame. Wes Bentley plays the \\"confident\\" neighbor who lives next door who discoveres everything is not as it seems. American Beauty is full of depth, substance and hysterical themes. Watch this film if you seroiusly want to be a director one day, Sam Mendes is one great director. Love this film, also won best picture.

ONE HAS TO LISTEN HARD TO HEAR WORDS <br /> <br />THE ALBUM Eliminations: Toss out \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" \\"Lost Keys\\" & \\"Vigenti Tres\\". They are just random noise. \\"Wings (Pt1)\\" is slow, spiritual intro to \\"10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)\\" like Parabol was on Lateralus.  <br /> <br />KEEPERS: Vicarious, Jambi, 10,000 Days (Wings Pt2), The Pot, Rosetta Stoned, Intension, and Right In Two.  <br /> <br />RUNDOWN: Album is a straight-forward lyrically with little needed additional research as on Lateralus or Aenima. It is not as heavy musically as either of those albums.  <br /> <br />1)VICARIOUS = tight, classic Tool rock, signiture single like \\"Schism\\" but longer and on Lateralus with triplet guitar riffs. Includes \\"Schism\\"-like mid-breakdown. AMAZING SONG <br /> <br />2) JAMBI =MONSTROUSLY HEAVY then fools listener while Maynards sings softer and spiritual as if a journey. Guitar solo uses talkbox but is univentive and weak. IT ROCKS REAL HARD AT IT CENRTAL POINT and bass slides down to an all-out jam.  <br /> <br />3) Wings Pt 1 = butterfly guitar delay sound and maynards words. <br /> <br />4) 10,000 Days = Clearly about Maynards Mom Judith Marie who suffered for 10,000 days from a stroke until her death. ONE OF THE BEST BASS PERFORMANCES TOOL HAS DONE. EPIC with Maynards voice following the bass and guitar to the songs multiple climaxes. A TOOL MASTERPIECE = Softspoken to Fierce to Spiritual to Touching to Exhausting until the sound at the end of the song sound like a bottle allowing a compressed soul to escape and flutter into the heavens.  <br /> <br />5) THE POT: from \\"The pot calling the kettle black\\" most likely referring to George W. Bush unto his eyes in \\"muddy/bloody\\" water ie full of BS and lied to killed people in maynards opinion. The line \\"You must have been HIGH\\" referred to Bush's poor judgement and history with marijuana possibly. Maynard's voice starts like MAROON 5's singer which is hard to digest but memorable. AGGRESSIVE SONG, FANTASTICALLY FUN, a possible RADIO SINGLE. EXTERMELY RHYTHMIC BASS, DRUM, GUITAR, and VOICE with HUGE APC \\"THE OUTSIDER LIVE\\"-LIKE SCREAM At the end of the song <br /> <br />8) ROSETTA STONED: HEAVY METAL AENIMA TOOL. Like \\"Third EYE\\" but heavy start to finish, Musically similar also to \\"TRIAD\\". Utilized heavier riff from center of \\"H\\". Probably about a guy that took LSD and was told the SECRET TO LIFE but was too drugged up to remember his pen to write it down. the Main Character mourns not writing down the message he was given because he feels a duty to tell mankind the Secret and help the world. Father of LSD is Hofmann is real history and Rosetta Stoned continues from Lost Keys. (the Rosetta Stone is in the British Museum today and was a key historical discovery to finally translating Egyptian hyroglyfics for the first time because the same messages in hyroglyfics were written next to Greek and Arabic on the same stone) <br /> <br />9) INTENSION: bongos and maynard like \\"Disposition\\" <br /> <br />10) RIGHT IN TWO: like a power-ballad almost. Commentary about Society calling some people monkeys who should not have been given free will or opposable thumbs because they have used both items to hurt humanity and neglected responsibly with God's gift to them. BASICALLY CAPS THE ALBUM OFF with a HUGE CLIMAX and WARM DOWN tabla.  <br /> <br />JUDGEMENT: 4 STARS. We expected ULTRA HEAVY, we got a progression of Lateralus and some weird but great story telling. For AEnima fans Rosetta Stoned is definately for you. Vicarious and the Pot are commercial attempts for Tool radio play and social commentary. 10,000 Days does not cater shows Tool throw their arms up and do whatevery they want. There is little cohesion from song to song but rather a collection of random Tool tracks independently engineered from each other. Album works off jams and band's music. Less focused on Maynard altogether.  <br /> <br />For Fans of TOOL, not particular albums of theirs. Internalize and develop with the band. 10,000 Days is as strong and great as anything they've ever done. It is on the listener to absorb it and let it positively influence that person. PEACE
B00079FUI6|5.0|Desperate Housewives - The complete First Season is delightfully wicked. Creator Marc Cherry (The Golden Girls) is a genius, what a fabulous show he has created. When i first saw the previews to the show, I have to admit I was less than amused, I thought it was just some silly little soap barbara with nothing to it. Boy was I wrong, I decided to give this \\"watercooler\\" show a chance and I was hooked from the first episode. I love the second season just as much. Marcia Cross's brilliant character Bree Van De Kamp is a hoot. Bree is so complex and desperate to be the perfect wife and mother but she fails miserably of course. Felicity Huffman is outstanding as well as Lynn. Great cast even though I am not a big fan of Teri Hatcher, otherwise than that, Desperate Housewives will have you begging for more. Such a guilty pleasure, I love it!
B00003CXDG|1.0|Adopting a well-established franchise and then discarding its fundamental premise is a wasted opportunity to make use of the very thing that distinguishes it from the rest. Mission Impossible is all about teamwork - there should be no single star. Getting the job done relies on the interdependence of all the team members. If you depart from that premise, as the Tom Cruise interpretation has done so, you might as well give it a different name altogether. This hijacking and raping of a well-loved TV formula looks much more like yet another envious attempt at re-inventing James Bond with an American hero. I was embarrassed on behalf of the original TV cast.
0060763280|5.0|The Secrets of the Millionaire Mind was outstanding!  The book is full of advice and tips that seem so subtle but can come together to make a great difference.  I really liked how Harv spoke directly to the reader.  He also made the book extremely interactive and fun to read through many different activities.  Harv addresses many important core concepts that without you will never be rich or truly happy.  I recommend this book to anyone!  I have learned a lot from Harv.  This is definitely a special book and I am positive that anyone can benefit from reading it.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|Mobb Deep's \\"Blood Money\\" is no doubt one of the most looked forward to albums in a while. The unlikely pairing of the Queensbridge legends and 50 Cent's G-Unit imprint left many scratching their heads last summer, myself included. The combination of Mobb Deep's street level, tough lyrics and gritty beats would likely contrast with G-Unit's hit-ready method, but it really doesn't. It's mostly a regular Mobb Deep album, similar to their last few. Havoc is still manning the production boards, so the creepy bass and instrumental heavy beats that we know so well remain intact. Their lyrics are slightly different, with more talk of women and money than their usual grimy and depressed street tales, but one would expect that from a G-Unit album. As usual, Havoc outshines Prodigy on the mic, sometimes more noticeably than others. Even though there is no single as strong as \\"Shook Ones Pt. II\\", \\"The Learning\\", or even \\"Got It Twisted\\", there are many very strong songs here. While I neither love nor hate G-Unit, I respect that they are the biggest name in hip hop at the moment, but most of their guest appearances slightly detract from the overall product. \\"Blood Money\\" is really a good old Mobb Deep album, with only a few new points added.<br /><br />\\"Blood Money\\" begins with the strong cut \\"Smoke It\\", a horns and drum fanfare with good, hard verses by both Havoc and Prodigy and a nice chorus. It sounds like the Mobb Deep we've loved for the last twelve years. Then comes the single \\"Put Em In Their Place\\", another horn/bass driven track, a good song with a subpar chorus. \\"Stole Something\\" is also strong, good all around with a complementary guest spot by Lloyd Banks. \\"Creep\\" has great spinning and loopy production, hook, and verses, but 50 Cent's subpar verse brings it down slightly. \\"Speakin' So Freely\\" is a great, tough track, with a creepy beat and threatening lyrics. \\"Backstage Pass\\", however, is very poor, a weak beat covered by worthless topics. Following the decent \\"Give It To Me\\" with Young Buck is the gritty \\"Click Click\\", an overall very nice track, except for a weak verse by the typically limited Tony Yayo. \\"Pearly Gates\\" is among the best songs here. It has a catchy piano line, and one of 50 Cent's best verses in a while. The song deals with 50's obsession with getting to heaven and tells some quick stories. \\"Capital P, Capital H\\" is a weak spot, especially Prodigy's lumpy-like-oatmeal verse. I like \\"Daydreamin'\\", where Hav and Prod go back to their young days and remember wishing out of poverty. The anthem \\"The Infamous\\" has a great bassline reminiscent of their album of the same name, and the lyrics live up to it. \\"In Love With The Moula\\", is okay, Hav and P talk to money as they would to a woman. The \\"It's Alright\\" collaboration with Mary J. Blige and 50 Cent is mostly driven by Mary, but it's a good song nonetheless. \\"Have A Party\\" is the best song on the album, with a great appearance by Nate Dogg and an awesome rock and roll beat. The \\"Outta Control\\" remix, a hit from last summer that I thoroughly enjoyed, is a nice added bonus.<br /><br />While \\"Blood Money\\" is by no means the best Mobb Deep album, it will certainly not turn away old fans of their other albums and will also please fans of G-Unit. I certainly recommend that old fans pick it up, because it really doesn't stray too far from their regular formula. For new fans, I would suggest buying their classics \\"The Infamous\\" or \\"Hell On Earth\\" first, but this is worth owning. Mobb Deep is a group that gained its legendary status through talent and style, which is definitely intact on this effort.Give It To Me\\" with Young Buck is the gritty \\"Click Click\\", an overall very nice track, except for a weak verse by the typically limited Tony Yayo. \\"Pearly Gates\\" is among the best songs here.

B000E6ESL2|4.0|This movie was very well done in the aspect of bringing suspense and confusion to this complex genre. This movie has a great degree of acting and mood, all the scenes are not seperated with simple cuts but are blended together . . . and you'll find out why. It has a knack for taking what you think is going to happen and totally flipping it upside down. Bob hoskins also did a breakthrough performance with Ryan Gosling( Guy from The Notebook).<br /><br />But, you may have to watch this movie a second time in order to be blown away and connect all the missing pieces.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I read somewhere that '10,000 Days' is not an album of singles, and that's true.  It is, however, existentially brilliant and deserves much of the hype that has surrounded it since the project's inception.  The band has matured a great deal since their piercing release, Opiate, but I don't think that they've necessarily lost any of the charisma that enticed me into their fan-base years ago.  Maynard, now in his 40's, no longer belts the notes that made him so famous in songs like 'Bottom' or 'Third Eye'.  Instead, the timbre of his voice is now much softer and more personal, and while this may just be the natural inevitability of a powerful (although in honesty, somewhat abused) voice that stretched itself for many years, it fits the band's progression and direction.  Danny, Justin and Adam deserve credit for linking everyone else's respective instrumentation in such a way that every sound complements another.  I for one am quite pleased, and if Tool never releases another album, this one as a closer, would definitely suffice.
B000EULJLU|5.0|As with each Tool album, this is a musical journey that is up to the listener to interpret based on their own individuality.  The review format doesn't really serve well for any of Tool's material since they are so different in how they approach creating their music and the artwork that compliments their music.  I love Tool, but that is my personal preference.  How I interpret the music is different than anyone else and it changes each time I listen to one of their albums.  Enjoy the musical ride that they give you...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I just purchased the new Pearl Jam album today and from what I have  listened too, all i can say is that this album is the best Pearl Jam album since their earlier albums like Ten and Vs. Each track has its own charm, from the hard rocker Big Wave to the beautiful slow tempo song Gone and the brillant single World Wide Suicide. <br /> <br />This album has reminded me that Pearl Jam are still one of the greatest bands on the face of the Earth. Do yourself a favour and buy this now!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|Final Fantasy VII is in an awkward position these days. Fans of the original still bask in the fond memories the (for its time) revolutionary title brought to them. Newbies, however, are now turned off by the (now) archaic graphics, inconsistent character models, and poor localization that resulted in severely bad English.<br /><br /> This game is in dire need of a remake, and rumors have been going around that one is in the works, but in the mean time fans have this little treat to hold them over.<br /><br /> For the first time since the original Mortal Kombat a video game movie takes place within the continuity of the game it's based on. This makes it already leaps and bounds better than any other game to film conversion. That said the film is far more visually stunning than its competitors, and the animation is simply breath taking. It brought tears to my eyes when I realized that one day the actual game could look this good, if they remake it... And theoretically it's possible that a PS3 remake of the original could come close. It's beautiful, and unlike other recent CGI films with quasi-realistic characters, Advent Children's characters feature very lifelike eyes, and deliver mostly believable performances except the gravity defying stunts defy suspension of disbelief, yet remain true to the game as many of these stunts are based off of the FFVII Limit Breaks! And they look amazing, even if I don't believe that Cloud could fall several hundred feet and not break anything.<br /><br /> The film's story, however, is somewhat problematic. Non-fans shouldn't even bother trying to follow it. There was potential for a very deep film here, but sadly what story there is minimalistic and serves as a device to move from one action sequence to the next. You can tell that the writers of this film are too used to writing for video games, as this sort of writing works well there, but here it leaves a lot to be desired. I was especially disappointed that the party (Barret, Cid, Caith Sith, Yuffie, and Red XIII) didn't really get all that much screen time. Had this film been longer then there could have been some seriously cool character developments. I was particularly disappointed with the final battle, which looked awesome, but really didn't do all that much for the story. Had the Remnant remained the main villain instead of a device to resurrect Sephiroth I would have handled the story a little more seriously. Cheesy resurrections don't go over that well with me.<br /><br /> Cloud is the only character that receives any significant character development here. And I'm glad he is able to make peace with himself, but at the same time I am sorely disappointed that there wasn't much by way of romantic developments between Tifa and him. Tifa is obviously in love with him, and I know he's in love with Aerith, but she's dead, and he should have realized by now that Tifa is ga-ga for him and done something about it at the end.<br /><br />  This story is not un-enjoyable, its just not very deep. It runs circles around Silent Hill, and would have been a much better expenditure for theater viewing. FFVII isn't going to win an academy award for best screen play or picture, but it certainly wets one's appetite for the rumored remake., Yuffie, and Red XIII) didn't really get all that much screen time.

B000EULJLU|2.0|So....I love reading reviews from all these Tool fans, WAIT...HARD CORE Tool fans...fans that dont listen to Opiate, or Aenima or have ever been to even see Maynard live. Give me a break, who are you all kidding? Ya, maybe if you listen to the album like 30-40 times, which Im sure most of you did stealing it off the Internet before it even came out, that YA..you will grom to MAKE yourself like a few of the songs, but to go as far as to rank it with the other albums is just nuts. Or to state that 'if you just liked the band, that you should be looking past what you want to hear and not to think about yourself, but what the band wants' as one person put it in so many words. What kind of jibberish crap is that. The album sucks. Plain and simple. You can get a few songs to grow on you, but if you think it even compairs to songs like Forty Six and 2, or Hooker with a Penis...Opiate, then you should go back and listen to those licks and how many times the songs change over and over again with all of Maynards catchy, melodic tunes....None to be found on this, almost APC album. For his band to even let a album this close to APC even be produced under their intelligent music is beyond me. Make your own decision I guess. I would do as Amazon requests in the top right to \\"Have one to sell?\\" if I havent already thrown mine out my car window. PEACE!
068987474X|2.0|This book was referred to me by my therapist, although she never read the book. After reading chapter 1, you've read it all. I find Mr. Behrendt a bit insulting, sometimes you even wonder if he doesn't think he's Dr. Phil. Keep in mind that the book was not written by professionals (psychologists) and you cannot generalize, every man, every couple and every situation is different and the way they give it to you is way too simple. Relationships are more complex than that. For me, this book is more for entertainment than reading into the signs. Women are not that stupid, we know when a guy is into us or not...
B000ETQRCM|4.0|While Pearl Jam chose to make their eighth studio album self-titled, it is perhaps the title of Neil Young's forthcoming \\"Living with War\\" that best fits the album.  A band never known for shying away from politics, Pearl Jam has embraced the topic head on, putting together their most aggressive and direct album since at least 1998's \\"Yield\\". <br /> <br />The album pretty much opens up on the offensive-- opener \\"Life Wasted\\", a pounding, midtempo reflection on sending our children to war with appropriately venomous vocals from Eddie Vedder sets the stage for cuts like punk vehicles \\"Comotose\\" and \\"Big Wave\\".   Energy is key and the record is filled with the sort of dirty guitar sound that is associated with grunge.  Leadoff single \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is another fine example of this-- explosive, fierce with an almot jangly verse and a pounding chorus. <br /> <br />Still, Pearl Jam is not a band that's been known for only harder material, and the band's more melodic side shines through on cuts like the odd pop song \\"Parachutes\\"-- Vedder's vocal rises into a falsetto and the music has an odd lilt to it quite unlike anything else the band's ever done, and \\"Gone\\", one of Vedder's trademark dark ballads-- those vehicles for putting his heart right out there and dig in deeply.  It's almost creamy arrangement and bleak sound make it the real standout of the record.  And certainly closer \\"Inside Job\\" is one of those pieces you never quite thought Pearl Jam had in them-- atmsopheric, melodic, dark yet uplifting, it builds in intensity and power over its extended arrangement and makes a superb closer for the record. <br /> <br />If there's really any complaints to be made about the album, it's in the production.  There's an odd sense of claustrophobia to the record-- this may have been intentional, all things being even, but at times the sound of the album can get in the way of the directness of some of the pieces.  Likewise, an odd choice to occasionally double track the lead vocals takes away from the strength of delivery.  It's really these factors that stop me from thinking of this as a five star record, but nonetheless \\"Pearl Jam\\" is a fine effort and well worth the investment.  Recommended.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Ever since Metallica released St. Anger, i'm afraid of another great band coming out with a big mistake. I read numerous posts on how this album sucked and that there were only a few good songs on here. After listening to 10,000 days, I realized that they just didn't know what they were talking about. Just like each album before it, 10,000 days manages to sound like no other Tool album, yet it is still recognizably Tool. In my mind, the two best tracks on the album are 10,000 days, which is a 12 minute epic, and Right in Two, which is probably the most familiar type of Tool song with it starting out soft and slowly coming to life. There are other highlights in this album as well. Maynard screams longer than I can hold my breath, just like in The Grudge from Lateralus. He also starts out a song singing higher than we've ever heard him sing before. I heard a nifty quote on Tool's semi-official website, toolshed.com, that perfectly sums this album up to all Tool fans: \\"It's not exactly what you expected, but it's exactly what you wanted.\\" Oh and I meant to give this 5 stars, but it won't let me change it since I accidentally hit 4
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I guess I have no idea what people are looking for when they listen to a Daft Punk album. I'm a sometime fan of ambient, electronica, rock, house, and 80s pop, as best I understand those genres. <br /> <br />For my money, Human After All is a close second to Homework, and both beat the apparently more popular Discovery, hands-down. And I'm a huge fan, even if I rarely like everything on any given album.  <br /> <br />Human After All, Robot Rock, and Television Rules the Nation, these three tracks are by themselves worth the price of the album. And while I can take or leave Make Love and Emotion as ambient pop, and find Technologic and On/Off trite, the remaining three tracks are also great listening material. <br /> <br />In other words, though I may give only 3.9 stars on average to the songs on the album, you don't need 10 great tracks for a 5-star album. Six will do. <br />
0802136834|5.0|This is the best history I've read on the subject, and I would recommend any one read it who is interested in the goings-on of the English monarchy in the 16th century. Henry VIII has been protrayed time and again as a wanton,lusting glutton. The bottom line is that he was desperate for a male heir, and he would do anything to have a son. Personnally, I was amazed that he didn't just legitimize his son, the Duke of Richmond. But, then history would have turned out entirely different.
B00008RWRH|5.0|Jochum and London Phil deliver the highest level of Haydn playing just like Colin Davis and Concertgebow do. I own both and tried to compare between two. <br /> <br />Jochum adds plenty of personal touches that decidedly grab your attention. You hear poignant romanticism or Beethoven-like roar in many places. Colin Davis, by comparison, lets the music flow naturally and makes it sound more balanced. In his set, you hear more of Concertgebow Orchestra than Colin Davis. I think it's the other way around in Jochum set. Concergebow's sound is more transparent and charmingly light-footed while London Phil sounds fuller and creamier without losing crispness. You get more agility and refinement from Davis set. You get more expressiveness and warmth from Jochum's. <br />Let me emphasize that all of the good qualities I attributed to either of the sets actually exist in both (they are inherently in Haydn's writing). It's just that some qualities are more apparent in one than the other. <br />As to the recording, Colin Davis set has more sparkle and vividness. It sounds more modern. Jochum's has a typical old-fashioned analogue sound in a very good way. It has plenty of natural ambience but doesn't sound muddy. <br />I recommend you buy both of these delightful and affordable sets.  I never regretted doing so :-) <br />
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I have two premises when I see a movie...  <br />Entertain me!  Happy Ending! <br />Very American, for me the point is escape from the day-to-day. <br /> <br />I didn't see the animated series before the Movie, and I went right out and bought a copy of the Movie after I saw it.   <br /> <br />Charlize is a very talented actress, and along with Kate Bekinsale have made some very cool stuff over a wide range of genres and are easy on the eyes.  Charlize is wonderful in this movie, as a disconnected member of her society. <br /> <br />I never felt lost in the movie, and I loved the action sequences, and I loved the ending.   <br /> <br />My copy of the movie came with a small sample of the animated series.  Very Japanese, I watched it and threw it out. No plot, no point, not what I consider attractive animation.  But, if it inspired this movie, I say thanks!
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is often considered a transitory album, where PF first perfected their sound (Atom Heart Mother being where they found their sound). <br /> <br />It is true that this album is where they perfected their sound, but this is not a transitory album in any way except that it ushered in their golden age. <br /> <br />In this album, PF branched out to other types of music than what they were familiar with, but they also stayed with what would make them famous.  The song A Pillow of Winds is one of their few love songs, and it is one of the best love songs there is. <br /> <br />San Tropez is, I believe, lounge jazz about a trip to San Tropez (what a surprise) that the band took with their then girlfriends/wives.  It's almost a love song, but it is not the sappy, poppish, pointless love songs that are put out today. <br /> <br />Seamus shows the lighter side of PF.  They poke fun at the British Blues movement of the 60s (which, ironically, is what they started as, albeit with a psychadelic twist to it).  Admittedly, it does break up the flow of the album, but the barking dog is absolutely hilarious (supposedly it's in key, but I'm fairly certain that I'm tone deaf, so I can't tell). <br /> <br />The other songs follow a more traditional PF style, some being the first songs like that by PF, some having a precedent in earlier works. <br /> <br />One of These Days follows much the same style as Careful With That Axe Eugene, though it is much more refined and features Gilmour's signature great slide work.  Like Careful With That Axe, Eugene, the song builds up to spoken lyrics, then kicks into overdrive, then calms down a bit for the ending. <br /> <br />Fearless is probably the worst song on the album, which is saying something, because it is very good.  It could be a tribute to Syd Barrett, it could just be about overcoming your fears.  Either way, it's worth is undiminished. <br /> <br />Finally, we get to the last song on the album, Echoes.  This song is by far the best song that I have ever heard.  It is amazing in every regard, musically (second only to Shine On You Crazy Diamond), lyrically (any song for which you can pick and choose from seven truly deep meanings has excellent lyrics, hands down, and this song has at least seven meanings), conceptually (again, going back to the seven+ meanings), and lyrically, as Pink Floyd always is.  At 23:32, this song is hard to beat. <br /> <br />Put all this together, then add the typically excellent sound quality that Pink Floyd was known for, and you've got the best album ever, hands down.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Many people do not see the experimental aspects of this record. However, I have not yet seen anyone mention the various cultural inspirations. Yes, we ALL know that Meshuggah and Fantomas influence can be seen in quite a few tracks (Rosetta Stoned, Jambi). However, let's not forget that Tool is more than just a metal band. They take years to complete records because they absorb and incorporate what moves them.  <br /> <br />This record draws inspiration from Native American music (Lipan Conjuring), Gospel/Spiritual music (listen closely to how Maynard sings \\"Wings for Marie/10,000 Days\\", it is there, even the bassline in 10,000 Days). The lyrics in \\"Jambi\\" seem to have a Middle-Eastern tint to them as well. <br /> <br />Please remember this is a TOOL record, and it is a strange sort of feast; it must be eaten in courses. Tool is not about immediate gratification.  <br /> <br />What I'm getting at is that if you are not a patient listener and do not see music as a process of understanding, then this is not your record. This may not even be your band. I recommend following your own ideas about it and if you don't like it, don't force yourself to like it.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|This has to be one of the most hyped-up albums of the year....and for good reason.  Pearl Jam is back with their first STUDIO album in 6 years.  But this album isn't without criticism. GQ magazine calls Pearl Jam the new Greatful Dead.  While PJ has had a lot of live albums recently, this new studio album is great...probably their greatest since Vitalogy.  I've been listening to this album nonstop for a week, and it is good. <br />There is also a lot of criticism about the sound of the album.  Ok Ok Ok!  I get it.  Pearl Jam in the early 90s was a hard driving musical force, and this album, while not quite the exact same force, still drives.  It isn't fair to compare this album or this Pearl Jam to 1991's \\"Ten\\" because...it isn't 1991!!!!  Pearl Jam still rocks, still has great tunes. <br /> <br />\\"Worldwide Suicide\\" and \\"Life Wasted\\" are probably the two best.  But \\"Parachutes\\" is a great tune as well.  Eddie Vedder proves that he still can sing in his famous howl...and his voice has matured, it seems.  Rolling Stone magazine made a good point. (I'm paraphrasing) In this age of emo bands when lead singers all whine or scream, it is good to have Vedder's dependable howl to turn on. <br /> <br />Sure this album isn't as good as \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\" but it is certainly one of PJ's best.  Even if you don't agree with the politics of the songs, the music is still great.  Those \\"hardcore\\" fans that say Pearl Jam has sold out because their tunes aren't as hard are missing the point.  An objective view of this material shows that PJ HASN'T lost their edge, but matured with the times, and still sound great!
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album lives up to every expectation i had from Tool. Every song is amazing! There is no other alternative/rock/metal band out there that can compete with the level of complexity and difficulty of Tool's music. The first few songs alone were worth the price of the CD.
B000301YY8|2.0|This album is centered around just the one song, \\"You're Beautiful\\".  That song, while lyrically confusing, is musically good, and entertaining.  To be sure, Blunt's unusual singing voice is at times a breath of fresh air compared to other \\"singers\\" who just shout...but it is also his downfall.  The whole album is sappy.  \\"High\\" is only an \\"ok\\" song and \\"goodbye my lover\\" just oozes with sap....and it's getting pretty thick.  If you're into that sort of stuff, then this is a good album. But be prepared to not feel much happiness in this album.  I don't know what did it....Blunt is a former British military officer, but his music style is too wussy.  Key point:  while you may have a \\"beautiful\\" singing voice, as some say, your song content doesn't have to be as effeminate.  But the album altogether isn't horrible...and may be a welcome change of pace.
B000009ED0|5.0|Everday i smoke a carton of ligets, chew an entire tin of timber wolf, drink a 30 of stones and listen to this CD. Its how Kid would want it.
0517220784|5.0|I love a good mystery and Sherlock Holmes very rarely lets me down. I purchased the complete collection and now it's a wonderful addition to my growing library. Fans of mystery already know how wonderful Sherlock Holmes already is, fans of great writing should check it out too!
B000EULJLU|4.0|At first listen, I definitely had a \\"that's it?\\" kind of feeling about, a dreadful thing for a beloved, consistent band like Tool. I've since changed my mind ALMOST entirely. I've certainly narrowed down my issues with it, namely the guitar work. Mr. Jones' guitar solos are rather pedestrian and boring. In contrast, the bass is truly incredible(Jambi!!). In short, don't give up on this one too quick, it may reveal itself to you. Also, the leaked copy sounds terrible compared to the real thing. There's another reason to actually BUY it, not that one was required.
B000EULJLU|5.0|As I listened to 10,000 DAYS curiously open with a bass and guitar interplay strongly reminiscent of the bridge from another of Tool's songs, \\"Schism,\\" I responded with uncertainty, curious but waiting to see where the beloved metalsmiths were going to take this familiar groove.  I remained patient as the opener \\"Vicarious\\" seemed to descend temporarily into a clich? alt-rock chorus I'd swear I'd heard Maynard already sing in his recent side-project, A Perfect Circle.  30 minutes into the album (that's 4 tracks), I'd come to the conclusion it was all going to sound basically like the band's previous release, LATERALUS, meeting Maynard's A Perfect Circle tendencies somewhere in the middle ground... not that that would be a bad thing.    But then came \\"The Pot\\".  I wouldn't be surprised if the song is actually a retooled outtake from one of the band's earliest releases, UNDERTOW; every element, including the lyrics and structure, are reminiscent of that album's mindset of aggressive (but complicated) anger.  The chilled-out instrumental segues following also elicit an awfully familiar feeling that I couldn't put my finger on until...  What \\"The Pot\\" is to UNDERTOW, those segues and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" are to AENIMA, another of the band's earlier releases, feces references and all.  And true to that brilliant masterwork's reputation, the song offers the first glimpse (roughly 45 minutes in) of some new sounds in the band's repertoire.    It is from this late point onward that the album not only meets my original expectations but truly blows them away, multiplying the more glorious transcendental sounds of Lateralus' final third to the, um, 10,000th degree. I shame myself... Moving right along, \\"Right in Two\\" is the highlight of the album for me. Danny Carey, Tool's drummer, finally comes out and shows off his stuff, and though he's produced quite low in the mix, he really drives the album's closure home--\\"Viginti Tres\\" doesn't count.    All in all, 10,000 DAYS sounds somewhat like a Frankenstein of the band's past works, but fortunately, Tool's never released a bad thing so it all comes off very convincing.    SELECTED HIGHLIGHTS: Wings for Marie (Pt. 1) + 10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2) & Right In Two
B000EULJLU|5.0|Since we've had five years to unravel _Lateralus_, (and deciphering a work so loaded with multiple layers of meaning and idiosyncratic musical ideas takes time I suppose), I'm in a quandary over whether any review of _10, 000 Days_ can fully do it justice at this stage. First impressions are often fleeting, especially for me. Despite this, I can cobble together a descriptive review of _10, 000 Days_ purely focusing on the sound, the overall texture of the music, and leave tackling the weighty themes to other, more qualified reviewers.<br /><br />_Lateralus_ represented a jarring shift away from the brutality and intensity of _Aenema_, although these elements were still present on that album, just more fully integrated into the scheme of things. _10, 000 Days_ sees the band shift bases once again, expanding their sound while retaining specific elements: the core virtues of a modern, forward looking outfit. On first meeting, _10, 000 Days_ throws some real curve balls at the listener-the odd vocal tone at the start of 'The Pot', the epic, almost progressive rock twists of the awesome title track, the off kilter, harsh vocal engineering in 'Rosetta Stoned'. 'Vicarious' does, at a push, sound like a _Lateralus_ throwback, although I now believe this is deliberate, as its opening track status serves as a kind of recap of previous output, pulling the listener in to the dense wealth of new ideas scattered throughout the albums massive sprawl. The band pace the album well in this sense, saving the truly daring material for the second half of the disc.<br /><br />'Vicarious' turns on rather typical Tool-ish riffs and an obligatory mighty crescendo towards the end-the middle breakdown bears the stamp of Meshuggah in its stomping, jarring intensity, although the comparison is slight and more superficial than any possibility of a deep trade of rhythmic ideas. 'Jambi' is something of a turnaround, juxtaposing a driving, chugging guitar riff with more pronounced vocals and crisp, more defined melodies. It's interesting to note just how the guitar propels this track: underpinning everything but rarely truly in the forefront of proceedings (apart from a solo-is that a voice box!) - something of a shift from earlier work which saw a near quartering of the disparate elements between the four instruments that comprise the Tool sound.<br /><br />The two 'Wings' ('For Marie' and '10,000 Days') function as an album centrepiece of sorts, and unite some of the musical and spiritual (I suppose) motifs that permeate the album as a whole, much like 'Lateralus'. Sound-wise though, at first glance this opus follows from D/R/T on _Lateralus_, although actually much more is true here, and the resemblance more reflects the tempo of the piece. Part 1 is something like a prologue to the main piece, foreshadowing some themes, although it does feature a jarring guitar part towards the end. '10,000 Days' itself is a slow burning fire, appearing almost devoid of any immediate musical element at first yet unfolding over time to reveal reams of subtle, interlocking thematic nuances and gorgeous, enveloping swathes of texture. This is my favorite track here, and it represents the point where the album really forges out into a new direction- the lyrics are actually rather touching, musically the piece is understated and genuinely progressive- the twist and turns are labyrinthe and the final guitar run is incredibly cathartic, the explosion of tension in the bands playing truly reflecting a palpable emotional dimension which is never overstated or exploited.<br /><br />After this rather surprising offering, 'The Pot' may be slightly less challenging, but it is superb none the less, with the vocals really coming to the forefront for the first time and the melodies, riffs and dynamics all firing the song into instantly likable territory. Its certainly the most easily accessible track here, but suffers little, as it is immersive and entrancing. To follow, we dive headlonginto experimental waters with the insane 'Rosetta Stoned' which oscillates between crazed thrash metal, bizarre and abrasive vocals and unpredictable musical turnarounds, as well as some excellent hooks that are buried late in the song but really hit home after a few listens.  It's the least immediate piece on the record but is interesting indeed- and emerges as rewarding, given time. Partnering this is 'Intension' another departure, which combines lush harmonies and hypnotic, trance like elements into a slowly unfolding dreamscape. Think King Crimson circa 'The Sheltering Sky' but with layered, chanting vocals which weave in and out of the song, flowing from a whisper to narcotic verse in a heartbeat. Very, very beautiful. 'Right in Two' is actually slightly more conventional (for Tool) with great harmonies melodies and a welcome dose of heaviness, as well as lots of MONKEY references (always important).<br /><br />Despite some initial misgivings, I feel this an excellent album that is, at its core, another step forward for the band. It might not be as impossibly all encompassing as _Lateralus_ (or, to be honest, quite as good, although time will tell...), but the new themes tackled and a musical approach in parts practically perpendicular to that found on previous records are most welcome. Some of the fire may be gone, and I suspect this may diminish the extensive (and rather baffling, truth be told) popularity they enjoy, especially as anger and spite are replaced firmly by pathos and tenderness (and a continuing high level of abstraction) across the board, bar the two more accessible tracks. However, _10,000 Days_ is a major statement from a band who continue to challenge, explore and tease with each and every release.<br /><br />Recommended.waters with the insane 'Rosetta Stoned' which oscillates between crazed thrash metal, bizarre and abrasive vocals and unpredictable musical turnarounds, as well as some excellent hooks that are buried late in the song but really hit home after a few listens.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Avocados contain low levels of cyanide. Not enough to kill you. You'll be more apt to kill yourself by putting this album into your car stereo, becoming distracted by how AMAZING it is, forget to pay attention then drive into a brick wall.  Perhaps it should come with a warning label - WARNING: ALBUM IS FREAKIN' AWESOME, MAY RESULT IN SEVERE DISTRACTION. DO NOT LISTEN TO WHILE OPERATING HEAVY MACHINERY!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam's best album since Vs. in my opinion.  It's a great album where even the weaker songs on the disk are better than most stuff out there.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|Ah, here we are with Hostel (a supervised lodging for youth) and in this movie Jay Hernandez (Crazy/Beautiful, Ladder 49), Derek Richardson (Reeker, Bring It On Again) and another guy go on a trip to Europe to party and try to find some young hot girls and well, get laid and have themselves a good old time. Well it seems that way at first when some of that stuff happens (complete with girl nudity, sure to give horror junkies or young boys a rising action....I found it to be stupid and useless). One by one the friends start to vanish and find themselves in a complete hell as they are tortured by sadistic people who cut up bodies and all sorts of sick and twisted stuff. Will anyone survive? What will happen? Will Eli Roth make a good movie? Uh, maybe...maybe not. I wasnt a fan of Cabin Fever although I did like some of the visuals and the performances by both Rider Strong and Guiseppe Andrews but I never liked it. Now in Hostel, Eli Roth's first BOMB so far. Roth, let's make an effort. I'm sure Eli Roth fans will get their deserved horror junkie boner from this movie but it's badly acted and a waste of Rick Hoffman (Cellular, Blood Work) and a quick cameo by Audition & Ichi The Killer director Takashi Miike. Roth himself has a cameo as a American Stoner. Quentin Tarantino, you may have been clapping, cheering and hollering but I wasnt. I like you Tarnatino but I dont like this movie. We all have our tastes....I have mine.
B00023BLXK|5.0|I saw the first dirty dancing and loved it, so I was afraid of what DD Havana Nights was going to turn out like, <br />and it turns out, I enjoyed it much more than the original. <br /> <br />I'll admit, the dialogues aren't great, and the plot as far as the political context leaves to be desired, but truthfully, I didn't care at all, and who would?  It's not a movie about the political context, it's about dancing, and DD Havana Nights is a success. <br /> <br />Diego Luna and Romola Garai are fantastic, they dance really well together, everything fits in that area.  And the dancing in itself put together with the amazing soundrack just makes the whole experience highly enjoyable.   <br />It will have you dancing in your seat and wanting to get up and dance with them. <br /> <br />It's a great movie I'd recommend to anyone who likes these types of dance movies.
B000EULJLU|5.0|On first listen I was expecting to here another Lateralus.  This dissapointed me at first but after repeated listens to this CD I have become addicted to listening to it.  I just cant stop.  Make sure you listen to it straight through dont skip around tracks or anything.  Once you here it this way a few times its amazing.   <br /> <br />Wings for Marie made cry, the only other music I have ever cried to is \\"The Tigers Broke Free\\" by Pink Floyd.  The climax in Wings is absolutely amazing and just puts you in a trance.   <br /> <br />Now my only complaint is I would have liked at least 8 actual songs on the album, you get about 6 songs here 7 if you count Intension. The thing is you cant really complain though because those 6 songs are a average of like 8-9 minutes long and they immerse you musically so much that you think there only like 4 minutes long.

B000E8NQUE|5.0|Simply awesome! If you are a Moody Blues fan, and you have a good surround sound system which can play SACD Multi-channel, this album will make you think you have died and gone to heaven. If you don't have a disc player that can play SACD Multi-channel (as well as DVD-Audio) just go get one. No need for me to talk about the songs as they have been around for almost forty years. The surround mix and the astonishing clarity of the sound are the new breakthroughs here.
0156027321|5.0|I'd heard people talking about this book for quite a while, but I'd never gotten round to reading it. But over the weekend a friend of a friend told me it was one of her favourite books and so I decided to take the plunge at last. And I'm very glad I did! <br /> <br />This profound book begins by introducing us to Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel, a young boy whose parents own a zoo in India. His parents decide to leave the country, and start a new life in Canada - and so they pack up their animals and set sail on a ship. However, disaster strikes halfway across the Pacific Ocean, and the ship sinks. However, Pi manages to survive on a lifeboat - together with a tiger, a zebra, a hyena, and a orang-utan. But will Pi make it back home? He's survived the ship - but will he survive the lifeboat???  <br /> <br />Although it sounds like a recipe for disaster, the combination of these mammals makes for one of the most profound and though-provoking stories I have ever read. I literally couldn't put it down - after I bought it, I sat in all weekend reading it. I was completely immersed in Pi's world. It was just like a brilliant detective novel - I kept trying to work out how he would survive, and wondering what was going to happen next all the time.  <br /> <br />The Life of Pi is a book that has kept me thinking for ages after I finished - especially the ending. I don't normally read books like this, but would definitely recommend it to anyone. And lastly but by no means least, I'd like to say a big thank-you to Natasha for recommending one of the best books I've ever read! <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Early statement but this might be the best album I have ever heard. It is definatly the coolset package and art work ever made. The only sad part is we will probably have to wait another 5 years for the next Tool album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Pop this disc in and press play. Kick back, and enjoy that dark, sad, angry ride that you know you've been waiting for. The album is going to open just as you want it to, with a circle of sound that slowly transforms itself into music, and then pretty much takes you into that black hole for the remainder of it's seventy plus minutes.<br /><br />There are a few new elements... but why don't we just call them pleasant suprises. Like the crazy rich beats, and the way he disguises his voice, and the insanely cool changeups somewhere in the eight minute mark of tracks. I had no time to be dissapointed with this disc, there were to many collages of sounds pulling me in (and I ain't even a huge TOOL fan people,.. I dug it alot.) This band has got it clicked together here.. I gotta say, if you jumped on the TOOL bandwagon back in 2001 with LATERALUS (remember that one, it wasn't bad... you know.. but BURY IT.. theres a new, new TOOL out now... and its F'in pretty nasty!)<br /><br />Thats about all I can say. Oh yeah.... make sure the volume is up.
B00000IFWE|5.0|For my money, the aging stoner hippy version of Tom Petty rocks a lot more than the young, hot shot pretty boy version of Tom Petty from the seventies and eighties.<br /><br />In 1998 when this album ECHO came out, I sort of overpassed it, because it sounded too mellow for my tastes at the time. I recently aquired this CD, and was ready for a mellow disc, but was very happily suprised to find that this CD is actually a really great RAWKER of a disc.. it grows on you fast, and after a few listens I can't even pick a favorite track... they are all great.<br /><br />Ok, so the first song, which was the initial radio release from this album ROOM AT THE TOP, is pretty mellow, but it kicks into some nice garage style rock riffs throughout, but that ain't even close to being my favorite. No. two COUNTING ON YOU was my first fave, its got some cynical lyrics, and sounds just like a down an' dirty Petty type song should (but it just gets better from here..)<br /><br />FREE GIRL NOW was the second single, rocks like old school. Then we start getting into some mellower tunes, yeah.. but its all stuff you have to just listen to, because the great moments on this disc are all spontaneous combustions of energy, and raw feel. SWINGIN' might be my favorite, because the vocals on that track just sound so cool... WONT LAST LONG might be my favorite, due to the in-your-face style of lyrics... or maybe my favorite is I DON'T WANNA FIGHT, because of the just all out kickin' nature of that tune. Then theres BILLY THE KID, also good... and RHINO SKIN.. a real treat to listen to, with lyrics like \\"You gotta have elephant balls..\\"<br /><br />Oh man. Tom Petty obviously has a long history of quality records.. I'm starting to believe that you really can't go wrong with any choice... but really the last handful of albums that he and The Heartbreakers have released have been his best, in my book.. and ECHO is no acception... KICKIN ACE T.P!
B000EULJLU|5.0|the title of my review may sound a little conceited, but for the most part, its very true. alot of people are pretty harsh when it comes to reviewing 10,000 Days. some people just can't get past the more intricate, prog-ish parts. also, Tool's tendency to emit a mystical, trippiness quality within their music is somewhat lost on the ears of the meatheads out there that only respond to the testosterone element - the mindless, heavy rock parts. and don't get me wrong, Tool definitely rocks out on a few of the songs on 10,000 Days, but they do it in a very challenging, unique way. so, depending on your i.q., this CD will either make you really think, or will induce seizures.

067144901X|5.0|My daughter is now seventeen. This is one of a dozen or so of her old books that we can still recite. And when one of us does it's always good for a grin, even without the pictures. I loved all of Boynton's books, shirts, calendars, potholders (ok, so she and I've both been around a while) and kitchen towels.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had pretty high expectations after hearing how great this series was.  Well, I wasn't disappointed in the least after watching the entire series.  All the hype is true.  It's too bad so many of us missed this when it aired, but the transition of this series to the \\"big screen\\" is excellent.  This franchise is far from dead with new Browncoats joining the cause daily.
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|After hearing \\"Dreams to Remember\\" I had to buy this CD. Sure, we all know how great Buddy's playing is; heck--he's been at it for years. But now that he has reached a riper age I feel he's doing what he wants to do and bringing in songs that influenced and moved him early on. The CD plays well from start to finish and restarts just as evenly, so you can let it play over and over again without ever growing tired. To the blues purists I say, let go if it (even Robert Johnson was playing to the popular audience if you beleive Elijah Wald's theory as I do). If there is one flaw in this CD is it the rote version of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" where Tracy Chapman sounds as if she never even entered the same recording studio as Mr. Guy--but then I found her duet with B.B. King equally lacking: she should stick with her fast cars songwriting skills. In a society that worships name recognition, who are we to blame the music industry for peppering CDs with these types of pairings anyway? We are what we buy, so \\"Buy This!!!!\\"
B0000C6K09|4.0|These CDs are okay, but don't have the spirit of the original peices of music written by John Williams, and it's like the orchestra was handed the music, and they didn't look at the emotional part of the peice. But over all, it contains the best of the best, worth the price.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is very addictive.  I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it, but that's just the way I am with all of Tool's albums.  It's definitely a different direction, which is not that different, for Tool.  They have been my favorite band ever since Aenima because they offer so much more than other bands can even try to offer. <br /> <br />The stand-out songs are Vicarious, Jambi, Right in Two, and definitely The Pot (this song is very infectuous, and Maynard's vocals are suprising at first). <br /> <br />On Wings Pt. 1 and 2, I strongly recommend being in a quiet room, preferably dark, and just crank it.  I promise you'll need a hug after.  Great song.
B000EULJLU|5.0|this album is INCREDIBLE, if you think it sucks then it just went over your head, i have to admit on first listen  i was thinking this was boring and wasnt as good as there last albums, but after many listens and finally obsorbing the songs  it all came together , 10,000 DAYS is up there with lateralus , its just an amazing ride all the way through. Once this album hits you - you wont be able to stop listening. : ) TOOL DO IT AGAIN
B00008NRI8|4.0|Lucy Kelson is a smart and funny attorney whose sole purpose in life from childhood was to fight for the last shreds of justice in the concrete jungle that is New York City. When she hears that Wade Corporation is planning to knock down her beloved Coney Island community center, she spares no time in stopping its CEO George Wade (played by Hugh Grant) in the street en rooute to his limo to convince him otherwise. Coincidentally, George has recently been berated by his older brother Howard (the real boss of the company) about his choice of chief counsel and their actual abilities. After quizzing her on her education and resume, George was impressed by her quick wit and perserverance, George hires Lucy on the spot and there begins a torturous yet blossoming relationship. Named after the customary two weeks notice that employees give employers before resigning from their jobs, this movie is superbly funny not only because of the jokes but because of the ingenious acting of Bullock and Grant. They convey wonderfully the light-hearted atmosphere of their relationship, and are versatile enough to switch from being quirkily humorous to sweetly romantic. The antics are never-ending, and added with Grant's bumbling British accent, makes this movie a gem of a romantic comedy.
B000E33VWW|3.0|PSH is great, but it takes more than a great actor to make a great film.  This is not a great film.  Slow and plodding, I fell asleep twice trying to watch it.  In the end, I was left curiously cold by the whole effort.  Oh well.
B000EULJLU|1.0|First off I am a HUGE Tool fan who has loved every Tool album so much that I am naturally biased toward liking anything Tool does.   <br /> <br />With that said I must say that not only is this the worst Tool album without question but a very bad album period.  There is only one song on this disc that I think even qualifies under the implied meaning of the word \\"song\\" which is Vicarious.   <br />Every other track on this record is just plain confusion to me - I could not even begin to tell you what was the verse and chorus of almost any of the rest of the tracks on here - it all droned on so much without any real sort of purpose or clarity that it feels like the disc is ment as a backdrop soundtrack for people to get high to. <br /> <br />If you have not heard the album yet but like \\"Vicarious\\" (the one played on the radio and the opening of Tool's webpage), or any of the past Tool albums, do not buy this album - believe me that song is false advertising and does not represent the album in any way.  The rest of the CD sounds NOTHING like Vicarious (or past Tool) at all and is mostly the complete opposite of what people generally associate with Tool - instead of \\"intense\\", \\"driving\\" and \\"hard rock\\" the disc is \\"unfocused\\", \\"droning\\", \\"repetative\\" and \\"slow\\".   <br />Its like they took all the long, artsy droning songs that appeared more and more as the filler on Tool albums and decided that songs like Sober, Stinkfist, Anemea, Schism, Prison Sex, 46 & 2, etc should be cut out completely. <br /> <br />If I could go back in time there is no way I would have bought this album.  It appears that Lateralis really was the end of Tool.  Most the people giving this album negative reviews are being WAY too kind.
0975991477|1.0|I had thought based on some of the reviews that I had read that this book might be a biologist's equivalent to physicist writers such as Stephen Barr and Paul Davies. No such luck. Like Davies and Barr Lipton argues against scientific materialism and philosophical naturalism. Where the physicists use nuances of quantum theory to open the door to a nondeterministic universe Lipton atttempts the same through his selective use (misuse) of cellular biology. Biology of Belief is a painful read. Lipton misrepresents his opponent (primarily Darwinism), misstates scientific and theological history, confuses basic concepts such as natural selection and evolution (he doesn't appear to realize  the two are not interchangeable terms) all with a complete disregard for balanced logical analysis.<br /><br />It doesn't help matters that the author comes off as egotistical and something of a hypocrite. The book is largely written in the first person and Lipton informs the reader at least a dozen times that he was at one time a \\"tenured professor\\" at a \\"world renowned\\" medical school. Though he seems too self-impressed by this apparently accurate if not overstated fact he makes very critical almost slanderous critique of the \\"medical establishment\\". This is rather tangential to his thesis and leaves the reader wondering whether his ultimate departure from the \\"world class\\" medical school was as self-imposed as he suggests.<br /><br />Some chiropractors will savour his childish swipes at western medicine; indeed, six of the twelve testimonials to Lipton's book are written by chiropractors. A seventh is by LeVar Burton (?!).<br /><br />It's a shame this book is such a mess because there really is something to be said for the author's thesis. There are intelligent arguments to be made against scientific materialism based on cellular biology they just don't come out very cleanly in this book<br /><br />-David Mckee MD
B000EULJLU|3.0|My opinion: <br />The music is good, but not as good as I expected from Tool.  The lyrics are not bad.  I think the band (excluding Maynard) did a good job musically, but Keenan's vocals make this sound like an APC album.  It is very disappointing to see him bring the APC sound to Tool. <br />This cd could have come out two years ago.  I don't feel as thoroughly impressed with this album as I did with AEnima and/or Lateralus. <br /> <br />Great to own, listen to, and put on the shelf.  Keep Lateralus and Aenima in your CD changer.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|I don't understand why everyone is saying this album is so much better than PJ's more recent efforts (ie. Binaural & Riot Act).  A lot of the songs on \\"Pearl Jam\\" would be interchangeable with songs from those albums and vice versa.    The best songs on the CD are \\"Marker in the Sand\\" & \\"Unemployable.\\"  \\"Unemployable\\" is really impressive musically.  Matt Cameron has a lot of talent beyond the drum kit.  It's also noteworthy that this is the first album since \\"Yield\\" that Vedder has done nearly all of the lyrics (12 out of 13 songs).  Stone Gossard is MIA on this one. Lately he seems to favor bringing in acoustic material rather than harder stuff such as \\"Do The Evolution\\" and \\"Animal.\\"  Overall, it's a good CD but not the answer for those people who keep hoping for another \\"Ten\\" or \\"Vs.\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|Really, to be blunt about it, i do not like metal music at all. At least the most of it. And i could say the same about most mainstream (and alternative) rock music. To me it is just too boring and everything seems to sound the same, as if each band was secretly ripping each other off. You know? I never listen to the radio at all. And if i were to ever turn it on i probably couldn't tell the difference between most of the bands on the 'Rock' stations. And even music that isn't popular on the radio, but popular among metal heads, like black metal bands and the like, i find them all too unappealing. To me they all sound the same. <br /> <br />I'm deeply into a lot of different kinds of music. Really, i will like anything that i can find a distinct difference in it, and it appeals to me in a way that is just too odd or unique to pass up. And i happen to LOVE ambient/drone type music. And really most things of that sort.  <br /> <br />Tool is one of the few rock bands from america that i actually still listen to. And any common Tool fan could figure out why. They are very unique. And i would have to say that on 10,000 Days, they certainly hit home with the unique-ness. And in my honest opinion, i think this new album really could be called their '2nd Masterpiece', as many call Lateralus their first. In fact i think this album, is better than Lateralus, but that may be due to me getting sick of hearing Lateralus so much. <br /> <br />I would say about in March i came across the tracklisting for the album, and well just by reading the tracklisting i thought ,,this has got to be good''. And so i waited.... <br /> <br />and today i finally bought and heard 10,000 Days for the first time. As soon as i looked through the album artwork i knew i was in for a good experience. And being a long time Tool fan, i knew not to hope for any lyrics, as they never print lyrics in their album liners. (excluding the bit from Undertow) <br /> <br />I can say i was extremely glad that i waited until it came out officially to hear it, rather than download it off some gloopy file sharer in crappy 192 kbps. (I have done that before with new releases and regretted it). So not having heard anything at all from the album, i didn't quite know what to expect. But i did expect (and in a way knew it would be good). And i'm proud to say, it was far beyond good. Good would have to be the word to describe a Nirvana album. This was fantastic, exotic, superb, first class Tool. The best experience you could ask for from a Tool album. <br /> <br />Yes, the other reviewers are correct in saying that it is not a bunch of singles put on one disc, if they wanted to do that they would have put out a greatest hits or a singles collection or something. Which i find to be much less interesting, and hardly ever buy. And albums that do turn out to be all single like songs, i find to really bore me. 10,000 Days, like every other Tool album, is meant to be listened to all the way through with out skipping tracks. And if you are complaining that it's too long, well i couldn't guess why. Tool's other albums are about as long, and they do have the filler tracks included into them, or the shorter tracks that lead you through the album, and those are just as important as the hard hitting ones that you like to crank up and beat your head to. I myself really enjoy every single part of this album. Even the dronie spacie stuff, because it reminds me a lot of the other kinds of music i listen to. I find it so great that such a big band mix so many odd genres into their music. And even the vocals, when i first started listening to Tool, i had a hard time understanding Maynard. And well i wasn't too bothered about picking out what he was saying as much as i was concerned about focusing on the music and the flow of the album, and keeping my mind on it. If you just sit and try to think about what he's saying you won't really enjoy it because you'll be saying the words in your head and won't befocused as much on the music. I find it best to just let things that you don't catch go, and later on try to write down what you think he's saying, or go online to try to find some lyrics. (Tool Shed) About his voice being too buried with the sound and music... i don't find that something bad at all, i enjoy it, it's something different, and i'm all about being different.  Same thing goes with the guitars. They are not boring, but yet they do not overtake the other instruments. I really don't like music with mostly wild guitaring and some fast drum beats and simple bass lines. I like it better when each instrument is playing as a whole even if it isn't some crazy guitar solo. I really don't like the kind of guitar playing found in most rock music anyways. The guitars on this album i found to be perfectly placed. As i usually do with most things Tool does. <br /> <br />And so i made an incredibly long review. But i suppose that's what i felt i had to say about this album. So, please if you are looking for an exceptionally well done experimental rock album give this a try. (assuming you don't normally listen to Tool)
B000EULJLU|4.0|Tool is one of those bands that has been around for the duration of my youth like Red Hot Chili Peppers, Pearl Jam or Radiohead. Not that the bands are anything alike. I'd consider myself a 90's rock fanatic at heart. I vaguely enjoyed Tool when I was in middleschool, catching onto songs like \\"Sober,\\" \\"Prison Sex\\" and \\"Stinkfist.\\" I thought AEnima was great. However I must admit I fell away from Tool there afterwards and didn't necessarily catch onto Lateralus as much or as strongly as others did. Slap me in the face, but I was going through different musical phases around then... Anyway I was fairly excited about word of a new Tool release. I figured I'd come to terms that Tool would not be the same band as back in '96 and I should stop expecting that from the band and check it out. Hell, I love what Keenan has done with APC (not so much with Emotive), so I can't turn my nose up at new Tool.. <br />I've been listening to 10,000 Days for two days straight now, and it hasn't gotten old at all. At its peaks, this album is pretty awesome. I'm alittle discouraged to see that alot of people have been saying this release isn't that great. Sure its different, but that is the whole point in staying original and reinventing your sound. I think my favorite tune so far is \\"Right in Two.\\" \\"Vicarious,\\" \\"Jambi,\\" \\"10,000 Days,\\" \\"The Pot\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" are all noteables. For me, this album reaffirmed my patronage to Tool, definitely. I let a few of my friends who aren't very big on Tool but other stuff like Atreyu/Mudvayne/Thursday check this out, and both were really impressed.  <br />Definitely check this out, new listener or Tool-veteran.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This C.D. is FANTASTIC!!!!I have only listened to it once.And I know I will Love it more as I get to know it More!!!!!The only qualms I do Have...are I will admit Maynards vocals are a bit Hard to Pick up in spots,I reckon He wanted to be More in the Background???I do kinda miss a good Belt from Maynard...Like that 30 second scream on  \\"The Grudge\\"on Lateralus.Hey all artists change..hopefully...Jimi Hendrix got tired of setting His Guitar on fire,just because He did it at Monterey,Maynard is changing too I guess?Anyway,TOOL has made another Brilliant,and very POWERFUL recording.Yes I agree with all those other reviewers who reccommend  Many,Many Listenings to really absorb what TOOL has created here...early favorites are...The Pot...Vicarious...Right in Two..If you Love TOOL,you will LOVE This one
B000EULJLU|5.0|no negatives here at all...coming from someone who listens to this while driving in europe, running long distance, working out, on my way to skydiving...i would be a...well, a non technical fan...i have liked TOOL since the mid 90's and know nothing of the technical side...it's good loud and it's good over and over...yes, i was skeptical at first especially with all the \\"filler\\" talk and 3-4 full song debate...(if you follow posts on other sites, you'll know what i am talking about.) i think we as fans become a little overzealous when it comes to what this band will release...and i hate to admit it but it took awhile to warm up to the last album---i really hate that people have to say that...but if you are a fan like me, i think that's what makes them so unique--do i like this or don't i??? and then one day you can't stop listening to it...i would love a full cd of just these guys full throttle, but that is why i think we come back for more...the rush, the break, the rush...whether you think it crap or art...i guess it could be both...but you know...it's just TOOL...love em or leave em...and from this simpleton to others out there looking for something organized and hard, although i have no music background i can honestly say this is an amazing album...no, it \\"ain't\\" 60 minutes of non stop bleeding guitars and vocal it is what it is...and that my friends is: TOOL.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Since I first got turned on to Tool's music I have been engulfed with their variety and uniqueness. So much of their music is like this. Just when you think the song is over it explodes and flys another direction. This is something that you don't find in any other band on a consistant basis.  <br />    As for this album 10,000 days, I love it. The best song (in my opinion would have to be Jambi). Maynard's voice is so distinct and overwhelming. Let me tell u non-believers something! When someone listens to anykind of music and it makes u get goosebumps on your arms and makes your arm hairs rise, that is a display of music on another level. This is the experience that I have had while listening to Tool's music. I've seen them once in concert and is it by far the best ever. The light shows, instrumentals, and the vocals took me off the edge of my seat. When Tool comes back to the states from Europe you best believe that I will be there to see them when they come to Kansas. Maynard is a God, and the God has spoken again.
0316776963|4.0|hey...all the essays r goood,except a few.... yes, it is a funny book but then u can expect all chapters to be equally funny. He is writing  essays on his personal funny experiences and i dont know how much fiction has been added  to it. However, If u are thinking 'To buy or not to buy'.... I would say, just buy this book because its worth reading
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I hadn't heard this cd up untill a few moments ago and my opinion of the band was a bunch of over hyped g'n'r wanna be red necks( got this purely from interviews ). anyone who can come up with music this catchy and rockin deserves every rock/metal fans attention. don't judge a book by it's cover!
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days is brooding yet melodic, familiar yet distinctive: another step in the evolution of Tool's sound. One cannot casually listen to this album and expect to be rewarded: one must surrender oneself to it. 10,000 Days has the ability to leave you cold and unsettled, with sounds ranging from hard-hitting (\\"The Pot\\") to other-worldly (\\"Intension\\"), to extremely personal and profoundly poignant--the two-part masterpiece--\\"Wings for Marie (Pt 1)\\"/\\"10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)\\"; Tool's ability to surprise you is as evident as ever, and 10,000 Days is arguably their most adventurous and unpredicatable album to date.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Well, I finally took the advice of co-workers and rented Serenity.  After watching the movie, I was hooked!  I immediately went and got the Firefly series on DVD.  My husband and I watched a couple of episodes each night. The only depressing part is when you have watched them all. You want more!!  This is by far the best series I have ever watched. It has humor (very well written humor), great actors, and great story lines.  It's like the book you never want to put down.  You get pulled in by these unique characters.  I will watch the movie and the series again and again, but I REALLY wish FOX wouldn't have cancelled this show!!
B00000I2PG|5.0|This album came onto the scene in 1982.I was a junior in high school.After LoverBoy spread itself all over the air waves a band from Britian calling themselves ABC released The Look Of Love and Poison Arrow on MTV.It was a gtoup mixing Disco,Dance,Blues,Rock and a little Jazz while adding string textures.Most of the groups were into that mixing sounds and textures and some worked while others failed.Styx tried it with Mr Roboto and bombed! Never the less its kinda like a bad commercial,ya never forget it.Every song on this album is great to good and never lets up.Its definately a party album for us to remember the eighties rightly for that was a time period I could look back on and say. \\"Yep gotta love the Eighties.\\"
068987474X|3.0|A woman friend of mine gave me this book to read.  It's a very quick read, easily something you could finish in a couple of hours. It's filled with women writing in to Greg and Greg responding to them.  At the end of each chapter Greg sums up everything you should have learned in the chapter and Liz gives her thoughts as a woman reading Greg's advice.   <br /> <br />Greg comes off as a know-it-all of relationships and he's not.  He makes countless assumptions and generalizations throughout the book.  I know it's difficult to respond to a persons situation after only reading a paragrah or two summary of their relationship.  With this in mind though, Greg should be extra cautious in making so many assumptions about what's going on and what the woman should do.  For this reason his advice should be taken with a grain of salt.  The best thing to do in a relationship is to communicate to your partner.  If he/she is doing something you don't like, you should talk to them about it.  Don't force them to change but express your feelings about the situation. This also goes if your partner is not doing something you would like them to do. If they are then unwilling to change it is for you to decide whether or not you want to be with that person for the rest of your life. <br /> <br />But Greg thinks he know's the answer.  For instance, if your boyfriend isn't having sex with you, Greg would say \\"He's just not that into you.\\"  \\"If a man likes you, he's going to want to have sex with you.\\"  This is true for most guys but it is still an overgeneralization.  Some people may have had bad experiences with sex in the past and are afraid of not being up to par or something.  In a situation like this it's not that the guy is \\"just not that into you\\" but that he is for one reason or another afraid of having sex.  So like I said before, the best thing you can do in a relationship is have good, open communication.  If your boyfriend is not having sex with you and you want him to, don't take Greg's advice and dump him right away but talk to him about it and get to the bottom of the issue and if he loves you he will try to work on his problem and please you.  This is only one example of generalization from the book.   <br /> <br />This book is really filled with red flags that women should watch out for.  It stresses that you should be happy in a relationship.  There should be mutual love.  If your boyfriend isn't calling you, doesn't want to be intimate with you, doesn't want to marry you, is cheating on you, etc...  These are red flags to look for which most likely tell you that he isn't into you or in other words doesn't love you.  Don't just break up with someone because of something you read in an advice column (talk about pathetic).  First and foremost, communicate these issues to your significant other.  If he is unwilling to change and you are unhappy in the relationship, then get out.
B00005RIKD|5.0|This is clearly Stings best cd but look at how many people who are still not satisfied..can an artist please everyone...clearly not.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|I am surprised every time I mention this beautiful film to a friend and find they have not seen nor heard of it.  No movie will leave you feeling so overwhelmingly satisfied as will The Shawshank Redemption.  I have yet to enjoy another movie as greatly and I have never felt nearly as drawn to the characters of a movie as I have while watching the Shawshank Redemption... even after twenty plus viewings! <br /> <br />If you have not yet had the pleasure of enjoying this film, buy it today and be proud to hold it in your collection!
B000EULJLU|5.0|I just bought this a few days back and with each time I listen to it, I love it that much more.  Unlike their previous albums, I picked this one up without hearing any of the songs on the radio or elsewhere and I'll be honest in saying that it sounds as if Tool may have just closed the door and departed us for good with this album.  We all know how MJK likes to use the symbolic things and the butterfly wings in Track 11 seem to symbolize their departure. <br />Sorry, thats enough rambling. <br />The opening track really starts this off right, I like the basic guitar riff at the begining and throughout.   <br />Wings PArt 2 (Track 4) is awesome, Maynard was once again able to grab me with his voice and help me lose myself in his dimension and take all of my worries away for a few minutes. <br />All of the songs are good in their own way and if there is anything that I can complain about it's the sometimes lack of vocals.....it just doesn't seem as if MJK put alot of work into it as the others in the band did...........Danny and Adam are terrific but its as if Maynard is trying to mix his APC with Tool, which is OK I guess because as long as it takes Tool to come out with a new album, we have to take what we get, but this one....like the others.....really excels.
B000E97Y6A|2.0|I know if you haven't already seen it, you want to.  I did - even though I knew I would be bored with mindless special effects and breathtakingly dull dialogue.  But I did it, like a souless drone I marched to the video store, paid my dues and suffered for over two hours until FINALLY they put that poor beast, and ME out of our misery. <br /> <br />Two quick points: <br /> <br />1.Special Effects and action should support a plot -  a plot should not be scribbled around effects and action sequences, which I am sure happened here. <br /> <br />2.Action flicks can have a great story - there seems to be this trend in Hollywood toward producing action or adventure films with absolutely no attempt to stimulate the mind.  This movie is the perfect example - while my eyes bugged out of my head at times at the marvellous work of special effects, not once did I feel drawn to suspense or long to know more.  Instead I patiently waited for the movie to end like an idiot. <br /> <br />Rent it if you want, but don't say you weren't warned.
B000BP86OG|5.0|Thank God for The Darkness. You have rescued rock. <br />How brilliant is this album!! I have to say, I fell in love with this album faster than anything before. On first listen it had me and has never let go. Even now, having had it since its release I haven't tired of it. <br />I'm a huge Queen fan and love the fact that this sounds so much like them. <br /> <br />Songs 1 - 7 are absolutely amazing. Songs 8 - 10 are amazing. <br /> <br />This album is streaks ahead of their first album in production and performance. <br /> <br />I can't recommend this one enough. I would go higher than 5 Stars if I could. <br /> <br />Best songs are: One Way Ticket, Is It Just Me (the best of all - so much like Queen), Seemed Like A Good Idea and Hazel Eyes (love the lyric). Bald, Knockers and Dinner Lady Eyes are right up there. There's a small gap to Girlfriends and Blind Man and the English Country Garden. <br /> <br />When you hear their B Side stuff it's amazing how good that is also.
B000F6IOC0|3.0|I know many people really enjoyed the film. Critics say the film's story is badly written, but I tried not to listen. No, while watching `Underworld Evolution,' I was just thinking about who is good and who is bad, which is the best way for me to enjoy the action sequences. But sorry, I couldn't finally bring myself to love this one. <br /> <br />I don't summarize the film. Other reviewers have done it better. I only say you must see the original `Underworld' before watching this sequel. In the chapter below I repeat what I have seen in the first 20 minutes only, and you know what I mean.  <br /> <br />As `Underworld Evolution' opens, you must read a sketchy prologue that tells us about the history of Lycans and Vampires. Then in its opening flashback sequences, the film goes back to the year 1202, when the troops led by Viktor are hunting William, a twin brother of Marcus. And then, finally, we are to meet Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run from the Vampire clan, somewhere in the Eastern Europe though the film does not explain how and why they managed to travel there. <br /> <br />All these things happen in the earlier chapters, which is too much for me to understand. Some footage from the first film tries to explain the background of the new story, but it doesn't work. I have seen the first `Underworld' when it was released, and remember the key elements of the film, but even so the additional information only helped confuse me. Director Len Wiseman and co-writer Danny McBride seem to stick to the principle -- the more, the better. My idea is, `Why not make it simple?' <br /> <br />I admit that actions are better than the first ones. They are packed with gore and violence, and Len Wiseman clearly wants them that way. I do not disagree with his decision, and I find the fight sequences are largely enjoyable. However, the cheesy sex scenes are another thing. They are rather pointless and emotionless, cheapening the entire film. The special effects also need improvement, and Michael's transformation into werewolf is far from seamless.  <br /> <br />When all is said and done, `Underworld Evolution' is a reasonable sequel, better than the first one. It also knows its target audiences, and provides what they want (it fared better than the original on the US box-office chart). But I still don't know why the story should be so convoluted. <br /> <br />By the way, it is Lily Mo Sheen (Kate Beckinsale's daughter) who plays the young Selene. Why not use her more, and forget about Derek Jabobi's character?
B000EULJLU|1.0|I couldnt wait for this album to be released. I listened to it at least 10 times, what hap here?. the album, is all over the place. there are only 11 tracks and like 3 or 4 of them are not even songs. I was looking for something like schisim, and stinkest....NOT TO BE FOUND HERE. Album sucks major ass if you ask me. the only good thing about the album, is the artwok. what a waste of 5 years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />do yourself a favor, go buy the new Pearl Jam album instead, it was released the same day........
B00005YUFK|5.0|I stumbled onto this album in a Tower store years ago. I've since listened to it many, many times.  I agree that Hugh's not too esoteric here and the quality of the live recording is spectacular.  This is a great first album for anyone wanting to sample Hugh Masakela.
B00004T8RK|5.0|To me this is Pearl Jam's BEST album.......i have been a fan since the days of VS......you will love this album. It takes some time to get it, but it is a GREAT experience.....moody, atmospheric rock at its best!!!!!!! <br /> <br />BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000EULJLU|2.0|this cd was ok.  most of the songs are 8, 9, or even 10 minutes long and there aren't any discernable choruses or anything catchy about them.  normally i like that kind of stuff but this went waaaay to far with the jams.  i think that some of these songs could have been cut down.  plus most of the guitars sound the same on everything song.  they almost sound like something meshuggah would have wrote.  maynards voice sounds weird too.  like on \\"the pot\\" i didnt even realize that it was him singing on it.  there were only four songs on here that i really liked.  10,000 days, the pot, vicarious, and right in two were the only ones i could get into after a few listens.  i know that this probably going to just get a lot of hate from all the tool fans but o well.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This album is def one of their best albums.....    EVERY SONG is great, except for the 54 second filler wasted reprise.....    I have been listening to this cd, since it has been released. Nothing else has been playing in my car other than this cd. Every damn song is unreal!    This is by far one of the greates albums they have ever produced!  NO question!    The way all the songs flow together is PERFECTION    I love every track, but my favs are    COME BACK  MARKER IN THE SAND  SEVERED HAND  INSIDE JOB
B000EOTAM6|3.0|The world of \\"Aeon Flux\\" is set in the year 2415, which is basically four centuries after 99% of the human race was wipe out by a deadly virus.  What is left of humanity is living in Bregna, a protected city that is ruled by the wealthy Goodchild family and we find out that are 5 million people living in that city: which is the same number of survivors left alive when the plague was done killing off people.  Clearly life in the future is carefully controlled, and of course there are those who do not like the arrangement and who are committed to doing something about it, namely bring the whole thing down.  So, once again, a sterile futuristic world is challenged by those who sensibilities are more in keeping with our own.  If only somebody in the future had an actual personality, this 2005 film would be a lot more palatable.<br /><br />The Monicans are the rebels in this society and their primary goal is to kill the Goodchild brothers, Trevor (Marton Csokas), who is the leader, and Oren (Jonny Lee Miller), the second in command.  The killing machine Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron, reduced to playing a walking manikin) is the best agent for the Monicans, receiving her missions from the Handler (Frances McDormand), and working with her partner, Sithandra (Sophie Okonedo).  After her sister, Una (Amerlia Warner) is killed by the government, Aeon goes right after Trevor Goodchild in his Citadel to assassinate him.  But the ultimate confrontation involves Aeon finding out some information that terms the world upside down and sideways.  This is not actually that surprising, because the vibe we pick up from the bad guy is that he is not the sort of evil megalomaniac we expect to see running a futuristic world.<br /><br />There are some interesting things about this world, from capsules you swallow so you can receive other people's thoughts to learning a pointed lesson about why you do not walk on the grass in this brave new world.  The problem is that while there are things of interesting in this film, I never found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.  Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.  To make things worse, the more I thought about it the more I was disappointed that given what is really going on what happens in the movie was not more interesting.  After all, this society has been spinning its wheels for four centuries just to get up to this decidedly underwhelming climax.  It hardly seems worth the bother.hings of interesting in this film, I never found \\"Aeon Flux\\" to be engaging.  What works as an animated series falls flat as live action, especially when the cast is reduced to two-dimensional performances that tend to make them indistinguishable from each other as the story spins out.    Peter Chung's MTV series provides plenty of ideas for visual treats but it does not translate into anything that proves to be memorably exciting.  But what made me round down on this one is that when we get to the big revelation, which compels us to rethink much of what we have learned about this futuristic society, my reaction was rather apathetic.

B000F1IQN2|5.0|One of the greatest ironies of international politics in the wake of World War II is that you can make an argument that the most fascist nation on the face of the planet is the state of Israel. This will strike most people as an oxymoronic claim because they will associate fascism with Nazi Germany, which means the Holocaust and the attempted extermination of every Jew in Europe. But as a political ideology that existed outside Hitler's Third Reich such as Mussolini's Italy, Franco's Spain, and Peron's Argentina, fascism had a specific dynamic that viewed life as an ongoing \\"struggle\\" for \\"order.\\" Mussolini was always proclaiming a struggle for wheat or whatnot, and we all know about his ability to get the trains to run on time. This dynamic stands in remarked contrast to the Whig-Liberal dynamic of \\"liberty\\" and \\"property,\\" but if you recall the Cold War then you can appreciate how fascist elements worked there way in American politics as well. In Israel, where everybody considers themself to be soldiers, life is indeed such a struggle more so than any other nation you can name.<br /><br />The argument that in its struggle to survive the state of Israel has become more like its enemy than it would wish to be in a better world is at the core of Steven Spielberg's \\"Munich.\\" The massacre of the Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics in Munich is presented as the opening act on the modern age of terrorism, and you do not need the camera's final shot to show the World Trade Center in the distance to know that this drama is still ongoing. Ultimately, the film is not about what happened at Munich but how the Israeli government responded. There is no small degree of symbolism in which some athletes innocently help the Palestinian members of Black September into the Olympic village. Actually footage of the coverage of the hostage drama, including Jim McCay's unforgettable announcement to the world that \\"they're all gone\\" is mixed with shots of what the terrorists are doing. But the actual deaths of the terrorists and their hostages comes later in the film, as the main character keeps recalling the events as justification for what he has to do and later for what he has done.<br /><br />Fulfilling the injunction of an eye for an eye in the Torah, the Israeli government comes up with a list of eleven Palestinians to die for the eleven Israelis murdered in Munich. Avner (Eric Bana), a former bodyguard to Prime Minister Golda Meir (Lynn Cohen) is made the leader of a secret and unofficial group that will track down the Palestinians and kill them. His only link to the government is Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), who will make sure there is enough money to get the job done. Working with Avner are Hans (Hanns Zischler), who can forge necessary documents, Steve (Daniel Craig), who is always eager to pull the trigger, Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), who has gone from making toys to building bombs, and Carl (Ciaran Hinds), who cleans up the evidence and who is the only member of the group to question what they are doing.<br /><br />We question because like the characters in the film we have to take at face value that these men need to be killed. But the first has translated \\"The Arabian Nights\\" into Italian. The second asks the world to note how many Palestinians have been killed by Israelis since Munich. They are not the terrorists, but they do share their ethnicity and perhaps their politics. But what about a man kissing his daughter goodbye makes him a terrorist? Avner gets information about where to find his targets from Louis (Mathieu Amalric), a Frenchman who could be connected to anybody from the C.I.A. to Mossad for all Avner knows. Meanwhile, as Avner and his men cross more names off of their list Black September is escalating its attacks, and there comes a point at which the hunters become the hunted, not that this stops them from pushing on with their missions.<br /><br />\\"Munich\\" is inspired by real events rather than an attempt to document what the Israelis did in response to the Olympic massacre. What I know about the true history is that they succeeded in killing many of their targets, who may or may not have been directly involved in Munich. The screenplay by Tony Kushner and Eric Roth, based on the book \\"Vengeance\\" by George Jonas, goes out of its way to make the attendant ironies of this endeavor palatable. While they use the same weapons in an effort to terrorize the terrorists, what separates Avner's group from their targets is their avoidance of collateral damage, which becomes impossible. But the pivotal scene in the film becomes not an assassination attempt but an moment of black comedy when Avner's team is forced by circumstances to share a safe house with a group of PLO members. Avner has a conversation with a man who is clearly himself as a Palestenian, doing what he is doing in the hope for a home. Devoid of specific reference to ethnicity or religion, the words could be said (and have been said) by those on both sides.<br /><br />I am reminded of Lincoln's words during his Second Inaugural where he observed that both sides had prayed to the same God, because Arabs and Israelis do not believe that they pray to the same God. Each believes God has promised this dispute territory to them and them along, and the difference between these mirror beliefs that makes us think it will never be resolved in anything other than blood and death is that each holds that there God IS God. The judgment of Spielberg and this film is that the path taken by Avren and his men did not make things better. It is pointed out that those who replaced the dead escalated the violence and the Twin Towers remind us where this road has taken us without an end in sight. The great tragedy could well be that there is no end and suggesting that a particular course of action has made things worse is not a retroactive argument for having done nothing. What is happening could well be as foreordained as any Greek tragedy and those who feel \\"Munich\\" attacks them are projecting what they know in their souls onto what they see on the screen.se to the Olympic massacre.

B000EULJLU|5.0|I listened to this cd one time and thought what were they thinking about, I did not like it. then I checked some reviews here that said listen to it a few times and you will love it. so I did just that I love tool and did not want to give up on the new cd just yet. after the fourth time of hearing it, I was like wow ya I can hear it now and I love this cd. it is tool at there finest hour. you can not listen to this cd,you have to hear it, once you give it a chance and you get to that point where you cross over from listening to hearing you will love it!!!! then you will go from hearing it to feeling it!!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is a rare and unique band. They play with unconventional time signatures and complex rhythms like they were nothing. They keep ther music alive with a sense of deep purpose that's only found in a few other artists. They know the meaning of the word \\"epic\\" and aren't afraid to show it to us.<br /><br />That said, 10,000 Days continues these trends that Tool is known for. It might go in a few different directions than one might expect, but anyone who enjoys Tool should find themselves becoming comfortable with it after a few listens, if not immediately.<br /><br />At over 75 minutes in length, this CD is a grand epic by any standards. A lot of the tracks tie together, and there are only a few stand-alone songs. Most notable is the \\"Wings For Marie\\"/\\"10,000 Days\\" conjunction, which creates an almost Pink Floyd-esque 17+ minute masterwork of a song. I wasn't expecting it, but \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)\\" and \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" also melt together to form yet another grandiose experience.<br /><br />After a few listens, I can say without hesitation that there isn't a single disappointing moment on this CD. Some listeners might be turned off by a couple of the vocal techniques or the heavier-than-usual use of synth, but it's all so well executed that I doubt it'd bother too many people. I, for one, am thoroughly enjoying these new musical ideas that Tool has brought to the table!<br /><br />One interesting note worth mentioning is the CD packaging art. Tool's packaging has grown increasingly more complex over the years, as anyone who's seen the animated displays of AEnima and the multi-layered art on Lateralus can testify. 10,000 Days takes it one step further with 3-D photographs and paintings (primarily from Alex Grey). The packaging includes binocular lenses and side-by-side images that, when viewed through the lenses, converge into one three-dimensional piece of artwork. It really is phenomenal to see.<br /><br />All in all, 10,000 Days raises the bar in many ways. AEnima is a superb classic, and Lateralus followed up in grand fashion. Those fortunate enough to experience Salival are privy to an even clearer picture of Tool's evolution. And now here we have 10,000 Days, which feels like a natural fit in Tool's string of masterpiece releases.followed up in grand fashion.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|pearl jam is the best band making music around. unemployable is probably my favorite song on the album. parachutes is a nice, heavily beatles influenced piece. comatose and severed hand are the two great rockers. the whole album is great, along with the political message. the artwork inside is crazy good. go buy it now.
1592401791|5.0|I am not articulate enough to describe how much I enjoyed this book.  It's a quick read and very well written.  Geoff Emerick is finally getting his due and what a story he has to tell.  To all those people saying there is nothing new in this book, that is not true.  I've read everything I could about the Beatles and there is a lot of great information here.  A book finally takes you behind the scenes to not only how the Beatles were in the studio, but how Abbey Road operated. <br /> <br />Yes, there are a couple minor errors.  Yes, he does a lot of patting himself on the back, and yes, Yoko comes off better then George Harrison.  But he describes the tension in the band after the trip to India, the change in their personalities, and why they could not have gone on any further.  It puts a lot into perspective and gives you a great insight into Apple and how these records were made. <br /> <br />His chapter on recording \\"Band on the Run\\" is fascinating and all the technical talk on the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" sessions will have you unable to put the book down.  A real page turner and a very VERY good book.  An essential read to any Beatles fan and a great addition to your library.
6304196938|5.0|Movie buffs look for attractive leading ladies, handsome gentlemen, unpredictable suspense, or witty humor. Hitchcock makes no compromises in NORTH BY NORTHWEST.     Mistaken identity leads to life-threatening consequences as criminals seek to kill a government agent. Most people would be content to escape with their life but Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) wants justice. His tenaciousness leads to his being framed for murder. Fortunately the government is well aware of the facts. The solution, of course, is to hire him as the unwilling government agent he is assumed to be.     Sultry Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint) is a trophy of conflicting agendas and men's desires. Dangerous Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) is not willing to share her and for the sake of Roger's life she tries not to be shared though the latter is her romance preference. Eve therefore becomes incentive for Roger to become an earnest agent on a mission to rescue the desire of his heart.    Movie quote: \\"The moment I meet an attractive woman, I have to start pretending I have no desire to make love to her.\\"
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|The CG animation is good, but that's the only thing good about the entire movie. At least in Final Fantasy:The Spirits Within, it felt like a movie because it had a decently written script. The script is the worst part of the movie. The dialogue is mundane, cheesy, and all-around just horrible. The plot is hard to follow because the movie is more about showing off it's animation than it is about the storyline. When an entire scene is supposed to be understood by a character saying a few words, rather than descriptive dialogues, monologues, etc. like a movie is supposed to be, you get lost in the scene's meaning. <br /> <br />I love the music from the FF series, but it just does not work for a movie. They should have hired someone to write a decent score because the entire movie seemed so dull without one. The mastering was horrible too and the sound effects were so cheesy that I had to force myself to watch the whole movie. When a character is in the heat of battle and says something... how about making it seem believable??? How about screaming it, or at least putting some sort of emotion behind it?? It's not supposed to sound like some dude sitting in a lounge chair reading a dull book. There was no excitement in any of the actors' voices at any point in the entire movie. I have never been so embarrassed on behalf of a movie company because the sound editing and mastering was absolutely horrible. <br /> <br />This could have been done SO much better if they had hired someone who knew how to write a screenplay. Japan needs to stick to video games and leave movie-making to Hollywood. Square-Enix destroyed any potential that this movie had. The two hour movie was so boring it fel like 30 hours (like the game) but nowhere close to being as exciting as the game. I have been looking forward to a sequal to FF7 for so long and this is the biggest disappointment I could have imagined.
0792840852|4.0|I am not much of a musical fan -- especially distracting to me are scenes when for no apparent reason people begin singing their lines and dancers pop out of trash cans. Nevertheless, two musicals stand out as classics in my book. One is WEST SIDE STORY and the other is SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. The former is a romantic drama; the latter is a romantic comedy. Most dance scenes are well performed and find appropriateness in the setting of a movie about the movies. <br /> <br />Gene Kelly demonstrates his ability to execute strenuous dance routines with complex choreography in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN. The \\"Gotta Dance\\" number was too long and complex though. Where Fred Astaire is known for gracefulness, Kelly is an athlete. You keep wondering where he gets the stamina to rebound from such awkward positions. Legendary status aside, the dance steps by costar Donald O'Connor most impressed me. He effortlessly mirrors Kelly's moves and looks to be having fun. <br /> <br />Beyond the dancing is a delightful plot with well-developed characters. Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan) are silent film's box office sensations. However, their fame and fortune are in jeopardy as talking films make inroads in the industry. Lina has a voice like a three-year-old female Mike Tyson. With the help of comedic-relief pianist Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor), the duo's disastrous first talking film is salvaged by converting it into a musical. This opens the opportunity for the budding dancer Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) to do voiceovers. Eventually this leads to a showdown of talent and the coveted position next to the leading man, Lockwood. <br /> <br />Movie quote: \\"And I cayn't stand'im.\\"
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|The Strokes are one of the better bands making music today, hands down. Room on Fire was incredible, and this album, while not being AS good is still a solid effort.  The album starts off strong, with the better songs being first.  Some of the songs in the middle get a bit boring, but the album ends strong and has some of the band's better work disperced throughout. Another thing that makes this album great and makes up for some of the weaker songs is the fact that it is quite dynamic and includes great variations in tempo, small unexpected breakdowns, and unusual bridges.  The 80's rock as well as older Velvet Underground influences blend excellently into a good rock album. The only bad songs tend to suffer from sounding too much like U2 (who sucks terribly).  Overall this album is a worthy addition to any rock fan's collection.<br /><br />4.25 stars.
0066620996|4.0|Good to Great was a very easy and enjoyable read that gives the reader a good understand of what it takes to make a good company a great one.  Collins and his research team spend five years researching and analyzing Fortune 500 companies to see what trends or similarities prevailed.  In the end, they came up with seven key elements that all need to be present in order for a company to be considered \\"great\\"; <br /> <br />     1) Level 5 Leadership <br />     2) First Who...Then What <br />     3) Confronting the Brutal Facts <br />     4) The Hedgehog Concept <br />     5) Technology Accelerators <br />     6) A Discipline Culture <br />     7) The Flywheel and Doom Loop <br /> <br />Collins walks through and explains these elements in a way that makes the reader understand the importance of them and how they all work together.   <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone that has an interest in the professional business world.  The practices can be applied to a business, department, organization, or even your day to day activities. <br />
B00005OWEG|2.0|My ongoing fascination with the original Apocalypse Now was born many years ago and always held a very special place in my heart as a movie that so efficiently conveyed the inner darkness of man and the absurdity of how we often perceive what we 'think' is moral in extrenuous situations. It even does all that (and it is a tall order to convey any of that coherently) in an unpretentious, digestable manner so that anyone, even a child, can grasp the important essence of what is there. <br /> <br />However, when supplanting my laserdisc version with the DVD of Apacalypse Now Redeux, I was dissapointed. The added 50 minutes is not just unnecessary as some critics claim but severely detracts from the experience of the original. The original concisely conveys the insanity, lack of moral judgement and fear that can exist in war; Redeux's added scenes often just go further with the same themes but really try to ram them down your neck when they were perfectly understandable before. What made the original so easily comprehensible was often the lack of dialogue (the ol' A picture tells a thousand words maxim) because you could see right up there on the screen than it was crazy, fearful and a moral struggle. In Redeux you need to be shown again, and again and again and then told with extra dialogue too. <br /> <br />My final beef is what I feel is the dramatic change of the genre and story. The original was not intellectual (although it was easy to spend hours discussing and dissecting it), or political or even that strongly plot driven. It was emotional, which is why it was so powerful and could speak to any audience (like or hate as many did, it was comprehensible). The added scenes impose a more rigid structure and therefore give it a more firm plot which in general is a good thing but somehow not here; not with this movie. The original spoke directly to the heart whereas Redeux requires a translation by the brain first. Finally, Redeux has politics behind it. Kurtz's cellside lecture that he gives to Willard is the single largest deviation from the themes of the original. What was originally apolitical (or at least hazily political) is now making a 'very' explicit statement on US foreign policy. That might not make such a bad topic for a film but why did it have to use Apocalypse Now to do it? The very fact that the orginal largely glossed over or bypassed politics enabled the viewer to just watch the movie and let the raw emotion of it wash over them. That is impossible now. I felt like I was watching an episode of a teen drama where you get to the end and are told what the moral of the story is which really insulted my intelligence. <br /> <br />Saying all that, it is called \\"Redeux\\" not \\"Director's Cut\\" implying that it is not the difinitive director's cut but that both films are definitive and Redeux is merely an alternative telling of the story. <br /> <br />My advice: watch before you buy. Like the original, there is no sitting on the fence with this movie, however it does not necessarily follow that if you liked the original you will also like this (or vice versa).
B000EULJLU|4.0|After the 5-year wait since Lateralus and sustaining our Tool addiction with Tool-lite...er,A Perfect Circle (don't get me wrong, I love APC, but it's not the same), I finally picked this up.  I must say, I'm not really sure I have an opinion yet.  It's different from the band's earler material, and the cynical must remember that every Tool album is different from its predecessor.  It took me a while to appreciate Lateralus, with its more organic sound.  I'm listening to 10,000 days for the third time as I'm writing this, and I think I'm just beginning to understand it.  It is definitely experimental, and some parts are downright ambient (although 5 minutes of ambient sound is downright irritating).  Tool is maturing; old folks like myself were distraught when Roger Waters left Pink Floyd, Aerosmith went sober, and Rush released Presto.  Although Tool has never catered towards the teeny-bopper audience, this album goes way beyond rock and their previous work; I think of Philip Glass in terms of 10,000 Days' dissonance and apparent lack of song structure.  If you hate this album, that's exactly what Tool wants.  It is better to be criticized and scandalized than ignored.  I'm looking forward to Tool's new direction; I see this album as a transition in their career.  It is worth the purchase, if not only for the packaging.  I haven't figured out what those lenses are for.  In any case, this album is definitely an acquired taste, and has a barbituate-like effect on one's psyche; you WILL NOT feel good after listening to it...once again, Tool will succeed in drugging their audience.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|To start off, many people say this is a comeback album but the truth is they never went anywhere to comeback to. They've always been a 'classic rock' band at the core with influences such as The Who, Led Zeppelin, The Buzzcocks, among others.  <br /> <br />I'll start off with the cover, which is a blue gradient background with an avocado. The avocado can symbolize many things since it has a unique pit. On the inside of this album you see that uniqueness with the artwork. Each song has two pages, one of the lyrics and the other a picture of a face zombiefied or altered in some way. The pictures are rather good and with the exception of the last picture which has Eddie's head covered in blood amidst the rest of the band members' heads also covered in various gory ways. It's no doubt a disturbing picture but you get the impression this CD isn't for the faint of heart. Most songs have a strong message about what's going on in the world from the war on Iraq to love ones lost.  <br /> <br />I can say my political views are not the same as Pearl Jam's but it didn't stop me from enjoying the music. That's because the lyrics are done in a tasteful enough way to not alienate fans entirely but still get their message across. That's really the best way to do things IMO and Ed's lyrics shine. He's acknowledged he's gotten away from the story telling his lyrics used to have in earlier work and he comes back to that here.  <br /> <br />To start off, Life Wasted is a strong rocking sound to kick off the album. The chorus can and probably will get stuck in your head after a few listens. What I love the most is Mike's guitar solo near the end. It's subtle enough to where you may not pick it up on the first few listens unless you're looking for it but once you recognize it the song feels much stronger. After that is the first single Worldwide Suicide, which has been well received. It's easy to see why it was picked as first single and fits well in the beginning of the album. I won't say much else because chances are you've heard it. The third song, Comatose, was played live once but this version is so much better. Granted the live version I heard was horrible quality but I picked up so much more here. The song has the pace of Spin The Black Circle or even Lukin. Eddie growls through much of the song and the pace is insane. This song is sure to be fun live and the addition of a quick solo by Mike helps give the song more substance. It's definately the fastest track on the album.  <br /> <br />Next up is the song they played on SNL, Severed Hand. This is my favorite song on the album. The lyrics are a bit gruesome with \\"Tried to walk, found a severed hand/Recognized it by the wedding band\\". The best part is the chorus as Eddie sings \\"Yeh...\\" in a very memorable way. During the song it builds up to the bridge where it just explodes with a brilliant Mike 30+ second solo, his best on the album. Going to beautiful live as well. Next up is Marker In The Sand and I wondered how they top Severed Hand or where the album was going to go. Up until this point there's been 4 hard rocking songs and this one starts the same, or does it? Let me just say this song has a chorus entirely opposite what I was expecting it to me. I won't say how but it's a real treat. This song has the most politically driven lyrics as he sings \\"I feel sickness...A sickness coming over me/Like watching freedom...Being sucked straight out to sea\\". This song just keeps going strong and I love the end. Eddie really let's everything go and as he finishes you can hear Boom's organ come in which fits perfectly.  <br /> <br />Parachutes is the first slow song on the album. People have said you can hear a strong Beatles influence but I can't say since I'm not a Beatles fan. It's probably my least favorite song but by no means horrible to the point of skipping it. The song stands out in the sense as it's the most different track on the album and I think fits perfectly in the middle. Unemployable was a B-Side on the WWS single and honestly have fallen in love with it the more I've heard it. The chorus is mainly what kept growing on me and Eddie sings it in a way I've never heard him sing before. Almost to a point where you wonder if this is still Pearl Jam you're listening to but it definately is. A nice mid-tempo song to kick off the second half of the album and it leads into the hard rocking Big Wave. This song has become my second favorite off the record. I was expecting a song like Oceans from Ten since it has that similar surfer theme going but it reminds me more of Pilate. The chorus is sung fast and I have to admit I love singing along with it. Mike finishes it off with another ripping solo.  <br /> <br />Gone is the studio version of the live song Eddie played solo last year. Only this time the whole band is in it and I love this version all the more. It's a slower acoustic type song and the lyrics fit this day and age well as he sings \\"When the gas in my tank/Feels like money in the bank\\". The lyrics have a similar vibe to Elderly Woman off Vs and Eddie sings it like he did Indifference. Wasted Reprise is just a short one minute interlude with touching music as Eddie sings the chorus from the first song Life Wasted. It feels artistically placed on the record. Army Reserve follows as another song with lyrics very politically driven as it tells a story about those families left behind from the war. Come Back is a great bluesy song about yearning for a lost loved one. The song builds up to the climax at the end that gave me a few chills. It may seem a bit stale at first but stick it through and you'll be rewarded, I know I was.  <br /> <br />For the last song we have Inside Job, a Mike McCready song. The first two minutes are a tad bit misleading, or at least they were to me. I was expecting something else when Eddie finally started singing but got something else. I like the song but it's not their best closer. It's certainly an epic 7 minute trackthat includes some vintage Mike guitar work. I'd put it about middle of the pack for a Pearl Jam closer.  <br /> <br />All in all, I obviously love the album. If I had to I'd say I'd put it as their third best record behind Binaural and Vs. but there's still time to move up or down. It's definately their hardest rocking record since Vs. and you can see how much the band has grown. I'm just glad that the politics that are there don't bash you over the head and the slow songs they did have are top quality. I'd say this record will be up there for my Best Album of 2006 and I give it a 9.5/10 overall. <br />
1558908455|5.0|After the superb masterpiece Pulp Fiction, came From Dusk Till Dawn (1995) which continued the genius Quentin Tarantinos consistent flair for startling origanality and diversity.  <br /> <br />This wild action-thriller sees two brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) venturing on a desperate crime spree across America. Tarantino puts in an effective and significantly amusing performance as the completely deranged convict who alongside the dynamic on-screen presence of George Clooney, kidnaps a preacher (played convincingly by Harvey Kietel of Reservoir Dogs fame) and his two children (which includes Juliette Lewis of Natural Born Killers fame).  <br /> <br />They flee with their hostages in tow to a remote and eerie nightclub in Mexico. Where as the film seems to be settling down as a compelling hostage drama, the film wildly steers direction and plunges into an enduring and darkly humorous horror movie as the nightclub is soon to be discovered to be crawling with blood-thirsty vampires.  <br /> <br />The outrageous plot twists shrewdly make From Dusk Till Dawn all the more compelling and riveting and the dialogue races along like a rollercoaster!  <br /> <br />The special effects are vastly impressive and the energetic filmmaking and engaging peformances from all the cast makes this truly another masterpiece to Tarantinos credit. <br /> <br />
B000EMGAGW|1.0|I was very disappointed this album. I couldn't believe 50 Cent said that this is gonna be classic as Get Rich or Die Tryin and as The Chronic til I heard this album and I was really like what the hell 50 Cent talking about?....Seem he lost taste in good music when he became Rich. <br /> <br />Where the hell is Big Noyd and The Infamous Mobb, Cormega, Bars & Hooks???...how come you have 50 Cent on 6 tracks and no QB niggas???....that's cold. <br /> <br />For Really they did falling out after Murda Muzik.
6305428050|4.0|Adventures In Babysitting (for some reason re-titled A Night On The Town for its release around Europe) is an enduringly silly comedy directed by Chris Columbus before he went on to direct the blockbuster Home Alone (1990).<br /><br />The delightful Elizabeth Shue puts in an engaging performance as likeable student Chris Parker who after being stood up one night by her slimy, two-timing lover, finds herself babysitting for her parents friends, the Andersons whilst they attend a business function deep in the heart of the city. Chris is initially meant to be babysitting Sara Anderson (Maia Brewton) but Sara's older brother Brad (Keith Coogan) who is totally besotted with Chris decides to invite his best friend Daryl (Anthony Rapp) over to pursue his desires for Chris.<br /><br />Not long into the night Chris receives a telephone call from her best friend Brenda (Penolpe Ann Miller) who is in complete distress after having run away from home on the spur of the moment and finding herself stranded in a downtown bus station thats running rife with all sorts of crazy and psychotic characters. In a hasty bid to rescue Brenda from the perils of the city Chris takes along Sara, Brad and Daryl into the city.<br /><br />Whilst on the motorway their car breaks down and find themselves taking a lift from a total stranger and before long find themselves inadvertently hitching a lift with a notorious car theif who works for, to say the least, a group of unscrupulous and shady business men.<br /><br />After making a dramatic escape from these gangster types the gang find themeselves plunged into a series of hair-raising adventures. Most amusingly they find themselves unwittingly on stage in an all-black blues bar where they are forced to deliver their own song. This scene is one of the highlights of the film as they hilariously perform their own song, Babysitting Blues.<br /><br />After fleeing from the late-night blues bar they eventually find themselves aboard a subway train where two rival street gangs armed with blades burst onto the compartment they are sitting in for a showdown with one another which leaves Chris and the kids understandbly terrified. However, the way they managae to plumb their way out of this situation is actually highly amusing.<br /><br />Towards the end of the film Sara disappears sneakily and ends up being chased by the gangsters which leads her to run into the building her parents are at where they are attending a business function (what a co-incidence but then this was the 1980's after all). The wayward Sara nearly plunges to her death as she crawls out atop the skyscraper her parents are in but predictably all ends well of course and the film closes on a feel-good note with Chris and the kids having bonded by this time after their hair-raising adventures in the city.<br /><br />Yes Adventures In Babysitting is just crazy, plain silly and totally unbeleavable from the word go but view this film in the right context intended and this makes for highly entertaining and always fun viewing with sharp direction courtesy of Chris Columbus and an above average screenplay from David Smithy.<br /><br />In one of her earliest film roles, Elizabeth Shue shines to perfection as Chris Parker whilst a somewhat goofball of a cute kid Maia Brewton hilariously manages to hijack a vast majority of the scenes she's in as cheeky but loveable Sara Anderson.<br /><br />Keith Coogan puts in a straight-foward performance as niaeve and lovestruck Brad Anderson whilst more amusing in contrast is his best friend Daryl, played impeccably by Anthony Rapp.<br /><br />Penelope Ann Miller delivers a fabulous cameo as Brenda. Some of the situations Brenda finds herself in are, to say the least, quite hilarious. One particular scene that makes for significant comic value is when short-sighted Brenda has her glasses stolen when she falls asleep for a few moments in the dingey, run-down bus station. Wandering around the bus station in a daze she seeswhat she mistakenluy thinks is a cute white kitten. She enthusiastically picks up the little furry abnimal only to have it pointed out to her that she is infact holding a giant, sewage rat. That priceless look on her face and the ear-piercing scream she lets rip when she realises this is just side-splitting and impeccably timed.<br /><br />Released in 1987, Adventures In Babysitting enjoyed some success at the box office though time seems to have eclipsed its achievements, probably as Chris Columbus went on to make the far more famous Home Alone which mereley catapulted his career into bigger things. The film is patchy but overly enjoyable and certainly a recommended comedy to lovers of the 80's genre. Defintley worth a look (and is personally an old favourite of mine having first obtained this on VHS when I was 11 years old back in 1990 so it's nice to have this again in the remastered DVD edition)!bus station in a daze she sees what she mistakenluy thinks is a cute white kitten.

B000EMGAGW|3.0|It's obvious Mobb Deep has gone down hill slighty over the past few years. However, with that being said,  they are still better than most mc's in the game today. Blood Money is your basic g-unit album. Your have your grimey tracks, your commercial tracks, your tracks for the ladies, and 50 cent all over the album. Therefore, i am not disapointed because i think everyone incmyself figured this would happen. This is probably next to infamy the worst album they've made. It seemed a little rushed, there were a few old mixtape tracks, and old filler tracks that date back to the summer.  <br /> <br />1. Smoke It- Great intro, hot beat, both rappers sound nice. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. Put Em In Their Place- Older track that has been out on the mixtapes for a few months now. However, it's definatly hot and has a hard beat. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />3. Stole Something- This song i think is really hot. Unlike most peoples opinions i think Banks verse was real ill. He stole the show. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />4. Creep- Probably the worst song on the album. One of the most annoying beats i ever heard in my life. Just awful. 4/10 <br /> <br />5. Speaking So Freely- HOT!! this is the only song on the cd that i could picture being on Hell on Earth or Murda Muzik. Real raw type feel. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />6. Backstage Pass- Disaster. This is what happens when a real hip hop group tries to use the g-unit formula. Impossible to listen to. Dfinate skip. 5/10 <br /> <br />7. Give It To Me- Club type track with young buck. Alright if you like that club type vibe. But once again thats g-unit making them something they're not. 6.5/10  <br /> <br />8. Click Click- My favorite track on the album. This song is impossible to dislike. This is the type of track you bump hard in the ride. Yayo's lyrics were somewhat unoriginal and corny but his flow and voice went nice with the beat. 10/10 <br /> <br />9.Pearly Gates- Featuring 50 Cent. Really good track. Has a kanye west type of beat. Really smooth and mellow.Everyone will really like this. 9/10 <br /> <br />10. Capital P, Capital H- Ilove this track. This is the sleeper on the album. Hard beat with a rediculous bass. Another one to bump in the whip. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />11. Daydreamin'- Decent track. Strong lyrics. Beats a little weak. Really good concept. 7.5/10  <br /> <br />12. The Infamous- Alchemist produced track. Rediculously hot. However, this is another track that is about 4 months old. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />13. In Love With The Moula- Smart concept. Really weak beat. Easy to fall asleep to. 6/10 <br /> <br />14. It's Alright- Featuring Mary J. Blige and 50. This track pissed me off big time. They recycled the \\"tic toc\\" beat from nas and prodigy on alchemist 1st Infantry cd. If you like this song then you'll like \\"tic toc\\" from nas and prodigy so much more. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />15. Let's Have A Party- Featuring Nate Dog and 50. Filler track. This track being on here really shows there laziness to finish up an album. This song is mad old. You might as well throw shook ones pt. 2 on here whle you at it. NA  <br /> <br />16. Outta Control Remix- Same feeling as track 15 above. NA  <br /> <br /> <br />

B000EULJLU|5.0|\\"Undertow\\" and Tool's promotion from second stage favorites to main stage breakouts at the third Lollapalooza made them a band to watch, but their 1996 followup \\"Aenima\\" broke them worldwide. The album was a reserved elaboration of the themes and songwriting of Undertow, but the band began experimenting with eerie segues and brought in a new producer and bass player, which improved the band's sound tenfold. The lyrics, which were somewhat vague three years prior, also improved.    Their next album, \\"Lateralus,\\" was controversial. From the first song fans were turned off. I personally was disappointed by the entire work. The fact that it was only their third album prevented me from giving up on the band so early in their recording career. A week later, I realized it was my new favorite. It stuck at first, felt wrong- it felt like a band's fourth or fifth album.     This album is no different. It is another step forward, this time even further ahead, and their music, once commonly mistaken for a handful of other 90s bands, has absorbed modern musical trends and created new standards and methods. Tool continues to be relevant, blazing a trail of progressive but heartfelt music beyond the hordes of imitators that are still trying to recreate \\"Aenima.\\"    The problem here is that Tool is a #1-Billboard band. Their fanbase covers many demographics, and the majority of music fans don't listen to experimental metal bands like Meshuggah, Dillinger Escape Plan or atmospheric post rock like Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Mogwai. The radio instead churns out the dregs of feeble \\"Aenima\\" imitators and saccharine whine-punk. No one band can change the musical landscape twice,  and unless they start writing pop tunes like former prog-rock giants Yes and Genesis, their albums will alienate more and more of their available fanbase as trends continue to shuffle and be dealt (off the bottom of the deck).     For fans of Tool who do not like the album but have read this far (all twenty-three of you), give it another chance. Expand your horizons and don't take it so personally. Peace, dudes. Smoke a fukcin' peace pipe or something.
B0000024ZT|5.0|True, the music production on this album is not great.  It's not as horrible as some of the reviews make it out to be, but it is still nothing to write home about.  That being said, the writing is excellent.  Yes, it is rambling and wordy, but the songs on this album (as well as The Wild, the Innocent, and the E Street Shuffle) are the most poetic songs Bruce has ever written.  There's a mixture of folk, jazz, rock, solo piano numbers, and solo acoustic numbers.  It may be too eclectic for some, but for me personally, it showcases the range of Bruce's talent. <br /> <br />If nothing else, purchase the album for the exhilirating poetry that seeps through every song.  True, he would release better-sounding music, but his songs would never be as poetic as this again.
0192804782|5.0|The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.<br /><br />I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.<br /><br />Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.<br /><br />Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.<br /><br />Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.<br /><br />Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.<br /><br />This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published.

B000EULJLU|3.0|I've been a Tool fan 5-6 years, long enough to become well acquainted with their catalog. Up until this album I loved every album each one a little different, but equally as good. I liked perfect circle, but I never thought they were in the same league with Tool. I'm going to have to agree with other reviewers and say there are many points on this album where its just plain boring. I usually don't review track by track, but I feel it's necessary in this case:<br /><br />1.Vicarious- I love this song this song has great lyrics and great music to match<br /><br />2. Jambi- I like this song as well I feel it maybe a little cookie cutter for Tool but it still rocks and is interesting (let me point out that Tool doesn't always have to rock for me to like them).<br /><br />3. Wings for Marie part 1- heres where we run into some problems. I like Tools slow stuff, lateralus was great, but this is just plain boring. This song is long, has no direction, and like another reviewer said it goes no where. Adam Jones plays some general lateralus riff for 2 mins then adds some effect and then they go into, very predictably, a heavy riff.<br /><br />4. 10,000 days marie part 2- ok better then the last one, but it still takes like 5 minutes to get going.....if you're going to have songs like that Tool give us a double album so we have more songs but you can still have the length. AND MY GOD ADAM JONES IS STILL PLAYING THE SAME RIFF! Then after that repeated riff he hits some harmonics and goes into a solo that sounds very familiar.<br /><br />5.The Pot- Awesome song....best one on the album love the intro...this is just down and dirty tool.....would have loved the entire album like this<br /><br />6. Lipian Conjuring- some pointless soundscape....didn't mind them when they were 30 secs on lateralus...now they are taking up like a third of the album<br /><br />7.Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)- another soundscape....its cool but good lord this could be like a minute and be just as effective<br /><br />8.Roseta Stoned- I remember before the album was released everyone thought this was a fake name...does sound like a kottonmouth kings song title...good song though...wish the whole album wouldve been like this<br /><br />9.Intension- another soundscape to get you in the mood for right in two...very lateralusy not as good though...I feel a tabla drum solo coming on in a live performace...unlike others i didnt mind electronic drums but i can see how this would upset someone<br /><br />10.Right in Two- Awesome song, I know Tool had material like this they cut from the album....a b sides of this album would probably be better than this album granted that its not all soundscapes which wouldnt surprise me<br /><br />11.Viginti Tres- AND WE END ON A SOUNDSCAPE- what happened to ending on a long rocker like 3rd eye?<br /><br />Ok so ive bashed it, like others have said though it is better than alot of crap, but that doesnt make it a good tool album. Tool albums should make comparisons to other mainstream albums irrelevant. Now I know these next comments are goona upset many. I personally feel both new system of a down albums and with teeth the new NIN are all better than this. And many people have been applauding them for going in new directions on every album....on this one i wouldnt have minded a Aenima undetow lateralus or even an opiate 2<br /><br />Better luck next time Maynard....you've hit a low by releasing this and emotivemember before the album was released everyone thought this was a fake name...does sound like a kottonmouth kings song title...good song though...wish the whole album wouldve been like this <br />9.Intension- another soundscape to get you in the mood for right in two...very lateralusy not as good though...I feel a tabla drum solo coming on in a live performace...unlike others i didnt mind electronic drums but i can see how this would upset someone <br />10.Right in Two- Awesome song, I know Tool had material like this they cut from the album....a b sides of this album would probably be better than this album granted that its not all soundscapes which wouldnt surprise me <br />11.Viginti Tres- AND WE END ON A SOUNDSCAPE- what happened to ending on a long rocker like 3rd eye? <br /> <br />Ok so ive bashed it, like others have said though it is better than alot of crap, but that doesnt make it a good tool album.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|After some of thier last albums I thought I was done with Pearl Jam, until I heard the new single: worldwide suicide on the radio. It reminded me of Pearl Jam when they were first starting out, but even better. On this new album Eddie and Co. take what they have learnt from their past mistakes and fueled it with the rage and fury from Ten and Vs. This is easily one of the best, if not the best Pearl Jam album. The band is really strong and seems to have full control of the music making everything sound really catchy and inspiring. Some highlights: Life Wasted, Worldwide Suicide, Gone, Severed Hand, Big Wave, Comatose, and just friggen buy the album!!!!!!!!!!
B000BTJDGC|4.0|Looking back into my childhood there were certain films which really scared the living hell out of me. Movies like the Changeling, the Exorcist and even the original House on Haunted Hill gave me the creeps and kept me awake in bed late at night. When you look at those films today they are pretty outdated but still have a place in our hearts. Sadly very few movies today can actually scare me and I know its like that for every long time horror viewer. As we get older we mature as human beings and our childhood fears die out. Thats why as we are older it takes a lot more to even make the hairs on our arms stand up. So we all search for at least one film that will actually hope to scare us like when we were kids. Some people found that in movies like the Ring, the Sixth Sense and heck even White Noise. It all depends on the persons individual tastes and fears. <br /> <br />For me personally the thought of dealing with something you know very little about really gets under my skin. Ghosts, demons and just the thought of supernatural forces really gave me the creeps as a kid (still does today). Today I got the chance to check out The Exorcism of Emily Rose. A film which surrounds the court case of Father Moore, a priest who is accused of negligent homicide after a failed exorcism. Moore has been claimed responsible for the death of a 19 year old woman said to be possessed by demons. In a battle between faith vs. science, Father Moore is determined to tell the truth about what happened to Emily Rose. <br /> <br />I know how commercials today can fool viewers. In this case what you see in the commercials are in this movie, but there is a lot more to it. There is more to the plot and the story rather than just being about a girl under the control of demons. About 60 percent of the film takes place in a court room and the story of Emily Rose is told in flashbacks from different characters. Most of it is focused on story and the possibility of what really happened. As mentioned before its basically a battle between faith and science. It works really well with this film and I enjoyed almost every scene. The court room scenes are actually pretty entertaining because it keeps you thinking. <br /> <br />I was amazed at how this movie gave me the creeps. It goes to show you that you don't need an R rating for a horror/thriller film to be good. This movie has no gore and very little blood, but thats the beauty of it. Its not meant to be that way at all. Instead its main focus is to scare the audience and show just how dangerous supernatural forces can be. I thought it worked very well and it really got to me in parts. The court room scenes and the other flashbacks hype you up for the main exorcism scene which comes later. When it hits it goes out with a bang. The exorcism scenes are really intense. Truthfully my heart was pounding the entire time they showed the main exorcism scene near the middle of the film. Being scared is great and being creeped out is just as fun. <br /> <br />I don't know that much about the events which inspired this movie, but after seeing it I'm very curious and most likely will be doing my own research about the true events. Overall I had a pretty good time watching this movie. It gave me the creeps in some parts and it really had me thinking. The story is good and the court room stuff is very interesting to watch. My best advice is seeing this film with an open mind. The commercials never show any of the court room stuff, but it's there and it's the main focus of the film. The scares are also there and it's not like any of the past demonic/possession films we've seen in the past. This one is pretty different and its blended with the idea of questioning what is really possible.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'm a PJ fan who thinks that Binaural and especially Riot Act are good albums - Riot Act mostly succeeds in the curve balls it throws - but I think this CD is as good as Ten, Yield, and Vitalogy. While Ten had more memorable individual songs, the self-titled album is very memorable as a whole. You'll come away thinking, yeah - that rocked! The ballads, which are in the classic rock vein, don't interrupt the momentum. If you're concerned that Pearl Jam is just a poor carbon copy of their past selves, it is a return to basics - but there's somewhat of a '00s touch. I'd rather they didn't go with some of the modern rock sounds of today that I find boring. And I don't think most fans want a lot of experimentation. This is another strong best of 2006 candidate.
B00009UW0N|5.0|I get the same question from a lot of people who ask me, 'What are your favorite horror movies?'. Whenever I answer those questions, the first movie I always bring up is John Carpenter's Halloween, the 1978 cult classic film that revolutionized horror films. With its low budget and uncanny frightening experience, John Carpenter found a way to spread fear across theatre seats with loveable characters, horrifying music and a knife-wielding maniac who stalks and kills babysitters. In the year 1963 on Halloween night, in the town Haddonfield Illinois a 6 year old boy named Michael Myers kills his older sister with a kitchen knife. After the terrible murder Michael went into psychiatric care. 15 years later on the night of October 30, he escapes from the mental hospital and returns to the town of Haddonfield.<br /><br />This is a movie I remember watching a lot when I was a kid. I used to stay up at night with my older cousins and watch this when it was on TV., and trust me it scared the bejesus out of me when I was a child. When I look back at it now, I pretty much changed my reason why I like this movie. Now that I&#8217;m older the scares don&#8217;t get to me, but I am more fascinated with the storyline and plot of the film. That&#8217;s the reason why I love the Halloween films so much. The story is what keeps me going as a fan of this remarkable series.<br /><br />If I can remember correctly, both John Carpenter and Debra Hill shot this movie during spring of 1978, with a low budget of $300,000. Shot in 20 days this low budget movie went on to make millions when it was released. Even to this day with the number of video sales, its still making money. Originally when this film was made, it had no music in it. So John Carpenter spent 3 days and created the films score, which even to this day is still a brilliant piece of art. The biggest thing that makes this movie brilliant is the music. The acting in this movie is great as well, Jamie Lee Curtis makes her first movie role playing the lead babysitter named Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode to me is the nerdy innocent character in the whole movie. Donald Pleasance plays the role of Michael's Doctor, who in fact only had about 5 days of shooting for the movie.<br /><br />Donald's character in the movie is kind of like the hero to this story, destined to get rid of the evil which is spreading across Haddonfield. Brian Andrews plays the role of Tommy Doyle, the frightened little boy who throughout the movie is afraid of \\"the boogeyman\\". Nick Castle plays the role of the infamous Michael Myers who gives a stunning performance with his body language, since of course Michael Myers is an evil character who doesn't speak. The Shape aka Michael Myers is the kind of character who embodies evil itself. Wearing a mask to cover his blank and pale emotionless face.<br /><br />Another thing that I liked about this movie was the fact that its pretty much bloodless. There is no gore in this movie, and there is very little blood actually shown. Which I think is absolutely brilliant. This movie focuses more on scares (which I thought was very successful), rather than trying to make you sick to your stomach. When you watch this movie, you may notice that some parts of this film were pretty much inspired by other films. Carpenter was inspired by none other than Alfred Hitchcock, and he gave this movie that sort of Hitchcock feel to it. Where your main focus is to basically scare the audience not only with the dark look and music, but by also the evil being himself Michael Myers.<br /><br />Also if you didn&#8217;t know, the mask that you see Michael Myers wearing in this movie, is actually a William Shatner Star Trek mask, which was changed and painted white. So you can pretty much say that Captain Kirk is the one that&#8217;s stalking and murdering all these babysitters. With this movie John Carpenter and Debra Hill had found new ways to frighten an audience. John manages to put the audience in the killer's point of view, which was rarely done back in the day. Although the point of view camera shots were done before in horror films, none were ever as good when it came to giving out scares. Oh and I forgot to mention, originally John Carpenter wanted Peter Cushing to play the role of Dr. Loomis, but he turned it down. John then tried to get Christopher Lee to play the role, he turned it down as well.<br /><br />I think that the best scene in this entire movie has to be the ending. The ending to this film pretty much gives you an idea that evil never dies. Just the way it was portrayed near the end of the movie was brilliant. This movie is the slasher film that started it all. With its Hitchcock influence, this movie doesn't focus on gore or any other cheap horror tricks. John Carpenter manages to scare people with an eary musical score, and an evil and emotionless character. He also managed to use the camera to his advantage. Hands down this is one of the greatest horror films of all time. This movie definitely proves that evil never dies.in the killer's point of view, which was rarely done back in the day.

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|It's such a shame that Avenged Sevenfold got caught into the mainstream becasue now they are going to turn poppier by every album. Cit Of evil is a great album, but this one is superior, it really shows a7x at their full potential, for a second album; this is an achievement. Everyone in the band does a great job but the singer's performances lack a bit of power. This is one of my favorite metalcore albums and it is one that stands out in this scene. Standout tracks are: \\"reminissions\\" \\"i won't see you tonight part 1\\" \\"clairvoyant disease\\" and \\"unholy confessions\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|People who say this album isn't perfect, (like the rest)are the reason Birth control should always be legal. Look, the stupid should be sterilized. Tool's music above all else is their stregnth, but Maynard's lyrics are visionary and provocative. For those of you with an IQ over 120 and a love for MUSIC (ya' know that instrumental stuff)buy this album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10000 days is not an album you can listen to in your car or office. Its certainly their most spiritual and rewarding album to date. This is an album that requires patience and concentration. Something most bands can't understand.This is a band that doesn't underestimate your intelligence. I don't know if its there best album to date but its certainly there deepest.
0688145078|5.0|My 21-month-old son loved this book while I was pregnant. When the baby was born, he quoted the book to us many times, going over and over what babies can and cannot do. \\"Can't walk, can't talk, can't play toys...can drink milk, can sleep, can cry.\\"  I think it really helped him with a difficult adjustment, and gave him the reassurance that Mommy and Daddy love him still, even though there was a new baby to love, too.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I'm not going to get wrapped around the axle of whether this is the best album of all time or not.  I know that I like it an awful lot, but how do you really quantify what is the \\"best\\" album ever?<br /><br />Having said that, this is an entertaining, fun, and complex album.  Those three things are not mutually exclusive, but it's a rare album that manages to put them all together.  The album just gets better the more I listen to it.  The experimental techniques are fantastic, and are used to good effect without calling too much attention to themselves.  I recommend \\"Pet Sounds\\" highly to anyone who is interested in good music.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I have listened to this album a few times already and the first thing that hit me was that the time signature changes are amazing, it's hard to keep track of whats happening at times!  10,000 days is like the halfway point between Aenema and Lateralus (A very good thing in my opinion).  Vicarious is probably one of the strongest tool songs up to this point. However, after a few more listens it dawned on me that this album sounds like a death metal album, bogged down in technicality whilst losing sight of the songs.It sounds as though the band had written the songs and Maynard has come in it at a later stage to \\"throw\\" the vocals over the top... Somehow it seems forced. However, if you are a fan of technical,experimental rock then this album is definitely for you,  i just dont think it is as well-rounded and focused as previous efforts.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The first time you listen to this album you may say the following: \\"What the hell\\", \\"TOOL SUCKS\\". \\"This album is boring\\", \\"tool lost their touch\\" \\"Maynard is not doing good job.\\"  That was my first impression. . However do what I did:  after couple hours and/or days listen to this album again carefully (preferably during a silent night with no distraction)... All of the sudden the \\"horrible album\\" becomes the most amazing, diverse, genius, psychedelics, meaningful, and beautiful album. It is probably the best tool album. Unlike previous albums it does not hit you right a way. It is much more complex than any of their attempts (which a good thing).  Some songs start soft and turn to fire and vice versa.  <br /> <br />While I amazed by this album, I also understand that this album is not for everybody. If you are used to instant gratification and have been listening   to albums such as System of the Down and Lincoln Park then you may never get use to this. On the other hand if you like classic Pink Floyd, grateful dead, and door the you will love this album. Best album ever <br />
B000EULJLU|4.0|Back in 1996, I fell in love with Tool's \\"Aenima\\" album. It was the most inspiring and diverse album I had heard since NIN's \\"Downward Spiral.\\" After a 5-year wait, I wasn't sure the next album could measure up...but when \\"Lateralus\\" finally came out, I was pleasantly surprised! The album was almost as good, if not JUST as good as \\"Aenima.\\" So here we are 5 years later again, and yesterday I picked up my copy of the eagerly anticipated \\"10,000 Days.\\" Although I love what the album has to offer, I have to say, it isn't much.<br /><br />On past Tool albums, the CDs contained as much as 13 or 15 tracks, keeping in mind that a small bundle of those are filler tracks. Well, this CD only has 11 tracks, and yet there is just as much filler as the past CDs. (Filler tracks are tracks on the CD that aren't actual songs, but just brief clips of weird sounds to enhance the listening experience.) When I listen to this album, I feel like I'm listening to a very long EP, because really, there's only about 7 or maybe 8 new songs on here.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Vicarious\\" is the album's first single and is possibly the best song on the album. It's your typical energetic Tool rocker. The following song, \\"Jambi\\" keeps the pace going with more heavy guitar chugging with Maynard's whispering and screaming. But on \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"10000 Days\\", things start to slow down. It's not a bad thing, I've always enjoyed Tool's quiet and emotional moments. Both songs are pretty long without much tempo change, but I actually see these 2 tracks as one long song. Things pick back up again with \\"The Pot\\", which begins with some bizarre high-pitched singing from Maynard. But there's some great guitar work going on and it holds up to the album's first 2 songs. Next is \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" which is just a filler track...it's about a minute and a half long of this creepy Indian-like chant. Then \\"Lost Keys\\" starts out like a song, but it's really just an intro into the NEXT song. (Yes, 2 fillers in a row.) \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" is a lengthy epic that explores lots of different emotional areas. It's a good track, but I wouldn't hold it up to tracks 1, 2 and 5. \\"Intension\\" is a very quiet moment, similar to \\"Disposition\\" from the last album. \\"Right In Two\\" is the last SONG on the album, and while it's a good track, it seems less inspired than most of Tool's previous work. Then the album draws to a close with one more filler, \\"Viginti Tres\\", which is just a few minutes of weird noises.<br /><br />As a diehard Tool fan, it hurts to not give this CD 5 stars, but I can't be an easy critic just because I love the band. There's some great new music on here, it's just that after 5 years, you'd think they could offer more music and less filler on here. Also, I've always given Tool a lot of credit for taking major musical steps with each album, but they don't really explore any new territory this time. In fact, pretty much everything on here could pass for \\"Lateralus\\" b-sides. I know it seems like I'm complaining a lot...don't get me wrong, the music that's on here is excellent, I just feel like they could've offered more.<br /><br />I'll close by describing the album's artwork, which is excellent. The packaging is revolutionary. All of the artwork is done by Alex Grey, who I am a huge fan of and he did all the artwork for \\"Lateralus\\" and the images on the Lateralus tour. The booklet contains something I haven't seen in a Tool album in a long time...pictures of the band. The packaging comes with a pair of lenses, and as you look through them at ALL of the pictures and paintings, they appear to be 3-dimensional..) \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" is a lengthy epic that explores lots of different emotional areas.

0385338082|5.0|I bought this book after I saw it a bookstore and I thought, giving the tile, that it would be a pretty good book.  I will never regret buying this book.  The first page alone has me laughing out loud, and I remember thinking \\"I think the same thing\\" or \\"I do the same thing.\\" It was just one of those books that you feel you are living in, having a conversation with the characters, knowing how they feel or laughing out loud because you remember going through some of the same things.  I just couldn't put this book down, at all.  I finished it in less than a day, and it would have been hours if I didn't have things to do throughout the day, I just could NOT put it down!! <br /> <br />So, Emma is going on a business trip, goes to the meeting, spills a drink on one of the businessmen while she is trying to sell the product, and then feels defeated and leaves back to the airport.  She is afraid of flying, but she has to go back. So, she gets on a plane, gets upgraded by one of the attendants, and sits next to a man with an American accent.  As they are flying, suddenly, they hit major turbulence and she feels as if she really is going to die, people are praying, getting smacked around, bleeding, etc, so she decides to spill all her secrets to the handsome american man that is sitting next to her.  She gets so involved that she doesn't realize that they have landed, and suddenly, she feels completely embarrassed.  She gets off and her boyfriend, Connor, suddenly wants to move in with her. She agrees, but is hesitant about it. <br /> <br />The next time she goes to work, she sees that the office is very hectic, people are running around, going crazy, because the owner and founder of the company, Jack Harper, is there, and everyone wants to impress him. When she finally meets him, they both realize that they met each other on the plane, and suddenly, she realizes, he knows all her secrets (yet she relies on him maybe forgetting). He remembers them all. <br /> <br />I was just laughing so much, seeing how Jack would mock her, knowing her secrets, like chaging the coffee machine at work, saying Ken when he meets Connor, asking about the Spider Plant of one of her co-workers, etc. <br /> <br />HILARIOUS BOOK!!! TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B000BMSTMS|4.0|It's been about 5 months since \\"See You On The Other Side\\" was released. I picked it up on release day, but I've waited a while to let the album sink in and grow on me, as it has to do. Certain Korn CDs like \\"Issues\\" and \\"Take A Look In The Mirror\\" had everything I wanted in a Korn album, and I loved them instantly. But with albums like \\"Untouchables\\" and this one, I'd listen to it the first couple of times and say, \\"Huh?\\" Although \\"Untouchables\\" was odd to me at first, once I became familiar with the songs I grew to love the album. I figured that would be the case with this album as well, and it was.<br /><br />Ever since \\"Follow The Leader\\" came out, Korn has taken some very big musical steps with each album. On this album, the group's sound has evolved more than ever before. The pop producers known as The Matrix did not at all add a mainstream sound to Korn, they simply expanded their already existing sound. Each specific member of the band still seems to have his own usual style...the guitar, bass, drums and vocals are all similar to the past albums, and the absense of longtime member Head has not seemed to directly affect the writing. What has changed though, is this new wall of sound built up around their usual style. All the songs have lots of digital effects and synthesizers in them. I know that may upset some people, but I've always encouraged artists to expand their sound. If I had to pick an album that this one most resembles, I'd say \\"Untouchables\\" because of Jon Davis' singing style and the synth stuff.<br /><br />The album's first track and first single, \\"Twisted Transistor\\", did not have to grow on me at all. The first time I heard it, I couldn't help but dance inside my head it's heavy groove. \\"Politics\\" has guitar that sounds more like traditional modern metal, and the verse sounds kinda bizarre at first, but the chorus is really catchy and you'll soon be singing along with it. \\"Throw Me Away\\" features lots of digital effects and industrial drums, infact musically it sounds like Nine Inch Nails most of the time. \\"Love Song\\" is one of my favorites, just because it so heavy and slow at the same time...it's a really angsty tune. \\"Coming Undone\\" has a We-Will-Rock-You drum beat, and although it's a pretty good song, it wouldn't have been my pick as the next single. \\"Getting Off\\" is a really heavy one with a great chorus that rocks out. \\"Liar\\" has potential to be the next single, and has already been deemed one of the best tracks by fans and critics alike. The album closes with \\"Tearjerker,\\" and it's the first time in Korn's 12 years to do a slow, quiet song. The song isn't as sad as much as it is creepy, infact it would've made a good song to play during the credits of the movie \\"Silent Hill.\\" I love this song just because of it's diversity and desperate sound.<br /><br />If you have an open mind towards experimental metal, give this album a listen.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|As a long-time(1964) Beatles fan and record collector, I never tire of hearing the truly fab Four in all their incarnations. This 'Let It Be' album re-release provides a fresh look at its creators' song-making process, songs which still sound beautiful and vital after all these years...Although the between-track lighthearted patter heard on the original album is enjoyable, the payoff here is a chance to hear \\"new\\" alternate versions. Music is a subjective thing, and people have differing opinions, but for the record, to *these* ears, John's \\"Across The Universe\\" sounds like it's finally gotten the sweet treatment it deserves...McCartney's immortal \\"Long and Winding Road\\" is presented in a completely different take - Viva la difference!...I have a fondness for George's charming acoustic blues hommage \\"For You Blue\\" and here it sounds clearer and crisper than the original album...Last but not least, the title song \\"Let It Be\\" comes off shining and improved in every way, with one of Paul's best vocals ever - and that's saying a lot!...I'm just happy to have The Beatles!
B000ENWKN8|4.0|Wow, it's been over 4 years since Mr. Zombie has graced us with an album. Let me start by saying that this album is not as bad or as weird as some people are saying it is. I've heard a lot of people saying things along the lines of this not sounding like Rob Zombie at all, or that it's not heavy, or that it sounds weird. Not true. Okay, if this album had come after \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\", I'd probably be saying the same thing. But after \\"The Sinister Urge\\" was released, I knew he was headed in a different direction, and this album is not much different than that one. In fact, I'd say this album is more like Zombie's past works than the stuff that was heard on the \\"House Of 1000 Corpses\\" soundtrack or even the new songs from his greatest hits album that was released a couple years ago.<br /><br />\\"Sawdust In The Blood\\" is merely the album's intro, with pounding drums and creepy piano...sounds like the opening credits of a horror film. \\"American Witch\\" is a great song. It has typical heavy Zombie guitar and could pass for something from \\"Sinister Urge.\\" The next song, \\"Foxy Foxy\\" is the album's first single. It's not as heavy or angry, it sounds more like something you'd hear on one of Rob's remix albums. \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\" is the only song on the album where I hear the influence of Rob's new guitarist, John 5. This guy played guitar for Marilyn Manson, and this track has a similar feel to past Manson songs like \\"Rock Is Dead\\" or \\"Disposable Teens.\\" Then there's \\"Let It All Bleed Out\\" which may be the heaviest on the album, and could probably pass for something from \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\". Songs like \\"Death Of It All\\" has something I've never heard in a Zombie song before...acoustic guitar. It's a decent song and I'm glad to see Rob is exploring new territory. \\"The Devil's Rejects\\" and \\"Lords Of Salem\\" are your typical Zombie crunchers, both very good. I enjoyed every song on this album. My only complaint is that there isn't much new music...there's only 11 tracks, and since 2 of them are fillers, it's more like 9 new songs.<br /><br />Bottom line: this album isn't as different or as bad as everyone has claimed. If you're a big Zombie fan, don't dismiss it based on what others have said or even on the album's first single. Give it a listen, I bet you'll like it.of them are fillers, it's more like 9 new songs.  <br />Bottom line: this album isn't as different or as bad as everyone has claimed.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|These guys wear their influences on their sleeves, that's obvious... LED ZEPP, SABBATH, JETHRO TULL, DEEP PURPLE ect... but they're simply influenced by the greats, playing an ode to the Rock gods is something to be commended and boy what an ode it is! They rip it, rock it and roll it, Pretty much to perfection... No Gimmicks, no BS, just straight up Classic rock... Put this on at your next party and Rock and Roll all night long!! These guys aren't some new flash in the pan, these guys have some talent! Please rock god's, don't let them sell out too. \m/.<br /><br />update: It's too bad this band got so much over-exposure, but I'm sure they're rich now so who cares... anyways, great album, now I just don't ever listen to it anymore because it's been on every commercial and radio station ever since it came out.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This is without a doubt PJ's best output in sometime. It's nice to hear some new stuff instead of the old stuff repackaged or just live. By the way what's with the guy who reviewed this album for Amazon.com. He states this is thier first album since 2000. Does he not know about Riot Act released in 2002. GOOD JOB BUDDY!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|After I got home from school on May 2nd I grabbed my CD player and Lateralus and headed off to Best Buy. Its a good hour and a half round trip so I got ready. The walk there I listened to the entire Lateralus album from start to finish. When I bought 10,000 Days I sat outside Best Buy and opened it up. I was amazed. Tool made a breakthrough with the album casing. If you haven't looked at it with your own hands and eyes you haven't witnesses the power. <br /> <br />I went back home and popped the CD in and started drawing. My first time listening to this album blew me away. Vicarious and The Pot and of course, Jambi made me rock out like it was 1962. <br /> <br />From Opiate to 10,000 Days every CD has its own unique flow. Lateralus was more eerie and deeply disturbing, Undertow was old school rocking and AEnima was....well....AEnima. I remember hearing someone say they wanted 10,000 Days to sound like AEnima...I disagree. I am glad Tool tried something new. And I think some parts get a little repetitive but that repetiveness is necessary to get a point across. I haven't yet figured out the hidden message within the album yet....but all I have to do is keep listening to it more and well....keep smoking \\"The Pot\\" <br /> <br />For those who have never heard of Tool you will enjoy this album. Right from the beginning of Vicarious your eardrums will explode from the mind shattering intensity of the guitar, drums and the bass. The singer, Maynard, tells stories very in-depth and every song from Sober to Schism and now to The Rosseta Stone. This CD is a must. But, if you plan on getting this CD, get the Others. Opiate, AEnima, and Lateralus. You will listen to them whenever you get the chance...because....This is Necessary.
B000EULJLU|4.0|When I first listened to AENIMA, I loved it. When I first listened to LATERALUS, I loved it so Tool has been one of my favorite bands for many years. However 10,000 DAYS, unfortunately, did not do the same for me. Sure, it is an excellent album and much better than what most bands put out today, but it just lacked the power that their previous 2 albums had. One of my biggest complaints with this album is how Maynard's vocals are not spotlighted. The main thing I always loved about Tool was Maynard's incredible vocals. I am not one of these people that listens to Tool so it can take me to a 'dreamscape realm' or something. I don't like them for that reason at all, so having people say \\"listen to it the whole way through many times\\" does not work for me. I don't believe I should have to force myself to like something if I don't like it straight off from the first listen. I have never liked Tool for the lyrics either, so I don't care what Maynard is saying, I just want to hear his voice shine and overpower the other instruments like in past albums (songs like \\"Jimmy\\" and \\"Schism\\" for example both have parts where I get chills hearing Maynard's voice exploding and overpowering the other instruments. The closest this album has to that is the very ending of \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Right In Two\\" but they still don't deliver the same power vocals that I was hoping for). I really also think it is a shame that Tool uses all of these stupid, pointless filler tracks. They did it on both their previous albums as well, but at least they usually led into other songs, whereas 2 of them on here are entirely pointless and used up space that could have been used for another song (which, after 5 years on each cd, there should be NO sound effects tracks on any of their cds). Another huge tragedy to this album is the song \\"Rosetta Stoned\\". The music on this song was superb, but the vocals are beyond pathetic. I understand he is supposed to sound like a mental patient, but I would have MUCH rather heard him sing like normal through this song, because it certainly had potential to be an amazing song. The vocals destroyed it though. Again, Maynard has an incredible voice and so I don't want to hear him always distorting it and making it sound like he is singing into a child's toy walkie talkie. The ONLY part that saves this song from being complete garbage is between 8:38 - 9:15 in the song where he sings normal. That part of the song sounds brilliant, but it is not enough to rescue the rest of the song. My final complaint (and apparently a first) is the album packaging. Sure, the case and artwork looks neat when you use the sterepscopic lenses, but I would have much rather had it in a normal jewel case. First of all, my copy has the booklet glued in it crooked, so everytime I close the case, one corner of the booklet gets bent backwards. The second complaint is that the pouch the cd goes into scratches the cd. After only taking it out 3 times, I am seeing scratches on the bottom of the cd, whereas if it was secured in a plastic case then it would not have scratched so easily. And finally, the case is too big to fit anywhere in or on my CD shelf where I keep all of my other albums. With all of that being said, the album is still good. The songs where Maynard actually sings (with the exception of \\"Rosetta Stoned\\" and \\"Intension\\") are really good. My favorite songs were \\"Right In Two\\", \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"10,000 Days (Wings Part 2)\\". I also have to say that this album is far better than the latest release from A Perfect Circle called EMOTIVE (where only the songs \\"Passive\\" and \\"What's Going On\\" were worth listening to). Also I like 10,000 DAYS much more than both OPIATE EP and UNDERTOW. But overall, it is my 3rd favorite Tool album. I hope the next album will not put Maynard to the back of the mix like this one did and I also hope it won't be another 5 years until the next Tool album comes out, because 10,000 DAYS will certainly not keep me occupied that long, whereas AENIMA and LATERALUS both did. Hopefully it will just sound more like those two as well. I'd rather have too much of a good thing than not enough. Nonetheless, I will still be listening to this album for quite some time to come.ereas AENIMA and LATERALUS both did. Hopefully it will just sound more like those two as well.

B00004NHCC|5.0|I'm a man of few words, but many CDs. This is in my top 20 secure CD case. All the tracks are excellent, but, September Song is my favorite. GET IT!
B0006VYG62|5.0|I first read this book when I was 12, and to my English teacher's horror: I received the question \\"Does your mother know you're reading that!?\\" to which I had the all-too-smug pleasure of being able to honestly reply that \\"Yes, she does, as she is the one who suggested it.\\"<br /><br />The Bell Jar is just incredible, hands down.  I am not the kind of reader who regards it as a sort of proto-feminist canon, instead, I try to limit myself to taking it in through its most legitimate, face-value feeling.  There is a \\"realness\\" to it that is just too good.<br /><br />As poor a context for crediting it with anything positive as it is, it was my first literary introduction to New York City.  There are scenes in it that, even now- years later, stand out so clearly in my mind: when she's walking down the street in the midle of the night, drunk out of her mind, and yet somehow lucid enough to find her way home- tracing her hand along the sides of buildings all the way; or the time she stands outside, stories and stories up in the building she's staying in, and proceeds to throw all her clothes out the window, one by one, floating away in the New York midnight breeze.<br /><br />There is a numbness to the story that trudges along like a silent locomotive: you know the tracks are out ahead and the crash is imminent, you just don't know how, or when, or where, or just how bad it will be.  And it is bad, it is really bad, but that's also why it's so good.  Not to say that tragedy is a hallmark of literary worth, but the tragedy \\"works\\" here because it is just simply too real.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, it is a little disturbing that it ends well, when Plath, herself did not.  Yet, in the end, maybe that is the best irony of it?  Regardless, it's one of my favorite books.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This CD has been criticized for containing lots of filler and what not, but this so called \\"filler\\" is all part of the genious if you ask me. Some relatable songs from this album to other Tool songs on other albums could be 46 & 2, Hooker w/ a Pen15, Reflection, Parabol, Disposition, The Grudge, and a faster paced Schism for the song 'The Pot'... in a way. This entire CD is really unique on it's own level. Entirely original material makes for a VERY different listening experience, but still sticks to traditional Tool sounding drum beats, guitar riffs, and bass guitar riffs. Keenan goes to the limit on these lyrics, ranging from people's mentality towards violence (Vicarious), and a man who visits Area 51 (Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned) which is pretty funny if you looks up the lyrics. <br /> <br />Overall, I'd have to reconmend this CD to any Tool fan, or non-Tool fan, and this excellent addition to any CD collection gets a solid 5/5 from me.
B00004XONN|5.0|I love this album: it's incredible.  I first heard it at a very impressionable age in high school.  I grew up in the mid west; it was in the middle of winter; there was snow on the ground; everything was bleak, etc.  I think that, in at least some ways, is the perfect context to take in Kid A: intense adolescent sexual and rebelious angst, coupled with that certain post-industrial alienation of all midwestern cities in the winter: a feeling and a quality I like to swear nowhere else has (though I know I'm wrong).<br /><br />Kid A is not the first Radiohead album you would ideally listen to.  The best way to get into Radiohead is to move chronologically; but of course I didn't.  It is not Ok Computer, even though it is more similar to it than the other previous albums.  It is less accessible: you don't hear the first \\"conventional\\" song until the fourth track, albeit it is entirely worth it to play through to that point as the song is \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" which is just incredible.<br /><br />However, I like what Wikipedia currently has to say on criticism of the album, as is excerpted from, bellow:<br /><br />\\"Finally, Kid A attracted another sort of criticism: that it wasn't as radical as advertised. Canadian post-rock collective Godspeed You Black Emperor! took issue with Radiohead's nonconformist stance given their major label backing, while underground electronic hero Aphex Twin, himself an influence on Kid A, didn't get the big deal. People who had been listening to less commercial forms of music for ages didn't like the way Radiohead had \\"co-opted\\" them, and although always giving credit to their influences, was now being given all the credit themselves in reviews by a musically ignorant or closed minded mainstream media. Indie rock critics in 2000 and 2001 would often cite some lesser known album that was similar to what Radiohead was doing but supposedly much more interesting, Hood's Cold House for example. These views, however, reflected the distinct minority of people who had actually heard music further off the radar than Radiohead.\\"<br /><br />Whoever wrote this makes a really good point that this was not the epitome, or the \\"ultimate\\" in this style of music at the time of 2000, and that Radiohead, in some ways, is more of a quasi-experimental art rock mainstream to lesser-knowns.  I think that's a valid point.  Go check out the rest of the Wikipedia review if you're looking for a really sound, well-informed critique.<br /><br />Regardless, this is still an amazing album.  It is extremely atmospheric and, taken as a whole, feels very artistic- whatever that even means.

0064404994|5.0|C.S. Lewis writes an inspiring tale of four young children who stumble upon a wardrobe that leads to a magical land called Narnia. Lucy, the youngest, is the first to find Narnia, and while she is there, she befriends a fawn named Thomas. Thomas tells her of the evil ice queen who cast a horrible spell that made it constantly winter without Christmas in Narnia until two daughters of Eve and two sons of Adam arrive to save the land. Complications arise when Edmund is bribed and betrayed by the evil ice queen who promises that he will become prince if he gives the location of his other siblings. The other three young children and eventually Edmund decide to help Narnia, and they begin a dangerous yet exciting fight against the evil ice queen. The story is filled with memorable and inspiring characters especially Aslan, the true and righteous ruler of Narnia. The novel is incredibly moving, and C.S. Lewis delivers a  meaningful message to his readers. It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike, and I recommend that everyone read this beautiful story.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This is my first album review. So bare with me. Ok to the album.. Like many said on here every tool album is different. Each take more then one listen to grasp. This album tends to be their most \\"accessible\\"... compared to the others. Its a good album for people who are new to tool. Yes i am a toolhead. I believe this is an excellent album from start to finish except a few of the filler tracks as mentioned in other reviews. This is tools most \\"Pink Floydish\\" album meaning this is a more progressive style of tool. With it having 2 or 3 songs that clock in at over 10 minutes. The samples of the thunder in the background during 10,000 days (the song) etc. Tool also announced this album was going to be a political album... so lyrically they want it to be more accessible, im not taking up for the band for all the people who dont think this is \\"arty\\" enough haha. Yes lateralus was a dark progressive album with weird time signatures and etc. I'll admit tool doesnt connect with everyone. Also, I am a singer/songwriter/keyboardist when you understand the composition of music, you respect this band a lot. Especially with a singer like maynard james keenan who has a very dynamic vocal range and daney carey's amazing drumming... And to others who said Tools sold out... The music industry is focused mainly on Punk,Emo,Rappers,Pop and stupid alternative bands with songs about drugs... how orginal. Give tool a break... all great bands have to fall down the hill sooner or later. I think too many people were expecting something complex along the lines of lateralus. I consider this an excellent album especially for where the music industry is going. To be honest when i first heard it i was kind of drowsy but it was also late at night...so i didnt connect with it on the first listen and the more i listened to it the more it grew on me. If your not a patient listener then dont waste your time with tool.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Don't be fooled by 0-to-1-stars reviews.  Most folks who give this album such a low grade do so just because Pearl Jam 'is not what they used to be in the glorious times of Ten and Vs.'; or because Pearl Jam 'is boring and doesn't rock by today's standards'; or because 'between Binaural, Riot Act and PJ/Avocado there is no difference'. <br /> <br />All these arguments are misleading.  What is the problem if PJ is not the same as Ten or Versus? I don't think many music bands around do the same stuff after 15 years... The musical and lyrical concerns of the band cannot be the same.  The listeners (us) are not the same either.  When I became a Pearl Jam's fan in the 1990s I cared about them for many reasons that are already over.  I still enjoy the older songs, and I do think they still are good music, but I don't judge Pearl Jam's work today by the standards I had then.  I judge them according to my expectations in 2006:  Wonderful, pure rock music, with solid guitars, some interesting lyrics, great drums, etc.   <br /> <br />PJ's latest album, \\"Pearl Jam\\" has great music and is, indeed, a 'must' for fans, and a 'you-should-give-it-a-try'for non-fans who want to listen to good rock n' roll.  It compares favorably to recent works because it is a more coherent album, one that you can listen continuously without skipping songs.  I don't care whether it has 'another Light Years' or 'another Corduroy'.  It's just what it is:  A great album by a great band.
0060245867|5.0|\\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\" is the first book my son can recite by memory - and not miss a single word.   <br /> <br />I'd heard of this book from other parents as \\"not to be missed\\" titles (along with \\"Guess How Much I Love You?\\" \\"Chick A Chick A Boom Boom\\" etc) and I finally stumbled upon a copy at our (microscopic) local book seller. <br /> <br />The illustrations are adorable.  We discover something new each time we examine the pictures.  The pages are splashes of color that any child would love, from toddlers to school age.   <br /> <br />We have ventured into \\"Pig\\" and \\"Moose\\" territory recently and haven't been disappointed.  Any Numeroff is a welcome addition to my son's library.
B000ETQRCM|2.0|...like some other reviews stated, this disc is much like Riot Act in that it has the same crappy production (the drums sound flat and lame) and the same forgettable tunes. At least Riot Act had \\"Love Boat Captain\\", I don't think this CD has one song that's even as good as that. I don't think they really 'have it' anymore...too bad, they were once relevant.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|i can remember the first time that i heard \\"ten\\" down in virginia beach on my senior class trip back in 1992 and the feeling that it gave me. i was in awe. this newest, self titled release, gives me that same feeling.  <br /> <br />sure, it's easy to pick on pearl jam because riot act, binaural, and some degree, yield, weren't as radio friendly as the first three albums. if every pearl jam album sounded just like \\"ten,\\" they'd be creed.  <br /> <br />i'd like to sit here and critique each song, but i won't. life wasted, world wide suicide, big wave, comatose, markers in the sand are some pretty rockin' song. gone just gave me chills. anyway, love 'em or hate 'em, you're just going to have to face the fact that pearl jam never left. listening to this album has made me that much more anxious to see them for the third time on may 13th in hartford.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|Oh my God... this album is absolutely fabulous. I'll admit, I wasn't so sure that I'd enjoy it... so I did download it first. And after I listened to it, I immediately went out and bought it. It was so fantastic. David Gilmour is ageless, I swear... he doesn't sound a day over his twenties when he sings... and his guitar playing is great. I've always told everyone that he was probably one of the most underrated guitarists of all time because he was still shadowed by Syd Barrett and no one really spoke of him. My personal favorites are \\"On An Island,\\" \\"Then I Close My Eyes,\\" and \\"The Blue.\\" But... every track is great... well, except for \\"Take A Breath.\\" It's quite repetitive and annoying. But overall... fantastic album! Highly recommend!
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|\\"Once\\" and \\"Wishmaster\\" are my favorite Nightwish releases but I'm afraid that with Tarja leaving the band, they will suck with their next one.  The band is known for having a great haunting female opera voice and they are giving that up.  I very much doubt that they can find someone to match those vocals and as with every band that loses their vocalist (if the vocalist was unique like we have here), Nightwish are doomed to go back into obscurity and eventually die.  Maybe someday they'll re-unite and do another album together, but by then it will be too late (see Iron Maiden).

B00005JOFQ|4.0|I am in the military and i liked this movie, i thought this movie was great and had a great plot, the only reason i gave it a four not a five was it was drawn out a litle too far, and i didn't care for the ending but something had to happen, but i hated it and in a wierd way liked the ending, but i would highly advise others to watch it and the scenes are not as explicit as everyone speaks ok, they had some good kissing scenes but other than that you see some butt shots and one sex scene in shich you do no see anything but know whas going on, thats it, well like i said before great movie.
B000002KIE|5.0|Pistols were and are the best punk band.I have got a huge bump on my head after listening to this cd.I put a hole in the god damn wall.Realy banged my head to this one.Now i got two copies of this Cd, dont know where the other one came from.Got 2 computers also.Hey got 2 of everything,going to have alot of fun now.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|I orginally saw this movie expecting it to live up to all the hype such as being told it was \\"one of the movies that will change the cinema forever.\\" The movie itself is simplistic seen from a casual observer. You see the forbidden love/romance but, I was not convince that the love between Jack & Ennis was geniune you really see a few moments between here and there that make you feel as though they have a love connection- but the moments are so brief you cannot real see the true connection between the two.<br /><br />The movie taps into gay issues- such as hidden romance- not being able to reveal your \\"true self\\" or being misunderstood in society. For that the movie might change the cinema forever- making more movies that relate to gay romance/gay romance more accepted(because how it is NOT accepted in society in the movie).<br /><br />Ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him. Both men do have families- and the beginning of both marriages seem almost like a sham or something that would have NEVER worked out regardless of how much either partner tired. The wives are portrayed as cold, non-responsive, and un-thoughtful... leading to perhaps that DIRE need Ennis & Jack have to be together and retreat to the place they intially fell in love \\"Brokeback Mountain.\\"<br /><br />But, I seriously doubt that \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will be here for generations or become the classic of this decade like \\"Titanic\\" or \\"Casablanca\\" will always live on. The truth is the movie has recieved the hype not for the movie itself but mainly the story matter- never has a gay romance movie gone mainstream or been accepted for that fact \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" will shape the history of the cinema and the United States. But, I highly doubt that future generations will look upon the movie as a \\"classic\\" but, more as a meer stepping stone in politics and society's views.<br /><br />If you don't want to see the movie for religious reasons or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie. All in all if you like simple romances and expect a simple movie/with simple concepts than you will enjoy this movie... hopeful this is just a drop in the bucket for future films/the country.or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie.

B000000OU0|5.0|Some Live albums tend to be difficult to listen to as the recording can be poor or there is too much background noise. This is definitely the case for \\"Hell Freezes Over\\". One of the greatest live albums I've never heard, it's a definite must of Eagles fans. A true testament that the band can withstand the test of time, I've never heard the songs sound so beautiful as they do on this album. With the addition of newly recorded songs, it's hard to go with this album in your collection. The only reason I didn't play it is because it's missing some of my more favorite Eagles songs. <br />
B000E8QVWY|4.0|\\"Walk The Line\\" is a powerful portrayal to the human spirit, love, and the struggle of the crazy dream. The movie in a sense is a great bio-music pic... much like \\"Ray\\" or \\"Beyond The Sea\\". But, this movie will not just make fans of Johnny Cash but will appeal to, all movie-goers . The story focuses mainly on the love affair Cash had with June Carter rather than a 'bunch of facts' that relate to Cash's life.<br /><br />The love affair with Cash is not only interesting but, it is relatable and unbelievable sweet. Reese Witherspoon got a well-deserved Oscar for her performance- she gives perhaps the most honest portrayal ever done on June Carter Cash- a smart, intelligent, family orriented women- (which Reese also is).<br /><br />Phoenix looks the part- but in this movie he actually acts the part too- and deserved an Oscar for his performance. The performance is so authentic it is hard to seperate the man from the legend- and the actor from the man. He is GREAT and gives the PERFORMANCE that Cash himself would be proud of.<br /><br />What is even more amazing is the music-both actors sing their songs and REALLY well- the music fits in well with the period and done in chroniological order that makes sense- unlike most bio-music pics.<br /><br />The movie is definately one of the movies that is \\"must see\\" the movie is heartwarming, heart-breaking,and amazingly humorous at times...like when Johnny is a rut financially, loses his car, and is on drugs- he walks for miles to June Carter's house a ritual he calls his \\"June Carter love walk.\\" Both actors give great performances and enduringly sweet. This is definately a movie I'll watch more than once and one to have in your collection!!! Hit the buy now button- and remember to WALK THE LINE!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|As a long-time Tool fan I was hyping up 10,000 Days and expecting an amazing follow up to Lateralus. I heard that Tool was going back to their Aenima roots which pleased me since that is my favorite album by any band. I was mistaken, though. It is a departure from any record released in their fifteen years together. And it's amazing to boot. <br /> <br />Musically, Tool is tighter than ever. One of the excellent successes of 10,000 Days is the unity between band members. Justin really shows what he can do on the bass this record after being vicariously (heheh) scrutinized by fans on Lateralus. Adam leads the powerhouse of a band with his guitar, which is one of the focuses of the new album. Of course, we received what we all expected from Danny with his demonic drum riffs.  <br /> <br />Maynard delivers as usual with the more variation in his vocals on any album previously released. His voice is as sharp as a knife on the opener, Vicarious, especially when he sings \\"Part vampire/Part warrior/Carnivore and voyeur.\\" In Jambi his voice travels from soothing to chaotic in seven glorious minutes. The Wings (Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days) together highlight the album. In a side we've never seen of Maynard James Keenan in Tool, he sings compassionately and opens up to his fans to reveal personal lyrics. The Wings are epic, clocking together as 17 minutes and 24 seconds, and probably my favorite part of the album. Anyone who doubted Tool's anti-mainstream position on music when looking at the album title \\"10,000 Days\\" will be blown away once they find the meaning to be about MJK's mother, Judith Marie Keenan, who spent 10,000 Days in pain as a paralyzed patient. The Pot shows how much MJK can change his voice in a shocking high pitch beginning. That song is so addictingly fun to listen to and, politcally, the lyrics are superb. The second epic on the disc, Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned, displays the classic odd Tool and is a direct sequel to Lateralus's Faaip De Oaid. The song, which is an alien experience told from the perspective of a drug-induced man, is one of the craziest songs on 10,000 Days and probably the finest musically--if one can get past the odd lyrics. Intension and Right In Two are calming, beautiful pieces with the former being very similar to Reflection from the previous cd. The outro, Viginti Tres is an odd song which involves the sounds of wings and buzzing with the simple words of \\"The System\\" being said in a demonic voice. <br /> <br />Overall, the cd is a solid release. Tool generally cut back on the filler, aside from Lipan Conjuring (which I really enjoy) and Viginti Tres, and focused more on music this time around. The artwork is as amazing as ever and features my favorite artist, Alex Grey, who did the cd booklet for Lateralus. The stereo-optic glasses are not a gimmick either--Adam Jones has been noting the effect of stereo-optic vision on the human mind for the past few years and hoped that it would provide more interaction between 10,000 Days and the listener. I really enjoy the whole package and though it took me several listens to get into, it is a must buy for any rock fan. <br /> <br />5 stars.
B000EULJLU|2.0|I love tool, but after aenima they ran out of steam. Lateralus has it's moments and so does 10,000 days, but they're both disappointing, even more so on 10,000 days. How can they take 5 years to release an album that only has 5 or 6 \\"actual\\" songs on it!! Vicarious is a rehash of Schism, does Tool really think we're idiots? When Tool release their next album in 5 years, I think I'll just hang on to my money.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|Pearl jam's time has come and gone....along time ago...They havent released an album worth listening to in years, and this is no exception.  Riot act must've been the worst album released in years and this is close behind.  Die hard PJ fans are gonna jump on me for saying this, but they are a washed up crappy band.. Dont get me wrong, they used to rock..10, VS, and even vitology were great albums, but there at their end.  I had hope for this album, but yet again severly dissapointed.  Eddie veder needs to stop concentrating on politics and start concentrating on his music cause in my opinion both of them suck.  There is no taste in this album whatsosver.  Nothing new, nothing original, nothing that i can even sit through another listen and not want to turn it off.  Sorry Eddie, but im movin on my friend...

B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been a listener of this artistic and more often than not ecletic band since the beginning. Tool never ceses to amaze me, with tribal beats and electric guitars blending like they were invented for each other this album will kick your a**. If you are the type of person who feels music and not just plays it for background noise this album is guarenteed to send millions of shivers up your spine and down your toes. I am so thankful that in this new wave of 80's hair bands refered to as \\"emo\\" a band still exists to remind us why our parents hated rock and we couldn't imagine listening to anything else.  <br /> <br />Thank you guys, you have once again taught us that drugs really have done some great things for us. LOL
B000EULJLU|5.0|Listening to the latest album from start to finish is like a journey. Each track affects your emotions in such different ways. I think I can safely say this is a masterpiece. Once again Tool has delivered. I would like to add that Lost Keys is one of the best pieces of music I have ever had the chance to experience in my life. I could sit and listen to it over and over. For those of you who haven't begun the journey do so now and be enlightened.
B0006399FS|5.0|I can understand the dissapointment that people have with this album, especially if one was to grow up listening to all of U2's great work.  But I'll be damned if I am not very impressed every time one of the songs of this album queues up in Windows Media Player.  Most significant to me though, was one night when I popped this CD into a small bedside radio as I lay down for bed.  This gave me time do nothing else but focus on the music, and I came off tremendously satisfied.  The guitar riffs and the heartfelt lyrics are very powerful, and the production is top notch.  Bono is great as always, regardless of what people say.  Compared to the drivel that is being forced down our throats from the music industry these days, this album serves as a refreshing breath of quality that only an all time great band like U2 can provide.  Highly recommended.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It's quite possible that Pearl Jam is more revered in retrospect than for their musical offerings from the last 5-6 years. Their name is legendary. And their initial 2-3 albums are considered classics. But what have they done lately that hasn't sounded tired and stale? <br /> <br />Even though I'd been burned by PJ's albums in the past, I took a chance on this new one, simply titled Pearl Jam. <br /> <br />Wow. Am I glad I did. Pearl Jam has been reborn!  <br /> <br />This album sounds fresh, alive and -- dare I say it? -- vital. They retained their trademark garage band sound and Eddie's sometimes mumbly (but powerful) baritone. But there are melodies and hooks on this album that are infectious. And the playing sounds like a Pearl Jam I haven't heard in a long, long time. It's energetic and meaty. <br /> <br />The album kicks off with the guitar-heavy, toe tapping \\"Life Wasted,\\" which sports typical Pearl Jam chord progressions but with more oomph behind them.  <br /> <br />\\"World Wide Suicide,\\" the next track, features a sound and energy reminiscent of anything off Vs. or their debut CD (1993 and 1991, respectively). <br /> <br />\\"Comatose\\" begins with a Tom Petty-like guitar riff and then explodes in Eddie's growling vocal and bashing, punk-like guitars that would make the Sex Pistols proud. <br /> <br />One of my favorite tracks follows \\"Comatose\\": \\"Severed Hand,\\" which begins with swirling, mysterious-sounding backward-played guitar noodlings before turning into another free-for-all garage band extravaganza. <br /> <br />\\"Parachutes,\\" a Beatle-esque song featuring acoustic guitar, a jaunty beat and tight vocal arrangements, is a nice change of pace after so many balls-out tracks. <br /> <br />\\"Unemployable,\\" the next track, is a great riff. Very catchy and upbeat. It reminds me of R.E.M. Very tasty guitar work. <br /> <br />\\"Wasted Reprise\\" is totally captivating. Haunting, even. It's less than a minute long, but there's something about it that I absolutely love. The lyrics are sung with such emotion: \\"I have faced it, a life wasted, I am never going back again.\\" <br /> <br />I can't say enough about this album. It's chock-full of big, BIG guitar riffs, Eddie's over-the-top screaming, crisp production, and heart-on-sleeve lyrics. It's a Pearl Jam you haven't heard in a very long time. <br /> <br />I strongly urge you to buy this new album from Pearl Jam. You won't be sorry.
0440180295|3.0|I have to admit that it is not the same book this thirty-nine-year-old remembers when he read it last at nineteen. Parts of it are brilliant, but I found myself rolling my eyes at the sidetrips to Tralfamadore and his juvenile asides about sex. A review I recently read gets it right:<br /><br />\\"I suppose that once upon a time, this novel must have seemed terribly arch or ironic. Perhaps it is simply a function of living in the Decade of Irony, but now it just seems fairly sophomoric.\\"<br /><br />Now I'm afraid to read any more Vonnegut for fear of slapping myself silly for being such an impressionable college boy.
B00006AW2M|5.0|TSMR is a one-of-a-kind album in The Rolling Stones catalog.  It is their response to The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\".  The album is full of magical and mysterious songs.  The opener, Sing This All Together, sets the quirky pace of the album and the ending of the song leads into the guitar of Citadel, one of the best psychedelic rock songs I've ever heard.  In Another Land is the only song sang by Bill Wyman and the song is pretty good, especially its harpsichord intro.  2000 Man is much like Citadel only a little slower and catchier.  Sing This All Together (See  What Happens) may be the only misstep of the album, it is very long and tedious.  She's A Rainbow is the best on the album and one of the best Stones songs ever.  From the beautiful strings to the Hawaiian-sounding backing vocals, the song is solid from beginning to end.  The Lantern is another good one, it's perhaps the slowest and quietest song on the entire album.  Gomper is East Indian-influenced with its sitar.  The song is great, I especially like its melodic vocals.  2000 Light Years From Home is the second best song with its outer space sound effects.  The last song, On With The Show is funny and cute and ends the album on a lighter note.<br /><br />My advice to any Rolling Stones fan is that you buy this album if you don't already have it, you won't be sorry.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Spielberg is one of my favorite filmmakers both because he knows how to tell a story, takes more risks than other mainstream directors, and always cares about the characters. Often his films are a little too much on the slick side, or as a neighbor kid used to say, \\"There's a whole lot of Hollywood in that movie.\\" A.I. is no different. It walks a line between being bleak and warm, between taking risks and falling back into convention. Parts of it had me in awe and played my emotions, while other parts had me shaking my head in disappointment and irritation.<br /><br />But for all its flaws, there is much to appreciate and think about in this modern take on \\"Pinocchio\\". David, the robot boy who is programmed to \\"love\\" want to be real so that his \\"mother\\" will love him. But what is \\"real\\"? And what is \\"love\\"? Can a machine created by a human be real or even love? Can it be human? Is it alive? What is our responsibility to such a creature? Should we even be dabbling in such things?<br /><br />As maddening and uneven as it can sometimes be (especially the ending), I still highly recommend it.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Ok, first I'm suprised at the mixed reviews, and then I'm not. It seems that whenever there is a monumental musical genre, like the genre that tool has created, there are expectations. However, when a band is so talented that every album is a slight departure from previous records it is almost pointless to pick favorites. These guys are one the few \\"artists\\" left in music (I would like to point out NIN, radiohead, and.....ryan adams). These guys have been my favorite rock band for almost 10 years. I bought undertow at age 16 and fell in love with their music. Then Aenima was a major departure from undertow. Then Lateralus. Now 10,000 days. <br /> <br />This is probably the most blended cd that they have. Undertow was kind of happy in comarison. This cd would be best characterized with the heavy and aggresive attributes of Aenima and the smooth mix and floaty intludes of Lateralus. This cd has some HEAVY songs in it. <br />1. Vicarious - at the moment my favorite song. In comparison probably one of the heaviest songs that they've ever written. <br />2. Jambi - really cool heavy guitar intro - song reminds me of Perfect Circle but far more intricate - there is a bass line 1 minute into the song that reminds me of the opening of Another Brick in the Wall. <br />3. Wings for marie - musical interlude <br />4. 10,000 days - continuation of Wings for Marie - has a nice mellow groove <br />5. The pot - very good, very cool sounding song that is quite funny. Hint: the song name  One of my instant favorites off the album <br />6. Lipan Cunjuring - Indian singing song <br />7. lost keys - a neat sounding musical interlude <br />8. Rossetta Stoned - this is another instant classic. It's a long one too, topping 11 minutes. The intro is speed libbed and the voice is actually slightly overdriven through most of the song, making the song sound heavier than it actually is. <br />9. intension - a quite interlude, quite mellow <br />10. right in two soft start, but kicks in and turnsinto a nice song that has some killer drums <br />11. viginti tres - they construct a beat out of the sounds of fluttering wings. Really  creepy sounding. Wake a friend up to this song and you'll cause nightmares. <br /> <br />a SOLID ALBUM BY THE VERTERANS OF A STYLE THAT HAS YET TO BE SUCCESSFULLY COPIED. FIVE YEAR WINTER HAS ENDED (little reference to ZAO).  <br />P.S. the art and packaging is pretty cool. Creapy and rather strange, but.. that's tool. <br /> <br />The future looks good for this very original band.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I have been a Pearl Jam fan since the album Ten. I have always said that any album after VS. is a waste of money! But this album in part has changed my opinion some what. There are maybe 2 songs I don't really care for BUT! This album to me is their best effort since VS. When I heard World Wide Suicide the hair on the back of my neck stood up. Sure in my opinion they have had some songs after Vs. I like such AS Spin the Black Circle, Whipping, Last Exit, Better Man and Tremor Christ (which are the only songs I listen to on Vitology)Wishlist and Last Kiss But this album made me stop and listen and Ilike it.(By the way my name is ERICK: D. Helle is my wife she didn't write this review.)
B000EULJLU|4.0|Listening to Tool is like sitting in a philosophy course and learning about metaphysical, morale, psychiological, and spiritual things in this life. I feel as though I am studying for an interesting project that I must present to the class (or whole world) the next day. All my life I have always been fascinated with hinduism, buddhism, taoism, mythology, history, metaphysics, philosophy, psychology, theology, and the mystical aspects of my life and what my eyes see. Tool just further awakens me to this knowledge, for they have fascinations with these studies as well and makes references to them in most of their songs.... For example, \\"Third Eye\\" is about seeing the world through your soul....changing your perception and accessing a different realm of consciousness to see what is really there. This concept is widely used in hinduism and buddhism for meditational benefits. \\"46 and 2\\" is about Carl Jung's evolution theories, and \\"The Grudge\\" is about how astrology effects us and our moods ever 29 years. I can go into deep explananation of all Tool songs but it will take forever....  <br /> <br />Not to mention these guys are just very damn musically talented. I seriously think Danny Carey has a hidden arm somewhere that helps him play drums as fast yet, smooth as possible. I love how Adam always manages to find a way to make the guitar explain the lyrics of a song...for example,  in \\"lateralus\\"....he literally spirals out the chords while maynard sings \\"spirals out. keeps going\\"....and in \\"46 and 2\\" how he makes the guitar almost sound like it is evolving into something else as the song explains a state of evolution. Justin always finds something interesting to do with his bass and effects to add to the feel of the song.  <br /> <br />This album,however is not Tool's greatest album. They drifted away from the mindful and spiritual things that usually interest Tool fans and leaned over to a more emotional and political side of the bridge. Not saying this album isnt great, but its not their best. To me Lateralus was the album that did it for me. Definitely Tool's climax. While a lot are disappointed with this album, I still say it has a lot of good messages in it. \\"right in two\\" is my favorite track. It makes references to Angels in heaven who do not understand why we act the way we do and take this life for granted. Adam, again found a way to add to the feel of the song by playing stair-stepping patterns on guitar as if floating up a stairway to heaven. Sounds  a little silly but if you listen to the song you'll know what I mean.   <br /> <br />I'm sick of people saying Tool is an anti-christ or satanic band. Yeah right. They just bring things and ideas to the table that people are too afraid to do. Its not like they are making songs titled \\"kill your mother, rape your dog\\" or \\"kill the christian\\" or make references to the devil as some death metal bands do. Tool is just open-minded and not a prisoner to their own minds as too many religious and close minded people are in my opinion. They are awake unlike some of you who dont understand Tool or call Tool fans stupid and arrogant. Anyone who doesnt understand Tool....I will explain it to you in one short and simple sentence; They are outside of the box and you are inside. Think about it. If doesnt make sense to you then you have made their point.  <br /> <br />Back to the album though,  If this is your first Tool album, dont buy it yet. Buy Lateralus, Salival, or Aenima. If you arent into some of the interesting and open minding messages they give, then just listen to the incredible music. This is a legendary band. Why? Becase they arent just another band. They have a message,they mean something, and their music is an experience.  <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool, as a band, has evolved again and are back and better than ever. The first listen of this album had me very disappointed, but this album grows on you and I literally cannot stop listening to it.  <br />The best song(s) that Tool has ever created would be \\"10,000 Days\\" with the \\"pre\\" track \\"Wings for Marie.\\" The music and lyrics are outstanding for any band and really pull you in.  <br />If everyone can look past the persona that Tool has unknowningly created and listen to the music as a whole, I believe that anyone would be thoroughly pleased. I give the CD as a whole 5 stars, because you really can't just jump from song to song. Like someone else said, \\"it's not an album of singles.\\"
B000003TA4|2.0|Nirvana's Nevermind easily ranks as one of the most overrated albums ever made. In any kind of music, period.    Now before you Nirvana fanboys/girls rip me apart, just let me confirm that I don't hate your favorite band (although I do think they are criminally overrated) and I'm not one of those who celebrated Kurt's death. But I do have some major complaints about this album.    Now about Kurt. A genius?! Don't make me bang my head on the keyboard out of laughing. And seriously all you guys who still mourn his death saying \\"KuRt'Z DeTh WaZ LyeK a StAb In MaH HarTT\\" are really starting to get on my nerves. Kurt was nothing special, face it. Why can't you mourn Cliff Burton, Dimebag Darrell, Layne Staley or Chuck Schuldiner? These guys had far more talent than Kurt, and got practically none of the attention they deserved, and today are being forgotten. If Kurt Cobain was a genius the James Hetfield is the Albert Einstein of guitar/vocals, give me a f**king brake. Kurt was easily the most overrated guitarist ever, he never played a half-decent solo and all the songs are structured from 3 powerchords at best. And his vocals were not much better, they were decent at their best and at their worst they were just unbearable. In most of the songs he sings properly in the verse and in the chorus he screams and sounds like a drug abuser. Now I have nothing against screaming in music, but the singer needs to have some abilty to do this. Bruce Dickinson can do it properly, and so Rob Halford, Phil Anselmo and Tom Araya. But Kurt couldn't. However Kurt had some upsides though, his songwriting was quite good, and at least he didn't write lyrics like Korn, Slipknot and Linkin Park who write lyrics all about how depressed they are. The 2 other dudes were also above average. Kris was a decent bassist. Dave Grohl is a great drummer (although he does better stuff today). The album's opener, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit', although extremely overplayed, is probably the best song on the album, although the chorus sucks (due to Kurt's screaming) the verse is great and the basslines and drum beats are actually good. 'Come As You Are' is decent, 'Lithium' is pretty bland. Other than that, this album is boring, uninspired and heavily overrated. And it didn't save rock and roll at any point. The didn't even started grunge (that would be Soundgarden), but I still have doubts that if Pearl Jam's 'Ten' wasn't, but Nevermind was then hair metal was killed.    Nirvana had actually made some really good songs on their swansong In Ultero and few decent on Bleach. These albums have much more well-structured songs, slightly better vocals, although the guitars are still bad. But still Nirvana has nothing on other bands from Seattle such as Queensryche (although they're not grunge), Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots or even Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. All in all, this is not an album that has aged well (despite what many may think) and is easily Nirvana's worst. Judge for yourself.
B000002J6H|5.0|With this self-titled debut solo album, originally released in November of 1970, Stephen Stills finally had an album consisting entirely of his own self-penned material.  However, don't let that, or the fact that Stephen is pictured alone on the front cover with an acoustic guitar, fool you--this isn't as close to a traditional singer-songwriter type of album as you may initially speculate.  Stills has an absolute load of guest artists here, not just background vocalists such as David Crosby, Graham Nash, Rita Coolidge, and 'Mama' Cass Elliot, but also Jimi Hendrix (whom Stills commonly refers to as James Marshall Hendrix), Eric Clapton, Booker T. Jones, and Ringo Starr (credited as Richie), and each of these guests truly add to the record as opposed to just being there for namesake.<br /><br />The characteristically ambitious Stills was clearly going for a 'Big Statement' with this record, and although a couple songs do suffer from overproduction, the album is simply brimming with inspiration, soul, and passion, with a unique mixture of different styles to boot.<br /><br />A gospel influence shines through on many of the tracks to great effect.  Stills starts things off with the top 20 US hit \\"Love The One You're With\\", an intoxicatingly joyful feel-good anthem with a sing-along chorus and exciting organ work--a brilliant way to open the album.  Also gems are the stately, slow-paced, super-emotional \\"Church (Part of Someone)\\"; and \\"Sit Yourself Down\\", which starts with a calmly reflective verse and works its way to a rousing chorus.<br /><br />You get a couple of bluesy tracks with the \\"Old Times Good Times\\" and \\"Go Back Home\\" which are sequenced back to back and feature Hendrix and Clapton respectively.  \\"Old Times Good Times\\" is irresistible with its fun lyrics and Jimi's great guitar work.  The nearly 6-minute \\"Go Back Home\\" starts to ramble after a while during the Clapton section, but it's got splendid, Hendrix-inspired wah-wah guitarwork from Stills, and the stripped-down sound on the first half of the track makes for a nice 'breather' in the context of the album.<br /><br />Stills also really shines on a couple of acoustic tunes played and sung entirely by himself.  The restful \\"Do For The Others\\" is a beautiful, pensive ballad with an endlessly hummable melody.  And Stills delivers a riveting performance on \\"Black Queen\\", with Stephen playing absolutely [...] country-blues licks--it was recorded all in one go, with no overdubs.<br /><br />Stills also takes a cue from Brian Wilson with the arresting, lush, vibes-laden orchestrated ballad \\"To A Flame\\" which sounds like it could have fit in on \\"Pet Sounds\\", and yes, that is definitely a compliment.  There's even a hint of progressive rock on \\"Cherokee\\" with its flutes and 7/4 time signature, and Stills' electric sitar work on it adds yet another flavor to the album.<br /><br />Unfortunately, overproduction rears its ugly head on the last two tracks.  The aforementioned \\"Cherokee\\" could have been another great song, but it gets bogged down by the blaring horns (which instantly recall \\"MacArthur Park\\", by the way), although they only crop up occasionally, so the song still ends up being quite solid.  But Stills really gets carried away with egregious overproduction on the closing track \\"We Are Not Helpless\\"--his careful rendering at the beginning of the song is appealing, and had he stripped away the excess it could have been a really nice album closer, but as it is, it's overkill, foreshadowing the cheesy overproduction that mars some of his follow-up album \\"Stephen Stills 2\\".<br /><br />Despite the occasional gripes, Stephen's ambitiousness really served him well here--the variety of music is highly impressive, as are his varied vocal stylings, and the result is a fascinating and often thrilling listening experience  There is simply a load of terrific, passionate music here, enough to make it a definite must-have.he first half of the track makes for a nice 'breather' in the context of the album.

B000E33VWW|5.0|This brutally honest portrait of author Truman Capote, with its stunning photography (by Adam Kimmel) and Academy Award-winning acting, has been one of the most \\"decorated\\" films of 1995.  Philip Seymour Hoffman, Oscar-winner as Best Actor, becomes Capote in this film--small, effete, and vulnerable, but also selfish, petulant, weak, and sometimes cruel.  Catherine Keener, as Harper Lee, Capote's childhood friend, offers a stunning contrast to Hoffman's Capote.  Tall, honest, and committed to keeping Capote focused, she grounds the film, while serving as Capote's research assistant during his investigation of the cold-blooded killings of four members of the Clutter family in Holcomb, Kansas, in 1959.<br /><br />At the opening of the film, the clean, flat plains and unadorned farmhouse belonging to the victims form a visual contrast with Capote's frantic life in New York.  A naive teenager's discovery of the murders, the savagery of the murders, and effects of the murders on the townspeople continue the contrasts between the harsh realities of local life and the esoteric lifestyle of Capote. When Perry Smith (sensitively played by Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Eugene Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) are arrested, and Capote makes contact with Smith, the viewer suddenly sees Capote and Smith as similar--both lonely, sad, a bit shy, and sometimes frightened.  As Perry Smith begins to confide in Capote, the similarities of their backgrounds and dysfunctional families become even more obvious.<br /><br />Exceptionally opportunistic, Capote is also deeply affected by Smith, feeding him when his hunger strike leaves him close to death, but also borrowing Smith's personal journals for his research because \\"I don't want the world to see you as a monster.\\"  Sometimes abandoning Smith and Hickock for months at a time, Capote comes and goes in their lives, leaving Smith desperate at times, and causing Jack Dunphy, Capote's lover, to accuse Capote of using Smith.  As the six years pass between the crime and the publication of In Cold Blood, Capote himself deteriorates from alcohol and drugs as inexorably as Smith and Hickock have done while awaiting execution.<br /><br />The interactions between Hoffman, as Capote, and Collins, as Smith, lead to poignant scenes of great emotion--Capote dissembling when Smith wants to know the name of the book he is writing, Capote refusing to pay a visit to Smith until just before his execution, and Capote crying \\"I did everything I could,\\" when clearly he did not.  Intensely acted, sensitively directly, stunningly photographed, and hauntingly human, this memorable film takes a close, personal look at Capote and the man he fears may be his alter ego.  n  Mary Whipplecrime and the publication of In Cold Blood, Capote himself deteriorates from alcohol and drugs as inexorably as Smith and Hickock have done while awaiting execution.

B000EULJLU|5.0|Like most Tool albums the first time I listened to it I thought, \\"What did they do?\\" By the third time I heard it I understood and now I love it. As for all you dummies in here trying to start a fight... go get a girlfriend or something. Life is about more than video games and the internet.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Oh yeah, this Tool album sounds crisp and top notch. I dont want to write much, but it has my full approval.
B000AP2ZLC|5.0|Cryptopsy finally returns after staying dormant for too long, but the wait was well worth it. Once Was Not is a massive slab of technical brutallity. Unrelenting from track 2 to the end, this is the heaviest, and in my opinion, best Cryptopsy album yet. An instant classic.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|NOT IMPRESSED. <br /> <br />I was expecting a lot from this legendary band but this albums sounds like a cheap copy of the Who. I highly DO NOT recommend this album. If you want to hear a raw garage band type of album without any crisp guitaring or vocals, get this. Vedder sounds the same. Have you heard spin the black circle? This whole album sounds like that, but a lot more worse. Where are the solos, Mike McCrady? <br /> <br />If I could give this a ZERO, I would.  <br /> <br />- Andy
B000EULJLU|3.0|Is it wrong for me to think that what made Tool so great on Undertow and Aenima was the raw emotion on display? The aggression and rage and contempt? Is it wrong for me to wish that they would continue in that vein instead of just spewing out technically proficient but emotionally sterile prog rock-without-the-prog (and often without the rock either) as they did on Lateralus and now on 10,000 Days as well? Is it wrong for me to be sad that apparently Tool are now content to just regurgitate ideas and go through the motions with practically zero creativity? If it's my fault for feeling this way, I apologize.<br /><br />I will admit that I do enjoy 10,000 Days more than Lateralus. But unfortunately I also have to admit that this album feels like a mountain of dead weight compared to the oceans of energy I found in previous albums.
B000001Y16|5.0|Like I said, this is one of the best 2pac/Makaveli cd of all time compared to \\"Me Against The World\\". Tupac was always amazing at put his heart into each and every song he did. On this record, you will not find one filler track. This is very real, you won't find a realer cd in rap then or now. It just shows how much he had to say in each and every cd he did. <br /> <br />Here is my rating for each song: <br /> <br />Bomb First - 10/10 - Some say that \\"Hit Em Up\\" was the most classic song against Biggie, Badboy, Nas, Etc. But you can not get any better on this. It shows how much 'Pac was angry, and how much he believed in what he was speaking of. <br /> <br />Hail Mary - 10/10 - One of my favorite Tupac songs of all time. And the most intelligent one as well. This is very dark and errie. And the best beat you'll find on this album in my opinion. <br /> <br />Toss It Up - 6/10 - My least favorite cd, I enjoy the intro. But I never did enjoy Tupac's sex songs. But this isn't bad, its still very listen-able. <br /> <br />To Live & Die In LA - 8.5/10 - Considerably the best song dedicated to how much Tupac loved his city, its very deep. It's part 2 of \\"Califprnia Love\\" and Tupac makes this version much better then the orginal even without Dr. Dre. <br /> <br />Blasphemy - 9/10 - First of all I love the intro, and I love the way Tupac raps to this beat. And when you listen to this song, you know what he's talking about is extremely true. <br /> <br />Life Of An Outlaw - 9/10 - When Tupac comes in, he starts to basically spit bullets. He comes out at you, and you have to acknowledge him. The guitar he puts in here is very unique. And I enjoy that very much. <br /> <br />Just Like Daddy - 8/10 - Good song, decent. Good beat, and what their speaking on, is very heartfelt. <br /> <br />Krazy - 10/10 - I just love this song. It shows off just pure talent and intelligence straight off, from the beginning to the end. This was the song that made me want to buy this album. <br /><br />White Man'z World - 10/10 - This songs describes basically that our society + government is running the world. And what's it like to be born black, in a white Mans world. A word to describe this song is \\"genious\\". <br /> <br />Me and My Girlfriend - 7.5/10 - I do enjoy this song, Defintely now one of my favorites. But its enjoyable. No one sure if he's talking about his \\"Girl\\" or his \\"Gun\\". But what I know is its a well done song. I also liek the guitar they have in there. Just liek in \\"Life Of An Outlaw\\". <br /> <br />Hold Ya Head - 9/10 - The best part of this song is the great lyrics, the chorus, and the piano. Which basically means the whole song... <br /> <br />Against All Odds - 10/10 - Like he said, It's the realest $hit he ever wrote. In this song, you know he's ready to go to war. An awesome way to end an al bum. Just to plan, plot, stratigize, and bomb first.. <br /> <br />All in all, one of the best rap/Tupac albums of all time. Forget this mainstream rap that's coming out today, and go pick up a real album. Like this one right here..
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|A friend of mine sent me a copy of the British release of this album a couple of months ago, and I was eagerly anticipating the opportunity to purchase the US release. While the songs on the American version are the same as the British version (and actually, they included an extra track, \\"Love Train\\") I had to downgrade this from a 4-star to a 3-star album. Why? They messed with the track order! In the original release, the tracks are sequenced this way: <br /> <br />1. Colossal <br />2. Woman <br />3. White Unicorn <br />4. Pyramid <br />5. Mind's Eye <br />6. Joker And The Thief <br />7. Dimension <br />8. Where Eagles Have Been <br />9. Apple Tree <br />10. Tales From The Forest Of Gnomes <br />11. Witchcraft <br />12. Vagabond <br /> <br />I know this probably seems like nitpicking, but sequencing is important, especially in music like this, which strives so hard to achieve a \\"classic rock\\" sound. And, as if messing with the track order wasn't bad enough, they did a terrible job of editing. For instance, at the end of \\"White Unicorn\\" on the US version, you can hear a aplit second of the beginning of \\"Pyramid\\" (which follows directly after it in the British release) before it lurches into \\"Woman.\\" Would it have been so hard, after they decided to mess with the track order for no reason at all, for them to at least EDIT the transitions between the individual tracks so it doesn't sound like a damn mix tape? <br /> <br />I'm not suggesting you purchase the British import version of this cd (especially since it's three times as expensive) but if you happen to see the import version for a price comparable to the American one, buy that instead, and hear a great album they way it was MEANT to be heard.
B000EULJLU|1.0|this cd is crap. ok. and before any of you self-righteous head-up-your-ass tool tools start calling me the wrong kind of tool fan or start saying i'm not into it for the right reasons or whatever, just stop thinking it. there is not one person alive who can argue that i am not a \\"real\\" tool fan. i don't like tool because they're heavy, in fact -despite their first two releases being strange manipulations of hard rock- they're not heavy, they're not a metal band, tool is intense. that is what they do. but the most important thing that they've always done but failed to do this time, is evolve. this time around, sadly, they've decided to recycle everything. though, i have noticed what i like to call a \\"lost theme\\", a mood that is a new mood for tool (as with all their cd's, they all have their own feel) that is found on 10,000 days (and those parts are good, but outweighed). it just so happens, that it's all muddied up and lost amongst the loads and loads of recycled crap. the riffs are tired, the leads/solos are the worst display ever... adam jones, the man who i thought was one of the few unstoppable guitarists who knows very little musically speaking (scales and stuff like that) comes to a screeching halt. aside from the moments he lends his craft to the \\"lost mood,\\" he churns out the same old stuff... some of it sounds like the work he did on the melvins/lustmord cd and the rest just sounds like reject licks and riffs from the older cds. maynard on the other hand, retains the most integrity but not enough. the lyrics, well, they're decent (most of them) but the delivery 80% of the time is more recycled and unspired crap. and the rythm section this time around just sounds, RECYCLED! damn these bastards, they were supposed to be the messiahs of integrity and creativity. memory lane does not constitute either. if you have any arguments with any of these statements i don't care. i am a tool fan and tool has failed me. if you agree, then join me in the mourning of a band that had us fooled that they would never suck. because 10,000 days my fellow humans, sucks. tool are jerks.d that had us fooled that they would never suck. because 10,000 days my fellow humans, sucks. tool are jerks.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|It's always fun watching concert DVD's. For one thing, being a musician, I can actually watch not only how they play the songs but see the musicianship of the band without the benefit of redoing takes and overdubbing certain parts. It's still a bit too early for a Coldplay DVD but still it's quite a good one regardless, it's just marred by the MTV-style editing that I'm very much despising at the moment. <br /> <br />The show combines some tracks from first release Parachutes to 2nd release A Rush of Blood to the Head, as well as 3 non-album tracks. There's of course crowd favorites such as Trouble(with a huge end sing along), the Scientist, Clocks, Don't Panic, Yellow with a beautifully sung intro to album tracks such as Amsterdam, Daylight and Shiver. As for the 3 non-album tracks, I love 2: The One I Love, a big rocker with a catchy ending(\\"sing it to me, oh oh\\") and See You Soon, a beautiful/melancholy acoustic ballad. <br /> <br />The editing problems are first evident in the Politik intro. While the track itself has that pounding beat, so does the editing and it's incredibly jarring. It reminds me of an old guy trying to get in the mindset of a young person by acting and talking fast so the hyperactive camera is a result of a \\"this is what the kids want\\" mentality. Like most DVD's, the lead singer Chris Martin tends to get the most attention. A talent yes but other band members get very quick shots before going back to Chris. At one point I almost thought I saw band member to Chris to band member to Chris rather than switching between the 4 of them. <br /> <br />It would've been nicer if they waited till X&Y came out so we can get Square One, Speed of Sound and Fix You live but that's alright. Knowing the record company, we'll get another one soon.
B000EMGAGW|4.0|First of all, I have been a huge Mobb fan since I bought The Infamous and Amerikaz Nightmare last year.  Since then, I have also gotten Infamy and Hell On Earth, both awesome albums as well.  But I have to admit that I was a little confused when Mobb Deep signed with G-unit.  I mean, why would one of the best rap duos of all time need to sign with a pop rap group?  Now, it just seems that they did it to get their money, and their is nothing wrong with that, if they would have retained their original mobb style.  But Prodigy has obviously slipped as a lyricist, but luckily Havoc steps his game up here.  The production is consistently good on the album, and there are a couple of guest appearences, by none other than 50 Cent himself.  He is on 5 of the songs!  Mobb doesn't need 50 to help carry the album.  They can do it themselves and that is a big problem with me.  The best songs are Speaking So Freely, Pearly Gates, Put Em In Their Place, and Smoke It.  The two bonus tracks should not have been included because they were already on other albums.  G Unit fans will already have those songs so they should have put other Mobb songs on their.  It would have been nice to see Nas on one of the songs, as well Big Noyd.  Overall, this is a solid Mobb album, considering it was released by G-unit.  There are fleeting appearences of the Mobb we know and love, but they are few and far between on this release.  Surely the G-unit fans out there will eat this up.  3.5 Stars
B000EULJLU|5.0|I have been counting the days, and years, until the next Tool relaease and once again it was well worth the wait!  There is a reason why Maynard James Keenan, Adam Jones, Danny Carey, and Justin Chancellor are all gods, it is because they manage to not let down their fans, EVER with ANYTHING they put out.  From Opiate till now, this band has never let us down.  Lyrically, Maynard is at his best.  I cant wait to see what Adam has up his sleeve for the new videos!!!  Not only that but the album cover is pretty darn nifty too.  As for the music; Vicarious makes me feel like I am in the stereo.  The lyrics, the bass, it all becomes a part of you.  I listened to this for the first time the way I have always loved to listen to Tool--in the dark with the stereo as high as I can take.  You feel sucked into the album.  As if your heartbeat is the bassline.  As if your breathing is the drums.  As if your blood is Maynard's beautifully melodic voice.  This album, once again, excites me to my very core.  Maynard, I LOVE YOU.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|It's great. Lyrics first. Music and Ed's voice second.. Even if they changed production and some way of recording, this album has something other PJ's albums don't have. It's a rush of amazing riffs to your head.. first songs rock so much that you won't get easily used to ballads in the end.. even if probably Come Back it's a masterpiece, and Gone makes you feel just like Immortality or Nothingman could do.. it's a great album, believe me.
B000E97Y6K|4.0|This movie seemed to have something for everyone. Lots of dinosaurs for dinosaur fans. Horror fans would love the sceeens in the cavern of the insects. For me, a fan of loving relationships, the relationship between Ann and Kong was beautiful to watch, especialy the sceen in central park in New York city with Kong playing on the ice. So I'd give most of the the film a half hearted three but the love between the two of them a five. As my title says, for me at least, there was only about twenty minutes of the film worth watching.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is the Austen film that I watch again and again. Rainy days, feeling sorry for myself days, sunny days alike. I think that it is such a sweet, hopeful story. The acting is all wonderful, it captures another time so effortlessly, all you think about is the people involved. Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root are perfect.
0792160347|3.0|This is one movie that grew entirely from its failings into one of the most influential movies of the last 20 years.How could the director of \\"Taxi Driver\\" blow it? The ingredients were in line: attractive stars: Model of the decade, Lauren Hutton; Richard Gere, Slim Von Wink;supporting cast,Hector Elizondo, Latino on the rise, Bill Duke (future director)and the blond near-actress tied to Howard Hughes, Nina Von whatever.The movie rides entirely on the surface, two wheels instead of four on the ground. Slick, teasing.Innuendos,political smear. The screenwriter could not tie the pieces together into a cohesive drama. You didn't know whether it would be a political thriller or a fashion thriller. The clothes, the glitter and gloss blend with the gross. You had as much concern for Gere's fate as his choice of wardrobe at the end. Let the music play, end of movie.Made you want to shop forever.All wrapping.Strictly beefcake.
B0006L0LOS|1.0|COME ON, YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!  This movie was so painful, Halle Berry was only in half the movie, and the other half was acted out by a poor CGI that did a pretty shoddy job of looking like Halle Berry.  The story sucked, the dialogue was about as moving as a pile of puke from the dead skull of a jackrabbit.  I don't know anymore, what is going on with movies?  Let's talk about my boy Ben Bratt, why the hell was he even in this movie?  With his smug smile, he played a sassy cop and was sleeping with the enemy! Weak!  He didn't do anything, except play the dumbest and unsatisfactory game of basketball against Madame Berry, as strings lifted her to produce an AND 1 slam-dunk! Then Sharon Stone, she hasn't done anything good since Basic Instinct, however she did look sort of hot in this movie, in a pigeon sort of way.  In conclusion, I want to know what was running through Halle's head when she read the script for this movie.  Halle you're hot, this movie is not.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've been listening to TooL for over 6 years and they are by far my favorite band. If you call yourself a Tool fan then you owe it to yourself to go out and give this album a chance. I've been listening to it nonstop for awhile now and it has definitely sank in. It is not as spiritual as Lateralus or Aenima. That said, it is still as good as either of those albums in terms of musical and artistic brilliance. It has a mind and sensibility of its own which means it is perfectly capable of standing on its own in terms of the albums they have put out (and especially when compared to the other crap being put out there nowadays.) Of course, this merely my own opinion. I realize the irony of telling you to think for yourself, so I'll just put it this way:  Go out, get the album, listen to it a few times and bask in the glory that is TooL's 10,000 Days.
B00005JOYA|1.0|I went to see this movie because I was intrigued by the creepy creatures shown in the previews and the mystery of what had happened to the town. What I got was a sick, demonic revenge fantasy, with several scenes of disgusting and disturbing violence that I find difficult to get out of my mind. Although some of the creatures are truly unique, creepy, and well rendered, and the use of sound and music to affect mood are pretty good, everything else about the movie is just horrible. A grotesque caricature of religious fundamentalism, scenes of horrible violence, and a conclusion that offers not even the slightest shred of redemption for any of the characters, just the total triumph of evil, hatred, violence, and death. Reprehensible trash.  <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I've been a PJ fan since day one and am very pleased with this release. There are a few dud songs on here as with most albums but i'm sure that even they will grow on me.  <br /> <br />\\"Come Back\\" and \\"Marker in the Sand\\" are by far my favorites on this ablum. As well as the ending song, \\"Inside Job\\" which rounds out the album well and ends things on a beautifully chilling note. Those are just the three songs that stood out in my first listen. Like I say though they are mostly all pretty damn good.  <br /> <br />Eddie's passionate and emotional voice and lyrics bring chills to my spine and a renewed motivation to make this world a better place.  <br /> <br />I agree with Rolling Stone for once. This is their best album in 10 years and dare I say comparable with \\"Ten??\\" I think I might dare the more I listen to this gem. <br /> <br />Well done boys and I'll be seeing you in concert for sure.  <br /> <br />GET THIS DISC!!!
B000002ADT|3.0|I simply cannot understand the accolades that this album has received over the years.  While I think that the music is really good--perhaps even great--the \\"songs\\" simply do not go anywhere (in my opinion.)  Perhaps I feel this way because this WASN'T the first jazz record that I remember hearing.  In fact, the first time I ever heard jazz was in the streets of New Orleans (where I am from.)  Sure, this album brought jazz into the limelight, so to speak, but that is also its major downfall--it's too watered-down (for lack of a better term.)   <br /> <br />Maybe since I grew up on a much more dynamic and upbeat \\"New Orleans\\" style of jazz, I find it hard to get into this \\"style\\".  I'll admit that Mr. Davis has a knack for bringing jazz to the masses (see \\"Bitches Brew,\\") but for true musicians, afficianados and enthusiasts \\"Kind of Blue\\" seems kind of lame.  Maybe I am being a bit too harsh considering this album's era, but Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\" was released at the same time and it seems a lot more vibrant and congruent in its melodies and ideas... <br /> <br />I guess if you are just getting into jazz, this would be a great place to start since the time signatures, tempo changes and overall modal aspects of the music seem really elementary.  Sorry Mr. Davis.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This LP come in 2 parts. The first being a all out rocker and the second being full of great musical ideas. These songs are more mid-tempo...but still great. <br /> <br />..oh..and this LP being out now has nothing to do with any election
B000EULJLU|4.0|i've been a tool fan ever since i heard \\"sober\\" about 7 or so years back. since then, i've heard the changes from album to album, never criticized it, and learned to grow with it. i figured, you can't expect a band to put out the same album every time they record something. <br />and tool definitely preaches that idea. <br />before i start into the album, i must first say that tool definitely changed their sound--lateralus was more organic and slower paced than aenima; aenima was more refined and angst driven than undertow; undertow was more melancholy and ambient than the almost-grunge-like opiate. with 10,000 days, they bring a little of everything from their past into the mix. <br />when \\"vicarious\\" starts out, the guitars sound like they could easily be found on lateralus. the song breaks out into a nice mixture of heavy bass lines and clean riffs accentuated by some tight technical drumming, as always to be expected of the great mr. danny carey. as the song, and the album, goes on, the bass lines become more punctuated, and the guitars sometimes seem to support the bass rather than the other way around. with \\"jambi\\", that groove is definitely more apparent. you hear it the whole album through. i won't describe every song in detail, but nearly every song (save a couple fillers) easily sway in and out of ambient, melodic passages and adrenaline filled classic riffing complimented by lyrics that range from somber to animosity-filled to even happiness. <br /> <br />and the lyrics are something to talk about in themselves. in \\"vicarious\\", maynard unleashes some anger about the media, as well as the viewers, for desensitizing violence, only to include hippies and peace activists near the end of the song. his message seems to be don't downplay violence, but dont try to think that there will ever be peace. \\"jambi\\" describes a man with everything who'd trade it all away for one love. \\"wings for marie pt. 1\\" and \\"10,000 days (marie pt. 2)\\" opens up the subject of maynardand religion yet again - this time, talking about heaven and hell in an almost poignant sort of sense - \\"i only pray/heaven knows when/to lift you out/cause 10,000 days in the fire is too long/you're going home\\". the album continues like this, with messages throughout the album. i must say, lyrically (which, for me, has always been a strong point for them), tool have matured. <br /> <br />to sum it up, the album is awesome for most of its run, but at some points can falter. i rate this on the level of lateralus or even opiate, but, in my eyes, cannot reach the epic level of aenima nor the catchy progression of lateralus. still, i'd recommend it for anyone whos not satisfied with your everyday, run-of-the-mill hard rock, and definitely recommend it to any tool fan who enjoyed lateralus as much as aenima and undertow.
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw's amazing fusion of acoustic pop, alternative rock and soulful blues crooning has an undeniable magnetism that you just can't help but give in to. While some artist of his age keep their audiences on their toes by acting out a lifestlye like that of a Lifetime special that's just so bad you can't help but watch, Gavin's appeal is deeply rooted in talent and his seemingly effortless ability to not only breathe an entirely original style into his own music, but also into even the most classic of classic songs, like that of Marvin Gaye's \\"Let's Get it On.\\"<br /><br />DeGraw's Chariot Stripped album is the pinnacle of the perfect artistic blend of instrumentation, vocality, and raw emotion. The tracks are so clean cut and pure, at times you can actually hear the sound of the piano bench settle underneath Gavin's weight. Nothing has been tainted with soundboard beats, echo chambers, or even the classic wall of sound, and it could be no better.<br /><br />Gavin display's a wide range of ability on the album from his guttural vocal stylings to his strength as both a guitarist and pianist. No two tracks are at all alike, and each has it's own very precise blend and balance of instrumentation. So many artists rely on looping beat tracks, but there is nothing repetitive about this album, or its production.<br /><br />\\"Meaning\\" is a soft ballad with some of the most insightful and honest lyrics I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. With incredible imagery and heart warming depth, this song cant help but make you love love and question what is all about anyway.<br /><br />One of the true treasures of this album is Degraw's immaculate interpretation of the Sam Cooke classic \\"Change is Gonna Come.\\" The vocality on this track is absolutely gorgeous, and shows a whole new side of Degraw's artistic range, passion, and lends even more credence to the 29-year-old's old-soul-crooner status.<br /><br />\\"Chariot\\" has a very complex piano accompaniment and fantastic, gripping lyrics that could speak to the heart of even the most jaded individual, reminding them once again of the magic of all things simplistic, earthly, and heavenly. A reminder of faith and strength of heart, \\"Chariot\\" brings the whole feel of the album home, summing up quite decisively the complexly minimalistic style that is the life and music of Gavin Degraw.<br /><br />Gavin Degraw is, without a doubt, a very powerful force to be reckoned with. His music is timeless and knows no boundaries of age, race, colour or creed. He is, across the board, one of the most talented, dedicated, tenacious, and promising artist of our time.
0790742780|3.0|This is one of the most haunting films I have ever seen. I saw it only once, when it was first released, and I both loved it and hated it, but I can't forget it. It affected me so strongly because I am a middle aged, white, defense engineer, in Los Angeles. Judging by the other reviews, people see different things in it. But to me it was the only film I have ever seen that expresses the frustration of us who grew up in the 50's and 60's in nice clean middle class neighborhoods thinking that someday we would live just like the Cleavers in a beautiful house in a neighborhood with trees and lawns, and then we grow up and get a job and suddenly find ourselves in a congested, smoggy, paved over place like Los Angeles where we are the minority race. Now I know people will immediately think \\"racist!\\" But what I am talking about is just the shock of such a rapid change in society in one generation. I think anyone of any race in any country would feel the same if their country changed so rapidly.<br /><br />The first half of the film was extremely powerful in portraying this frustration. Bill just wants to go home, but the traffic won't move. He abandons his car and starts to walk. Shouldn't a citizen be able to walk safely thru their own town? But it isn't his town anymore, he is an alien in his own city. He walks thru MacArthur Park, remember that song \\"MacArthur Park is melting in the rain\\"? I always thought MacArthur Park must be a beautiful place, but if you go there now you feel like you are in Guatemala, or a drug dealer's convention. And the scene at Bill's mother's house is so true to life. A little old lady who bought her house 40 years ago in a nice middle class neighborhood where the kids could play outside who now finds the neighborhood changed around her and she needs bars on the doors and windows. I see that every day in Los Angeles, old white-haired people adrift in a world they don't understand. So I was very impressed that the makers of this film expressedthis feeling so accurately.<br /><br />But in the last half of the film they seemed to cave-in to political correctness. There seemed to be no blacks in the film at all, even though the hamburger place was supposed to be in South Central LA. It is as if the film makers thought it was OK to stereotype Hispanics and Asians, but they were afraid to offend blacks. This seemed like a cop-out to me.  And the scene with the neo-nazi surplus store owner was very strange. I was expecting them to become allies, but the neo-nazi guy suddenly turns on him, and Bill ends up killing him. It seemed like the film makers were going out of their way to show that Bill was not a racist, he was just mad at society.<br /><br />And the end of the film infuriated me. The whole movie set me up to identify with and feel for Bill, and then the policeman just kills him and acts like \\"ho-hum, just another day on the job.\\"  And his wife (or former wife?) doesn't seem to care at all. So they just seemed to verify Bill's feeling that nobody cared about him or appreciated all the work he had done his whole life. So in a way, I felt betrayed after sitting thru the whole movie. After-all, even though Bill broke some laws, all the violence he did was in self-defense. So I have never seen the film again, and yet I still remember every bit of it, after 13 years, which is not something I can say about most films.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Picked up 10, 000 days last night and was able to listen to it 3 times. Other previous reviewers have stated their dissappointment...expecting more after such a hiatus. My inital perceptions are not totally stoked...though I will allow it to grow. The evolution of the band called Tool is definately otherworldly. Tool has an unmeasurable depth which provides me a path to willingly step into the abyss they have created. It's not just music...it's inexplicably much more to me. The two immediate stand-out songs are \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Right in Two\\". The rest have not completely captured my being. In their defense and my lack of understanding, \\"Lateralus\\" didn't intially grab me in the way that \\"Aenima\\" or \\"Undertow\\" did. The packaging with the built in viewer is pretty cool. Adam's creativity, when it comes to CD packaging, is totally amazing. He's tapping into something that is missed by the majority. Why make rudimentary and \\"done-to-death\\" CD notes with lyrics and a few snapshots of the band, you can make an interactive device? Previous efforts included holograms and transparency overlays...even A Perfect Circle's \\"Thirteenth Step\\" was on board with the deciphering symbols to uncover phrases from each song. These are the visuals which stimulate the winding and unexplored passages of the mind. Sorry...I guess I am rambling at this point. I just hope it grows on me as all of Tool's past CDs. Nonetheless, it is a MUST BUY!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Yes, the album is everything it is cracked up to be.  Listen to it from beginning to end.  A bunch of people are trying to compare 10,000 days with previous albums.  How can you?  Most movie sequels that come out suck in comparison to the original.  Well...why would want a watered down sequel from previous Tool albums?  Let the previous and current album stand on their own legs.  I think most people that compare 10,000 days to older albums just started listening to Tool recently and also think Nickleback should be on Ozzfest!  I believe every Tool album is an original and should never be duplicated...just evolve.  I have listened to 10,000 days for the past 2 weeks now & I believe it is the best ALBUM that Tool has made lately.  Obviously, the old Tool rocks, but everyone grows with age & Tool has also.  Maynard knows what is best for you anyway, give it a couple of listens, it will grow on you!
B000EGF0B4|5.0|I don't wanna talk too much, but to summer it up, the movie is very well done, the acting is great (especially with straight actors in the lead!!!) I expected the love scenes to be more discreet, which I was glad that they weren't. Ang Lee, you are very good, Heath & Jake are simply AMAZING
B000F0UV0E|5.0|What an unlikely pairing--but awesome duets!  Haunting, beautiful.  Who needs to glean singles when you get one like this where every cut is a \\"keeper\\".
B000ETQRCM|3.0|Boise, Idaho, 2000.  Front row seats, right side of the stage, closest to Stone(thank you fan club).  Binuaral tour.  Midway through an intense and amazing show, Eddie Vedder takes a breif moment to walk to my side of the stage lean over the crowd and personally hand me a guitar pick.  I've never met the man before in my life.  All through the show, the band had been throwing towels, picks, and tshirts to the crowd, but Ed, for a specific reason, took the time to personally hand me his pick. <br /> <br />I am a die-hard Pearl Jam Freak.  Most people find us often psychotic, yet we are deep, emotional people who find value and meaning to life.  We connect with PJ's music on an almost spiritual level.  That night at the show, ed recognized that connection.  He knew how I felt and what PJ's art means to me.  Which is why I regret saying that this album for me only gets 3 out of 5 stars.  The reasons are simple, but they are honest and meaningful to me.  Here they are: <br /> <br />1.  What happened lyrically?  Some good examples are dissident,rearview, betterman, WMA, Given to Fly, just to name a few.  When Ed tells a story in a song, it truely connects with the listener.  While some songs on this album have that affect, they lack simplicity, clarity and ability to understand meaning.  In addition, it's often too difficult to decifer what Ed is saying, which brings me to my next point, vocals. <br /> <br />2.  Ed often sings in falsetto and aside from slower tunes, it seems he is always pinching his throat.  I like distorting your voice, it's a necessity for true rock, but it needs to sound good.   <br /> <br />I praise PJ for making an intentional effort not to sound trendy, but they do it at the expense of sounding good. <br /> <br />Sometimes ed's vocals are so high pitched and screatchy that I cringe.  I'm not asking him to sing like he used to, I just want him to sing, period.  Just sing naturally. <br />3.  Mike Mcready is one of my most favorite people.  Problem?  Where are you?  The band has got so many instruments going that I can't tell what's going on.  I love complex music with several instruments, but you've got to be able to decifer each one and feel what it contributes to the song as a whole.  Too often, I believe you could remove a few sounds from songs and I don't think you would notice a significant enough change to alter the meaning of the song. <br /> <br />It's hard to immagine, but PJ is leaving me with something to be desired.  There are good tracks that will carry me through.  The album is solid and decent.
0804102988|5.0|<br />Fantastic! <br /> <br />After finishing reading the first two chapters, I already made up my view on this novel, which is quite consistent till the end of it (1000+ pages).  It was tough read, unless a reader has set his/her mind on finishing them all. <br /> <br />If you think you know about the history of England, then you should grab and read this novel.  The main events really happened (a fact), while Rutherfurd has skilfully put life into the facts by re-living the characters.  I have also never knew that England used to be a cape jutting out from the northwestern part of France in the past 10,000 years, which is quite recent by geological standards.  Before that, England was still a cape. <br /> <br />Each chapter was dedicated by the author to a certain period of time during the English history: neolithical times, stonehenge period, Celtic culture introduction, Roman invasions, Saxon culture intrusion, Norman conquest, the plague, and so on.  A the result of the breadth of subjects exposed, the author cannot dwell into details on each historical events, otherwise it will become a encyclopedia of English history written in fiction terms.  This, I suspect, was one of the flaw which many readers finally gave a 4-star review. <br /> <br />Anyway, I respect Mr. Rutherfurd's effort in condensing such a broad subject into just a little over a thousand pages of novel.  A five-star read for me.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|Okay, there are a lot of great reviews for Wolfmother, and with several listens, I can understand the buzz. But something still keeps me from really liking this album, and I know just what it is.<br /><br />First off, I'm an older heavy music fan. Clocking in at age 47, some may think that at my age, \\"He just doesn't get it.\\" Well, my younger rockers, that may seem like the case, but I'm still not 80 and I'm not dead yet. Than again, Robert Plant hasn't made an album that is even close to his Led Zep days. AC/DC has put out albums for 26 years after Back in Black, and (even with my suspicions about who wrote the lyrics for this classic disc) they haven't excitied me since. You getting the picture? As we get old, do we lose something? Even if you believe this, hear me out...<br /><br />...Hearing the song \\"Woman\\" on the radio sparked my interest in this band, but everytime I've heard the song, all I hear is Jack White of the duo, White Stripes. Don't get me wrong, there are many other tracks on this disc where the vocals sidetrack me. Mostly because the music on many of the songs is so darned, ummm...different. But then again, I've heard this music before. Oh, the beautiful distortion!<br /><br />Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, Blue Cheer, Grand Funk Railroad, and many others (and YES, White Stripes...blatent, especially on the tune \\"Apple Tree\\") all jump out at me when I hear these songs. But there's always that haunting Jack White vocal that somehow ruins my experience when listening. I even hear White Stripe-ish music in most of the songs. I wish I could just get these thoughts out of my brain and enjoy the experience.<br /><br />This shouldn't keep any true rock fan from buying this modern classic.<br /><br />Minds Eye<br /><br />Colossal<br /><br />Minds Eye<br /><br />Witchcraft<br /><br />Dimension<br /><br />& White Unicorn<br /><br />Are all solid rock tunes that I would have no problem sneaking onto some Gangsta Rap lovers ipod, in my effort to convert them to the \\"Rock\\" side of life.<br /><br />Hey, I realize that this is the way the lead singer sings, and I really do like The White Stripes. Still, I'm looking for total originality from a new and upcoming band. Imitation may be the best form of compliment, but spare me the copy-cat vocals on this one.<br /><br />3-stars for: Distortion, heavy without being mind-numbing, well written songs, $7.99 @ BestBuy, destin to become a \\"Classic\\" rock favorite in future years.ck\\" side of life. <br /> <br />Hey, I realize that this is the way the lead singer sings, and I really do like The White Stripes.

B000EULJLU|4.0|I've listened to the album three times now and feel a little bit disappointed after anticipating this for five long years.  The album is good but just doesn't stick with me as Lateralus did.  I feel that the only songs that hold this album together are Vicarious, Jambi and The Pot.  10,000 days is a beautiful piece of music but would have been better placed towards the end of the album, much like Reflection on Lateralus.  Rosetta Stoned and Right in Two have yet to grow on me and the rest of the album is short segue ways and filler.  What's missing is the organic growth and climax that many of the songs on Lateralus had.  That album was stitched together perfectly well where all songs formed an organic whole in sequence.  I dont feel that from 10,000 days.  Perhaps I am unfairly comparing this album to Lateralus but after five years how can I not expect something better?  Every album from Tool was better than the previous, evolving on elements only partially devleved into in the prior records.  Of course I will still go see them live in NYC this month but I was surprised that the setlist for the tour contains only four songs from the new album, the rest from Aenima and Lateralus.  Well I still love Tool but I doubt I will be playing this album another five years from now.  Hopefully, they can put out another album a year or two early next time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've always been just a casual Tool fan. (And never a fan of Perfect Circle.) I've never bought their albums on the first day of their release, or for that matter in the first months, but I do own them all. I just happened to be in BestBuy today and seen it sitting on the shelf in that strange packaging for $9.99. Hearing \\"Vicarious\\" on The Bone (107.7 KSAN) here in the San Francisco Bay Area, made me decide that I was going to buy the album. Why not?<br /><br />From my very first play, I decided that this is now my favorite Tool album, dropping Aenima into the number 2 slot.<br /><br />I've read the other reviews and yep, the songs are long and it chews up a big chunk of time to listen to it, but it's so full of variety, and not one clunker on the disc. I usually tend to hate first singles off of albums, but \\"Vicarious\\" is my favorite at this time...after 3 listens and a 1/2 while I cooked dinner and the wife listened in the living room.<br /><br />I highly recommend this disc to Tool fans. If they find the disc not up to snuff with your older Tool albums, just relax. Take a few breaths, open your mind and remember, we wouldn't want Tool, or any band for that matter to put out the same CD with every release. (Can anybody say \\"Godsmack\\". Sure, I knew you could!)<br /><br />You've waited 5 long years for this release. Give yourself some time. It's really a great work...Thanks TOOL guys!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|WITH AS MANY REVIEWS AS THIS SERIES HAS ON-LINE ONLY NEED TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST COMEDY,FUN,DRAMA,MYSTERY,LIGHT HORROR,SCI-FI OFCOURSE OUT THERE.  IT HAS IT ALL...OH YEH GREAT SUSPENCE TOO...AND ORIGINALITY...YOU CAN GO ON AND ON
B0009P42S2|4.0|As Akira is one of my favourite anime films, I was excited to hear that Katsuhiro Otomo was making another anime flick.  I was very curious about Steamboy for a long time and knew it wasn't going to be as good as Akira.  I was right.  Steamboy is not as good as Akira but what a film it is.  With fantastic visuals and a great story, Steamboy has what a Japanime needs.  The concept of setting a time in a futuristic 1930s, is a genius idea.  Where robotic technology is steam powered.<br /><br />Steamboy is an instant classic and a very enjoyable film that resembles Akira.  I would highly recommend this to anyone interested.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|I'm so sick of these stupid G-Unit haters saying that this album is garbage simply because Mobb Deep is on G-Unit now. It's not \\"Hell on Earth\\" and it's not \\"The Infamous\\". When are we gonna stop demanding another album on that caliber from Havoc and P? It's not gonna happen any time soon. This is still a lot better than \\"Amerikaz Nightmare\\" which was ok but a bit of a let down. This is still one of the year's best albums.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jams self titled release is definitely one of their best albums yet.  In their 40s now, the band still sounds fresh and are just rocking the hell out of this album.  Everything that makes PJ great is here.  Great lyrics, flat out amazing vocals, crunching guitar riffs, cool solos, nice solid bass playing, and AWESOME drums.  Its all great, especially if you are a fan of any type of Rock music.  Im sure you can find something good within this album.  The thing that makes the album so great for me is the voice of Eddie Vedder.  On the bands last 2 albums, Ed didnt have to be aggressive in his singing.  On this album he reached his most powerful yet.  Its quite amazing to hear him go from singing aggressive to very melodic and beautiful.  Along with Eddie, the rest of the band are in top form here.  Everyone gives it their all.  Mike and Stone havent sounded more alive with their guitar playing in a long time.  So, if youre already a Pearl Jam fan and you werent pleased with their last 2 releases, you will most likely love this.  Its A LOT like their 1998 album Yield in terms of overall vide and energy. Great, solid, and very cool album.
B00005JOFQ|2.0|I went to the theatres, naively believing the trailers' claims of a love movie, and left disappointed. It is more about sex than love: Ennis enjoys the gratification, but doesn't take it further; Jack continues to seek other homosexual partners throughout his life. The film is very weak until redeemed by the last 20 minutes, which are powerful. <br /> <br />As for the acting, the male leads are alright... I was blown away by Michelle Williams, and never again will Ann Hathaway simply be known as \\"that girl in the Princess Diaries.\\"  <br /> <br />The cinematography is beautiful, but one can find equally stunning visuals in better movies.
0143039504|5.0|There are several complete editions on Amazon of Austen's novels, so I thought I would write a review recommending this one (the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition). It lays open in your hand, has nice paper and high-quality paperback binding and cover, and it has perfectly sized type and wide inside margins. Other than the substantial size and weight (though it is not nearly as inconvenient as quarto-sized complete editions, such as the classic Sherlock Holmes), it is a perfect volume for those who are more interested in reading Austen than admiring how she looks on the shelf.<br /><br />By contrast, the Modern Library hardcover edition (which I compared in person at the bookstore) has such a narrow inside margin that the reader must strain to read bent text or to force the binding to open more and the paper to lay flatter. Otherwise, it was a nice edition. For me, they ruined it by this simple mistake.<br /><br />The leather bound edition from the Library of Literary Classics is a nice idea, and I have not seen it in person. I did notice, however, that the table of contents shows how little space they manage to squeeze Austen's novels into. It has far fewer pages than the Penquin Classics Deluxe Edition. When previewing the pages of text, this seems apparent in the very small type. As I said, I have not seen it in person, so I may be wrong, but it looks like it might be a strain to read, whereas the Penguin is quite comfortable. Hopefully Penguin will provide preview images soon so potential buyers can \\"Look Inside\\" and compare for themselves.<br /><br />It is wonderful that there are so many editions of Austen to choose from. The choice is personal and subjective. I will spend many, many hours reading mine, so I chose the one that I thought would be the most comfortable. I do not want to fight the book -- I want it to disappear so that my imagination may wander unhindered with Jane's characters. I hope you enjoy the novels, whichever edition you choose.
B00005JOVN|4.0|\\"It may be cheese, but \\"Poseidon\\" lays out a mighty fine spread. [Credit mainly] director Wolfgang Petersen (\\"Das Boot,\\" \\"In the Line of Fire,\\" Air Force One,\\" \\"Outbreak,\\" \\"The Perfect Storm,\\" AKA a lot of good stuff - of course, he also made \\"Troy\\").   He shoots both barrels in this escapist blast. After a perfunctory character setup, Petersen hits the action button and never stops whaling on it.  Hollywood made a hit film of Paul Gallico's novel The Poseidon Adventure back in 1972, sparking an era of disaster flicks (Most recently, and most similarly, was Sly Stallone's underrated \\"Daylight\\"). On the technical front, this remake whups the original's ass.  You'll end up entertained if you forgive the clich?s and let Petersen grab you with the visuals, from the avalanche of water in the ballroom to the eerie sight of a flooded crawl space where wires take on the form of deadly tentacles. One of the bigger names in the cast has a drowning scene that really had me going. You don't expect a remake to spring surprises. This one does.\\"    So says Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers (everything in parenthesis are my own little thoughts and additions).  And he is right on the money.  This movie may be plot-light, and yes, it is yet another remake, but movies like this are made to be updated as technology is.  It would be sacrilege for anyone to attempt a remake of say, \\"The Godfather\\" or \\"Gone with the Wind\\" just because they can, but \\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" was not The Godfather.\\"  I'm sure it has its loyalist fans, but unless they are completely delusional they should be able to admit the movie was pure cheese and pretty much was made, as many movies are today, for a special effects showcase and not much more.  These are really the only kind of movies Hollywood should bother remaking.  You can't really insult the integrity of the original and on a technical level you can do things so much better.  The BIG special effect movies tend to wear me out after being force-fed them all summer long.  Movies can truly do anything nowadays, so effects alone just don't cut it - especially after a whole summer of similar, effect-laden fare.  But \\"Poseidon\\" has the advantage of being first out of the gate. I am not oversaturated at this point and as a kick off to the summer movie season, this one is just right.  For pure thrills, grandeur and eye-popping visuals, \\"Poseidon\\" is the go-to movie so far this summer.  Watch your back \\"MI:  III.\\"    ***By the way, unlike the completely insane John Q. Public below me, I have actually seen this movie - and all the ones I review - before I write a review.  If you want a laugh, check out his \\"see all my reviews.\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|More than any band of this generation, TOOL demands time. To review a TOOL album mere days after its release is frankly an insult to the band. So this represents an initial observation rather than a review; I'm glancing at the menu not gorging on the feast. <br /> <br />If you want a bubblegum rock album that's going to grab your attention for a few minutes and then quickly lose its flavor, then this is not the album or band for you. The 'singles' from 10,000 days ('Vicarious', and eventually 'The Pot') contain as much depth as an entire album of the majority of modish recycled music that pollutes the airwaves these days. That said, 'Vicarious', 'Jambi', 'The Pot' and 'Right in Two' are accessible enough to leave an immediately pleasant taste in the mouth. These four songs represent the more contemporary elements of TOOL's music. They're heavy, and superbly executed. You can put them in a box and stick a label on it, which is what most of us seem to need to do to become comfortable with music. <br /> <br />The rest of the album is harder to classify but will eventually be more rewarding It's essentially just two long songs, one shorter one and a pair of segues. The first major piece is the Wings / 10,000 days duo. Many others have explained the meaning of this opus, so I'll deal with the flavor rather than the ingredients:  this is an ethereal piece of music which is touching, personal and at times very uplifting. This segment of the album is a quiet treasure, in which Maynard gives much of himself to the listener. <br /> <br />The second experimental piece is the Lost Keys / Rosetta Stoned pair. The beginning is reminiscent of early Floyd, maybe a piece of Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast, but once the scene is set, the mother of all jams begins. 'Stoned' is enigmatic, it's both fabulously spontaneous and at the same time meticulously designed and engineered. The best parties are always the ones that are unplanned, yet this one is both a riotous drunken ball and a choreographed high-society wedding. This one will grow, I'll wager it's the track that no one likes on first hearing, yet it's the one talked about for years. <br /> <br />As I've already said, this album is essentially unreviewable and probably will be for a few months yet. I don't want to give it a rating, but Amazon insists I must. So I'll therefore rate it at the level which I assume it will eventually reach. However, if you don't have the patience to immerse yourself in TOOL's music and allow it to slowly consume you, then you're wasting your money. <br /> <br />As Maynard might say, \\"We can always play you some Green Day\\"
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool's new album is not for those into instant gratification.  It is something that needs to be experienced and felt.  You actually need to open your mind with this type of music.  I am a huge fan of many different genres of film.  I'm always amused by people who hate Japanese Horror or Italian giallo films or other Asian or European fare because they do not provide the instant gratification that US \\"films\\" provide.  \\"I hate reading subtitles\\", \\"The ending doesn't make sense\\", \\"The plot isn't straightforward\\", etc.  All of these are common issues people have with these types of films.  Why?  I believe that it is because we are a fast food society and we no longer want to think, to expand our minds, to move outside our comfort zones.  For me, there is nothing better than watching some great foreign film and then thinking \\"What was it that I just experienced, how many different levels and layers does this film really have?\\"   <br /> <br />I believe the same holds true for Tool.  When I am done listening to this album, I am left thinking, and appreciating the unique nature of the music.  It's not fast food, it's a fine foreign film, and Yes it has subtitles
B000EULJLU|5.0|I've always considered Tool this generation's Pink Floyd.  As a dark, intellectual progressive metal band, they've achieved outstanding commercial success and a near-fanatical following among their hardcore fans. <br /> <br />This album once again demonstrates why. <br /> <br />10,000 Days is not so much an evolution from the band's last album, Lateralus, as it the well-polished sum of all their work to date.  Tracks like \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" recall the band's earlier work, with heavy distorted guitars and pounding bass-heavy rhythms, all coming together in a polished, mature way.  The pair of songs \\"Wings For Marie\\" and \\"10,000 Days\\" recall the powerful, spiritual songs of Lateralus, taking them to new heights of emotion.  Singer Maynard Keenan's voice is at its best here, driving the latter song forward and carrying it by the sheer power of his vocals. <br /> <br />The album does take a turn down after its midpoint, reaching what is perhaps Tool's most commercial song to date (\\"The Pot\\").  It's still high-quality work, but not as complex or emotional as the first four tracks. <br /> <br />Fortunately, after a couple of shorter bridging tracks, the album once again reaches for the high quality work earlier on the album with \\"Rosetta Stoned\\".  It's a weird song, but who does weird better than Tool?  Guitarist Adam Jones is at his crunchy best here, driving the song forward with riff after riff. <br /> <br />While not as memorable as previous songs, the album's closing tracks, \\"Intension\\" and \\"Right In Two\\" provide a fitting conclusion.  The first serves as a break from the heavy metal assault of the majority of the album, but lacks the dynamics and emotion of \\"Wings For Marie/10,000 Days\\".  The second plays in much the same vein as \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\", another well-written progressive metal track.  Its lyrics lambast humanity itself, referring to us as \\"silly monkeys\\" fighting over unimportant issues. <br /> <br />As a whole, 10,000 Days suffers in comparisonto Lateralus.  It lacks the coherency of vision present on the band's last album, feeling much more like a collection of songs than a single, precisely constructed work.  Still, the songs themselves are excellent, and Tool proves themselves a mature metal band well-deserving of their success--if that not the fanatical devotion of their followers.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|Thoughts on PJ <br /> <br />Life Wasted --  Very good..Will rock in concert....Will become an anthem for middle American teens who lives suck and are hoping to find a better way <br /> <br />WWS --    Excellent, very catchy. <br /> <br />Comatose --  A modern day Spin the Black Circle -  Will be great in concert. <br /> <br />Severed Hand --  When the songs slows 3/4 of the way through, I hear \\" Insignificance \\".    Good tune. <br /> <br />Marker -  Great  melody and refrain/ chorus.....Favorite song so far. <br /> <br />Parachutes --  Pretty ballad....reminds me a little of  \\" All Those Yesteryears \\" <br /> <br />Unemployable --  Excellent.  A PJ pop song if you will.  Should get radio airtime. <br /> <br />Big Wave --  Not a great song, but will a song you grow to love after you hear it in  concert .....A la \\" Do the Evolution \\" <br /> <br />Gone --    Very nice ...Could see them doing this as the opening song of an encore. <br /> <br />Wasted Reprise -- Not needed, but I like it...Again, a song to reinforce a message of hope for misguided teens. <br /> <br />Army Reserve -- Like it a bunch -- I hear some of The Edge in the background guitar.......Can see McCready doing a solo around it. <br /> <br />Come Back --   A PJ country and western song --   Great.  Hear some similar guitars to \\" I Wish \\". <br /> <br />Inside Job --   Maybe the best song...Love it when the pianos kick in....can see some shows ending w/ this song. <br />
B00005JOQS|5.0|I have no idea why idiots are posting reviews before the movie comes out. Quit being a bunch of morons, stop bashing a movie that's not even out. I have no idea why Amazon lets this happen. Please, future reviewers, only review after you've seen the movie, I swear, each time someone bashes a movie that's not out, everybody who reads it IQ drops...
B000ETQRCM|5.0|FIRST OFF) <br /> <br />It's UNBELIEVABLE to me how people such as the reviewer below call themselves a \\"Die-Hard Pearl Jam freak\\" Yet for owning the album for no more than a few days at the most, are already so willing to give it 3 stars... ANY true Pearl Jam freak knows that any new Pearl Jam album has never been easy to listen to right from the beginning & always takes a couple weeks to really grow... Yet this is May 3rd, yesterday this album came out.. & we got people like the reviewer below giving this album a bad rating while calling themselves a \\"Die-Hard Pearl Jam freak\\" <br /> <br />Give me a break you phonies. <br /> <br />Secondly - People are insulting Eddie's voice & saying Mike isn't anywhere on the album... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! LISTEN TO 'COME BACK', LISTEN TO 'LIFE WASTED', LISTEN TO 'SEVERED HAND' & you're actually saying Mike isn't anywhere on the album? He's EVERYWHERE & he's playing excellent <br /> <br />And Eddie Vedder's voice is more captivating than it's ever been.. It's as if the soul of Muddy Waters or Otis Redding or Sam Cooke is inside him when he sings 'Come Back' & 'Cometose' matches any intensity he had on Vs or Vitalogy <br /> <br />Some people are saying Eddie's soul & that song doesn't match that of past blues musicians... LET'S BE REAL.. THE ONLY REASON ANYONE IS SAYING THAT IS BECAUSE EDDIE ISN'T BLACK.. HE'S UNDER 50, & THEY'RE OVERLY OBSESSED PROFESSIONAL CRITIC REJECTS THAT ONLY LISTEN TO WHAT SOCIETY TELLS THEM IS \\"LEGENDARY\\" <br /> <br />Eddie's voice matches ANYTHING , any amount of soul anyone like BB King ever touched on before... It's an amazing song & that leads me to my next comment.. <br /> <br />Some people are saying there's no classic Pearl Jam songs on this album.... WHAT?!?! <br /> <br />'COME BACK', 'LIFE WASTED', 'INSIDE JOB', 'PARACHUTES' (which sounds heavily Beatles inspired) 'GONE'... are some of the best songs of Pearl Jam's career... Oh but you \\"Die-hard Pearl Jam freaks\\" won't even give that halfa week to sink in... <br /> <br />And by the way, this album sounds nothing like any album they've done in the past!! I never understand people who compare new Pearl Jam albums to past ones... Theyve been my favorite band for over 8 years & this albums sounds NOTHING like any album they've done before. <br /> <br />ABOUT THE AVOCADO <br /> <br />The Velvet Underground's debut album has a banana on the cover & everyone thinks it's brilliant... Pearl Jam's self-titled album comes out & same music critic rejects say \\"I don't get it\\"... <br /> <br />THE AVOCADO IS A SYMBOL OF THE GREEN PARTY, WHICH PEARL JAM IS HEAVILY ASSOCIATED WITH <br /> <br />Explained now? Everything better now kids? <br /> <br /> <br />- IN CLOSING... I DON'T CARE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS REVIEW, I DON'T CARE IF EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU CLICK \\"NO\\"... I'M NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT OBSESS OVER SUCH SMALL THINGS.. ALL OF YOU COULD CLICK \\"NO\\" FOR ALL I CARE, I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK MY MIND. <br />

B00000DHZJ|5.0|For the ignorant reviewer who panned Hendrix ( Biz Bitter Lang) or \\"Mr. White-Collared Conservative Flashing Down The Street\\". He could play better with his teeth than those \\"greats\\" you talked about.  I guess you're too \\"respectable\\", too \\"sophisticated\\" to get it.  I wish Hendrix were alive now so he could join Neil on his new song \\"Impeach the President\\"... Hendrix was the Master!

B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is it - this is the one we've been waiting for, the one we've been signing online petitions for. The cinematography, the sound, and yes, even the story and acting. It's the only racing movie that ever got it all right, capturing the epic skill and danger of the era without dumbing it down for the masses (Days of Thunder) or sacrificing drama (Le Mans). Absolute magic.
B000002C1W|5.0|I've been a fan since the very first time my dad danced me to sleep to \\"Cpmfortably Numb.\\" I love The Wall, Dark Side, and all the other recognized greats. I have to say, though, that Momentary Lapse is my favorite. Even without Waters, the group pulls off a stunning ensemble of sound complimented with excellent sound effects, awesome guitar solos, good lyrics (as good as they can get without Waters), and an overall theme that you come to expect from Pink Floyd. A few of the songs could use tweaking- \\"Dogs of War\\" comes to mind- but overall I was very impressed. I had expected the band to flop after Final Cut. <br />I would highly recommend this album.
B0001CNRBG|2.0|some stories date really badly, and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one. all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s POV, and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant. decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn, but the writing and directing cant be compensated for. <br />
0449002632|1.0|If you pick up this large book please take a close look at the genealogy chart. From the top down it looks like the unwrapping of a rope. As the rope unravels it becomes frayed, chewed upon and ratty. That is what happens to this book. I must confess that I just had to finish it because I wanted it to end not as I had predicted. But, it did end as predicted. For example, once you looked at the chapter titles and saw that the end was titled \\"The Blitz\\",  when reading the chapter where the Romans hid the gold you immediately knew that it would be found after a German bomb hit that place in World War II - it did and it was! <br /> <br />This book is NOT Follett's \\"Pilars of the Earth\\" nor is it any one of Michner's - not even \\"Poland\\"! It is too long, to frayed and not small enough for an airplane read. I cannot recommend it to anyone. I have not read Sarum, and now I won't.
B000BB1MI2|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Tim Burton, normally one of the most innovative and inspired of modern American filmmakers, comes a cropper with \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" a cold and crass adaptation of the beloved children's story by Roald Dahl.  This is actually the second filming of the work, the first being the charming and delightful 1971 film renamed \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" to give Gene Wilder the title role.<br /><br />In this remake, Johnny Depp takes on the part of the famed chocolate manufacturer who decides to open up his factory to the first five children who find a gold ticket in one of his bars.  Charlie is the sweet-tempered young boy who is the fifth to do so, and, thus, gets to take the tour along with four other obnoxious brats who have none of the purity of spirit he does.<br /><br />\\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" fails to make us care about either the situation or the characters.  Depp plays Wonka like a bizarre cross between Michael Jackson and Carol Burnett, and Burton, even with all his attention to detail in the sets and special effects, is unable to distract is from the fact that not a whole lot is really going on in the film.  The early scenes, involving Charlie's eccentric relatives and their attempts to secure the ticket for him, have a warm, familial feel to them, but once the tour itself begins, we become as imprisoned in the claustrophobic setting as the characters themselves.<br /><br />Locked in a tedious monotony, the plot essentially consists of Wonka, the children, and their respective parents moving from room to room where each of the four brats meets up with his or her well-deserved comeuppance in the form of a bizarre factory accident, until only sweet little Charlie is left.  Interspersed throughout are a series of inane song-and-dance sequences a la Busby Berkeley and uninteresting and undramatic flashbacks to Wonka's deprived and unhappy childhood that are somehow supposed to explain why he has become the creepy character we find at the center of the story.<br /><br />The art direction and set decoration are fine but not impressive enough to make us overlook the dullness and unpleasantness of so much of the film.  Mr. Burton may need to go back to making the kind of small, quirky films that he cut his directorial teeth on and leave these empty, bloated big screen extravaganzas to others.center of the story.

B000000W5N|5.0|Why the average review for this album is anything less than 5 stars is beyond me.  Whether you believe that this is the best Rolling Stones album (and personally I do, but you could debate it until the end of time), there's no denying that the material here is first-rate.  This album is among rock 'n' roll's finest.  The album is great from start to finish, so I won't bother you with details.  My favorite song is \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\\" definitely in the top 10 rock 'n' roll songs, period.  If you haven't heard this album then buy it, now.
0784011710|3.0|meryl streep DOES give a great performance, but this is just a bit too downbeat for me. all those nazis, y'know? and as an aside, the commentary is the worst ive ever heard on a dvd, being recorded at the same volume level as the dialog, rendering BOTH unlistenable. <br />
1400062756|5.0|I stayed up late reading Carol Dweck's book, Mindset.  What fun it is! It is so clear, so deeply experienced, and entertainingly written.  I am going to buy about five copies to give to friends & family.  <br />   This book has highlighted a deep yet obvious truth, which informs all our lives: life is a Rorschach test. There is choice in perception, and that choice is determined by whether we perceive our intelligence and our talents as fixed & finite or in flux & subject to growth.  In the latter mindset, all our missteps are transformed into opportunities for growth and learning.  <br />   How healthy it is to be able to laugh at our mistakes and to be invigorated by a challenge.  How lovely it is to revel in the achievements of those we love, instead of feeling diminished by their successes.  <br />   This book contains the stuff of which happy, creative, and loving lives are made. It should be a best, seller!
B000EULJLU|4.0|The only Tool album I loved from start to finish the day I bought it was Undertow, back in 1993. That was the same year I bought Radiohead's debut and had a similar reaction. I saw them both in concert that year, and they have been two of my favorite bands since. Anyone who's been listening to these bands from their debut has come to expect each new release to be a departure from the previous one. For me personally, I've never liked any of the followup albums on first listen. It always takes a week or so for me to really like them. But once I do, I can't remember what I didn't like in the first place. It's a similar phenomenon with Pink Floyd albums or Aphex Twin albums or Skinny Puppy albums (expect for maybe their last one without Dwayne Goettel), where your first reaction is confusion, then a week later you have an \\"ah-ha\\" moment. So if you come across a bad review from someone written on the same day this CD was released, you can pretty much ignore it. I'm not saying \\"10,000\\" Days is a masterpiece -- I think many of the Tool fans claiming such are jumping the gun (sometimes Maynard worshipers mistake bad experiments for creative genius). But it's certainly worth $15.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Listen people, although I am not feeling the whole concept of Mobb deep going G-Unit ya gotta admit this album really ain't half bad if you don't take it at face value and say \\"man this joint is gonna be wack cause they with G-Unit now\\" Some tracks on this album remind me of what i'd expect from Mobb Deep like \\"put em in they place\\" or \\"the infamous\\" produced by the alchamist. Like anotha gentleman said on here it's that classic Mobb Deep sound. While other cuts like \\"give it to ya\\" and that last cut on the album with 50 and Nate Dogg or any other joint wit 50 sound just plain G-Unitish. I'm not knockin G-Unit but G-Unit is not Mobb Deep, plain and simple. I mean yeah it was a good career move for Mobb Deep to go this route but they've already lost their true fan base(for the most part). Granted the production is tight, I can bop my head to this album from start to finish, but Hav and Prodigy need to go back to that Hell on Earth, Murda Muzik or The infamous sound that they used to be on cause that's what the fans miss.
B000EULJLU|5.0|10,000 Days marks the return of Tool. The plain and simple truth is that Tool have always made their music with furious complexities and timing variations you don't find anywhere else. This is what we expect from Tool, and this is what they have delivered. <br />This band is vastly different from A Perfect Circle, even though they share the same singer... do not think these two bands are alike beyond that. <br />Having said all of that, this album is nothing short of fabulous. Each time I listen to it, I hear more of the intricacies that have been put into this effort.  <br />If you like Tool, maybe you'll like this CD <br />If you love Tool, then you'll love this CD!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is dripping with beautiful animation. I love the costume design work and the facial expressions. This is a major step stone for CGI movies. Absolutely incredible. Cloud really shines.
B00012L786|5.0|just a near-perfect concept: richard widmark is a pickpocket whose latest mark is a young woman who just happens to be a spy carrying nuclear secrets in her wallet. film noir at its very best. and thelma ritter to boot. <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|Quite simply Tool's best work.  After just acquiring 10,000 days, along with many listens, I can still honestly say Aenima is still their greatest album.  Strong in all aspects, lyrics, instrumentals, meaning, organization of songs, etc.  Some people who expected Tool to maintain their Opiate and Undertow sound have been disappointed, however, good bands that survive a long time tend to change their sound and Tool has done that successfully on this album.    I suggest you buy this CD if you're into Tool's other work as well as any bands such as APC, NIN, Rage, Audioslave, system of a down, etc.  Simply a great album.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|<br />Vitalogy was the beginning of the mixed bags. While PJ have had some excellent moments on each post Vs. disc, they've failed to deliver a complete effort (start to finish) - until now. I've been a huge fan of PJ's music since the release of 10. Personally, I have never cared for their political views and never will (can't we all just get along?), but I'm open enough overlook that and appreciate the music. And, for the first time since 1993, there's plenty to appreciate here. <br /> <br />By no means is this in the same category as 10 or Vs.  That said, there's still plenty of solid tunes to enjoy.  Come Back, in my opinion, is the best song they've produced since In Hiding (Yield).  In fact, to save text, I'll simple say of all the songs on here, the only one that has yet to completely grow on me is Comatose. But, I've only had it for 5 hours....  <br /> <br />There's something to enjoy on all of PJs releases (even Riot Act). But for the first time in a long time you can buy a Pearl Jam disc and just push play.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam never went away!!  As other reviewers have noted, every Pearl Jam release has something to offer anyone...I can't imagine my music collection without Pearl Jam--it's that simple.  If you enjoy any kind of introspective, meaningful music in any way...I suggest getting into Pearl Jam.  Ed Vedder is one of the greatest song writers ever--arguably the greatest in the last 16 years or so. This record is no exception..not as much of a 'challenge' to get into as some of their previous efforts  (which means mainstreamers may enjoy this and/or bandwagoners will be jumping back on. The end result is, unfortunately, they won't be \\"my band\\" anymore--Pearl jam fans, you all know what I mean...)but this is definitely worth the money. What I love about Pearl Jam the most is that they never get boring or repetitive.  They are always re-inventing themselves and growing musically, lyrically, and artistically.  I'm not going to get into a song-by-song breakdown, enough reviewers have done a great job of that already. Is this record good? Yes. Is it their best in 10 years? Who cares, how can you truly judge an artform? Pearl Jam fans can't even agree on which album is the best, and why would you want to? It's music--it's an artform--Art is expression and creativity. Art is Pearl Jam.  If you have any sense or depth at all to your person, and if you take the time to not only listen, but hear Pearl Jam, you will be a fan for life... At the very least, listen to this record... and go see them live before you die...
B000EULJLU|5.0|10 000 days is an incredible experience. evry time i listen to this cd i like it more and more it is my faviorate cd. if you tool then you will love this cd.
B00007G207|3.0|a tad overpraised when it opened, the directors cut only serves to extend the flaws of this movie. the early scenes with the little boy are what everyone remembers, but it goes on & on & on & on after he grows up. not bad, but not great.
B000002I27|5.0|I like most of the Doors albums--they all have certain qualities that make them unique. But \\"Strange Days\\" is on a level all by itself...not only when compared to other Doors albums, but all albums of this genre. As my poor mother said when she heard me playing it for the first time back in '67: \\"He sounds like a depressed crazy.\\" She must have heard \\"Horse Latitudes!\\" Back then when parents would say something like that, you knew you were on to something! This is just a deeply dark, emotional piece of art set to haunting rhythms...the Doors \\"blue period\\"...even the bluish hued album cover conjures memories from the movie \\"Freaks.\\" If I were to leave a time capsule from the 60's, I'd almost be afraid to put this ablum in the capsule just because the finders would think we were a bunch of depressed psychotics! Without going through all the songs, since this album is truely on a par with \\"Abbey Road\\" in that everyone is very familiar with all of the songs on this album--but from beginning to end each song paints a blue image in black light psychedelia of existing and impending doom...with the exception of \\"Love me Two Times\\" which, when compared to the other songs, sounds light hearted! Written by Robby Krieger, it seems a little misplaced on this album. Robby Krieger finally stepped to the foreground and played some great 60's, west coast guitar, something that was pretty much missing from the first album; I always thought the first album was a little heavy with the organ and a little light with the guitar...that evened out with Strange Days. This is an essential 60's album; without it, your collection is missing the dark psychedelic mood that sometimes permeated the 60's not to mention several great great songs. Besides, this album contains the audible \\"scream of the butterfly\\"--probably the only time it has been heard since time began. This album came at a time when the Doors were at their creative peak; before all the drugs, booze and notariety took its inevitable toll. I think it is their most creative and interesting album.toll. I think it is their most creative and interesting album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|For the small few of you giving this CD a low rating, listen to it for a week, then come back. For those of you about to give it a low rating, DON'T DO IT YET!! Listen to it a little longer then come back to write a review. When I first listened to it I was like \\"WTF?!?!\\" The next day I was like \\"Ah\\". the third I was like \\"Hmmmm\\". Now I'm craving it every second of the day. <br /> <br />This record is really a masterpiece. There are definitely hidden meanings and positive energy contained within. On a musical level, there are so many small details that you won't pick up at first, but you start to notice them in time. You will discover things each time through it. <br /> <br />Trust me, BUY THIS RECORD!!! Support the band so that they will come back again in 5 years ;) <br /> <br />TOOL is the greatest band currently active. Your great, great, great grandchildren will be talking about them.  <br /> <br />Witness history and get this record <br /> <br />P.S. The artwork/packaging is very creative.
B000002J09|5.0|I'm not a Led Zeppelin fan at all but this album is really an exception. The song \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" is one of the best songs of all time that every rock fans would agree. On to the album. This is a no filler album. Even though that some tracks are better than others, the album has eight tracks for a very good reason,every track as good. This album is perfect with nothing but epic songs, 1 to 8. <br /> <br />Black Dog - Excellent opener with heavy guitar complimented by Robert Plants's excellent vocals. 8/10 <br /> <br />Rock and Roll - The drumming is solid and powerful that John Bonham deserves it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Battle of Evermore - Folk song totally, awesome acoustic guitar with perfect harmony. 10/10 <br /> <br />Stairway To Heaven - What can you say, it's just a perfection. This song is overplayed just because it's the best rock song of all time. It's impossible to describe how perfect this song is. <br />20/10. <br /> <br />Misty Mountain Hop - One of the worst songs that I've ever heard. The melody here is totally ridiculous. 2/10. <br /> <br />Four Sticks - Another foolish song. How can you hold two drum sticks on each hand to play drums. That's ridiculous. 2/10 <br /> <br />Going To California - Another folk song that showcases perfect harmony of the mandolin and acoustic guitar. One of my favourite Zeppelin's songs. 11/10 <br /> <br />When The Levee Breaks - One of the heaviest songs that Led Zeppelin ever did with blasting drums and driving guitar. 8/10 <br /> <br />This album is not only for Zeppelin fans but for those who have ears. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin rules.
B000FIMG68|5.0|LOST is one of the best TV shows (along with Desperate Housewives, Greys Anatomy, and Prison Break) to come out in a long time. In a world where silly reality TV seems to have taken over, it is refreshing to see a quality show out there like LOST. Lost is one of the few shows that hooks you in, gets you addicted, and takes you on this emotional journey with the characters. I give Disney a lot of credit for releasing such a beautiful DVD set. They really put much time and effort in to the LOST DVD sets and it really shows.<br /><br />Lost The Complete Second Season - The Extended Experience will be released as a 7 disc DVD set and it includes all season 2 episodes of the this awesome show.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|FIRST OFF) <br /> <br />It's UNBELIEVABLE to me how people such as the reviewer below call themselves a \\"Die-Hard Pearl Jam freak\\" Yet for owning the album for no more than a few days at the most, are already so willing to give it 3 stars or less... ANY true Pearl Jam freak knows that any new Pearl Jam album has never been easy to listen to right from the beginning & always takes a couple weeks to really grow... Yet this is May 3rd, yesterday this album came out.. & we got people like the reviewer below giving this album a bad rating while calling themselves a \\"Die-Hard Pearl Jam freak\\" <br /> <br />Give me a break you phonies. <br /> <br />Secondly - People are insulting Eddie's voice & saying Mike isn't anywhere on the album... WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT YOU PSYCHOS? LISTEN TO 'COME BACK', LISTEN TO 'LIFE WASTED', LISTEN TO 'SEVERED HAND' & you're actually saying Mike isn't anywhere on the album? He's EVERYWHERE & he's playing excellent <br /> <br />And Eddie Vedder's voice is more captivating than it's ever been.. It's as if the soul of Muddy Waters or Otis Redding or Sam Cooke is inside him when he sings 'Come Back' <br /> <br />Some people are saying Eddie's soul & that song doesn't match that of past blues musicians... LET'S BE REAL.. THE ONLY REASON ANYONE IS SAYING THAT IS BECAUSE EDDIE ISN'T BLACK.. HE'S UNDER 50, & THEY'RE OVERLY OBSESSED MUSIC SNOBS THAT ONLY LISTEN TO WHAT SOCIETY TELLS THEM IS \\"LEGENDARY\\" <br /> <br />Eddie's voice matches ANYTHING , any amount of soul anyone like BB King ever touched on before... It's an amazing song & that leads me to my next comment.. <br /> <br />Some people are saying there's no classic Pearl Jam songs on this album.... WHAT?!?! <br /> <br />'COME BACK', 'LIFE WASTED', 'INSIDE JOB', 'PARACHUTES' (which sounds heavily Beatles inspired) 'GONE'... are some of the best songs of Pearl Jam's career... Oh but you \\"Die-hard Pearl Jam freaks\\" won't even give that half a week to sink in... <br /> <br />And by the way, this album sounds nothing like any album they've done in the past!! I never understand people who compare new Pearl Jam albums to past ones... Theyve been my favorite band for over 8 years & this albums sounds NOTHING like any album they've done before. <br /> <br />ABOUT THE AVOCADO <br />________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />The Velvet Underground's debut album has a banana on the cover & everyone thinks it's brilliant... Pearl Jam's self-titled album comes out & same yuppie music critic rejects say \\"I don't get it\\"... <br /> <br />THE AVOCADO IS A SYMBOL OF THE GREEN PARTY, WHICH PEARL JAM IS HEAVILY ASSOCIATED WITH <br /> <br />Explained now? Everything better now? <br /> <br /> <br />- IN CLOSING... I DON'T CARE IF YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS REVIEW, I DON'T CARE IF EVERY LAST ONE OF YOU CLICK \\"NO\\"... I'M NOT ONE OF THESE PEOPLE THAT OBSESS OVER SUCH SMALL THINGS.. ALL OF YOU COULD CLICK \\"NO\\" FOR ALL I CARE, I JUST WANTED TO SPEAK MY MIND.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Damnation is one the best albums I've heard in a long time. Because of this Opeth opus I have started to listen to alot more of the obscure folk/prog bands from the 1970's. Listening to Damnation I hear King Crimson, Wishbone Ash, Pink Floyd, Mellow Candle, Comus, Black Widow and others in the same vein. Faves from this disc are: Windowpane, In My Time of Need, Closure, basically the whole album is amazing.  Listen to it with an open heart and mind. Don't expect the death metal Opeth is known for, but dark folk/prog rock.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Don't get me wrong.. I absolutely loved Tool's 3 previous albums. Aenima is probably my favourite album of all time. But...10000 days just doesn't have the epic feel that their previous 2 did.  <br /> <br />Vicarious is an amazing song, but I'd say its the only great song on the album. Rosetta stoned and 10000 days give the album one star, vicarious gives it 2, therefore a rank of 3. <br /> <br />I expected more from Tool...maybe it will grow on me, but I'll need to get over the initial disappointment,
B00004Y6NP|5.0|At first I'm not familiar with this album in spite of two well-known hits: \\"So Far Away\\" & \\"Walk of Life\\". One day, my working associate called Brian May (whose real name is Brian Lee and claims to be the biggest fan of Queen) highly recommended me to buy it and after that I was totally blown away. <br /> <br />So Far Away - the easily understandable lament of anybody who has been away from their loved one. It gets right at the heart of the emotion, with the same thoughts running around and around in your mind, unable to be shaken free. 15/10 <br /> <br />Money For Nothing - The whole song is a big spoof of consumer culture (including that MTV reference) and the lyrics were taken from actual snippets of conversation that Mark Knopfler had heard people saying. 8/10 <br /> <br />Walk Of Life - It's about getting through life as best you can, and doing the best with what you have. I find it very inspirational. 20/10 <br /> <br />Your Latest Trick - Gets more into deeper emotions. I just love the lyrics. \\"Most of the taxis, and most of the whores, are only taking calls in cash.\\" It gives you a visceral mental image. 15/10 <br /> <br />Why Worry - Talk about the perfect song to play when you're feeling low. Just sit back with a glass of port, and listen to this one play. The guitar work is gorgeous, and Mark's soothing voice really does help make it feel like things will get better. 15/10 <br /> <br />Ride Across The River - Spooky Feeling about this track. Just close your eyes and imagine that you're ridin' across the river while you are listening to it. 5/10 <br /> <br />The Man's Too Strong - Strange song. Can't grow on me even after listening to it several times. 2/10 <br /> <br />One World - Not a stand out track actually, but the lyrics are quite cool. 4/10 <br /> <br />Brothers In Arms - Here comes the title track. Not a bad track but when you are feelin'low, just have a listen to it. 3/10 <br /> <br />After all, this is \\"The Dire Straits\\" most successful studio album, so if you are a progressive rock fan you must have it. Just don't hestitate.  <br /> <br />P.S. Thanks to Brian May who recommended this for me.
B00007BKVC|3.0|If you are shopping for the Special Edition with the extra features this is not it. I bought this DVD expecting to see the Thelma & Louise: The Last Journey documentary and the Original theatrical featurette as mentioned in the product details section on amazon. It turns out that the version of this movie that amazon is selling is the regular edition without the bonus material. I have written to amazon three times to inform them of the error and I have called in twice. So far amazon has not updated the web page. If I could rate amazons service I would give them one star. Don't waste your time here if you are looking for the special edition.
0783219695|2.0|I am a Sci-Fi / Space geek so this movie seemed right up my alley.  The cast was solid, the director has talent, and the story is a true story so all pretty much went well...right?  Nope.    This was a pretty dull film with very little believable suspense. The formula kept repeating over and over: Something goes wrong + Houston advises + Astronauts do something = All is well.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Boring, VERY boring. I never once flet any real tension except for the initial \\"problem\\" which obviously was not THAT bad because everything went well in the end.      The problem is that all of the \\"issues\\" the men faced were handled so matter-of-factly.  Rarely did anyone seem rushed or panicked.... it was just yeah, attach this tube to this tube and magically everything will be OK.  I never felt that the astronauts were really threatened, maybe a few times, but only for a minute or two.  Some reviews claim that this movie was tense and riveting.... how so I must ask?  Nothing really happened.  It was not emotional at all since the \\"struggles\\" of the men were so poorly portrayed.  To each his own I guess, but 4 1/2 stars?  Geeez, just because Tom Hanks is in it does not make the movie good follks!    The family interactions were pretty standard: Crying wife, kids asking questions, annoying media attention, etc, etc.  Yeah, I could feel for the characters to some extent, but again, this movie needed a LOT more real tension and panic to be meaningful.    I will say that the launch scene was excellent and very cool, so were some of the space shots but even those were fake with noise and Star-Trekkish special effects.    Too bad, I had high hopes for this film but was completely disappointed and bored.    NOT recommended.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Like everything Tool does, this album is a masterwork of songwriting and performance.  They don't ever do anything halfway.  Much like Lateralus, this album contains long sections of very atmospheric music that pulls you along inexorably, as well as some highly aggressive gut-punchers like \\"The Pot.\\"<br /><br />Maynard's incisive lyrics glorify the flaws of the human experience and relentlessly cut down anyone who would deny their own personal failings.<br /><br />Well worth waiting five years for.  Now, if they'll just tour somewhere near my town I can actually see them.
B0002B55WA|4.0|Magical Mystery tour is a cool little film with some funny scenes and some good music. So what if it's \\"weird\\" or offbeat. It's the Beatles! They were always creative and fun to watch, and they ventured out and tried new things. I had never seen this until I got it recently, and I like it.
B000ETQRCM|1.0|This album is lousy..  The band I grew up to love has now been reduced to this..  Unoriginal and lame..  What happened to the intensity and innocence some of their songs had..  Pearl Jam should hang it up now, instead of putting albums out like this one..
9626343346|5.0|I'm new to audio books.  But, I'm afraid I've already been spoiled.  I wonder if there could possibly exist a better combination of author and reader.  Holmes sounds just the way you'd expect the great sleuth to sound.  Deliberate, never rushed and always a gentleman.<br /><br />The story is carefully woven and the presentation of the characters by Timson is masterful.  I've listened to it over several times and each time I appreciate a little more the complexity and the detail.  The Musical interludes are brief and sparse, but definitely compliment.  If you like Sherlock Holmes, Timson is the right reader for the job.  I'm buying the big collection now.
B000EULJLU|5.0|After SIX years of \\"well worth it\\" wait, finally, good music!!! Tool has always been #1 on my list, because they actually put thought, melody and effort into thier music. When you listen to this thier latest work, if you really concentrate, you WILL lose youself in it. If you haven't heard Tool before or even if like me, you've been a fan since 1992, buy this album. You'll get your money's worth, at just over 1 hour and 15 minutes of continuous rythem.  <br />(music+art=Tool)x10,000Days=MASTERPIECE!
B000EULJLU|4.0|I've been a Tool fan since 1995, in a time in which almost NO ONE knew about them in sunny PR. When I first heard \\"Part Of Me\\", it blew me off right away, and ten years later they remain amongst my favorite bands, \\"Aenima\\" being in my top ten albums of all time. That being said, I must confess I was expecting Tool's latest album with a huge enthusiasm. But, after a few listens, I found myself somewhat dissappointed. The first tracks, \\"Vicarious\\" and \\"Jambi\\" are pure Tool, all that heavy-yet-artsy Rock, ferociuos as they've always been. Problem, in my opinion, is that there is too much filler, and that makes the album quite repetitive and boring. <br /> <br />\\"10,000 Days\\" is a good album after all, but as a long time Tool fan, I was expecting more considering we've waited over 5 years to see what Maynard and the gang were about to bring.
B000EULJLU|5.0|It may be hard to digest at first, but the interludes are what makes the album.Some people are upset that Vicarious, The Pot and Rosetta Stoned, and maybe one other is all thats there in this album, but Lost Keys blows my mind as an interlude into Rosetta Stoned.  <br />Intension is a very personal, reflective song as well. Buy This Album, Its a treat we've been missing for some time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|When I pickes up 10,000 Days, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but Tool has once again proven why at least I think they are the greatest band in the world. This album is not as dark as Lateralus, and Maynard brings a little too much of APC style vocalings, and some of his lyric style has changed, but all in all it is one of the best albums released in the last decade. It starts out heavy with VIcarious, and jambi, but then the overall mood changes and it gets pretty mellowed out. Musically speaking, it is no doubt the best they have ever done, which is rare in a band to keep topping the album previous to it. I believe this is definitely an album for the real fans of Tool. Yeah, we had to wait five years for it, but I think it was worth the wait. Tool just keeps on pushing the envelope. Its still the same Tool, with creepy guitar sounds and ambient bass grooves, topped off with some of the best drumming out there and thought provoking lyrics. These guys go a long way for their fans, and we should appreciate their effort. They refuse to conform to modern music standards where simple chord progressions and sappy lyrics are all you hear on the radio anymore. So, if you love Tool, go out and buy it, and if you want something different and don't particularly care for Tool, then go buy it anyway, I believe you will be pleasantly suprised. Definitely the most relaxing album to date, and well worth the wait, so put it in your shopping cart for one day shipping, it is a musical masterpiece on all levels.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I dont think this album is as good as any of the other Tool albums, I remember when I bought Lateralus, it took me 2 listens to fall in love with it. <br /> <br />I have listen to 10.000 Days 5 times and still much rather put Aenema or Lateralus or any other Tool or Perfect Circle album on. <br /> <br />I just dont feel that Maynard is singing as well as he can in this album, the only two in the band I do really feel have their moments are Danny and Justin. <br /> <br />But anyways, this album has 13 songs, this are my thoughts and scores: <br /> <br />Vicarious 4/5 Is Basically Schism in a different light, not 100% original gets better as it nears the end. <br /> <br />Jambi 4/5 One of my fav in the Album, wish Maynard singed a bit louder/better/more passionately. <br /> <br />Wings for Marie 1/5 Honestly, who the hell buys a Tool album for its \\"spiritual side?\\" if you want that then wear a thong and put some candles on and meditate or something, get Gery Halliwell's yoga. <br /> <br />10.000 Days 5/5 Fav song in the album, just the kind of progressive rock I like, nice guitar rifts, amazing bass and there isnt a word that can describe the awsome drumming. But once again, Maynard dissapoints. <br /> <br />The Pot 4/5 Was Maynard really stoned when he started singing this or something? I thought they were doing a System of Down and Danny or Justin or someone was having a go at singing, the singing does get better though, its just the beggining that sounds strange. I like the music but cant say much for the lyrics. <br /> <br />Lipan Conjuring 0/5 Again with he spiritual crap, honestly, if you like this guys, then go get naked and sing to the nearest tree in your vicinity. Peace and Love dudes. <br /> <br />Lost Keys 1/5 Well, this song is what it says on the box, I guess Maynard lost his keys and told the guys to play whatever they wanted while he went to look for them, because honestly is just crap. <br /> <br />Roseta Stoned 5/5 Again, better, much better, awsomesong and Maynard does seem to sing a bit better now, guess after I have learned the song by heart I can enjoy Kareoking this one in the car on the way to work. <br /> <br />Roseta Stoned 2/5 I would give it 1/5 but because its long I guess it deserves another point, so for this song to get 5/5 it would have to be like 3 hrs long because its that bad, once again they want us to have a spiritual moment. <br /> <br />Right in Two 4/5 Too slow and too long for the first 4 minutes or so, does get a lot better around the middle but then I guess thats ok because thats Tool so no real complaints on this one. <br /> <br />Viginti Tres 0/5 OK, godamnit, I hate when a band like Tool does this, they put some weird cool sounding name to a song and add some weird arse sounds to it and call it a song, come on guys, you cant POSSIBLY like this crap, songs like this and Roseta Stoned, Lost Keys, etc... cannot be enjoyed even if you are stoned, on acid, on coke, NOTHING can make you enjoy this!! <br /> <br />So yes, album has its moments, but for 5 yrs waiting its a dissapointment as a band as talented as Tool could have written this in under a year, unless they are not telling anyone they have another album coming out soon. <br /> <br />Peace and out, and for all of you who love the whole album, go to Yoga classes and buy an unlimited supply of candles. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|After five years, the members Tool has finally returned from their various side projects and created another full-length album for their devoted fans.  For months since the announcement of the album, fans have been speculating on the release and how it will measure up to Tool's previous albums.  Many people are complaining because they thought that this release would be another Lateralus or AEnima, and believe that Tool has fallen short of their so-called \\"promise\\" to us.  I for one believe that this is the greatest ALBUM they have released so far. <br />I say album emphatically to emphasive a point:  the difference between an album and a single.  While most bands focus on producing singles for radio, Tool creates entire albums where all the songs fit together.  The reason people are dissapointed is because 10,000 Days has no clear-cut, catchy singles:  there is no Lateralus, no Parabola, no AEnima.  Instead, what Tool has produced for its loyal fans is their best concept album to date.  All of the songs, filler included, flow impeccably well from one song to the next.  Heavy-hitting riffs and strange/unusual guitar effects are found on every song on the album.  Wings for Marie and 10,000 Days (Wings Pt. 2) are a good example of this fow:  Wings starts with almost no sound, and then begins moving slowly towards the end.  Then, weather effets are added in 10,000 days, where the idea begun in Wings climaxes into piercing lyrics and powerful riffs, quieting down again into a single sound.  This progression is found throughout the entire album, creating not 13 separate songs, but one powerful, intimate, and somewhat spiritual experience. <br />So if you are ready to undertake an 80-minute long musical journey unlike anything Tool has ever produced (or may ever produce), buy this album.  If you're looking for catchy singles, I suggest you go somewhere else, because that is not ever what Tool has been about anyway.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|I have been Pearl Jam's largest fan since before they were Pearl Jam!  First a few facts: <br />       Pearl Jam is the finest live act in Rock <br />       Eddie Vedder is the best performer in Rock <br />       The band is amazing together as a unit <br />       Isn't it nice to review a true band from the 90's? <br />Now, on to the album.  Great.  Buy it.  I'm from a red state and don't get into the politics too much, so I can say that his lyrics(their lyrics) are out of this world.  The album moves along at a nice speed.  Life Wasted, Wolrd Wide Suicide, Severed Hand, Inside Job, Come Back, and Comatose are my favorties as of now.  I think Severed Hand is their best rock song in years.  Good God, it has been a while since they rocked.  I stuck with them through no code, yeild,(I liked both of these cds) binural, and riot act.  I did not care for riot act too much, and binural made be only want to hear out of one ear.  So it is nice to again say that Pearl Jam is back on top of Rock! <br />        <br />
B000EMGAGW|1.0|I?m listening to this garbage trying to figure out if this is a Mobb Deep CD.This whole set of \\"songs\\" are so below average that it couldn?t be the same Mobb Deep that made Shook Ones and Drop a Gem On Them. Now P aka V.I.P (Very Insignificant Punk)  and Havoc aka Hollywood Faggg(unit)ot ride with G Unit and start dropping the wackest Crap ever.Now it seems that they turned to be as just as those G(arbage)Unit rappers selling this fake image of tough rich ignorant gangsta that don?t have to show respect to nobody ( women, fans,GOD , Jesus, religion...).I loved their first three records and respected their other ones but now their \\"music\\" are tailor made to fit into the mind of retards who actually spend some of their hard earned blood money on dumb lyrics, wack hooks and weak beats. If you are considering to give this more than 1 star i advice you to listen their first 03 CDs...I guess in the end it wasn?t Pac or Jay the ones that smashed their career, it was their greed and 50 Cent that crushed what once was Mobb Deep.        Be smart...IF THEY ARE AS RICH AS THEY SAY, THEY DON?T NEED YOUR MONEY. SO INSTED OF BUYING THIS WEAK CD JUST DOWNLOAD IT.I?M POSITIVE 50 WILL GIVE THEM MORE OF HIS BLOOD MONEY.BUT I HAVE TO WARN YOU: THIS IS A WASTE OF SPACE IN YOUR COMPUTER.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|this album is strait up awesome.  almost every beat is bumpin and every hook ill.  this is one of my favorite albums in the last year.  best song is \\"Capital P, Capital H\\"
B00003CXRM|3.0|This was an extremely likeable movie. It's not one of my all-time favorites, but it's a movie I'd enjoy watching again. Although there was really nothing extraordinary about the movie, it was very nicely done in many ways. The music was quite good (and I don't generally listen to blue grass or \\"old timey\\" kind of music). The characters were engaging. The atmosphere created was perfect for what I'd imagine the south was like during the time period portrayed in the movie. There was plenty of beautiful scenery. The movie was pretty much flawless, and although it may not be a great movie it is about as likeable as they come! (BTW, according to dictionary.com, likeable can also be spelled likable.)
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is back with a familiar yet fresh take on their old sound, and 10,000 days is a very satisfying album after a few listens.   <br /> <br />I say a few listens, because it takes a lot of time and \\"active listening\\" to fully digest.  There's a lot to this album, and it doesn't go down as easily as a generic top 40 single.   <br /> <br />It seems like there's a lot of maturity in this record, which only pain and age can impart into people, and the very fact that Tool is still playing together after 15 years (the intermittent APC hiati aside) is testament to both their staying power and their ability to grow together as a cohseive unit. <br /> <br />Musically, the album is solid and powerful, however those that are looking for them to be exploring entirely new ground might be a little disappointed.  10,000 days is more like a final coalescence of the direction they began on with Lateralis.  What this albums does have that Lateralis didn't is a very spiritual direction.  You can tell Master Maynard has been through a bit of living and introspection in recent years, evidenced by the songs \\"Wings for Marie\\", and \\"Right In Two\\".   <br /> <br />As always, Tool's themes are firmly rooted in the darker side of the human condition, but this time, it seems they're looking up to the sky rather than at their feet, if that makes any sense.  They seem to be catching on to the fact that the more questions you answer, the more questions appear in this life.   <br /> <br />Like I said, it takes multiple listens, but it is very much worth it at the end of the journey.
0385510454|2.0|This is the first Grisham book that I've read. I know I'm a little late, but I only picked up this book because I was reading it aloud for someone who was interested in it. It was dragging and if it were my choice, I would've put it down after the first couple of pages. I was relieved when I was done, so that I wouldn't have to pick it up again. I've been to Italy and have studied the language, so I did enjoy the many references and dialogue. Other than that, I really could care less about a powerful political negotiator and a governmental scam. If you are looking for something that's easy to read and isn't that exciting, maybe this book is for you.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool has to be the best hard band out there, and it seems each album has gotten progressively better. I love this album after the first listen. It is an experience to listen to this album while trippin on the killer artwork with built-in3 D glasses, amazing again. i can't wait to see them on tour again. Go buy this album. Tool again has blown me away and wanting more...
B000EHSVQE|4.0|There should be more movies such as Napoleon Dynamite, that are innocent and show teenagers in this kind of light - tapping in to their own creativity, using their imagination and ingenuity, spending time on their hobbies and practicing, instead of listening to gangster rap music, dressing like sluts, drinking beer and doing drugs.  I thought it was a wonderful movie and laughed hysterically and really loved its sweetness.
B0000024K1|5.0|There's a reason why this album is consistently listed near the top of any list of great albums, hip-hop or otherwise.  The layered production and album's thematic cohesion represented a quantum leap over anything that had been released in hip-hop to that point.  Yet, it doesn't sound the slightest bit dated (like, for example The Chronic) because no one was able to emulate the Bomb Squad's sound the way that G-Funk or RZA-style production were constantly bitten years later.  The result is an album that was monumentally important at the time of its release, and still just as fresh and jaw-dropping nearly 20 years later. <br /> <br />It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back is the definitive group statement from one of hip-hop's greatest acts.  Chuck D is a true force on the mic, but PE doesn't get by on his skills alone, though they certainly could.  Despite rhymes that convey his considerable intelligence, he has a presence on the microphone that has rarely been matched.  Even if he wasted his flows on cookie-cutter battle raps, he could do so convincingly.  Fortunately for us, that isn't the case.  Flava Flav, far from the caricature he is now, provides the perfect foil for Chuck.  Abrasive and wild, he underscores all of Chuck D's statements like an exclamation point.  Meanwhile, Terminator X and the Bomb Squad propel the backing tracks into the stratosphere with a constant barrage of samples, scratches and funky beats.  Constantly self-referencing, the music here is dense and complex, adding to the epic feel of the album (though it runs just under an hour).  Not to mention, they have the best song titles in all of music:  \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\", \\"Terminator X on the Edge of Panic\\", etc. <br /> <br />I am usually a little wary of artists that are this overtly political, and I always thought that Ice Cube traveled too far down that road, for example.  With PE, however, the politics only add to the urgency of the album.  It doesn't hurt that ChuckD is typically right on with his lyrics.  It also doesn't hurt that all of the themes touched on (drugs, war, police, the justice system, etc.) are always relevant. <br /> <br />To say that It Takes a Nation... is a good rap album with a couple of classic tracks would be a gross understatement of this album's value.  This is a masterwork, and nearly every other track has become a standard (\\"Rebel w/out a Pause\\", \\"Bring the Noise\\", \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\", \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\", \\"She Watch Channel Zero?!\\"...).  No filler.  The consistency is staggering.  In fact, at first listen, the record can be a little intimidating, since there aren't any concessions made in the effort to vary their output or spawn a hit single.  Chuck D even anticipates that they won't have commercial success in his line: \\"Radio stations/I question their blackness/They call themselves black/But we'll see if they'll play this.\\"  Multiple listens reveal more and more of what Public Enemy has embedded into this startling effort.  Any fan of hip-hop who doesn't own this album needs to.  As does any fan of music who has dismissed hip-hop as anything less than a vibrant art form. <br />  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060516402|4.0|I found Built to Last to be an analytical look at the intangibles of success.  Core development and maintenance, personal growth, employee development and more, highlight the \\"outside the bottom line\\" look into an organization lasting longer than any one leader's tenure of influence.  Although I don't agree with every aspect of the book I still rate this high due to its ability to stimulate positive thinking.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'm currently listening to the album (and am almost done) I have to admit with every band there's that feeling that something is a little off because it's new material, but with Tool you have to come to expect that. I don't understand why so many people write this off as horrible, when they just listened to it recently. Let it settle as so many before me have said. It takes several times for people to warm up. And if I were you I wouldn't listen to those who only point out one or two songs per Tool album, all their stuff was/is great. Opiate on up. I remember people's reaction to Lateralus, some hated it; I bet some of them are the ones who are saying they love it now. Give it time, that's all I'm saying. I love what I'm hearing!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool's \\"filler\\" is better than 99% of every other bands so called hits. Unless anyone has figured out how to raise Bonzo from the dead and give Plant his voice back I don't think we are going to get anything better than the Tool for another 20 years! Soooo eager masses, bow down and gather all the crumbs that Tool allows you to have and be thankful.

0790733226|4.0|While this movie is often held up as a science fiction story about first contact with beings from another world, that is only the framework for what the story of this movie is about (I have not read the book and do not know if the book is similar to the movie, but the Carl Sagan was involved in the screenplay).  Contact also refers to the human search for truth and what coming into contact with that is like.  This isn't a particularly subtle story, but it does have a strong point to make about the humility true seekers of truth have versus those who talk about truth, but distort and destroy as they advance some other agenda.<br /><br />A mistaken view of the movie would be to see it as science versus religion or as reality versus faith.  Sagan is actually pointing out the similarity of scientific truth seeking and faith - a lesson that Eleanor Arroway (played by the great Jodie Foster) eventually learns as she is persecuted for the reality she experienced, but cannot prove.  She even refers to her experience as a vision in trying to describe it.  And her soulmate, the man of faith Palmer Joss (played quite well by Matthew McConaughey), supports her testimony and sees something in the search for truth through science that he had not suspected.<br /><br />The bad guys in the film are on both sides and are portrayed a bit ham handedly, but are well acted by Jake Busey as Joseph, and James Woods as Michael Kitz.  Joseph is the wild eyed \\"prophet\\" whose vision of the truth leads him to reject anything that science has to say (except the making of explosives, apparently), and Michael Kitz is a cynical politician who \\"investigates\\" Arroway's experience, but who is really using her to try and advance his political career.  (Why they simply didn't have someone else go through the machine to verify what Arroway said one way or the other eludes me - maybe the story made up some \\"reason\\" to prevent that logical next step.)  So, this way the story pairs Arroway and Joss as true seekers who have humility and devotion to the truth, but who have different approaches.  Their love story shows them as soul mates not only in love, but also in their love of truth.  Then we have the idiot bad guys Joseph and Kitz who have other desires and only pretend to be seeking the truth.  They already \\"know\\" their truth and aren't seeking anything.<br /><br />The other characters all help dress out this theme and add to an interesting story, but this is the main point of the story and makes for a pretty good film.  Just don't expect a terrific science fiction / alien film, because that is not what this really is.rue seekers who have humility and devotion to the truth, but who have different approaches.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Dull supernatural thriller than has Keanu Reeves playing a modern day ghost buster who helps a police detective (Rachel Weisz) in a race against time to prevent the end of the world. Now this is an interesting premise but the biggest problem this film faces in the casting of Keanu Reeves, who is miscast to the hill. It also does not help that his performance is as wooden as ever in this film, not to mention the fact that his character is more of a selfish jerk than a person that you can root for and not to mention the fact that he is also the most underwritten character in the entire movie. You don't really care about him at all and you really don't want to spend any more time with him as well. His leading lady Rachel Weisz steals the movie from right under him and the rest of the so-so cast with a tight and strait forward performance that is soulful and gripping but the movie unfortunately is not as deep as her performance and it titers between juvenile and self parody. The screenplay at one point of the film does an about face and contradicts all that was explain earlier in order for certain thing to just happen for the sake of the climax, which is not very good to begin with. <br /> <br />If you want to see it, you will not be disappointed with the great performance of Rachel Weisz but you will be disappointed with the movie as a whole.  <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|3.0|first off, i'm a classic hardcore fan from back when nobody knew- i'm of the generation that was tool= \\"aenema\\", \\"undertow\\", and \\"opiate\\". that being said, this album represents the unfortunate trajectory of tool towards a less interesting and cliched sound. to me lateralus wasn't the devil (just not quite what i wanted or hoped for), i'm not one of those bitter, narrow fans, in fact the constant experimentation of new sound is imperative to a band's evolution. but i think this is a byproduct of age. all musical artists seem to be fated towards a cheesy distillation of themselves as they pass their peak. you see, i actually believe that maynard (yes i said maynard) is the sole reason for this. musically, adam, danny, and justin are all on top of their game and evolving their sound in an intelligent and respectable way judging from things of theirs i've heard not affiliated with \\"lateralus\\" or \\"10000 days\\" or tool necessarilly. it seems as if musically the direction they would head in is even more marginalized and darker (what i love) but to compromise and continue making albums, they had to factor in an APCed maynard and the result is a less interesting, typical sound (which is ironic). as for this album, objectively, there are only a couple \\"not bad\\" songs, the lyrics are bad, and there is a cheesiness that makes it difficult for me to continue being a fan. but of course i will, and i'll even give this album 3 stars when others who feel betrayed gave it 1- it ain't that bad. i think i was expecting more of an isis sound since some of those guys helped out on this album and justin played on a track on \\"panopticon\\" , but i was wrong. this album is for the new generation of tool fan and a broader base. some others in the first generation camp of fan might find themselves enjoying new neurosis, isis, or cult of luna better than new tool. c'est la vie. i'll continue to support them and my fingers are crossed for that album i expect them to make rather the new ones theydo.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl jam have returned with an album which is as good as Ten.No amount of praise is going to be sufficient for this album.Eddie vedder,Stone Gossard and Mike Mcready are in top form in songs like Comatose and Big wave.Highly recommended but avoid all albums from Nick Wackey as suggested by a previous reviewer.
0812550706|5.0|First, I have to say that this has become one of my favorite books. It ranks right up there with \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". And I really can't stand how such works are thrown into the science fiction bucket and therefore stigmatized. I read lots of different kinds of fiction and each has their own merits. But it is the quality of the story that counts.<br /><br />This idea that it isn't appropriate for the young. oh please. Card is not condoning what was done to Ender and the rest of the \\"children\\". He's not saying that the ends justified the means. Card is asking you the reader to examine these and other issues for yourself. This is what a great story does, forces you to think and decide. That is why I can put this work beside \\"Mockingbird\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\", which also challenge us to think. And we ask our youth to digest those works.<br /><br />I would recommend this work and the books that follow in the series to anyone who enjoys a great story and has an open, questioning mind.<br /><br />Thank you.
0380820846|5.0|The romance that blossoms between Penelope and Colin was wonderful to read. The pace of its development was convincing enough for me since, unlike other reviewers, i didn't think Colin fell too quickly for Penelope. I've always had a soft spot for storylines where the \\"dark horse\\", in this case an ordinary spinster who's resigned to never marrying her true love becoz of her old age and the fact that she thinks he'd never look at her in any romantic way, finally gets the \\"prize catch\\", the one perfect man that every woman in Society clamours for, simply by being herself. It's very heartwarming, don't you think? <br /> <br />My only complain (it's quite a tiny dissatisfaction, maybe i shouldn't even call it a complain) was that i would've liked to see a follow-up of the scene where Penelope caught Colin adamantly shouting to his brothers abt not wanting to marry her that one time many years ago. They both remembered that fateful incident, but after they fell in love, neither of them ever brought it up. Wasn't Penelope the least bit curious abt Colin's outburst, and why he'd since had a 180 degree change of mind? I would've liked to see Colin try and explain himself to Penelope, and maybe even grovel at her feet a bit, for forgiveness or understanding, either way it would've been pretty funny i think.  <br /> <br />But other than that, Romancing Mister Bridgerton was an amazing read. This is my first Julia Quinn book, and i was hesitant at first to start my way in the middle of her Bridgerton series and wondered if reading them out of order might dampen my liking of it, but i bought it anyway becoz like i said, i always enjoyed this sorta storyline. And now, like all her fans, i am now quite thoroughly hooked on her very lovable Bridgerton family and am seeking to read all her other books in this series juz to bring myself closer to the Bridgertons again. Good God, but they sure are addictive.
B000002UAC|5.0|'With the Beatles' is the British version of the American LP 'Meet the Beatles,' the first real album to \\"make it\\" on the Western shores.  It is a remarkable album that contains all the energy of 'Please, Please Me,' yet the polish needed to create a classic listening experience.  There are many great songs that even less casual Beatles' fans haven't encountered.  The songs are often fresh, sometimes dated, but, subjectively, there isn't a bad one in the bunch.  The remakes are as consistent overall as the originals.    The opener, \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" is a wild rocker that deserves at least as much praise as \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\".  The lively covers of \\"Please Mister Postman,\\" \\"Money,\\" and \\"Roll over Beethoven,\\" are some of their best remakes, and \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" \\"All My Loving,\\" and \\"Not a Second Time,\\" are rousing originals.  Yet, the rest of the album can only be judged subjectively.  \\"Don't Bother Me\\" represents George Harrison's songwriting debut.  It is an appealing song (although lesser than most of the rest).  Similarly, \\"Hold Me Tight\\" is a catchy, but less significant McCartney rocker that could have used an extra verse.  And, for all its charm, \\"Devil in Her Heart\\" is good, but dated enough to make most listeners wince.      As energetic as the album is, the Beatles manage (as always) to come up with some fine ballads. \\"All I've Got to Do,\\" is a remarkable song (although some listeners will find the fifties atmosphere regrettable).  McCartney also performs a fine remake of \\"Till There Was You,\\" a Broadway tune.  The musicianship is splendid, and it gives us a rare example of any Beatle song revealing a British accent.      Song for song, 'With the Beatles' is a remarkable rock C.D.  While most fans buy 'Sgt. Pepper's...' or the 'White Album,' their early recordings have fine material less often seen in C.D. collections or heard on the radio.      It should also be mentioned that (thankfully) the main Beatles' C.D.'s today are from the Britishversions of their albums, the way the Beatles themselves intended.  Unless you are sentimental for the American (Capitol) releases and the memories they elicit, the British catalog is more generous and better compiled.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll begin this review with something that pisses me off. People are taking the previous works of Tool and writing in comparison with this offering. Any Tool fan that isn't an idiot should know that isn't the proper way to review any band, especially one that varies as much as Tool does. <br /> <br />Apparently to some reviewers, Tool has sold out. However, what doesn't make sense to me is that this album is definitely less accessible to new listeners than Lateralus or Undertow ever was. I was familiar with the definition of 'sell-out' being a group of musicians who are no longer making music for themselves, but rather, to keep a fan base. But Tool seems to making the most personal and endearing songs I've ever listened to. In particular, lyrics for 'Wings for Marie (Part 1)' and the title track, '10,000 Days (Wings Pt.2)' are obviously tremendously personal to MJK. Part one brought tears to my eyes with the line. 'Never had a life...but surely saved one.' <br /> <br />As for this whole 'It has to set in and let you soak the genius...' thing, that's half-rubbish. Yeah it takes a few listens, but not months of persistent listening before you realize how great this work is. Don't let Tool fans fool you: They like to pretend they're incredibly intelligent, and make it look like anyone with an IQ below 200 can't enjoy Tool's music. It's not an exclusive club, go ahead and listen to it. They're all talk, they won't bite you. <br /> <br />This album will take you everywhere. It will show you where Tool's been. It will show you where they're going. But most importantly, it's another showcase of why they are where they are now: Because they're one of the few of America's truly great bands that we have left. Don't listen to this album and think it will be another Aenima or Lateralus. Over time I'm sure, this will become it's own entity like their previous efforts did. Oh, and the CD case is amazing too. <br /> <br />Welcome back, Tool. We missed you.
0804115613|5.0|Absolutely the best story I've ever read.  Ms. Flagg's editor wasn't the best, as there are numerous typos and spelling errors (for instance, \\"polker\\" instead of \\"poker\\") but that's easily overlooked for the sheer beauty of the story.  No matter how many times I read it, I cry each time.<br /><br />And an FYI to the reviewer L.A.W. on April 27, 2006 -- Idgie's and Ruth's characters were meant to be lesbian.  Ms. Flagg has stated she based Idgie on a lesbian aunt of hers, and the relationship she was in.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Rock fans have waited long enough for this album, and the gods of rock have finally smiled.  One of the few bands to have actually gained popularity since the grunge days of the &#8217;90s, Pearl Jam does not disappoint with their self-titled eighth album.<br /><br />Fronted of course by the great Eddie Vedder, this album is true to the band&#8217;s roots with thirteen songs to please rock music lovers everywhere.<br /><br />Tracks of choice are the single-worthy &#8220;Life Wasted&#8221;; powerful first single &#8220;World Wide Suicide&#8221;; &#8220;Marker in the Sand&#8221;; and the slower &#8220;Parachutes&#8221; (you gotta love this track), &#8220;Gone&#8221; and &#8220;Come Back&#8221;, but &#8220;Pearl Jam&#8221; is definitely worth every penny.<br /><br />You don&#8217;t have to be a rock fan to appreciate this one, but it doesn&#8217;t hurt to convert.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, May 2, 2006
B000024D4R|5.0|For some, \\"Animals\\" takes getting used to. It isn't as accessible as \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here\\" but once you listen to it a few times it becomes addictive. This album has some of the most powerfully compelling mix of lyrics and music in Pink Floyd's repetoire. Waters dark sarcasm shines here in Dogs/Pig/Sheep as he takes on the various versions of human flaws. Gilmour/Mason and Wright give the best  of their musical talents. Animals becomes more hypnotic and beautiful with every hearing because the ear and the brain have a chance to catch on to the complexities that mark this great Pink Floyd opus.
B000000XB9|5.0|What can you really say about a CD that is this good??    Like millions of others out there, I've had this classic album in my collection for many years. It is an album that belongs in every collection of every rock fan on earth. These twenty rock solid tunes represent some of the most enduring and enjoyable music the world of rock n' roll will ever produce.  Song for song, Chronicle is probably the greatest rock n' roll album ever!     Let's be honest. Rock n' roll songs of any era just don't come any better than \\"Travelin' Band\\", \\"Proud Mary\\", Fortunate Son\\", \\"Up Around the Bend\\", or \\"Born on the Bayou\\" which is the only essential song not included here. Although most of the tunes on this CD have been played to death over the years on classic rock radio, they still pack a punch almost 40 years later. Creedence Clearwater Revival produced more great songs from 1968 to 1971 than most rock bands come up with in their whole careers!      The Beatles had a bigger impact on the world and the Rolling Stones stayed together a whole lot longer, but neither band consistently produced as many pure rock n' roll tunes of higher quality than the songs in this album.     As Bruce Springsteen said when inducting these guys into the hall of fame, \\"they weren't always the hippest rock n' roll band in the world, just the best\\". If Creedence Clearwater Revival isn't the greatest rock band of the 60's and 70's, there hasn't been a band on the radio in the past 30 years who can touch them!    John Fogerty was a guy who managed to take everything that was great about rock music in the 1950's and make it popular all over again at a time when psychedelic excess and flower power had taken over the world. Creedence offered nothing but \\"feel-good\\" rock n' roll with more beat, rhythm, and drive than any other rock band of their era. Their music was simple, direct, raw, powerful, and totally infectious. The everlasting quality of these 20 songs offer all the prove you need that Fogerty is oneof the greatest rock n' roll songwriters of all time.     It is nearly impossible to be a rock fan and not like at least a few of the timeless songs on this CD. This is simply as good as rock n' roll gets. It is everything that rock n' roll should be.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The first time I heard this cd, I will admit, I was dissapointed, but then I remembered that this was exactly how I felt every time I heard a new Tool song.  The thing about Tool is that they are so individual in everything they do.  Each time I hear a new song of theirs I have to listen to it many times before I understand it, they aren't catchy like most metal bands, their music is dense and, again unlike most metal bands, often has a purely musical intrest beyond simply the lyrics (which have just as powerfull an intrest all their own) and the mad rock outs.  They are heavy but only when the music need heaviness, they are not afraid to abandon the typical form of a metal song and structure their music around the development of a rhythmic motive, a modal scale, or some other musical device (good examples are The Grudge, Third Eye, Parabol/Parabola and Jambi).  This record has a very different style from their previous works.  It is substantially mellower, the lyrics are less cryptic and metaphorical, and the songs are much longer, and more technically demanding.  Given the very  tracable arc of Tools technical and compositional development over their previous albums, there should be little to surpise you here, the songs are very long, progressive, and atmospheric.  If Tool keeps making albums they will eventually come out with a cd that has two songs that are half an hour each, and bridged by a short instrumental a la Eon Blue Apcalypse.  If this isn't your style, steer clear, but if your favorites are songs like Third Eye, or Disposition/Reflection/Triad, this is the stuff for you.  The biggest surprise for me on this cd was the song Intension, which is very mellow, and since their mellow tracks are usually the shorter prelude types (think mantra, usefull idiot) I was surprised to find that this track is given equal weight to songs like Vicarious and The Pot, both of which are much heavier and traditional for Tool.  I have seen many people marking Intension as another atmospheric \\"mood enhancer\\" track, but it's really just as solid as any of the \\"real\\" songs on this CD (or any Tool CD for that matter), it's just not heavy.  This album is very much something that is not to be taken lightly or at face value, the music begs repeat listening with an attentive mind.  Don't overlook it just because it's not as heavy, or it isn't as catchy as your typical metal tune.  There is real musical substance to be found on this record, and that is a rare and treasured thing.
B000002J1F|5.0|This is Yes' classic album, along with their most famous track \\"roundabout,\\" although my personal faroite song on this album is \\"we have heaven\\". If you want an intro album to Yes skip the greatest hits CDs and go for this masterpiece.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Crooner's beware, you have now entered the turf of Michael Buble, and there isn't much you can do to get any better than him.  Starting off strong with 'Feeling Good' Michael gets you out of your seat and into his zone.  Michael masters both the smooth ways of the Bobby Darrin era with tracks like the aformentioned as well as 'Save the Last Dance for Me' and 'Can't Buy me Love' but it's when he slows things down and lets his heart do the talking that he really shines and brings this album to new heights.  On tracks like 'Try a Little Tenderness', 'Song for You' and the beautiful closer 'You and I' Michael's voice is so pure and clear that your drawn into his charm.  By far the best track here is the endearing 'Home' which could bring a tear to your eye if your not carfull.  Michael shows here that he has what it takes to be king of the crooner's, so all you others beware...you have BIG shoes to fill.
B000002H2H|1.0|This is very bad, get out more and enjoy the true beauty of life.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The amazing minds that have come on here to denounce the lyrics of this album need several schooling lessons in english literature as well as religion. Point in case: Right in two. The song is clearly about heaven shaking its head at the gifts and abilities we've been given and have squandered to things such as greed. <br /> <br />That aside, I feel this album is another work of wonder from this band. I'm not going to rate any of the songs because the whole album is art. It's ups and downs and ethereal moments are meant to throw you around and leave you questioning your very existence. That's every tool album, but more increasingly as time has gone on. You \\"purists\\" who claim that this isn't \\"Tool\\" like to sit in your beanbag chairs listening to Opiate and wishing for the good old days when it was straight rock. Unforunately for you souls who cannot adapt, you're missing out on a great experience. Do I personally like listening through the weird sounds each time I put the album in? Hell no I do not, but that does not stop me from listening all the way through once to grab the feel of the album.  <br /> <br />I'm telling you folks, it's a gem. And for those of you saying they've lost their way please go listen to track seven on Aenima for me again. <br /> <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Great album. I did not like Riot Act at all. But this one is very good. Come Back is probably the best Pearl Jam song ever. <br />Brilliant. I also like Gone a lot. Great song. Not forget to mention Parachutes and Marker in the Sand. I think that every Pearl Jam album, even Ten, has got his weaker points. And this album is no exception. Personally I do not like Big Wave and Unemployable. However, this is a great album from a great band. Together with Ten, No code and Binaural this will be my favorite Pearl Jam album.
0679422714|5.0|Among the book's many themes, two appear particularly distressing: the degree of Mao's disregard for human life and suffering and the extent to which he was a product of the Soviet Russia.     Marxism was perfectly suited for Mao: it justified constant war based on the theory of inevitable class struggle. As did the rulers in the Soviet Russia, Mao just labeled many of his adversaries members of a group that was declared an enemy of the people, and killed them. Early on, he showed a penchant for violence: in 1920s he personally approved various forms of torture. In 1930, in one Mao-occupied county alone there were 120 kinds of torture. The hysterical rallies and \\"thought examination\\" were a personal touch that Mao introduced in the 1940s into the practice of dictatorship. Just as in the Soviet Russia, in China oftentimes people were killed according to a quota imposed by the Communist Party. For example, in 1948, the CCP declared that 10% of the population were evil landlords, or kulaks. During the Great Leap Forward, torture and violent murder was widespread as a punishment reserved for the starved people \\"stealing\\" food. To the tens of millions who died from famine and overwork during the Great Leap Forward, Mao added over 3 million who died violent deaths in the wake of the Cultural Revolution.    From Mao's early military campaigns, Moscow supported him in a variety of ways. It repeatedly protected Mao from his fellow Chinese Communist Party members who wanted to get rid of him. Moscow supplied him with money, industrial aid and, increasingly, arms (which under Stalin led to the Korean War and under Khruschev resulted in China getting nuclear weapons). Stalin personally assured Mao's safety from Chiang Kai-Shek by keeping Chiang's son as a hostage in Moscow (tellingly, Stalin did the same with Mao's two sons, but Mao did not appear vulnerable through his children). Moscow needed a strong leader who would promote the communist cause. In addition, Stalin, a formeroutlaw, may have felt affinity with Mao the bandit. Without Moscow's support Mao would have found it extraordinarily difficult to survive the conflicts with vastly superior forces of Chiang Kai-Shek or red military commanders, let alone rise to the top of the Party leadership.    Of course, Moscow was not the only reason for Mao's ascension to power. Just as German aggression against Russia ultimately resulted in the formation of the Eastern Bloc, Japan's aggression against China diverted Chiang Kai-Shek's army from fighting Mao and resulted in Mao's survival. And the aggression of Germany, Italy and Japan in the 1930s was condoned by the western powers: Britain, France and the USA, who have to bear part of the responsibility if one is willing to go that far.    The monstrous Mao was the same Mao who was well read, a connoisseur of opera, a writer of poetry and an occasional admirer of flowers and snow. The book would have benefited by shedding some light on the reasons for which a person, not devoid of sensitivity, would become so insensitive to human deprivation. An expanded account of his childhood and adolescence, beyond a few pages devoted to the first 17 years of his life, would have been welcome. In addition, I would have liked to see more of an analysis of how the political, economic and cultural environment in China encouraged Mao to become what he became.    The book is one of the best biographies I have read. Even though some of its statements are debatable and the prose style is a bit awkward, the book makes clear and well-documented stand on its positions and provides an exhaustive reference for further research.    As for the statements of some critics of the book that Mao did greatly advance Chinese industry, and that therefore his vilification in the book is very much one-sided, I believe that any achievement at the expense of people's lives, especially on the massive scale, was not worth it. Paying for the industrialization in Russia with grain inthe early 1930s was not worth the millions of lives of those at whose expense it was carried out. Similarly, exporting millions of tons of grain to purchase modern industrial plants and using millions of kilograms of grain as a raw material to produce fuel for missile tests, was not worth the millions of Chinese who starved to death and exposed utter disregard for human life - the most horrible claim that a political system can ever make.
B000EULJLU|5.0|dont be fooled by a first listen. take 2, 3, or 4. this is excellent tool and that is why it takes the extra listenings. you will need it to pick up all the sounds, vocals, and anything else you might miss. do not pass this up or discredit because you got used to the tool of aenima or lateralus. they grew between those albmus and they grew on this one too. the haunting melodies are still in tact and maynards genius lyrics and vocals are in full stride. tool once again proves why they are one of the very very very very few bands of the last 20 - 30 years to not only remain relevant but also continue something unheard of today...taking years not a year and a half to make a cd. id rather them take the time to perfect their sound than just shove out a half way done cd thats meant to attain radio and single status. so all in all tool once again goes into a different dark hole and perfects the abyss they musically dwell within. give it a lsiten open your mind and you will see the greatness thats now running through your ears. enjoy.
0761944524|5.0|This book is a lifesaver and the bonus is that it's actually enjoyable to read.  Unlike most statistics authors, Andy Field seems human AND he can write clearly!  I was lost in a graduate school statistics course for most of a year, with one of those professors who can't teach at all and who requires you to read one of those stats textbooks that is just a bunch of numbers on every page (probably written by one of those people who is smart in math but flunked English).  <br /> <br />I am hopeless with computers and terrible in math.  Our SPSS assignments in my grad course were killing me. <br /> I tried hiring a tutor and HE got things wrong. Finally it occurred to me to do a search on Amazon, by customer review, and that's how I found Andy Field's book.  Immediately, I read the chapter on the topic for the assignment I was working on.  Wow!  Crystal clear instructions on each and every step of the analysis.  This book tells you exactly what keys to press on your computer and uses pictures from the computer screen to show you exactly what to do.  You just read and follow along.  And THEN...THEN!...the beauty of it...it shows you pictures of the printout and explains what everything means.  I could cry from happiness.  Before Fields' book it would take me a couple days of struggling, crying and swearing to finish one simple SPSS assignment.  With Fields' book, it took me less than half an hour. AND...drum roll...I got my first A+ in the course. <br /> <br />Dear Andy, if you're reading this, could you please please write similar books for more advanced stats topics, and could you write similar books for the SAS program? <br /> <br />Now I use Amazon.com searches organized by customer reviews, to look up any and all books I need.  With great results
B000EULJLU|5.0|Look through the lenses with your eyes about three inches away at the various pictures that you can flip through. It shows the pictures much larger and in 3-D. It took me a few minutes to figure out the lens thing myself. The album is great by the way and it truly gets better with each listen.
B000EULJLU|5.0|There will never be another Aenima. There will never be another Lateralus. They have been created and can never be duplicated, in part or whole. So how can we expect Tool to do so?    We can't. We shouldn't expect them to do anything. When you have no expectations you are never disappointed. The fact that Tool can debut at #3 on Amazon in terms of music sales and #1 the next day (meaning that more people are buying this album than any other on Amazon) says very little about the album itself, only the anticipation. Five years between albums is not unusual when you go on tour for two years! supporting Lateralus, your lead singer and drummer have other wildly sucessful bands in between [APC and Volto!] and a vineyard to take care of.     Tool has already proven themselves with Aenima. They have found a way to pay tribute to their influences while showing their true genius with Lateralus. This album isn't a puzzle, it isn't a metal powerhouse. It's a piece of art that reflects the band now. If you want a secret code try this:  10,000 days is about 27 years which is how long it takes Saturn to come back around to where it was when you were born. They say that every time this happens we go through a life change that defines who we are. Maynard and AJ were 27 around the time Tool was taking form in 90-91. Justin was 25 when he officially joined Tool. What's the secret? Middle Age. Looking back on the life changing direction that each member took and trying to convey their journey through music.     I really hope that those people who say that there are only a few good songs surrounded by filler are themselves 40 something rock-artists who have proven themselves time and time again in the studio and on tour. Otherwise, they have no idea. They have an opinion, and that's fine, but it comes from a lack of understanding. Just because you don't understand why a song is where it is on the album or why it's soft and mellow and envoking instead of gut wrenching and lyrically profound doesn't mean that you should automatically dismiss it as filler. If you've been to a live show of any kind, especially Tool, you know that you can't headbang for 2 hours straight. Yeah there's a setbreak, but the audiance and the band need a break every once and awhile. Tool's tours are extensive. Night after night they bring the energy to nuclear levels. Slow, spacey songs are purposeful twofold:  Tool likes them and they need a break from playing their guts out. Disposition>Reflection> Triad was played at almost every show on the last tour.     The band goes into the studio with music in their head, with or without lryics or structure, and lays down what they like, soft or not. Saying that a song is pointless or filler is like looking at a painting and saying that a particular brush stroke doesn't need to be there or is unnecessary.     On Maynard's vinyard website he says, \\"My art and music has been described as 'thick, dense, rich, complex, engaging, emotional, and spiritual' by those who are fans. And an 'acquired taste' for those kind others who are not.\\" That pretty much says it all. That is a perfect description of this album.     Those who are fans of art and music will understand, if not agree. Those who like to be spoon fed the same old sounds and words and song structure time and time again, someone please give them a Lite-Brite. You can make lots of neat and different pictures, but in the end it's still just a Lite-Brite. Same colors, same stupid light box, never evolving.     Tool is art. Lite-Brite is not.
0895260131|4.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable and illuminating text. It exposes many of the brutal atrocities committed by musalmaans on people they regard as \\"Kaffirs\\". While this may focus a bit too much on the christian-muslim conflict and whitewashes the christian side a bit, it's a good first step. It's books like these that dispel this horrible disease of political correctedness that has gripped the western media and exposes part of the truth about this dangerous and sick cult that is Islam. Maybe books like this one will inspire others to reject the fear of terrorist and musalmaan-gangster reprisals and writing about their systematic genocide of millions of Hindus, the destruction of Buddhism in their countries, their virulent anti-semitism against Jews and Israel, their brazen practice of paedophilia, their secret bouts of ethnic cleansing and other such atrocities. This would go a long way towards freeing the people of Dar-es-Islam from their bondage and bringing them to the 21st century.
B000B8QEYC|4.0|I've been been an Enya fan since I bought her self-titled debut back in junior high school (later re-released as \\"The Celts\\").  I own every major album that's come out, her greatest hits album (Paint the Sky With Stars), and even several foreign imports.  So, naturally, I bought Amarantine right after it came out.<br /><br />The album in and of itself is pretty good.  Many of the songs are just as beautiful as you'd expect them to be, and Enya has once again managed to re-manufacture the sound that everyone has come to expect from her.  I guess that's the chief reason I docked my rating one star.<br /><br />I know that if I like Enya's music (as one reviewer put it), then so what if it's just another typical Enya album?  I guess my problem is that although Enya's music is beautiful, haunting, and well-done, it's never really changed or grown.  Roma Ryan still pens the (mostly depressing) lyrics, and Enya still composes the (mostly similar) music.  None of it is bad by any stretch of the word, but so much more could be done.<br /><br />Perhaps it's unfair to subtract a star simply because the Enya I listened to 13 years ago is almost exactly the same Enya I'm listening to today, but I feel it's justified.  When an artist's fans grow and change, but the artist doesn't seem to do the same, where does that leave the fan?<br /><br />If you love any of Enya's other albums, this one shouldn't disappoint.  If, however, you like an artist to give you a bit of variety, don't expect much here.
B000EULJLU|1.0|This album is not that great. I would have ranked it a bit higher but I am really disappointed by the songs on here. It was all very disheveled. They should go back to the earlier CD's and take a listen. That's what made them. This is all commercial and sellout.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|Before this album dropped I was hyped and ready for new MOBB music.  I've been a fan since they first came out and they have always been on point.  I'm not a big fan of G-Unit or 50, but I thought that it definitely couldn't hurt that they hooked up, after all it's still Mobb Deep.  After giving the album a couple listens I'm a little disappointed.  The classic Mobb sound just isn't there. Don't get me wrong its still better than most crap that is out nowadays, but I was aching for that grimy Mobb sound and I don't get my fix off this album.  The beats are over-produced and squeaky clean.  I wanted that Infamous sound from their first 3 albums and all I got was a 50 Cent album featuring Prodigy and Havoc.  I still recommend the album. It shines here and there.  Diehard G-unit fans should love it.  I suggest anyone who loves Mobb Deep and is hoping for that straight of the street grimy Mobb sound stay away 'cuz unfortunately you will be disappointed <br />
B0006FO8RA|5.0|This Britney Spears album contains a bunch of loveable hits and some new songs that are very good. I don't know what the other reviewer below me is talking about. Britney Spears deserves a greatest hits album and this album deserves a grammy.
B000EULJLU|4.0|When i first heard this album is sounded like a jumble attempt at an epic record that was just over the mighty tools' head.  But as usual with tool, it took a few listens for it to settle in that this a great album from one of the greatest bands.  Though not there best album imo, it is full of great music.  Some reviews complain about there only being 5 songs on the album.  Well, when the songs are well over 7 minutes thats something that i can deal with.  I would have liked to have another 2 or 3 songs, especially since it has been 5 years.  But my main complaint with what we have is the vocals on most of the songs.  Maynard has one of the best voices in metal/rock and rights some of the best lyrics ever.  But on this album he sings softly most of the time and the vocals are usually in the background which at the same time means that i cant hear the lyrics cleary, atleast until i read them and remember them.  <br /> <br />Other than that i recommend this album for TOOl FANS and i recommend that noobs to tool start with anema or lateralus.  <br /> <br />My favs are the pot, vicarious, 10,000 days
B000ETQRCM|3.0|For a self-titled album, Pearl Jam could have sounded more like Pearl Jam.  The last album, Riot Act, took a while to grow on me, but it did eventually.  I've already listened to this one three times and it has yet to stick on me.  I love Pearl Jam and there's no better live show than a Pearl Jam show, but I don't know which of these songs I'd really care to hear live.  I'm a big fan of the No Code album and the Lost Dogs album, even though Ten and VS are excelent.  Yield was satisfactory and Binaural was better.  Riot Act was a new sound, but this album seems to be slightly redundant with a washed out sound.  Eddie Vedder has done much better, Stone Gossards writing continues to shine, but I didn't get much from the other band members, besides a few good accents here and there by Matt Cameron.  Poor Jeff Ament and Mike McCreedy seem to be sitting by the wayside, overpowered by well fueled intense energy, not 'given to fly' as they should have been.  I suppose I might have anticipated too much from a self-titled Pearl Jam, but then again, maybe this will grow on me if I listen to it three more times....
B000EULJLU|4.0|Props to the reviewer that talked of someone painting the same picture over and over again and why anyone would want to do that.People seem to like an album by an artist and if all the other ablums by that artist dont sound like the ablum they liked,they no longer like the artist.Too many groups these days make the same album over and over and that is why I appreciate Tool so much,because NOT ONE of their cds sound like the previous disc.They take their sweet time putting out new music,but when they day its quality music.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Hmm, how to start.  Well, I think this is Tool's best album.  Opinions like this always change, of course, so who knows how long it'll last, but after listening to this fairly continually for a week and a half, and then finally getting to hear the full sound quality version a couple of times there's no question as to how I feel now.  Plenty of people are disappointed, but hey, they always are.  Admittedly, though this certainly isn't devoid of innovation, it unquestionably isn't as much of a step forward and new direction as were `Lateralus' and `Aenima'.  Personally, I think this is a good thing, as I don't know how much further Tool can go without abandoning their basic style altogether, and I don't want that.  As much as I liked `Lateralus' I distinctly recall being a bit worried  after it was released, thinking that maybe they'd go too far and start releasing things like the `Reflection' cycle exclusively.  Now, I like that song cycle a lot, but I don't want them to abandon the alt-metal roots altogether, and they haven't done that with `10,000 Days'.  This is really sort of a culmination of their sound thus far, combining elements from all their previous albums.  Hell, it's even got the occasional direct reference to earlier albums.  (Yeah, this kinda thing could be annoying if it were taken to far, but, uh, it isn't here.)<br /><br />The production here is pristine and heavy, and the players are all in top form navigating the long song structure and numerous unusual times signatures quite readily.  No, they ain't flashy virtuosos, well, except for Carrey, but they know they're instruments, and each have an immediately recognizable style.  I'm also pleased to say that Maynard's vox have come more to the forefront again, and he's allowed to display a bit more venom more frequently.  `10,000 Days' has 3 shorter, more conventionally metallic tracks, `Vicarious', `Jambi' and `The Pot'.  Each of them is excellent.  You must've heard `Vicarious', and it's  a good example of the combining effect of the album, mixing `Lateralus' style droning with some more rough, relatively D'Amour-esque basswork from Chancellor and off-kilter but still relatively straightforward, bruising riffwork that comes off as a mix of `Undertow' and `Lateralus'.  Damn fine drumming and a memorable chorus to boot.  Great song.  `Jambi' is one of the more unexpected tracks, loud but very smooth and flowing with deceptively simple and repetitive guitarwork.  This song really displays Tool's taste for subtle rhythmic dynamics, as it moves from liquid, polyrhythmic riffs to straight-up pounding and back.  Great vocals from Maynard too, particularly the `Damn my eyes' part.  (Well, there's some debate as to what he's saying, but whatever.)  `The Pot' is another rather unexpected track which definitely recalls Tool's earlier days, albeit while still being a bit more sophisticated.  A surprisingly funky and just flat-out fun track with tons of groove and some of Chancellor's best basswork ever.<br /><br />Then we've got the more epic things.  `Wings For Marie' and `10,000 Days' are, of course, one 17+ minute composition, so I'll just consider them as one.  This will be a controversial song I'm sure, and no doubt those who thought that `Lateralus' got boring will think this gets dull too.  Certainly, this is just about the slowest, moodiest thing they've ever done, little more than rumbling bass, whispered vox and distant, low-key guitar for amost all of the first 10 or so minutes, and it never quite explodes as much as you might think.  Still, I think it's a great, emotional song effectively combining the airy, spacy sound of `Lateralus' epics with the darker, sludgier feel of some `Aenima' tracks.  Again, the 10 minute buildup is pretty long, but that makes the more intense part of the song all the more effective.  I especially like the ghostly, choral vocals that pop-up at times, and I think the lyrics are, as a whole, fairly  touching.  `Rosetta Stoned' (whichcombines with  `Lost Keys', a fairly pointless intro), will doubtless also be pretty controversial.  It's a weird one, substantially derived from `Third Eye' but turned into a more riff-driven rocker, albeit a very long one.  Tons of time changes here and wildly varied vocals.  It's also kinda fun to hear Tool write a less serious song again, considering how humorless and pretentious so many Tool fans are.  Not the very best song here, but I do enjoy it a lot.<br /><br />`10,000 Days' biggest problem is that it saves the weakest tracks for last, `Intension' and `Right in Two'.  It's also somewhat disappointing to end with these tracks, as they're the ones that are most particularly like a specific earlier album i.e. these two songs would fit on `Lateralus' very nicely.  Still, these are good songs, so you can't complain too much, and you know an album is good when the biggest criticism you can come up with is the track order.  (And, in reality, I think the progression of sounds actually works pretty well, it's just a problem that the quality drops a bit.)  `Intension' is another quiet, melodic track, kinda like `Disposition' and the like.  It arguably goes on a bit too long at 7 minutes, but it's got some pleasant, ethereal melody and some fun electronic drum work.  `Right in Two' is another epic track, opening slowly with gentle vocal melodies and some light instrumental work, though it certainly picks things up later.  Again, very much like `Lateralus', particularly in that it's loud but not angry, but, well, `Lateralus' was a great album, so I can't whine too much.  Again, a very good song, if still one of the weaker ones on the album.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  I find it difficult to imagine that this will not be at the very top of the list of best albums of `06 when the end of the year comes around.

B0007GAEW6|1.0|If you're looking into this band, you're probably already a fan of Pink Floyd.  So I'll describe them in terms of Pink Floyd: <br /> <br />You know how Pink Floyd had this habbit of putting in these extended bits of not-quite-music between their songs.  The weird noises between tracks on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", the boring bits of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", and the quiet bits in \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Sheep\\"? <br /> <br />These guys have made entire songs out of this stuff.  Twelve minute tracks - or a single \\"song\\" that extends over seven tracks.  Burried in all this highly produced but fairly un-musical waffle is the odd bit song. <br /> <br />These actual songy bits are alright, but they're few and far between.  They have a wild, spastic quality, and sound more like Zepellin than Floyd.  They might actually be really good - its hard to tell after only a few listens. <br /> <br />Even so, a few bright moments of brilliance can't really sustain an entire album.  It actually almost seems like these guys came up with this material, and said to themselves \\"well, we could put out five short songs on a little EP and become a Dillinger Escape Plan type band, or we could couch this stuff in a whole lot of overwrought soundscapey stuff and break into the prog-rock scene\\".  It actually feels that pretentious. <br /> <br />The benefit of couching their bombastic stuff inside all the waffle is that the loud, fast stuff sounds that much louder and faster after seven minutes of sustain effects and sampled bird noises.  It's effective, but it doesn't make it good. <br /> <br />People obviously enjoy this, but really, I'm the sort of person who tolerated the filler on Floyd albums because it didn't take up too much space, and their actual songs were good.  Obviously, if you're the sort of person who enjoyed the filler, this might be your album. <br /> <br />Personally, I find it to be tedious, pretentious, and, well, not that good. <br />
B000ETQRCM|5.0|I'm like a few others on this page that have no idea what the problem was with all of Pearl Jam's albums between Vs. and this current release.  They have been putting out amazing albums for years.  PJ are one of the few Rock bands on the planet that have grown, changed and challenged their listeners over the years and this album sees them come full circle and release an album that encompasses all of the elements that made their past albums great while still sounding fresh.<br /><br />Every track on this disc bristles with energy and passion.  They truly sound like a band on a mission.  Maybe its a reaction to their age as a band, I don't really care.  That perception is one I leave to all those losers who say they haven't liked them since Ten but don't actually own any of the subsequent albums.  But enough debate already, if you like Rock in the traditional sense you will love this album.
B000EULJLU|2.0|Ever since they made the metal/alternative classics \\"Opiate\\" and \\"Undertow\\" and seeing them on the sidestage at Lollapalooza III, I have bought each subsequent album hoping it would be another album with crunching quitars and heavy base riffs, but sadly Tool has slowly become just another progressive/tribal/psychadelic rock band.  The anger and raw sound is gone,replaced by tribal druming and background noise.  If you liked there last album, then you'll probably love this, but if your like me and are waiting for the next Undertow, don't bother, I don't think they have it in them anymore.
038533348X|5.0|The book, which is one of my all time favorites is not quite as amazing as some of the reviews.  Some are looking for SiFi and find this \\"simple\\".  Others are looking for a feel-good, uplifing story, and many seek something to conform to their pre-conceieved beliefs and biases.  They come away depressed!  This is a brilliant satire of so much of the human condition.  The charactors are great, and the story line, although fantastic suits as a perfect vehicle for the myriad of points made in a book of less than 200 pages. It is a story to be read every 10 years of so and to compare to the current state of the world.  In a way, only the names change and the irrationality continues.
B0000033P0|5.0|I read a not so flattering review of this disc from someone here and when I checked the other reviews he/she is obviously not a prog rock fan so why he/she is bothering to review discs like this is beyond me. This is a classic prog rock disc and it would still be even if it was just side 1.<br /><br />These are quality musicians playing some fantastic prog rock. Keith Emerson is a beast on the keys and Carl Palmer shows off his formidable chops in keeping up with Keith, and of course Greg Lake holds it all down. The pace starts off fast and furious on side 1 with changes galore but the band is tight and nails it. This disc is a must-have for any pro rock collection, regardless of what a certain somebody said. If you want cute little 3 minute pop songs, look elsewhere!<br /><br />[...]

Although this story has WWII as a backdrop, it could have been anywhere and anytime.  It clearly shows the illogical aspects of life with tremendous insight and humor.  The cast of charactors are wonderful.  90% of my reading is non-fiction but of all the novels that I have read this is my #1 favorite of all time and my candidate for best novel of the 20th Century.  Enjoy the read.

0671027387|3.0|I liked all the scientific and military background in this book. I would have liked it a lot better if Dan Brown hadn't written it so explicitly for women. It reads like a cheesy romance, breathless and full of italics.<br /><br />The plot is not entirely believable, but no more so than most thrillers, where characters you won't remember tomorrow race around the globe, facing down and vanquishing deadly bad guys armed with the all the latest in high-tech weaponry.<br /><br />Protagonist Rachel Sexton, a presidential hopeful's daughter, hates him for the usual reasons totally empowered female characters hate their fathers. She of course has risen - without any of his help!!!! - in her career, in this case the intelligence community, working for the incumbent he hopes to unseat. Rachel falls for hunky celebrity marine scientist Michael Tolland, whom she constantly wishes would wrap her up in his big strong arms. You know Tolland's worthy because, seven years after his wife's death, he's still not dating! Love even after death! How romantic! Male readers may want to puke, but guys, Brown didn't write this for you.<br /><br />Rachel's counterpart, ambitious Gabrielle Ashe, meanwhile has risen to become the closest aide to Rachel's daddy. Who, of course, has also seduced her. (Horrors!) As his name is Senator Sedgwick Sexton, soap opera law dictates he must be the rich white bad guy. Rich! Unprincipled! Ambitious! A seducer of young women!<br /><br />Rachel is suddenly let in on a big secret: The discovery of a meteorite proving the existence of life on other planets. She's dispatched to the site, where it lies buried in Arctic ice and is about to be raised with attendant fanfare that should proved helpful to both NASA, which discovered it, and to the president's lately struggling campaign.  Of course, not all is as it seems.<br /><br />Back in Washington, Gabrielle - who helped forge Sexton's NASA-hammering campaign - develops suspicions about his finances and backers, and is torn between these and her loyalty to his campaign. Her own career hangs in the balance with NASA poised for what would be a huge victory and leave Sexton with egg on his face.<br /><br />Brown does his usual good research job. He actually makes the fine geological points on which aspects of the plot hinge, comprehensible. Still, I can't go for the style in this. He poses as though he's writing it for professional women - all those fully empowered professional women characters, all those white male bad guys - but the writing is pure bodice ripper.and backers, and is torn between these and her loyalty to his campaign.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|With Pearl Jam's 8th studio release, \\"Pearl Jam\\", they solidify their status as the best band in the world. Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Mike, and Matt are the single best band performing today, bar none. Anyone who listens to this album along with their other seven releases (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield, Binaural, and Riot Act) would be hard pressed to disagree. I will first review this album for Pearl Jam fans, and then for listeners who aren't as into them. From a Pearl Jam fan perspective, this album is certainly what you've been waiting for after the sub-par \\"Riot Act\\" from 2000. This is Pearl Jam's most consistent album since \\"Yield\\". Both \\"Binaural\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" had flashes of brilliance, but each had spots of filler. The self titled album is solid all the way through. The past week I have been listening to their entire back catalogue and re-familiarizing myself with their sound. This record really sounds like the culmination of all of Pearl Jam's musical ventures. It is a perfect blend of their whacky ecclecticism, songwriting prowess, and tight musicianship, something that hasn't been so synergic since \\"Yield \\" or \\"No Code\\". If you had lost faith in the band, you'd do right to pick this up anyway. I KNOW that all Pearl Jam fans will want to know how this release ranks among their others. It scores ahead of \\"Yield\\", \\"Binaural\\", \\"Ten\\",  and \\"Riot Act\\", but is not quite as good as \\"Vitalogy\\", \\"Versus\\", or the band's mission statement \\"No Code\\". It is refreshing to see a band that can release material that is still competitive with everything they've ever done, even when their career is nearly 20 years in. Now, for those of you who don't religiously listen to Pearl Jam, this is a more than solid modern rock release. Lead single \\"Wolrdwide Suicide\\" and opener \\"Life Wasted\\" have great energy, and are as good if not better as absolutely ANYTHING you can hear on the radio. Vedder's lyrics are poignant and political but are done tastefully enough so as to not alienate anyone. Another thing of note is Vedder's voice; he has long been criticized for having an unintelligible, lazy delivery. His vocals have never sounded better on ANY of Pearl Jam's older releases. This is where the self titled release really excels. \\"Parachutes\\" is one of the best songs Pearl Jam has ever written and is a perfect combo of adrenalized emotion, strong songwriting, good lyrics, and sonic experimentation. Another standout is \\"Unemployable\\", an uptempo rocker that ranks among Pearl Jam's best. Vedder and the boys are truely back, and I couldn't be happier.
B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I can't beleive a lot of people were waiting years for this piece of junk. This could of been released in a week. Don't they know the Matrix got old already? This is nothing but stupid unrealistic action with people literally flying and the slow motion to boot. Advent Children is no where near as cool as it thinks it is.    Bottom line, this movie has disappointment written all over it. And even hardcore Final Fantasy 7 fans who won't admit it, will get bored of it soon. There is one scene that stands out as even more ridiculous than the rest and that's hard to accomplish trust me. It's where cloud jumpes into the air and  flys up for miles and miles I mean the scene takes like 5 minutes. It gets better the other FFVII characters all happend to be on higher ground and as cloud reaches each one of them, they give him a hand by grabbing his hand and tossing him up higher.

B000ETQRCM|1.0|Pearl Jam hasn't released anything decent since \\"Ten\\" (a masterpiece!) and this album is no different. Only the true die-hard fans that have no credible musical tastes will get anything out of this sloppy excuse of a release. There are only a couple of rare glimpses of the brilliance that was \\"Ten\\". For the most part, however, it will bore the hell out of you. The songwriting is lame and Vedder's voice is as annoying as ever. Plus, they continue to push their self-righteous and ignorant political views on us (see \\"World Wide Suicide\\") which just make them a laughing stock. Thankfully, I found this album online and listened to it before wasting any money on it.
B000002OVJ|5.0|........I think I hear the spawn of Van Halen on this album. <br /> <br />This album stands out in their catalouge simply because it is raw and powerful. To me that's the essence of The Who. I'm so glad they offered up the rest of the show for the re-release. This version really puts you in the middle of The Whos interpretation of the Power Trio. Which, in my opinion, is a most exceptional interperetation. The vinyl release didn't let you have a full understanding of this. <br />The set list isn't exactly songwriting extrodinaire, save for \\"Amazing Journey\\" and a couple of others, but that's not what the recording is about. <br />The tunes are just catchy enough to keep your attention. <br />What really gets me is the template that these guys are laying down for future rock bands. In that aspect it's a great retro-spect listen as well. <br /> <br />Alright there's my one cent. <br />You want two cents? Ha ha ha <br />Well...until the gas prices come down I'm afraid my opinion is going to be budgeted at one cent. <br />Sorry for the inconvenience. <br />
B000E8QVWY|5.0|First off, I will say that I am not really a country music fan.  I, like most people in my age group, have heard of Johnny Cash or seen him on an award show, etc.  But, I have never been a fan until now.  I just can't imagine why 'Walk the Line' is being compared to 'Ray'. ?? Both movies are great portrayals of two famous individuals - each person helped to define contemporary music.  Does liking 'Ray', mean that you don't like 'Walk the Line' or vice versa?  Why can't people enjoy both movies?  There have been hundreds of movies produced about the trials and tribulations of some famous individual - shouldn't we compare those movies to `Ray' and `Walk the Line' - to be consistent?  There is no doubt that Joaquin Phoenix deserved the best actor award trophy over Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Mr. Phoenix's performance was flawless.  On the other hand, I could barely stay awake during Capote and can't recall a quotable line.  Walk the Line will stay in my memory (along with other great movies) for years to come.  That to me is the hallmark of a good movie.  I own both the DVD and the CD, because that movie was awesome.  In the reviews, someone wrote that there was too much Joaquin in the movie.  I say there wasn't enough.  Anytime an actor makes you want to learn more about a famous individual or a different genre of music - that actor has done his or her job.  Similar to `Ray', where Jamie Foxx's portrayal made me appreciate the music of Ray Charles, Joaquin Phoenix made me want to hear more Johnny Cash tunes and learn more about the man in black.  Walk the Line is a fantastic movie and I am sure that we will see many more great performances from Joaquin Phoenix.  Let's hope the Academy wises up and gives Phoenix his due.
B00005JOYA|3.0|<br />Silent Hill, Sony Picture's adaptation of the popular videogame series, continues the entertainment industry's introspective exploration of disaffected and disempowered children, masquerading as dispossessed spirits, desperate to redress insidious abuses, sometimes at the expense of a parent's life. <br /> <br />The film opens with Rose Da Silva's (Radha Mitchell) gambit to take her daughter, Sharon (Jodelle Ferland) to the enigmatically titled West Virginia town, against the wishes of her husband, Christopher (Sean Bean), in the hope of finding a spiritual cure for Sharon's mysterious illness. Its onslaught has conjured ominous bouts of sleepwalking, delirious repetition of ''Silent Hill,'' disconcerting memory lapses, and brutal artwork, all threatening to have Sharon institutionalized. <br /> <br />En route, Rose and Sharon hazard upon an instinctively suspicious police officer, Cybil Bennett (Laurie Holden).  Keen on following the pair into Silent Hill, after a brief encounter in nearby Brahams, the parties are caught off guard by the apparition of a young girl that figures prominently in their separate roadside accidents. Rose ''awakens'' to find Sharon missing. Flustered, she ventures into Silent Hill, on foot, where she believes she has glimpsed her. What she encounters there defies rational explanation. After reuniting with an infuriated Cybil, they navigate a labyrinth of streets and buildings in a dimensionally fractured environment that is enshrouded by powerful metaphysical themes, worthy of some of the best-canvassed creations of the late surrealist, Salvador Dali. Quarantined thirty years ago by Toluca County officials, Silent Hill still smolders as a noxious, ashen hell made more menacing by the shadowy din that periodically transfigures it, heralded by a bellowing siren atop the town's Church. The original coal fire destroyed countless lives-some less innocent than others-and its victims seem to confront Rose and Cybil as badly burnt children,disfigured nurses, contorted corpses, rodent-like insects, and mythical demons--including \\"Pyramid Head\\"--a favorite of the videogamers. Most disturbing perhaps, is Silent Hill's cult of fanatical executioners, bloodthirsty witch hunters, led by beguiling Christabella/Valtiel (Alice Krige, in a role that exceeds the menace of her alter persona as Star Trek's Borg Queen).  More said would spoil the film. Notwithstanding, director Christophe Gans, and writers Nicolas Boukhrief and Robert Avery, execute a superbly crafted, and beautifully cinematographed, film with a brilliant flashback that satisfies nearly all questions about the unfolding mystery. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I have never played the Silent Hill videogames. Despite witnessing grown adults shudder at its mention, I suspect the filmmakers' desire to gratify the gaming faithful with violent, if not familiar, imagery did the film more harm than good. The excellent ghost story and score that anchors Silent Hill deserves intellectual play in the disquieted minds of its filmgoers, not in excessively sadistic screen graphics. Gamers will likely disagree with this analysis, and it certainly is not my intention to begrudge them of their joy, but the film's over-reliance on visual mayhem eclipses the truly fine performances of the actors, and truncates constructive narrative and back-story that could have advanced the film's intriguing esoteric, social, psychological, and religious themes. The \\"monsters\\" and avatars that the protagonists defeat or heed in Silent Hill are metaphors for the less savory in society who impose, or taunt us through, corrosive cultural constraints, institutional obstacles, and personal dilemmas that can corrupt our sense of right and wrong, dissolve the lines between good and evil, and fail our better judgment. Those who are most malevolent threaten the collective good, which has taken the form of a lost and abused little girl in Silent Hill. Falsely accused of the \\"sins\\" of her mothers,she is to be sacrificed on the altar of heresy. The real fear in the film is the doubt we have in the protagonists' ability to save her, and keep other loved ones safe and alive, away from the fiery precipice. <br /> <br />Inspired performances abound. Rahda Mitchell, as the emotionally distraught mother of a terminally ill child, connects with her on screen daughter and husband, and viewers alike. Sean Bean's frustration as an alienated husband, perniciously thwarted by a disingenuous detective, Thomas Gucci--whom actor, Kim Coates, seasons to perfection with small town mindedness--is genuinely believable. Laurie Holden indelibly impresses us as an abrasive, tough motorcycle officer, and Jodelle Ferland, like so many gifted child actors and actresses who have been featured, recently, in sinister tales of possession, raises the bar a notch with a truly mesmerizing interpretation that belies her beauty and innocence. <br />
B000E33VWW|2.0|As an actor, I have no issues with Mr. Philip Seymour Hoffman. He's due to win for something. Unfortunately, Capote was not one of my favorite 'Hoffman' roles. Also, Hoffman didn't deserve to win over Joaquin Phoenix, whose portrayal of Johnny Cash, made me go out and buy the movie and the CD.  This is a real phenomenon because I really don't like country music.  Who makes these stupid decisions in Hollywood?  Sorry, Mr. Hoffman but Capote is not as good or as memorable as the characterization in Walk the Line.  Frankly, the only memorable performance in Capote was that of the convicted criminals.
B000EULJLU|2.0|If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous. I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...  <br /> <br />Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band. Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere. None of the epic sound of past releases.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should. And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.  <br /> <br />A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort. The silver lining? Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...  <br /> <br />Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant. Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply. <br />

B000002I7R|5.0|I'm going to say something that I'm sure will have me howled down by other reviewers but I gotta get it off my chest - I love this Plant album more than anything Led Zeppelin ever did!<br /><br />Right from the word go this album grabs hold and won't let go. Put it on in the car and just cruise down the highway safe in the knowledge there isn't a dud track anywhere.<br /><br />The backing musicians are great, especially Robbie Blunt, the vocals are excellent as Plant still had all the range required to bring out the best in these compositions. Going into track by track analysis is pointless, this is an awesome album. Production wise this disc doesn't sound like it was record over 20 years ago, it's still quite fresh, perhaps due to the restraint of the arrangements and the clarity and quality of the playing.<br /><br />If your interested in getting into Robert Plant and don't know where to start, this would be my suggestion, either this or The Principle of Moments.
B000683VI4|5.0|Sometimes I am very disappointed with love stories because they tend to follow one type of formula or another.  This movie has wonderful twists and turns.  In brings out one's positive feelings in very moving way.<br /><br />The characters were believable and well done.

I can't imagine anyone would be disappointed who enjoys a good love story.<br /><br />Also, prepared to be surprised.  That's all I have to say.
B000002JK4|5.0|I initially got into Robert Plant around the time of his Now and Zen disc and worked backwards from there. And what a treasure trove was waiting. This album, along with Pictures at Eleven, constitute vital listening not only for hard rock or metal fans wanting to check out this guys solo stuff, but also for generic music fans.<br /><br />Just like on Pictures at Eleven, this is not a heavy metal album, it's just brilliant. Tunes like Other Arms, In the Mood and Big Log are just excellent.<br /><br />Specific points would be - excellent harmonies and melodies; a wonderful set of backing musicians; an open mind about musical direction; tidy production that hasn't really dated and also the feeling that everyone involved knew that this album was going to be good. It's like it was some sort of karma or something.<br /><br />Any generic music fan should buy this album, it's a wonderful primer and for those few Zep fans who are unsure as to whether they should explore Plants solo stuff or not - the answer is a resounding yes.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I loved everything about this movie.  It captured the spirit of Gandhi's life, had a well developed plot, great characters, beautiful scenery, wonderful music and was a fine example of great drama.  It didn't sensationalize Gandhi, his life, his impact on the world or rely on a lot of hollywood gimmicks for its strong visceral impact.<br /><br />This is the best theatrical biography I have ever seen and it is possibly my favorite movie of all time.  It is truly inspirational and raises the bar for this type of movie considerably.  In short, it is a masterpiece.

Reportedly Thurber didn't like the movie too much, but, honestly, I believe there is little not to love in this movie. It does a superb job projecting the character Walter Mitty Thurber seemed to want to create. There is quite a deal more depth given to this character in the movie, and this is a good thing. Instead of just being a simple-minded man who dreams away from his uneventful life and wife to bigger and better things, this Walter Mitty leads two lives-the real, and the dream-which seemingly interconnect during the film.  <br /> <br />There are subtle differences from the short story. For instance, Walter's wife (in the story) is replaced with his nagging mother in the film. He is going to be married, and is not only nagged by his mother but also his fianc?. However, after he witnesses a murder, he begins to question what is real and what illusion is, including the girl of his dreams (Virginia Mayo).  <br /> <br />Another superb aspect of the film is simply the performance by Danny Kaye. Kaye embodies the very essence of Walter Mitty so well-there are the goofy moments when he nervously struggles to get away from danger, the entertaining parts where he is singing about musical devices, or showing the latest fashion, and the adventurous scenes where he is trying to help his damsel-in-distress escape countless villains (one of which is played by none other than villain legend Boris Karloff).  <br /> <br />Another great thing about the film is its quality. The DVD is in excellent quality, sound, transfer and color are fantastic. I'm so glad they brought this classic to DVD.  <br /> <br />This is an exceptional movie for the family to enjoy, or just a movie to cheer you up. It definitely has the comedic flavor that we expect from Danny Kaye films.  <br /> <br />I think we can all associate with the dreamer in Walter Mitty, because we all want to be heroic in some way.
B000EULJLU|5.0|The newest album from Tool can easily be called their best work yet from beginning to end the sounds will blow your mind away. I have been a fan of Tool ever since Undertow and each album gets better and better, even for people who do not like Tool or rock music you need to give this a listen and experience some of their genius.
B000001FE0|5.0|During a strenuous time for the brothers Gibb, they managed to make an instant classic. Strange arrangements and lyrics (thanks mainly to Robin)spun together with a solid cohesiveness of beautiful harmonies and great, mature songwriting.  The Bee Gees were at their musical peak.  The orchestral opener, about a ship lost at sea sets the tone where everything musical is possible.  \\"Marley Purt Drive\\" could have been written by Robbie Robertson(but it wasn't). The odd rocking arrangement of \\"Whisper Whisper\\" must have been adopted by Elvis Costello for his \\"Trust\\" album. And \\"Melody Fair\\" is just....gorgeous.  Arguably, the best Bee Gees song out there.  Maybe Odessa's oddness turned many people off.  This is an album that samples so many genres.  So many artists have tried to record an album like this and have failed.  Not the Bee Gees.  This is truly an under appreciated but appealing album.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|Awesome album. Harcore gangsta. All the G-Unit haters out there, Mobb Deep has proved that G-Unit is still ahead of the game!
B000EULJLU|5.0|Didn't care much for the album at first listen... actually, I was pretty disappointed. But as I've listened to it more and more, I can safely say that it really is a work of art. It is an album that will creep up on you over time, demanding your attention. The bass is in-freakin-credible, especially in the song 10,000 days. The Pot's lyrics disappoint, but musically it's still a great song, reminds me of their Undertow days.  <br /> <br />Also, go read the lyrics for Wings for Marie/10K days. Amazing.  <br /> <br />Anyway, if you're a fan, go buy it.. You won't be disappointed. The people that are complaining are just not listening closely enough. Can't wait to see them on the 4th!

B00005JOFQ|1.0|Two married with children people leave their vows and families to pursue \\"love.\\"  Poorly written and acted, although nicely photographed - this is an abysmal film.  Without the homosex aspect it would have barely registered a blip. Glad my viewing was someone's DVD left around, so I took a look to see what the fuss was. A clever marketing ploy to get their audience to pay anything to see their cause forwarded, but ignored by the rest of us. Give it a pass.
B0000069NM|5.0|Scofield sounds totally at home in so many musical settings, whether its the (relatively) straightahead live jazz on 2003's \\"EnRoute\\" with bassist Steve Swallow and drummer Bill Stewart, or this rollicking funky (and fun) ride from 1998. Here, just when the funk grooves reach meltdown point, Sco and his tighter than tight collaborators Medeski Martin and Wood take it down a few notches and its more of a slow burn. Tunes range in style from the hook-laden, melodic \\"Jeep on 35\\" (one member of the band in fact can be heard whistling the melody at a certain point) to the faintly menacing and furiously climactic \\"Hottentot\\", which most of my neighbours will also be familiar with by now. Scofield is in a class of his own when it comes to sounding soulful and laid-back and angular and unpredictable all at once (I like to think he'd have hit it off with Thelonious Monk had they belonged to the same era); I think that comes also from the fact that he's not an out-and-out speed demon, trying to bludgeon you into submission with a flurry of notes. If he were a boxer, he'd be one of those ones that wear down their opponent by circling them and picking them off with well-timed, unpredictable combinations and the occasional sneaky blow below the belt. In total control. Great stuff, though definitely a \\"grower\\" - I wasn't totally blown away at first myself, so give it a few spins!

B000ETQRCM|5.0|Pearl Jam is a band that many love, but few in the mainstream actually understand.  Nine out of ten people will say \\"Oh yeah! Jeremy!\\" without even batting an eye at their later material.  Once Vitalogy came out, that spelled the end for their mainstream appeal, because it represented something that was not easily digestable and warranted repeated listenings.  This album is no different.  However, it exceeds the excellent (but occasionally murky and obscure) offerings of Binaural and Riot Act.  Both albums are very good, but this album hits you with an urgency that hasn't been felt since \\"Yield\\" (the pinnacle Pearl Jam album as far as I'm concerned).  From the opening punch of \\"Life Wasted\\", I'm reminded of why I started listening to Pearl Jam in the first place.  Ed hasn't sounded this angry in some time, but he is simultaneously thought-provoking and hopeful.  The lyrics are clearly scathing of the Bush administration, but they resonate more than any other 2000's-era protest music.  They examine both sides of the problem, from the administration's crimes to the public's apathy towards them.  Vedder is not simply spouting off sarcasm like he does in concert; he is truly examining the collective psyche of a society whose morals and respect for human dignity have been all but pushed aside by money, greed, and corruption.  This may not be the same \\"storytelling\\" he did in earlier years, but the quality is not hindered at all.  And besides, I'm sure Vedder is in an entirely different mental and emotional position now than he was at the time of Ten and Vs..  The band is still making a statement that is entirely unconcerned with what the public thinks of them, and more power to them for that.  What consistently amazes me about Pearl Jam is the fact that they do what they do, no matter the trends in music at the time.  While the mainstream is desperately seeking out the next \\"indie\\" trendsetters, Pearl Jam are making great rock and roll on their own terms.  They may get aradio single here and there, but they certainly aren't seeking one out.  And besides, \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is a great song.   <br /> <br />The album kicks off with \\"Life Wasted\\", a classic rocking Pearl Jam album opener.  \\"World Wide Suicide\\" is relentlessly catchy and to-the-point.  \\"Comatose\\" is one of my favorite tracks on the album; it represents the band at their speed-punk finest, even borrowing some oblique counterpoint that reminds me of late Fugazi.  \\"Severed Hand\\" reminds me of The Who a bit, with its grand arena rock intro, but quickly cuts into a nasty groove with some killer playing from both Gossard and McCready.  Matt Cameron is also becoming a true Pearl Jam drummer, playng tasteful and innovative beats and fills rather than hammering out the tasteless AC/DC beats of his early tenure with the band.  \\"Marker in the Sand\\" ends with a beautiful guitar riff that is very hopeful and impassioned.  \\"Parachutes\\" is a Stone Gossard song to the core; he is definitely the most underappreciated member of the band.  It is a quirky Beatles-esque tune that reminds you of how tender and offbeat Pearl Jam can be.  From here on out the rockin' is a little more sparse and not nearly the fury-driven intensity of the first five songs.  \\"Unemployable\\" is a great song with some really poignant lyrics.  \\"Big Wave\\" is mockery a la \\"Do the Evolution\\"; Ed at his sarcastic best.  \\"Gone\\" is one of the album's finest tracks, hands down.  Definitely pulls at the heartstrings, but not too much.  After that comes the mandatory interlude track, which is really just a reprise of \\"Life Wasted\\"'s chorus.  \\"Army Reserve\\" is the last true rockin' song on the album, as \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" end the album on a hopeful note.  \\"Inside Job\\" is especially notable, it reminds me of Binaural's \\"Parting Ways\\" in its slow, deliberate climax with a glorious ending. <br /> <br />People expecting this to be a \\"return to form\\" for Pearl Jam will be sorely disappointed; I'm still not sure why this album was marketed and reviewed that way.  It is certainly more direct and purpose-driven than the last two albums, though those were both great too.  The band sounds like they were really inspired for this one.  After hearing the production-over-songs method used in Binaural and the folk approach to Riot Act, it's good to be reminded that these guys really are one of the only true rock bands left.  Don't get me wrong, I love me some indie and many other types of music, but the passion and originality that Pearl Jam bring to rock music today are second to none.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|5 stars is to stay of the haters. Truth be told the album is not bad at all and is worth the purchase. Why waste your time hating on 50 and the unit; aren't there better things to do with the time.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I hadn't read anything about this album before getting it. I've been a tool fan for a long time though. I think my favorite album (this one included) is Aenima, but this album has some real great music on it. I'd buy the album just for the 4th track: 10000 days. It is amazing. And is it just me or does the 3rd track almost succeed in putting you into a trance when heard through headphones? There is only one song on this album that bothers me, which I think actually lowers my opinion of Tool which is Lost Keys. It just didn't taste right. It was graphic in a way that seemed below them. Still, a magnificent album. Get it.
B000E6GBV2|5.0|This CD is one of the best I have heard in a while.  The mind blowing lyrics and euphoria inducing harmonics make this album something that you will listen to over and over.  I liked it the first listen, but after three listens, I was hooked.  This CD hasn't left my car CD player since it left the store.  If you can,  just close your eyes and let the music soak into you, it will have an amazingly spiritual effect on you!
0156027321|5.0|I read lots of english books, but this one is well written.<br /><br />Yann did an excellent job while picking up the words and building the imagery. When the story starts to develop, you won't be able to take the book off!
B000EULJLU|5.0|The greatest album yet from the greatest band alive.<br /><br />If you don't \\"get\\" this album, I merely feel sorry for you.  TOOL have accomplished a lot of things in the realm of sound, but making me shed tears (@the end of \\"Wings For Marie\\") is a first for this unique band.  I will be seeing them live for the 7th time tomorrow, August 29, 2006, in SLC, and the goosebumps have already started.  Please:  if you don't have anything good to say about this masterful tour de force, don't say anything at all, it's just wasted words.  Instead, try shutting up and listen to the album again, only this time, turn off all the lights, tell everyone around to shut up, pay attention, and let the music + words carry you away.  It is a tremendous musical as well as lyrical statement, and there is no other band alive that can touch this.<br /><br />Another thing:  It becomes painfully obvious while listening to 10,000 Days that this music is intended to be experience in a live setting.  These studio recordings are as impeccable as they could manage, but you have not heard this album until you've experienced it live and in your face.<br />I can't wait until tomorrow. . .<br /><br />Long live TOOL \m/
B000ETQRCM|5.0|After more then a few years of waiting for the new Pearl Jam CD, I was enthralled to hear that they were coming out with another CD.  It had seemed much too long since the somewhat disappointing Riot Act, so I was ready to hear some new material. <br /> <br />After the first listen, I was shocked.. mostly because after CD's like Binaural and Riot Act, which were more experimental, this one was more like Vitology (my favorite album by them).  The first five songs cranked out, and I was already hooked.  Even after they slowed it down for the next couple songs, and Eddie's voice slowly sang over McCready and Gossard's guitar, I still loved it. <br /> <br />I didn't really care whether the lyrics had more of a \\"political message\\" to them.. While I did like his lyrics on his earlier albums more then I do on this one, the lyrics were never the most important part of the CD to me.   <br /> <br />As the title of my review says, I'm finding it to be one of my favorite Pearl Jam albums.  When Life Wasted kicks in, you can't help but grin that the Vitology era Pearl Jam is back.  World Wide Suicide has the same frantic, grungy sort of sound, and then Comatose comes on, and it's just all out grunge rock.  When Eddie yells \\"Feel it rising!\\", it's almost like you're listening to Part 2 of Spin The Black Circle.  Marker In The Sand retains the same grunge sound as the previous 4 songs. <br /> <br />With the first five songs being all out rockers, the next two, Parachutes and Unemployable, were sort of a breather.  Parachutes was an excellent acoustic song, and Unemployable was more of a mid tempo song, but still good. <br /> <br />After the two soft tracks, Big Wave is a huuge jump back into the more heavy stuff.  It definitely has a funky sort of sound to it. <br /> <br />Wasted Reprise isn't really a song.. more of just a little continuation of Life Wasted.. But this song leads into Army Reserve, which is probably my least favorite song on the CD.  I don't know what it was aboutit, but after all of the other songs, when this one comes on, it just seems inferior to the rest of them. <br /> <br />The CD ends with two epic songs.  Come Back is a slow song that slowly builds up to mid tempo.. Amazing song, followed by one of the best songs they've written in awhile: Inside Job.  This song starts off verrry slow, and it keeps going on until it reaches an epic end.  Awesome end to a great CD. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend buying this, just to hear the old Pearl Jam sound again <br /> <br />And also, I don't really see how people are making comparisons to this and Riot Act.  To me, in my ears, they didn't sound anything alike.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|Some lovely cinematography and an instantly riveting character study from Heath Ledger had us straight into \\"watching a new classic\\" mode. Shades of The Last Picture Show, liberal overtones of late, elegiac Pekinpah and even a hint of Butch and Sundance in both the budding buddiness, the banter and the long landscape vistas. There is also, of course, the original hook of \\"men's men\\" bonding extending into the erotic - cowboy physicality turning sexual in what is conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location.    From the compelling opening, the affair matures and gathers poignancy, evolving from sweet infatuation to tragic separation, as the smitten pair struggle to make \\"conventional\\" family lives work after they leave the lovely eponymous setting of their first meeting. The film has enough generosity to portray these doomed \\"normal\\" lives with dignity, too, evoking equal sympathy for the sensitively-studied heterosexual partners with whom our protagonists attempt to build some kind of \\"acceptable\\" reality beyond the mountain. The film's initial strengths combine to make you want these guys to get back together on a permanent basis with exactly the same romantic fervour you'd normally apply to star-crossed lovers of the Shakespearian (or even Sleepless in Seattle) variety.    What a pity, then, that the story outstays its welcome by about half an hour. The sexual tension to which we've been attuned begins to weaken as Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is outpaced by Ledger's. The former appears to find the conveyance of ageing as much of a challenge as James Dean did in Giant. Gyllenhaal tends to fall back on the drop-your-head for a big-eyed look-up school of appeal, which is fine for Disney but not so effective in sustained, gritty tragedy. You find yourself longing for the beauty and poignancy of John Voight's glorious Joe Buck in Midnight Cowboy. Instead, you get the Gyllenhaal signature doe-eyes (with, of course, a cool mouth-twist to denote post-millennial irony). Our Jake has gone unchallenged for too long, now: his reputation is the sum of great parts, rather than performances - in other words, luck. I hope he finds a script and a director to really stretch him soon.    As for this increasingly dreary, one-note piece, there's a precise moment when I felt my attention begin to slacken, long about the time Ledger's character is sitting in a rainy car on yet another miserable day telling his daughter he doesn't think it would be a good idea for her to move in with him. One sigh and rustle of denim too many, I think, one too many raindrops on a windscreen; a bit too much wind.    It's a waste of some great work to let the early energy peter out in melancholy indulgence like this. Blame Ang Lee, as well: he clearly thinks he's earned the time to depress us at length (when, actually, we've become well-invested in the story and are starting to look for narrative outcome and, if not redemption, at least some form of closure). The final test of how let down we felt is in our response to what could have been a decent, downbeat ending - if only Ledger had been encouraged to articulate the actual last line with a little more clarity. Instead, as a nice deep focus window-landscape fade went into the credits, over a swell of the simple, moving score, what we thought we heard was something between \\"Sheergar's where?\\" and \\"Day-Care sore.\\" A sense of emotional short-change led swiftly into levity and undermined a lot of the decent efforts before, a feeling of \\"Well, if you can't be bothered to let us hear what could have been a poignant anti-climax, we can't be bothered to take your whole point seriously.\\" The stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.    Having deciphered the last line from Internet research, the next test would be whether we could watch it through again, so as to avoid the unfortunate bathos of Ledger's Last Gargle. Well, we can't; we'd rather watch Crash a third time. Ultimately, then, Brokeback Mountain's promise is allowed to sag, and we have to conclude that there are better male love stories. Maturin and Aubrey in Master and Comander, for one example. The Odd Couple for another. And far better, more complete films. Like Crash.    Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing; but I suggest you look up the last line before setting aside the gloomy hours required to get to it. And rent, don't buy.      And now (a week or so later), I'll append a counter to a counter to me, if I may:-    Although this facility is best used to air considered individual opinions, it's also reasonable for us to offer temperate comments (and, where appropriate, counter-comments) on each other's views. What \\"Reviewer\\" (above) likes to call \\"contravesry\\" (sic) is the essence of healthy exchange. Just because you disagree with my critique of a film you like, however, is no basis for childish slurs on my integrity and accusations of lack of intelligence. Hating people because their tastes are different is the kind of thinking that leads to prejudices such as racism and homophobia.    Reviewer judges my contribution incorrect, prejudged, and shallow. Well, I'm standing by what I liked: \\"lovely cinematography\\" and a \\"riveting character study from Heath Ledger\\"; I'm sticking with my comparisons to The Last Picture Show and late, elegiac Pekinpah. I repeat that I found the (homo)sexuality \\"conveyed, with lyrical toughness, as undeniably, perfectly natural in this wild, beautiful location,\\" and admired the film's \\"generosity\\" to the cowboys' doomed heterosexual partners. I'll even repeat: \\"Brokeback Mountain is certainly worth a viewing.\\" I trust that such features of my original review caused relatively little apoplexy in Reviewer.    Having said that, I also claim the right to reiterate my unfavourable comparison with Midnight Cowboy; to say again that I found the tale \\"increasingly dreary\\"; and that I felt a \\"sense of emotional short-change\\" from the director's \\"melancholy indulgence.\\" By then, I guess Reviewer's tantrum was well under way. Indeed, my sin of \\"incorrectness\\" probably began with the qualification that the \\"stronger aspects of the film deserve a much better, more disciplined last reel or so.\\"    So - as for shallow? I'd say I was fair. I took the time to watch the thing; took the time to construct a review that discussed positive and negative aspects of the piece, giving credit where due; even took the time to look up Ledger's garbled valediction. And prejudged? Only in so far as I actually wanted to appreciate this movie. It's just that certain elements, such as its indulgent length, one lead's performance and occasional unintelligibility of the dialogue wouldn't allow me to love it as much as the movie and its adulators clearly thought it deserved. In fact - as I said - the flaws left me feeling cheated at a great opportunity narrowly missed through lack of discipline and a reliance on the \\"issue\\" itself for depth, rather than cinematic quality.    Incorrect? Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it? It's why we have different reviewers giving different assessments. But I do think the use of \\"incorrect\\" is very telling, as it looks to me like the objections to my review are rather based on perceived political incorrectness than on critical inaccuracy.     Reviewer is clearly a big fan of Brokeback. Indeed, \\"...my family, and friends, and just about everyone I know watched this movie at least 5 times in theatre, and have all bought the DVD release.\\" OK, in conclusion, I'll refrain from urging Reviewer to get a life in favour of a counter counter-request for a little more balance and a mind a little more widely open to the valid, reasonably expressed views of others - rather more in keeping with the spirit of the film than his own less than charitable, pejorative outburst.

B000ETQRCM|2.0|Well here we go... another Pearl Jam album 3 ? years since the last one. Do we need another one?<br /><br />First of let me state that the only reason I now own a copy is because of the strong reviews I've read for this album I've read in various sources most notably AMG which rated it 4 ? out of 5 saying that it is their best record since `Vitalogy' (1995) if not before. This is Pearl Jam's eighth album now and I think we can divide their career now into two halves: Their first four albums being their classic period which lasted just five years (Ten; VS; Vitalogy; No Code) and the latter four albums in ten years (Yield; Binaural; Riot Act; Pearl Jam). Well actually you know what `Pearl Jam' feels just like `Binaural' and not as bad as `Riot Act' but kind of on a par with `Yield' (and certainly not better than `Ten' `VS'  `No Code' and definitely not better than `Vitalogy' which in my opinion is their career peak).<br /><br />So what are the tracks like? Well for the most part they are just below par however the last three `Army Reserve' `Come Back' `Inside Job' are better in a Springsteen / U2 impersonating way, entering into a psychedelic `Black' territory (but not as good by a long shot). There are no great tunes here. No `Alive' `Even Flow' `Jeremy' `Daughter' `Dissident' `Rearviewmirror' `Not For You' `Better Man' `Corduroy' `Immortality' and definitely no `Why Go' `Deep' `Spin The Black Circle' `Go' or `Blood'. There just seems to be a lack of passion, there is no anthemic angry young man presense any more, no hand reaching out to the disaffected and instead a more comfortable `40 something' affair about it all. But of course it's been like on the last three albums anyway.<br /><br />When I first heard `Ten' I was sixteen years old, I'm 30 now and personally I've grown musically. I don't believe this band has grown much in that time. At times it reminds of the early nineties but most of the time it's just downright boring. The Clash said `you grow up and you calm down' (Clampdown). Their best years are now long behind them. For me the difference between `Ten' (1991) and inspiringly title `Pearl Jam' (2006)(read sarcasm) is the fifteen-year gap and 2600 albums I acquired in those years. I've listen to so much more exciting music in between that this just seems lame now. When I heard that there would be a new album I was not completely excited by the prospect and when I saw the artwork I was very much unimpressed, I mean it's a goddamn avocado. And to think that there was concern about artwork for `Ten' being mauve. If anyone knows the significance please let us know.<br /><br />I think what this band needs is a drastic change. I'd take them and stick in a real garage full of rattling faulty junk equipment and make them record on a cassette 4 track recorder. Strip away all the studio polish that seems to have crept into their sound and starve them for a month and them let them record their album live again in seven days. I'd also push the vocals further back into the mix so Eddie has to really work to be heard. The production on `VS' and `Vitalogy' was much better than on recent albums. Anything they produce will be better than this.d you calm down' (Clampdown). Their best years are now long behind them.

B000ETQRCM|4.0|Pearl Jam have already solidified themselves as Rock and Roll legends. To dimiss any of their releases is to truly show your ignorance about rock music in general. It took about two or three spins and the album easily won me over but speaking as a long time fan that is something Pearl Jam have always excelled at.  <br /> <br />This time around they definetly want to rock you out of your mind and the first couple of tracks do this and than some. Eddie's voice is aged like wine and while they arent as clean as on previous records its got a great Neil Young quality which further enriches the classic rock sound coming from the other members of this mafia, Jeff, Stone, Mike, and Matt. Its hard to sound fresh on your 8th release but somehow they still manage to surprise me with the songs they've packed together in this package.  <br /> <br />Parachutes and Gone are two wonderfully written ballads and the album closer, Inside Job, is the most epic they've been since 'Immortality' on Vitalogy. The record opens with good old fashioned hard rock and the final three tracks make it a far more poignant experience than you may have expected. <br /> <br /> Riot Act was a far more pessimistic record with a few glimpses of hope. That records themes showed a strong distrust in the system but a lot of faith in the human spirit. This record is about coming out from that pessimism to truly making a difference in this world. Taking faith into action and leaving behind a life wasted. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is yet another Tool milestone. An excellent addition to your musical collection.     Tool does what other modern bands can't dream of. Maybe it could be a little inaccesible at first, but, just listen to it multiple times, let it grow, and enjoy Tool's creativity.     Songs like Wings for Marie/10,000 Days and Lost Keys/Rosetta Stoned are epic. Brings tears to my eyes. Vicarious and Jambi are so powerful. The Pot is so nice and different, totally unexpected. Right In Two....no words.         PLEASE...DON'T compare this album to Tool's past efforts. Realize this is NOT Lateralus 2, this is NOT Aenima 2. This is not a sequel. Every Tool album is meant to be a different experience, and THAT is what makes Tool so great, so unique. They're always pushing the envelope. They're always bursting with creativity.

Blue Racer: Men buy this album because either they are G*y(like Fed Up) or want to, as Prince aptly put it, \\"get off\\" looking at the cover, Japanese Beetle: I don't think she is worth the price of tea in Japan, HAASAH(karate chops her head)!!! SAYONARA!
B000ETQRCM|4.0|I bought this based on World Wide Suicide, their appearance on Saturday Night Live and the fact that it is self titled, and now that they are on J records I felt it was Pearl Jams way of saying, take a look at us once again. Plus I wanted to get ready to see them open for Tom Petty.  I love how stripped down the album is, with some of the songs being a little weird but in a good way.  Strong lyrically and very interesting musically.  It is a rare CD that rocks and is still mellow at the same time.  I also like that the bass lines were not forgotten in most of the songs.  Not flashy or glossy by any means, and I really liked Eddie Vedders voice being mic'd so close.  The album artwork on the inside is incredible.
0670034711|1.0|I'm glad I got the book from the library. Aside from the shallow observations, the actual construction and vocabulary of the words are limited and uninteresting.
B000BTJCRM|2.0|this bands label treated them to an INFOMERCIAL here during SXSW on late night tv. very strange and definitely lost a lot of points with me for that. not very 'rock and roll.' <br /> <br />but, the music is okay. it has its moments. they'll go the way of the vines or the von bondies and nobody will know who the f*** wolfmother is in 2 years time. so enjoy it a few times around for what it is, a throw-away retro rock album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is a continuation of Tool at its best.  Maynard's vocals have gone to a new level, perfectly aligned with the music and with lyrics that are meaningful.  This album is worth the purchase simply for the two best tracks, Vicarious and Right in Two.  Danny even breaks out a bongo/percussion type drums in Right in Two.  Given the lyrics' relevance to today's world, this could be their best track yet.  Their are hidden gems throughout this album, just be patient and keep listening.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|I'm a big East Coast hip-hop fan, and this the album that I've waiting for for a long time. There is not one bad beat on this record. The album starts off hard with \\"Smoke it,\\" the bangin' street single \\"Put 'Em In Their Place,\\" and the Lloyd Banks featured \\"Stole Somethin,\\" and the solemn \\"Speakin' so Freely.\\" The album's  \\"G-Unit production\\" begins with the joint Creep that features 50 Cent. This is a very experimental track that takes a little time to get used to, but it will grow on you... The next \\"G-Unit\\" songs are club records with \\"Backstage Pass\\" and the bangin' Young Buck featured \\"Give It to Me.\\" After that it's pretty much street bangers such as the Tony Yayo featured \\"Click, Click,\\" the controversial \\"Pearly Gates,\\" the introspective \\"Daydreamin,\\" the Alchemist-produced banger \\"The Infamous, and \\"In Love With the Moula.\\" They finish Blood Money with Mary J. Blige providing a verse and the hook on \\"It's Alright.\\" Overall, Blood Money satisfies both old Mobb fans and G-Unit fans. They pretty much stick to the formula with 50 Cent adding his platinum touch to the record, and there is nothing wrong with that...
B0001US8EO|5.0|This is one of the best, and underrated, westerns ever made. It was a very intense, interesting character study of a famous lawman, showing flaws and all. In fact, this is the only version, I believe, that really shows the sadistic side of Wyatt Earp, and what made him a bitter man. To be fair, it also shows his good traits.  <br /> <br />It also has a terrific, deep cast and features a good mix of drama, romance and action. Even the music grows on you after several viewings. There is no humor in here: this is a serious story. Unlike the more popular \\"Tombstone,\\" this Earp story has a lot less profanity and almost no usage of the Lord's name in vain....but there is rough language and some crude sexual remarks, so don't watch it with the kiddies. <br /> <br />At rate, the movie is a lot better than the critics would have you believe. (All nationally-known critics but one panned this, as far as I know.) Kevin Costner performed one of his better acting jobs. It was nice to see Michael Madsen and Tom Sizemore as good guys. That's not seen in too many films! They were low-key characters, too. Dennis Quaid did a nice job as the fascinating \\"Doc Holliday.\\" It's generally conceded that Val Kilmer's \\"Doc\\" in \\"Tombstone\\" was the best-ever, but Quaid version is just fine, thank you, and gets better and better with each viewing.  <br /> <br />This is a long movie, but it's never dull and it never overdoes the action, either. The cast is deep so you see a lot of familiar actors. As mentioned, this film is extremely underrated. I know most people prefer \\"Tombstone\\" but I'll take this version of the Earp saga any time!
1401206905|5.0|During the late nineties the Batman comic was in trouble. The character lost almost all its dark appeal it had when Bob Kane conceived it. Batman was blue and had this bright yellow sign on his chest. The character had lost all its sharp edges. He became basically an easy going guy, the kind that tells corny jokes but is entertaining enough to take out for a couple of pints.  <br /> <br />Enter Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli. Within a few years after this classic comic the character was completely revamped. Batman was dark and edgy again, too serious to be your buddy, but great comic book material. Had Batman been a write off before, now everybody remotely creative in the comic book industry wanted to lay their hands on him, Batman year one even spawned a the Legend of the Dark Night series which was in it's first years complete dedicated to year one related stories. <br /> <br />Year One features a Gotham City turned nightmare yet told with a very good sense of realism. Gotham's state doesn't differ too much from the state a lot of the American inner cities were in at the time. Year One didn't need super villains to keep it afloat. Here we find Batman up against corrupt politicians, crooked cops, hardened business men and the mob. Divisions blur between them, all of Gotham seems to be corrupt. It takes an outsider like Jim Gordon to bring some humanity into Gotham. <br /> <br />Batman Year One is as much Gordon's story as it is Batman's. We watch his struggle with corruption, his faltering relationship and we watch him trying to figure out what to make of this vigilante in his city. At the same time we see Batman more humane than we've seen him in years. Batman is still struggling to find his methods to become the cities protector, trying to find alliances, building his myth. Alfred & Bruce Wayne once again take the much necessary comic relief on their account. A role they lost when Batman was still such a friendly guy. This new Batman is merciless, determentand brooding, just as he should be.

B000003TA4|1.0|It has been 12 years after the death of Kurt Cobain. So attention, Nirvana elitists. Did you get that the first time? Let me repeat myself. Kurt Cobain has been dead for 12 years. Okay. Now that you understand that...GET OVER IT. He is dead!!! Okay, he shot himself in the head and killed himself with a shotgun. He isn't on an island somewhere, or living in a basement in Los Angeles somewhere. He is dead. So, when you Nirvana elitists grow up and realize that this drug-infested hack was not a genius, and that he is in the dirt being eaten by a bunch of worms, then I will forgive you for all your sins since the death of Kurt in 1994. Look. He was the most overrated guitarist in history. \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine said that he was #12 on the list of greatest guitarists of all-time. When I saw that, I wanted to get a shotgun and blow my head off. How could you think that this guy was a genius? <br /> <br />Compared to the other big 3 in grunge, (Soundgarden, Alice In Chains, Pearl Jam), Kurt Cobain cannot even hold a candle to those guitarists. Chris Cornell (played guitar), Jerry Cantrell and Eddie Vedder are better singers, songwriters and guitar players than this hack. His lyrics were nothing but revolving around his depression, drug problem and overall angst that made Nirvana an MTV favorite. Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell of Alice In Chains both had better lyrics and vocals, and Chris Cornell could sing ten times better than Cobain. Kurt is more of the worst guitar player in history than the best. As other reviewers stated, he lowered the standards for how to be popular. He spawned MTV to its peak of popularity, and it seems the last year MTV played something good was 1994. Thanks, Kurt! You really did us a good job. And, unlike other reviewers, I am not happy he's dead, but I can really care less because he took his own life and didn't take it like a real man. <br /> <br />So on to the other two members. The bassist is descent if that, and another overrated one. Drummer Dave Grohl is the only talented one here, because not only did he own on drums, but he did the entire first Foo Fighter's CD all by himself, showing that he does have talent. And the music? As a fan of metal (no...and not the MTV metal-core garbage), I listened to this with an open mind. And what I got was pure frustration, because this tripe is the most overrated thing I have ever heard in my life. Can someone please tell me why this is a classic? A classic is something like \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\", Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" or any Pink Floyd CD. Only one or two good songs do not warrant the word classic. Alice In Chains, Soundgarden and even Pearl Jam wipe the floor with this nonsense. An overall disappointment. Grunge didn't die in 1994. It died in 2002 (when Layne Staley of Alice In Chains died). <br /> <br />So, Nirvana not only lowered the standards of musicians today, but they also kicked off this revolution of garbage mainstream music. This may be a coincidence, but I feel Nirvana helped set the stage for all the angsty stuff on MTV and mainstream radio. Also, Kurt Cobain is a hypocrite. He says he hated the mainstream, yet he continuously made music videos for MTV. Also, a little known fact. After Cobain blew his brains out, Nirvana album sales went through the roof. Videos were re-aired, radio was playing them again and album sales were jumping. Nobody gives this much credit to Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, who was murdered tragically, but they give this hack Cobain who couldn't produce good music acclaim. I don't mean to pick on Nirvana, but Kurt and his \\"influence\\" and \\"genius\\" just pisses me off. A lot of potential in this album, but give these guys a better guitarist, and it may sound better! <br /> <br />RECOMMENDED 90'S GRUNGE/ROCK ALBUMS: <br />Alice In Chains - \\"Dirt\\"/\\"Jar Of Flies\\" <br />Soundgarden - \\"Superunknown\\"/\\"Badmotorfinger\\" <br />Pearl Jam - \\"Ten\\"/\\"Vs\\" <br />Rage Against the Machine - \\"Rage Against the Machine\\"/\\"Evil Empire\\"
B000002KXV|5.0|This album has been one of my top 3 favorites of all time since my husband introduced me to it when we got married 15 years ago. I was only 19 at the time, but luckily I recognized its greatness. My hubby is an audio engineer, and he's trained me over the years to really *hear* the music. The Nightfly is one album by which he measures much of the music he mixes. I find myself pulling this cd out often. It's perfect for any occasion. I turn it up loud and groove to it while I clean house. (How could mopping NOT be fun while bouncing to \\"Between the Raindrops\\"?) Yard work becomes easier as well. We made copies of it to keep in the car. It makes great background music when having other couples over for dinner and cards. DH and I even like to listen to it in the evenings while chatting over a glass of wine. (\\"Maxine\\" is a smoooooth, bittersweet slow-dance song.) Donald Fagen's voice is classic. His use of lyric can not be matched. His songs are stories; each song on this cd is like a chapter in a book. <br /> <br />I can't pick out a favorite song here. I never skip any. It must be enjoyed from beginning to end. I do have favorite moments and lyrics in many of the songs that sometimes merit a re-play. In Ruby Baby, it's the spot after the second verse, right after the piano solo - when everything stops but the drums and the one bass piano note- \\"bomp,bomp...bomp,bomp...\\" In New Frontier, it's the lyrics \\"Well I can't wait till I move to the city/till I finally make up my mind/ to learn design, and study oooverseas...\\" The title track, well, what can I say? \\"I've got plenty of java and Chesterfield Kings/but I feel like crying/I wish I had a heart of ice/a heart like ice\\" They just don't make music like this anymore.  <br /> <br />Even our sons, currently ages 13 and 10, love this album. They also like Kamakiriad and our Steely Dan albums. (But, they may have been \\"ruined\\" by their dad. They don't listen to today's music. My 13 yr old's favorite is jazz, & especially theBill Evans trio, and the 10 yr old's is old Fleetwood Mac!) I promise, you will not be disappointed with this album.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Could you really ask for more? Inspiring, provoking, and artistic. My own next chapter has come...
B000002KXO|5.0|I'm suprised some stingy jerks are giving this album 3 & 4 stars/////Amazing list of songs <br />   The one song that makes my heart melt..\\"Only over you\\" <br />Christine i'd die for you......anyday,,,,anytime
B000EULJLU|4.0|They come out with a new album. And I must say, I am impressed. It takes about 5 years between Tool album and in that time i barely listened to my one time favorite band. I just felt gravatated towards other music. But once i heard Vicarious, my ceuriosity grew.<br /><br />It took a few listens but the song drew me in. But i knew i had to hear to whole album before i spent my $12.99 on it. What with the recent disapointments from bands like Nine Inch Nails and Queens of The Stone Age? I didn't want to waste the money if it was indeed a dude.<br /><br />When it finally leaked i downloaded it and gave it a few listens. With each listen my complaints seemed to deminish. I heard new things, in a different way with each listen. God, Danny Carrey is such an amazing drummer.<br /><br />The first half of the album blows my mind. Vicarious, Jambi, and The Pot are probably my favorite songs on the album. The two part tribute to Maynard's mother who passed last year is also quite intence. However I agree with alot of people that said the album lags in it's 2nd half. At least it did at first, not so much now. I'd say there is really one filler on this album. Lost Keys is more a lead into Rosetta Stoned. Which i must say is a song that grew on me. It loses it's direction at times but isn't bad at all. Intension is a rather forgetable song. I don't have real opinion about it. Right In Two is a powerful new song to add for the Tool library and the real end of the album. for Viginti Tres is nothing but bull-spit. I bet if you played it backwards it would do something cool but who really cares?<br /><br />To me this is what hurts the album a bit. a few songs lose direction and don't really have a true hook or melody that draws you in. And for me, a good last song is as important as a good first song. It's like book end, if you only have one bookend, all you're books are going to fall to the floor. And this album doen't have an ending song. Maybe it's because Aenima had the most amazing ending song ever in Thrid Eye, and Lateralus really could have closed the album if you asked me.<br /><br />But  whats important is that is a well made album. It has some of their best playing and a few great new ideas. such as Justin's near funk line on The Pot, along with Maynard's vocal intro on the same song. Adam's almost Meshuggah-like riff on the intro to Jambi. and Danny's use of Tabla on Intensesion. I know what you may be asking. Did you buy it? YES! I got it for $9.99 infact. I guess i really can't resist a Tool album. If you find yourself unpleased with it give it a few listens before making your final judgement. And don't let it stoping you from seeing them live for god's sake! I already got my tickets and i'm excited to see how the new stuff trasfers to their live show.e most amazing ending song ever in Thrid Eye, and Lateralus really could have closed the album if you asked me. <br /> <br />But  whats important is that is a well made album.

B000ETQRCM|5.0|To start off I will say this and you can take it however you want when you consider my review.....PEARL JAM IS THE GREATEST AMERICAN ROCK AND ROLL BAND....EVER...don't believe me, check this site out...  <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />keep in mind I said American rock band.....With that being said, this album is remarkable, it goes back to the days of Ten, V/S, Vitalogy, No Code...No Code is their most underrated album so I include it in classic Pearl Jam. This album is remarkaly well sang, well written both musically and lyrically and it flows so well...I would tell you what my favorite songs on it are but I pretty much like them all, the ones that stand out the most are....life wasted, marker in the sand, world wide suicide, gone, severed hand, and inside job....this is a must own if you like true rock and roll music from a true rock and roll band....there is nothing out there today like Peal Jam, and there are very few true bands left so I suggest you pick this album up...
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is awesome.  Maynard is a genius.  I got this Cd today at work.  I started listening to it.  I had things that I needed to do but could not walk away from the music.  I was spellbound.  If you have ever liked any of Tools other stuff, buy this album.  You will not be disappointed.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|Yeah, so I've been a Mobb Deep fan for a long time. But unlike most, I was glad 50 signed The Infamous. I was thinking, they're gonna put out a classic with all the funds they will get. Also, I was happy for them, because ones ur wit G-unit, fan base will grow. Same with when Pac signed with Death Row and when Scarface signed with Def Jam. Anyway, back to the album. Yeah, so I will be lying through my teeth if I say that this album's a classic. Nope, doesn't come close, but is way better than the last few joints they bumped out. Prodigy is starting to come out of his slump since HNIC. On most song, he's still rapping lazy, but on a few occasion he shines better than any from the albums. Havoc, is still producing banging tracks, too bad he only produced six. Lyrics wise, he's slipped a bit, but is still superior than most from G-Unit. So, with this album, I hope the next one will be a classic Mobb album featuring artists from QBC, and less 50. 50 was probably below average most of the time, even when he's on the hook, EXCEPT for Pearly gates. U should buy that album for the song along!! Man, haven't heard a song that good in too long. <br /> <br />So here's the Tracklist: <br /> <br />1. Smoke It- Great start for the album. 4/5 Hav shines, not P though <br /> <br />2. Put Em In Their Place- Their first single, beats hot but grows old quick. 3.5/5 Great verse from both. <br /> <br />3. Stole Something- Featuring Banks, grimy beats. Banks didn't seems to fit in well. 3/5 <br /> <br />4. Creep- Featuring 50. Funking beat, a nice change. Havoc was on point while P mumbles on. <br /> <br />5. Speaking So Freely- Great song! 5/5 My second favorie! Both H and P shines lyrically. And of course banging beats. <br /> <br />6. Backstage Pass- The beat is great, but the verses are wack. Groupie talk from Mobb? Bleh!! 2.5/5 <br /> <br />7. Give It To Me- Overuse beats, a pop song for the radio featuring young Buck. Average. 3/5 <br /> <br />8. Click Click- This would have been a5 star song, but Yayo's horrible verse make this a 4 stars. The beat is crazy on this one, and both Hav and P spit well. Great song. <br /> <br />9.Pearly Gates- Featuring 50 Cent. One of 50 Cent best hook ever!! Great beats that tells give u those Church feel. All three spit well, but P's verse got edited because he basically said F--k G-d, and said he will beat Je--s up. So, u won't be able to understand P at all in the song. <br /> <br />10. Capital P, Capital H- Great beat, has a sad feel to it. basically talking about where they at now by signing to G-Unit. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />11. Daydreamin'- Is a classic!! P talked about he way from the bottom and climbing up. Havoc talked about when they're on top. Great song. P actually rapped better than H, hasn't happened in a long time. 5/5 <br /> <br />12. The Infamous- Great beat, very grimy. With 50 Cent doing average on the hook. Both spit well, except for the last verse spit by P, kinda wack. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />13. In Love With The Moula- A very relaxing but good beat, with P and H talking to money as a human being. Pretty good song. 4/5 <br /> <br />14. It's Alright- Featuring Mary J. Blige and 50. A very good song. Different from u normal Mobb depp. Still very good. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />15. Let's Have A Party- Featuring Nate Dog and 50. I find this song good because I'm a Nate Dog fan. hehehe.... Most won't like it that much. The song is also on GRODT soundtrack. 4/5 <br /> <br />16. Outta Control Remix- Another song from another album, The Massacre Special Edition. I really like this song, even after so long I still listen to this song. 5/5 <br /> <br />I guess this is how 50 does it. I mean putting old songs on new album. Take GRODT for example, there were songs from the 8 Mile Soundtrack and Power Of The Dollar. Just wanted to put that in. Anyway, go get this album, 4/5. Pretty good, certainly not the greatest, but classic albums are hard to find these days.
B000EULJLU|4.0|After many listens to this CD, I finally put my finger on what I don't like about it.  I like all the tracks, and I think there are a lot of innovations for Tool here, but I just HATE the mixing job.   <br /> <br />Many people have commented that MJK's vocals are drowned out, and that is true to an extent.  However, I'm surprised that more reviewers haven't pointed out the more obvious point that, with the exception of Vicarious, the drums are WAY too far back in the mix.  Listen to Rosetta Stoned and Right in Two for the best examples.   <br /> <br />I think maybe Danny Carey is playing some really cool stuff on this CD, but I'm not sure because I can't hear it very well over the mud.  This is partly due to a lower overall volume on the drums, but there is also a notable lack of punch.  Carey plays a bass- and tom-heavy style.  Even more so on this album.  Which is why it boggles my mind that the bass drums and toms have almost no punch to them. <br /> <br />On Lateralus, I felt the rhythm; on 10,000 Days, I just hear it.
B000EULJLU|4.0|Here we have the new tool album- 10,000 days.  It has been widely anticipated and theorized and speculated and now scrutinized and criticized.  It is not a bad album as some are stating, but it's not the behemoth that lateralus was as some are claiming as well.  There are two main problems with this album, one being the shallow song selection and the other being the immense build up to its release.  The band couldn't help the latter, but it seems like someone should have addressed the former during the production process.  It's not that what is here is of a particular poor quality, quite the contrary actually.  These songs are rather straight forward but are engrossing at the same time.  They do borrow heavily from previous efforts, but this is not such a bad thing considering those works.  The only problem is that it ends too soon.  This album would've benefitted greatly from the addition of two extra songs- even one might have done it.  It just seems that this album does not come to closure.  It would be fine as a part of a two cd set, but we all know this is not the case.  In all, it just doesn't flow as well as their earlier work.  It's more a straight forward rock record this time and the segues seem a bit contrived, superfluous, and excessive (in the last six 'songs' there are four).  But, what is there is good and at points very good (wings for marie is an incredible track), so sometimes you take what you can get.  Seriously though, if this is it for tool as a band, I don't think there is one amongst us who would be disappointed with the collection they've left us.  I hope it is not, however, and with a perfect circle out of the picture I hope the next release comes sooner than five years.
B000EULJLU|5.0|i would like you, any of you, to name me a band that has been around since 1990. a band thats been in the biz for 16 years, only having out 4 full albums and 2 ep's, and with just this little amount of amoe, having a huge and faithfull and strong loving fan base. all 4 members of this gruop are true artists at what they do. they have been around for 16 years and have never conformed or sold out, and never will. why, because they dont need to. they dont care what the main streem is doing, they dont care what is going on on mtv, they dont care about the sell outs in this world. they are artists, making pure musical art. to me this cd is awesome. it ties in all the forms of styles they did on the last three cds and pulled it all together. it has the deep huanting bass line of undertow, it has that light and space psychadelicness of aenima, and the alienness of lat. but it still holds that strong in your face tool sound that we all look for and love. but they still push them selves to new things also on this cd. i loved undertow, and eanima, i some what loved lat, i thought it was a hit and miss disk for them, but this cd is truely great.
B000002AZ8|4.0|I will state first off that I'm one of those hipster snobs who dismiss Pearl Jam's debut album, \\"Ten,\\" as the whining chart-whoring pseudo-anthemizing overpriced-flannel-flying watered-down-grungifying crowd-surfer-pandering piffle that it is.  If you think that makes me inherently biased (unbalanced?) this review probably won't be \\"helpful\\" to you, and you can move on the other 250 or so reviews.  If you decide to hear me out, I promise to be fair, 'cause even though I may be a hipster snob, I can't deny to myself the sweet rockin' going on in \\"Vitalogy.\\"<br /><br />This album represents one the best meeting points between what was then called \\"underground\\" or indie rock and the \\"classic\\" rock mainstream.  Thus the production quality is raw when it needs to be but polished enough so it doesn't sound sloppy.  Ballads like \\"Better Man\\" and its companion piece \\"Nothingman\\" are clearly influenced by Neil Young and even \\"Nebraska\\"-era Springsteen--they're sincere & emotional but not mushy & sentimental.  \\"Not For You,\\" with it's lyrics about how Eddie Vedder's small table has been invaded by uninvited hordes, is a none-too-subtle complaint about Pearl Jam's status as \\"millions served\\" rock gods and a longing for the more stripped-down aesthetic of punk.  That, of course, is more directly the point of \\"Spin The Black Circle,\\" an old-fashioned punk barnstormer that sounds like a close cousin to SST-era Husker Du.  For Vedder, the joys of vinyl are that they seem \\"warmer\\"--a symbol of \\"tradional values\\" in a rock 'n' roll sense: independence, hard work and homespun crafts are better than the shiny, sterile corporate plastic of compact discs.  Never mind the fact that vinyl was just as much a product of corporate culture; Vedder just feels a pleasing wave of childhood nostalgia cradling a 12\\" record sleeve in his arms and watching a needle bury itself into those mysterious black grooves.<br /><br />Pearl Jam may be in many ways traditionalists who long for the simple joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference.  On the other hand, the Big Corporate Evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience, which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of \\"Vitalogy\\"--it's designed as a salute/satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical/mental/spiritual hygeine.  The album, therefore, aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band's own youth (the Who, Neil Young) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the Power of Rock (Fugazi, Sonic Youth)--hence the  title.<br /><br />The album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me,\\" even though they're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel.  Still, some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like \\"Last Exit\\" and the somewhat proggy sea chanty \\"Tremor Christ\\" (whose title I dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement).  Even though it's uneven, \\"Vitalogy\\" is the work of a self-reliant, even ornery band that's in full control of their ideas--even the bad ones.  It's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like Stone Temple Pilots and Matchbox 20.joys of just playing for the kids without corporate interference.  On the other hand, the Big Corporate Evil has enabled them to reach a huge audience, which in turn helped them finance the elaborate packaging of \\"Vitalogy\\"--it's designed as a salute/satire of a very old hardcover book advising youths on good physical/mental/spiritual hygeine.  The album, therefore, aims to strike a balance between the fondly-remembered rock stars of the band's own youth (the Who, Neil Young) and the more recent indie-punks that re-sparked their interest in the Power of Rock (Fugazi, Sonic Youth)--hence the  title.  <br /> <br />The album is perhaps unnecessarily padded out with unfinished or noveltly tracks like \\"Bugs\\" and \\"Hey Foxymophandlemama That's Me,\\" even though they're intended to give the album a looser and more light-hearted feel.  Still, some of the songs that work the best are gloomy ones like \\"Last Exit\\" and the somewhat proggy sea chanty \\"Tremor Christ\\" (whose title I dearly hope is meant more as metaphor than an endorsement).  Even though it's uneven, \\"Vitalogy\\" is the work of a self-reliant, even ornery band that's in full control of their ideas--even the bad ones.  It's also not their fault that they influenced the likes of true bottom-feeding whores like Stone Temple Pilots and Matchbox 20. <br /> <br />
1592401791|5.0|This is a fascinating story, told from the viewpoint that we haven't gotten before: a sound engineer who helped bring to fruition the ideas in the heads of (mostly) Lennon and McCartney.  When Lennon would want to sound like he was singing \\"from the moon,\\" it was Emerick who had to translate that image to an actual sound when Lennon sang.  The stories of how McCartney's crisp bass sound was achieved during Paperback Writer, to the frantic recording of All You Need Is Love, and many others, satisfied this reader's curiosity about what actually went on in the studio for so  many great recordings.  Obviously Emerick's love of sound and his ability as an early creative rock engineer is evident throughout.  He broke lots of standard rules, and came up with other ideas that are now standard.  His book stands as a welcome addition to what has become a tired genre: Beatles books.  Highly recommended to fans who know the songs all too well.
B00005JOE8|2.0|_V for Vendetta_ is a film adaptation of a graphic novel which pits an anarchist protagonist against a fascist government.  The film raises several interesting philosophical questions but ultimately it is severely damaged by the type of political correctness all too often seen emanating from Hollywood. <br /> <br />First, the movie raises the issue as to whether violence in any form is ever justified.  Obviously the absolute pacifist ethic runs into severe problems when put into practice and in extreme situations in which one must choose between one's own life and the life of a perpetrator.  Even the idea that one should never initiate force (although which may allow for force to be used in defense against force) runs into difficulties when faced with familiar scenarios such as a mother using force to prevent her child from running into traffic.  To this extent, I agree with the movie that force is permissible as a defense against unjust political regimes.  The movie also speaks to the power of symbolism and symbolic actions.  Thus, the destruction of parliament by the (ambiguous) \\"hero\\" V is justified in the movie through the idea that it represents a symbol of a corrupt regime that must be toppled.  Secondly the movie raises the issue as to the unethical nature of state sanctioned scientific experimentation on unwitting individuals.  Both totalitarian states and the United States government have engaged in such experimentation (consider for example, the CIA's experiments in mind control and LSD research).  To this extent, I agree with the basic message. <br /> <br />However, despite my reserved agreement with this movie on these two points, I must note that its message is severely damaged by political correctness.  In today's world it is political correctness that poses the greatest totalitarian threat.  Despite the current regime's claim to be \\"conservative\\", Bush is in fact nothing of the sort.  The government continues to grow and impinge upon the liberties ofAmerican citizens.  (Your property can now be confiscated by the state to generate greater tax revenue according to a recent Supreme Court decision.)  Affirmative action and abortion continue to grow in magnitude.  Illegal immigrants continue to overrun the United States (as well as Europe).  And, valuable resources are being wasted on a senseless war in Iraq.  Whether the Democrats or the Republicans win the next election the results will be the same:  greater state interference in the lives of ordinary Americans and the continued threat of ever greater globalization.  In the movie, Christians and \\"fascists\\" play the role of unambiguous \\"bad guys\\".  The bishop who appears in the movie has an unsavory sexual appetite and is involved in the creation of the death camps.  Homosexuality is glorified and made to appear a victim of a fascist regime.  In today's world, political correctness is by far the stronger force and the various communist regimes which have been propped up through the help of finance capital are never mentioned in the movie.  While the fascists and Nazis murdered approximately 25 million individuals, the communists may have murdered as many as 100 to 200 million.  This difference is staggering.  Certainly government can be a great evil, but by painting all enemies of political correctness as proponents of the state, this movie has severely undermined its own premise.  This is especially ironic given the way in which politically correct forces collude with the state to censor and promote violence against those who disagree.  It is in this respect, that I firmly oppose what this movie stands for, despite its apparent philosophical interest.   <br />
B000EULJLU|5.0|come on people... this is a great album... I know that a lot of you were expecting something similar as Aenima.. dont forget ... the aenima album was something unique.. something that was difficult to repeat an re-create.. i love this album as aenima and lateralus.. it's just different than the others but no less...
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|The movie is superb. 9.9 out of 10, outstanding CGI and top-notch action. The Japanese voice actors are money! Their voices match each character perfectly. I speak Japanese and my only gripe is that I just wish the English translations/subtitles were done better.  <br /> <br />I know that when you dub a movie in a different language you have to try find lines that fit the character's mouth movement(Unlike those old Kung-Fu movies) but, in this day and age... <br />WHO THE *BLEEEEEEEEP* says \\"Dilly-Dally Shilly-Shally\\"?!?!?
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool Fans will not be dissapointed. It has finally arrived! <br /> <br />With Perfect Circle keeping the Tool fans calm until the next album comes out, this is like an addict getting a fix again. The album does has it's filler songs, just like most tool albums, but this also has some strong, forceful and passionate songs that you feel intense about, kind of like Aenima did. Check our Wikipedia and read on what some people feel the songs, as well as the album might be about (10,000 days might be a reference to his mother having a stroke and was wheel chaired for little over 27 years until she died, or almost 10,000 days.)  <br /> <br />As with most Tool songs, they are left up to interpretation, but simplistically, you can hear Maynards questioning tone in \\"look your maker in the eye...... you never lived a lie\\" type question why this was done to you. To me, this seems like some of these songs are more personal than in the past, possibly taking about his mother (his mother's name was Marie, as well as her middle name was Judith, kind of like the song from perfect circle's first album...) <br /> <br />This album needs to be heard all together as it is a total experience and is intense and you get the feeling of it's ups and downs. <br /> <br />Some songs are long and do seem like jam sessions, but if you are a tool fan, then you are used to these longer songs and drawn out guitar riffs and tones. <br /> <br />I have been waiting for new Tool and here it is. You will not be disappointed. Is it weird I can't get enough and want more? <br /> <br />
B000065K2Q|5.0|This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams, his \\"Principessa\\", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.<br /><br />Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.<br /><br />In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.<br /><br />While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying. It is simply a great movie. Bravo!s played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying. It is simply a great movie. Bravo!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|This was a very solid album from Pearl Jam. It ranks right up there with my favorites, \\"Vitalogy\\" and \\"No Code\\".  It is nicely balanced with forceful rockers such as \\"Life Wasted\\", \\"Comatose\\", and \\"Severed Hand, and then the slower, more progressive songs near the conclusion of this album - \\"Gone\\", \\"Come Back\\", and \\"Inside Job\\".  \\"Gone\\", I believe, could ultimately become their best song since the \\"glory days\\" of Vitalogy and Yield.  \\"Come Back\\" is an emotional roller coaster which I long to see in a concert of theirs (if they ever announce a St. Louis date).  The last minute or so of that song is comparable to Yellow Ledbetter when calculating their most emotive and climactic song-endings. \\"Inside Job\\" ends the album in perfect fashion..a bizzare, abstract intro which sounds in the vein of The Who or Radiohead. It is a great song written by Sir Mike McCready. <br /> <br />By the way, Amazon, \\"Pearl Jam\\" is not their first album since 2000...but their first since 2002.  \\"Riot Act\\" was the album that Vedder used as his tool for attacking the Bush administration, and the rest of the world, for the events of 9/11.  This album really doesn't fail to attack Bush...but please, get your facts straight. <br /> <br />
B0000041DF|4.0|This disc has an excellent performance of the Rachmaninov 3rd concerto, but although others have noted that the orchestra sometimes seems to need to catch up to the soloist, she has trouble consistently maintaining her tempo a bit, actually.  <br /> <br />Argerich at her best (Liszt B minor sonata) is sublime, but she has the tendency to sound disinterested as if she's \\"tossing off\\" the notes. This problem is particularly evident in the Tchaikovsky, where the pianist evidently feels so technically monumental that the piece's musicality should be dwarfed by isolated and heavily compressed displays of dispassionate bravura.  <br /> <br />You can do far worse for Rachmaninov's 3rd than this disc. Only Horowitz and Rachmaninov himself (with dreadful cuts) surpass it. (However, the more chordal and superior cadenza played by Ashkenazy with Haitink makes me want to play that version despite the awfully slow tempo and weak feeling during much of the piece.) No one plays the piece with more understanding and edge than Rachmaninov, but there is no whole recording, particularly with the longer cadenza, so the world has been robbed of a musical treasure.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I have not watched TV for a couple of years. It's great. <br />Instead I sniff out the best shows and get the DVD. More costly, but a vastly superiour experience in so many ways, especially when you get a whole season at a time. <br />One of the slam dunks this year for me is Gilmore Girls. <br />To the untrained eye it may look like just another soap opera slash romantic comedy kinda thing. And surely this is in its geenes somewhere, but this is a whole 'nother story. This show is so intelligent and so witty! <br />All the characters are wonderfully real and original, and they all manage to somehow be funny, without being laughable. <br />And the best thing is the *warmth* of the show, the characters, and the stories. This is something which is really, really rare, especially if you want to combine it with a high level of intelligence and perspective. <br />I love these people and this show. I have watched three seasons in a few weeks, and I am already starting to get sad that only a bit less than two seasons are still on my shelf!
B000ETQRCM|5.0|For once in a long while, the masses are correct: Pearl Jam has released their best album since their 1994 release, their 3rd album \\"Vitalogy\\".<br />While spectators are sure to draw the similar response, \\"Well, it's no Ten!\\" they will no doubt enjoy the raw energy and rusty distortion that has been lost since 1993's Vs.<br /><br />This is an album of pure emotion.<br /><br />As a fan of their latest studio album release Riot Act in 2002, the simplicity of harmonies and the epic melodies that danced over guitarist Mike McCready's riff work or bassist Jeff Ament's subtle bass fills were gorgeous. \\"Love Boat Captain\\", albeit a ridiculous title, and \\"Can't Keep\\" became instant favorites, but admittingly this was an even softer side of Pearl Jam and one that had become even lighter than it's previous releases Binaural or Yield.<br /><br />Stripped down and still moving ahead, Pearl Jam is nothing but the band. This is their core, as it's album cover implies featuring half of an avocado with the empty hearth on the back. As an eighth studio release, this should have been their fourth or fifth-it sounds like it too.<br /><br />Back is the punk rock energy that harkens on vintage 1991 grunge in songs \\"Comatose\\", \\"Life Wasted\\", and \\"Severed Hand.\\" \\"World Wide Suicide\\", their first successful single in a long time, brings the more recent political angle of frontman Vedder with his more melancholic rage. When he sings, \\"Medals on a wooden mantle/ Next to a handsome face/ That the president took for granted/ Writing checks that others pay\\", it comes out coughing rather than clean. Vedder's mumbling couldn't come at a better time when the world is so confused and headed toward disaster.<br /><br />Pearl Jam also brings some lighter highlights that will eventually draw as crowd pleasers. The alternative, feel good, \\"Gone\\" chimes in at perfect timing and the \\"Wasted Reprise\\" will have everyone scratching their heads and wondering if this is a concept album. It's uplifting, soulful, and hopeful-can you say that about anything these days?<br /><br />The album closes with the next \\"Yellow Ledbetter\\", \\"Inside Job.\\" Imagine the build up of \\"Freebird\\" without the fantastic guitar solos at the end, but still with the same feeling. Maybe throw in a little Zeppelin into the mix, there's definitely hints of it. The progression of the song is right out of a Nancy Wilson score for a Cameron Crowe film; it just takes your heart and warms it in the microwave.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a concept album. The minimalist cover art might consider this a simple rock band which is maybe what Pearl Jam is trying to convey. They were labeled as grunge when they clearly drew from classic rock and since then they have maintained to stabilize their heritage without ever selling out.<br /><br />They're revolutionary, they're rebellious, and stripped down they're what every rock band sets out to be. Perhaps this album is a concept of that. Whatever it is, it works and this is by far one of the best albums to come out in a long time for the band.<br />Pearl Jam fan or not, this one's for you, this one's for everyone, this one just ROCKS!!!ything these days?

B000EULJLU|1.0|If you feel this is a great effort by Tool, I'm jealous.  I so wanted to love this album, as I have their past 3...    Please attempt to review this CD here, and not the band.  Anyone who bothers to post here probably loves Tool, as I do, however 10,000 DAYS has little progression in the songs, and is made up mostly droning riffs that go nowhere.  None of the epic sound of past releases.    Perhaps the biggest disappointment is the production; maynard's voice is way back in the muddy sound of the guitars, and never wails above when it should.  And where are the great searing guitars(?), mainly boring unimaginative riffing.    A few high points, but way too many boring minutes - all the ambient filler further makes me suspect of the effort.  The silver lining?  Tool will tour and we can hear the rest of their catalog...    Lateralus was Tool's peak, with Aenima only slightly less brilliant.  Now, sadly the curve has started downward... sharply.    Bummed.  Really bummed.
B000EMGAGW|5.0|mobb deep baby that what's up. Great album. Not the same as before but still it's like a breath of fresh air, stop hating hip hop is hip hop. it's not as dark as the other album but only a bit more accecible(not as much as comercial). it's time they get that paper ,M.O.B.BBBBBBBBBBB
B000ETQRCM|4.0|There are no bands in the world who uses a political or social message to make there best music more than Pearl Jam.  Without regurgetating the names of songs liek every other review, i leave you with feelings.  After the Immortal first 3 albums (Ten, Vs, Vitalogy) Pearl jam had an attack of conscience.  No Code was rebirth and like a beginning it was faded and was missign what we had grown to love.  Then came Yield (there most underrated album)  A collection of giants during a time when Korn and Tool and Staind were at the top.  Binaural was another step and Riot Act was a pleasant album.  It all lead to this moment.  Pearl Jam's new album is like a Who operatta.  first 5 songs hit you like a sledgehammer, and the middle brings it down, while the album closes on a 7 minute plus excercise in \\"This is how you do it.\\"  to subpar wannabe bands like Staind and Nickelback.  Pearl Jam is what U2 is, but not as popular or friendly. They are mean, ruthless and Pis*** off. Just the way we like them
B000CCBCAS|5.0|The 1994 movie, \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\", was an international box office hit and the pioneer in the film genre known as the 'Romantic Brit-Com'. This is a genre of usually small budget, comedic films, that are about the romantic lives of good looking, young Brits (usually with a close group of witty, quirky, supportive friends), who must overcome self-doubt and bad timing to make true love happen. A good number of these films star British actor, Hugh Grant and have been written (and sometimes directed) by Richard Curtis (\\"Notting Hill\\" \\"Love Actually,\\" \\"Bridget Jones\\"). Curtis has been so involved in this genre, that he's basically been annoited \\"King of the Romantic Brit-Coms\\". \\"Four Weddings\\" was pretty much the first of these films. This movie mostly takes place at public events, which are of course the \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\" in the title. In the film we meet Charles (Hugh Grant) and his close knit group of quirky, witty, supportive friends. We never find out what they do for a living, what their backgrounds are and only get hints of how they know each other. It's as though we are guests at a wedding meeting these people for the first time. What we do find out is that Charles seems to be a perennial wedding guest/Best-Man. He has great doubts about his troubled romantic life and wonders if he is ever destined to meet, that one special person, who he might actually marry. He also always seems to be putting his foot in his mouth and getting into embarassing comic situations (I love the scene, where he gets stuck at a table filled with all his ex-girlfriends!) At the first wedding he meets a glamorous American named, Carrie (played by a luminous, Andie MacDowell). They meet, flirt, even wind up in bed with each other over the course of the different public occasions. But of course because of self-doubt and bad timing, these characters can never really seem to get it together and declare their true love for each other. It's not hard to figure out how this all ends, but the long and winding road over the course of the four weddings and a funeral are quite funny, sad and interesting for all. This is due to the  very funny and poignant script from Richard Curtis and sure direction from Mike Newell. The cast is top notch. Hugh Grant has a star making performance in the lead role. Other standout performances include actors Simon Callow as the gregarious, full of life, Gareth and John Hannah as Matthew, who just stops the film with an emotion filled eulogy. Kristin Scott Thomas is also very good as Charles' friend Fiona, who secretly pines for him. Finally, mention should be of British Comedian, Rowan Atkinson's short, but drop dead hilarious turn, as a very nervous, new Vicar, who can't seem to get the wedding vows right! (\\"Do you take Lydia Jane Hibbert to be your Awful wedded wife!\\") Originally, this film was released in a pretty primitive bare bones release. It has now been released in a newly minted, 'Deluxe Edition'. The picture is cleaned up and presented in widescreen. I thought the sound in this edition left a lot to be desired. The extras are wonderful. They include a full length commentary track from the filmmakers and a number of short documentaries and featurettes on the making of the film, that prove to be very interesting. But best of all are the deleted scenes (with commentaries), that flesh out the backgrounds of the characters a little more. This film is a wonderful romantic comedy, that leaves you wanting more.

B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie has to be the best horror/revenge film of all time. Sissy Spacek is oh so cool and creepy as Carrie White. Carrie discovers she has a special gift - she can move things with her mind. This film also stars a young Amy Irving, Nancy Allen, P.J. Soles and John Travolta. Piper Laurie received a best supporting actress nomination and boy I am glad she is not my mother, yikes! A horrible practical joke is played on Carrie at her Senoir prom and well Carrie finally gets sweet and long over-due revenge on her classmates and teachers. The ending is so scary, so don't take your eyes away for a split second. Based upon Stephen King's novel of the same name. So don't forget to check out Carrie, she is waiting for you.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Ever since they released \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" on a 2-Disc DVD, I have been wondering when \\"The Little Mermaid\\" would get the same treatment. In my opinion, this is the best animated disney film of all time. I mean, I'm a boy, and it's one of my favorites. It's that good! (I also love \\"Aladdin\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" ) I was ecstatic when I found out they were releasing this as 2-Disc special edition. <br /> <br />This film is filled with beautiful design, an amazing score, an adventerous story, and an absolutley fantastic cast (Who doesn't love Jodi Benson because of this film?) Something that so many animated films are lacking nowadays. <br /> <br />As all the Disney Special Edition DVD's, I'm sure this will have hours of bonus features, and \\"making of\\" featurettes. <br /> <br />The Bonus feature that I am hoping for most (I'm sure a lot of people will agree with me on this) is recording studio footage of Jodi Benson singing \\"Part Of Your World\\", as they did on the Aladdin Special edition with \\"A Whole New World\\" <br /> <br />I'm guessing Disney purposally made this a 2006 release so that it would also be the 15th anniversary of the film. <br /> <br />So while I know it may be hard to wait for this release, lets be happy that Disney is finally giving it's greatest film the treatment it deserves.   <br /> <br />
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Closer is the perfect romantic drama. I was very hesitant in seeing this film, but I am glad I did. Juila Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen and Natalie Portman make a great and complete cast together. A lot of dirty talk but no sex scenes are shown, never shows the middle of relationships, just the beginning of when they meet and the end of their relationships. The ending was a surprise, didn't see that one coming. Closer is a beatiful and complicated film for anyone who has ever been in love with more than one person.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Is 10,000 Days just another one of Tool's work, to me, it is a masterpiece. 10,000 Days is worth every penny in my opinion. It may sound like their older album (Lateralus), but when you sit down and listen to it, it is completely different. Tool kept to their Blood and Heritage when it came to this Album. Anyone who has listen to a Tool album before and enjoyed it should check this one out, and anyone wanting to see what Tool is all about would enjoy it too.
B000001E7T|3.0|PJ Harvey's third release, To Bring you My Love is a middle of the road album for me. It's more produced, which is fine by me, never really cared either way, more romantic, and her voice is at its strongest here but I don't love all the tracks. Standout tracks include: To bring you my love, Come on Billy, Teclo, The Dancer, Down by the Water, and the gorgeous Send his Love to Me. The rest of the tracks are weird and plain. PJ is one skinny woman, does she ever eat? I prefer Dry, Is this Desire?, and Stories from the city.... better. This album is considered her masterpiece and it's good, but it's not great.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|HOSTEL comes to us from Eli Roth, the man who also gave us CABIN FEVER.  Like that film, this one spares little when it comes to some gutwrenching gore.  The movie is almost sadistic in its terrifying view of torture and death and dismemberment.<br /><br />Three backpackers in Amsterdam learn from a native about the available girls in Slovakia who will do ANYTHING for money.  On the train, they meet a weird older man whose identity is secretive but he plays an important role in the movie.  Roth wisely keeps the pace slow in the beginning to give us a chance to familiarize ourselves with the trio, but once the bloodletting starts, it's frenetically suspenseful.<br /><br />Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson give very good performances as the two Americans, and one has to question one's own tolerance in viewing such a decadently \\"sick\\" film.  However, Roth's goal to disturb and terrify are well delineated and if you like gory horror flicks, this is a good one.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|About a Boy starring Hugh Grant is such a sweet little gem. I saw this in the movie theatre with my best friend when it was released back in 2002, and I was surprised by how good Grant's acting was. It really shows his depth and vulnerability for such a serious and understood part. Grant plays a playboy who decides to seduce women who are single parents so he pretends he is a single parent too to date these \\"desperate women.\\" Along the way he forms an unexpected friendship with a strange boy who is looking for a father figure. Toni Collete and Rachel Weisz also star. Grant's character begins to grow-up and realize what is important and that is having people you love close to you and opening yourself up to life's little disasters. A great romantic/friendship comedy, a funny and sensitive film, Highly recommend it.

The people insulting this album were the same people who insulted Radiohead when they made 'OK Computer', the same people who insulted Pink Floyd when they made 'The Wall', the same people who insulted the Beatles when they made 'Sgt Peppers'. <br /> <br />This album is an instant classic... I'm not saying this album will be classic, I'm saying it is, right now. <br /> <br />I can't remember the last time I heard such an original, moving & passionate album <br /> <br />A+
0385339682|2.0|Interesting, richly described, yet like so many of the detailed meals Grisham (it's clearly intervention time, John has become a full blown 'Foodie') has so lavishly described in \\"The Last Juror\\" and \\"The Broker,\\" I was left with heartburn and an uneasy I don't think it was worth the effort feeling. Ultimately, it was satisfying, but it didn't leave me wanting more. <br /> <br />Wonderful subtle humor sprinkled masterfully throughout the work to lighten the weighty themes. In general, the subplots often meandered for page after page, but frequently led nowhere; obviously, designed to tantalize and engage the reader of possible conflicts and situations that never materialize. All too often, Grisham's characters seemed more like <br />Caricatures of polarized moral extremes that can be only be written with the moral certitude of today's lenses, than truly flesh and blood characters -- but thankfully this work is much less preachy than \\"The Street Lawyer.\\" <br /> <br />For me, the ending was a half frozen peach cobbler, sure you can swallow it, but it wasn't what you were expecting from an author of Grishman's talent -- it was like catching the last ten seconds of Paul Harvey's \\"The Rest of the Story\\" without truly having all the details to lead you to the \\"ah-ha moment.\\" <br /> <br />After reading the book, I am beginning understand why AAA used to issue advisories against out of state motorists driving in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Sure there are some great people, some interesting sites, but is the risk worth the reward?
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is like a whole new Tool experience for me. I've been a fan for roughly a decade now and have never felt the jitters like I did when listening to this album. I've heard some people complain, including two of my friends, that the album is too atmospheric and doesn't have enough hard hitting tracks. That is exactly what gives those hard hitting tracks their uniqueness. <br /> <br />Tool has incredible range. The diversity in the sound and atmosphere in these tracks will amaze even the newest of Tool fans.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|With this new CD, Pearl Jam to me, has moved from the last band standing from the so-called grunge era to a band that should be considered amongst the best in the history of rock and roll. The Beatles, the Stones, Led Zeppelin, U2 (I'm forgetting some, but you get the point!)and now....Pearl Jam. Anyone who has seen them live in any tour since 2000 and considers their impact on their fans and considers the body of work this band has done would agree.  As far as \\"Pearl Jam\\" the new CD is concerned, its definitely a strong overall effort....I love how the first 3 songs just absolutley come out and 'rip off your face'....I thought the track ordering was superb to start.  The fourth track, SEVERED HAND is right now my favorite song on it, although the album closer, INSIDE JOB, is blowing me away today after a few additional listens. I love MARKER IN THE SAND's harmonizing and UNEMPLOYABLE is a great rock song, it reminds me of good mid-90s REM.  PARACHUTES is a good ballad with great lyrics. It is one of many songs that make me think the main creativity of this record comes from the fact that these guys really felt they had something to say about the world and themselves right now.  All that being said, the best part of the record, I think, is the last 5 songs...GONE is tremendous, it reminds me a little of Elderly Woman, because of the images it creates and L.WASTED REPRISE is kind of an answer to the anger in track #1, LIFE WASTED, like he was screaming it to convince himself in the first song, but then gratefully lamenting the sentiment of avoiding a 'life wasted' in this version...ARMY RESERVE is surprisingly awesome, the guitars sound different than anything I have heard them do....it, along with SEVERED HAND, will probably become one of those songs they play at every live show. COME BACK is a song that has really, really grown on me, the first time I heard it, I thought \\"this is country!\\"...but it is starting to sound like a Springsteen or Dylan song with McCready's guitar at the end, and INSIDE JOB completely blows me away, the lyrics are as good as I have ever heard from them, and Eddie Vedder's delivery of them is awesome.     Another good sign as to the power of this record, as far as I can see, is that it 'blew me away' right away, whereas Binaural and Riot Act took, many, many listens before I fully appreciated them.  Also,I always like a little blood and gore in album art, haha....but I read this stuff as possibly some anti-war sentiment, that might be digging, but certainly its in there somewhere.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is a work of art.  The guitar riffs are totally different from their past work.  Just because Adam Jones uses the same style he has been using in the past does not mean that the riffs are the \\"same\\" from their old stuff.  The sound of this album is totally different from their older albums, but it still has the \\"tool edge\\" to it.  This album is a mind stimulating work of art and is much more personal sounding than their last albums.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I already know what most fans of Tool are going to say. \\"This album does not live up to Tool\\", \\"What a disappointment\\", \\"not worth the wait\\", blah blah blah. 10,000 days is an amazing album that evolves just like all the other Tool albums have. To compare it to any other Tool release is sacrilage. 10,000 days is a very progressive album, much more progressive than their others. It certainly is not a gem like Lateralus, but we are not comparing. The musicianship in my opinion has evolved to a more progressive nature, but is still very \\"Toolish\\". Heavy riffs and off beat time signatures, atmospheric and ethereal, and very, very creative. The guitar and bass throw out grooves that will keep your head nodding. The lyrics are well written and are, as always very meaningful. Many fnas are critisizing the lyrics which is a huge mistake. Maynard is one of the most intelligent lyricists in music. There is absolutely nothing about this album that disappoints me, it was well worth the wait. It is still classic tool, and I know that may disappoint many fans who were looking for some kind of mind blowing next level tool album. But it is NOT more of the same. It is a truly unique tool experience. It is well worth picking up. Most of the tracks hit well over the seven minute mark, and two of them(10,000 days and Rosetta stoned hit the eleven minute mark). There are three tracks that many view as \\"filler\\", but they are really atmospheric journeys, something that is common to Tool albums. The dynamics are amazing and there is a balance of heavy and soft, which is the true mark of any great band. The lyrics are not as spiritual and eosteric as Lateralus, but they are no less thought provoking and creative. I wouild give five stars to every tool album because they are all amazing in their own right. If you love wonderfully crafted music, prog. metal with insane tribal feel, or are a tool fan, pick this album up. But for the casual listener, it may fall on deaf ears.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I must say that I may have to refine my review several times over the next few years, as was the case for Tool's previous album. Id also like to state, that even though I am a fan of Tool's music, I would not hesitate to give an album from them a negative review if I felt it warranted one. This, fortunately, is not the case with this album. I have to say that I'm not surprised to see how some fans (yes, they can still be fans) feel disappointed thus far in their listening experience. It took MUCH effort for me to listen through the first couple of times and feel like I was getting something significant out of it. I was even worried for a bit. Well, guess what... that worry has completely vanished. The effort i gave to the first few listens has paid off, for all I can do now is enjoy the heck out of this album. I do not doubt that many people will need much more time to let this settle, because what we seem to forget after the release of each new Tool album, is that Tool is a very radical band. They have polarized their fan base with every release they've ever made(Aenima included) if only for a brief period before the dust settled. Sure there are instances in this album that are very reminiscent of past albums, but this IS a different kind of album with a different kind of feeling than we are used to hearing from them. One thing I won't do is judge this against all other Tool albums. That will vary from person to person and is pointless to argue over. As Tool said in one of their interviews, \\"This is as close as we have come to making the album we want to make\\". Tool are their own biggest critics, and if they are happy with what they are releasing, then I'm confident there is something for everyone to gain from it.
