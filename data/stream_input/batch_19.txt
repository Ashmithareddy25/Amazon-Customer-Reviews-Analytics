B009FZHYKU|5|For serious.... watch it. I need sixteen more words... I mean, if you're considering season 3, you've already watched seasons 1 & 2. So you should already know how kick ass this series is.
B00CBRAD2A|3|it was good enough to watch one very late evening when there was nothing on TV.  Lots of action, a little corny but enjoyable.
B00BWRKVVS|5|awesome movie there's nothing to complain about. it is such an entertaining and fresh one to watch with the whole fmaily.
B00TYB95I4|5|Awesome!
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Sycamore row is a page turner that reminds you of early Grisham novels.  Splendid account of someone who dutifully &#34;does the right thing&#34;, knowing it won't be popular.
B00B2GK4KW|5|recommend it to anyone and easy to use and for so many different projects. best price in town from amazon
B004LOMB2Q|5|love evernote it has everything that i need and more. I love that no matter what<br />device i use to make a note or list i can get to it from any other device.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like this game. I just wish I didn't use up the energy so fast. It is challenging and interesting.
B004WR125O|4|Drops the connection once in a while and you have to power reset the receiver to make it work again.
0810983915|5|My son reads all the Wimpy Kid books many times over!
B003WUYRGI|5|What I about this dictionary is you could look up words that you don't know. What I dislike is that you can't type letter that you need .
B00DVKOYBM|5|fun for friends and framily but when I was playing I got scratchers with Amazon points and after that the points aren't there so...<br />still fun game though
B00UENHBAU|4|This game is so scary
B0030BCCAM|5|Great albums from Zombies singer;  great package of first 3 solo albums.  Now how about doing the same for the next batch.  Too bad they're on different labels.
145162445X|3|Maybe it was because I listened to the book on tape or because I have no background in physics or astronomy, but I just didn't understand a lot of the book.  I don't think of myself as a stupid person, but I certainly felt that way for a lot of the book.  Reading it makes me admire the people who have written reviews talking about how accessible the book was.  I was not able to access most of the information in the book.  Hope other readers have more success than I did!
B008GJV4F2|4|Was good - lost continuity about three-quarters of the way through. I like Johnny Depp, but his appearance on-screen coincided with this film losing its momentum.
B004DLPXAO|1|What the heck?<br /><br />It initially states it is available for US and International.<br /><br />Confirms that my mobile is compatible...then it informs me that due to geographical restrictions it cannot process my order!<br /><br />Didn't even deserve the 1 star rating!!!
B006VFLIYK|4|I always enjoy reading Baldacci books, this new character and stories were as usual a good read.  The story line keeps you interested and wanting more.  I immediately bought the next 2 works of the series after reading this one.
B00F8OUBXE|5|grate new album from an old school band this one rocks
B000FGGE68|4|Seriously, I dont know why anyone would think this movie was bad. For me it was a visually stimulating, actioned packed movie with at least an interesting plot line and for god's sake it has Milla. I really like her, I think she has an interesting style and she can actually act. <br /> <br />This movie reminded me very much of Equilibrium (Christian Bale and Taye Diggs). The dystopian society is an obvious corrilation. More than that though it was almost like they were directed by the same person. The imagery and sets and fighting style were so similar. UltraViolet was much more colour infused but on the whole I was having major dejavu through the movie. <br /> <br />So, if you like Equilibrium you will like this movie. If your expecting earth shattering, mind blowing commentaries on the nature of society and the human condition your expecting too much. This movie covers pretty much the same gound as others have before. If you want a cool movie to relax and eat popcorn in front of, this is your bag.

B000001ELD|5|I LOVE this CD!! I love how diff'rent the songs are, I didn't wanna hear another \\"Deuce\\" or another \\"God of Thunder\\" 'cause if that would've been the case then WHY make a solo album?? I have nothing negative to say about this CD. The tracks are:     #1: \\"Radioactive\\" The intro is AWESOME, cool lyrics, Joe Perry of Aerosmith play's lead & it ROCKS! 5 stars.     #2: \\"Burnin' Up with Fever\\" Good song feauring the Disco Queen herself Donna Summer. 3 stars.     #3: \\"See You Tonite\\" Classic song, I play this one seems like everyday :) Gene's vocals and the music are PERFECT!! 5 stars.     #4: \\"Tunnel of Love\\" This song is good NOT great but it's still cool, I do like the Guitar solo. 3 stars.     #5: \\"True Confessions\\" Another great song, I love the lyrics & the Church Choir sounding towards the end. 5 stars.     #6: \\"Livin' in Sin\\" My least favorite song on Gene Simmons, it doesn't do anything for me. 2 stars.     #7: \\"Always Near You/Nowhere to Hide\\" Now this is MY favorite song from this CD. I love everything about this one, the lyrics, the music & Gene's voice at the end is just AWESOME!! 5 stars.     #8: \\"Man of 1,000 Faces\\" Great song and it's Gene's tribute to his hero Lon Chaney. This is another song I never get tired of. 4 stars.     #9: \\"Mr. Make Believe\\" Great song with powerful lyrics. Gene shines on this one. 5 stars.     10: \\"See You in Your Dreams\\" Remake of the same song from \\"Rock and Roll Over\\" but much better. I really like this version better than the original, it's faster and much more FUN! 5 stars.     11: \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" Good way to end this great CD. I like it, 3 stars.     I recommend getting Gene Simmons NOW!!
B005B0QYMM|5|Saw this movie yesterday, and all i gotta say is WOW! Movie was a trip! Nowadays i'm skeptical of horror movies since movies just aren't as scary as they used to be, but i'm glad i gave this a chance! Can't Wait to buy it!!!! =)
0316282243|2|This was a let down and way to shot for what the front cover of the book said it was about. Most of what you learn about the two sisters could have come from a short reading level one book. Because this book give you no back information on the two sisters mother or father and why they are the only alicorns around. Only that they are to be the princess because the two sisters are alicorns. and how come the unicorns where the ones who raises and lowered the sun and moon. The book did not go into the defeat of king sombra or discord or any real heart ship as rules. The dangers the sister face after becoming princess was light. The second half of the book is the biggest problem it turn to twilight and friends journal. The book is about the two sisters remember. It would have been better to have stay with the sisters and read Princess Celestia  last words in the sisters journal with the castle half destroyed and her sister now banished to the moon. As Celestia closed the journal for the last time and seals the room
B00DJFIMW6|2|I had it on a Kindle Fire and it took forever to load and then it would periodically have to load at another level or whatever.  Game was OK but the loading (and I guess memory) issues made it a pain.  I removed it from the Kindle.
B000VBP38C|5|I own the  earlier version. I love each version for special reasons. The more contemporary version, however is more believable. Neither version follow the book exactly but then that is the beauty of interpretation.
0739499963|4|All of Sparks' other books, of which I've read two and this is the third, have been easy reading novels, and this one is no exception.  The quality of the writing, and the content, is like viewing a Norman Rockwell painting.  If you ever are in need of a good book, one that won't disappoint, you can rely on a Nicholas Sparks novel.<br /><br />This book reminded me of Walk Across America, which was a true story by the way.  The book's premise of walking across the country to find a woman you only have a picture (a lucky picture at that)of may be far-fetched (and daunting), but that only adds to the mounting tension and romance.  Logan withholds his lucky snapshot of her, and it's frustrating to Beth, with her woman's intuition, as well as us, the readers.  But that also adds to the building suspense. How clever.<br /><br />Logan seems so lame at times.  At other times, quite ingenius.  So, he reminds me of myself.<br /><br />Near the end it is like a soap opera, with all the characters vying for attention, especially Clayton.  This is not the super romantic love story I was hoping for, and which Sparks is capable of , but it is a very good novel just the same.
B0071XO8RA|4|If you like sci-fi, and feeling absorbed in a story, I don't think you can go wrong with reading Wool Omnibus aka silo series. I am going to leave the rest up to you.
B00003IPFK|5|Great piece of work. Truly demostrates origin of american culture. Really captivating and I feel as is I was in it while watching it. Can't wait for the release of &quot;Return to Lonesom Dove&quot;, &quot;Dead Man's  Walk&quot; and &quot;Streets of Loredo&quot; in DVD form.
B0049VZ222|5|So far season one still seems to be the best of the seasons. Love this show. But is loosing its appeal in the later seasons.
B00005V1Z5|2|This movie is mostly just downright stupid and takes half an hour to get any good. Depending on your sense of humor you may find it hilarious to see Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson strutting and preening like a couple of peacocks and some of the movie actuallly is pretty funny, but I found it mostly embarrassing;I guess it all comes down to personal preference. However there are lots of cameo appearances (everyone from Donald Trump to Madonna) which may maintain your interest.Though if the phrase \\"stupid is as stupid does\\" sums up your personality, then you'll probably love this.
B00KK0PICK|4|This is not a simple method but once it is done you are done and will not have to worry about having a tidy house again
B00000IAU3|5|The Guardian (a major UK newspaper) recently published an article branding owners of this album as clich&eacute;d 'trendy' people.. middle class, mid thirties, trying to stay hip, etc. Why? Probably because this was the biggest selling UK album last year. But even though it's clich&eacute;d, it's still a stunning debut.<br />The songs are fully developed and elegantly penned. From the straight-forward &quot;I'm No Angel&quot; and trip-hoppy &quot;Here With Me&quot; to the dizzyingly beautiful &quot;Hunter,&quot; the songs give a 'serious music' impression, but remain easy to get in to. This album is extremely accessible.<br />A lot of people hype up Dido's vocals. Truth is, she's nothing amazing, it's her songwriting and production values that really shine. She has a pleasant voice, but it doesn't stand out from the crowd.. but who cares? The songs do.<br />For the guys out there, Dido is also an extremely good looking young woman, so she covers the eye-candy bases too meaning it's not too embarassing to admit you have her album.<br />Musically, she covers the bases set by Sarah McLachlan, Alanis Morissette and Sade, without sounding much like any of them. In conclusion, this isn't an innovative album, nor is it exciting, but the songs are excellent, the vocals are sound, and the instrumentation is interesting. What more can you ask for?
B000QGAU4E|4|Exciting movie, but not particularly profound.
B00E8B1358|4|Well it was kind of a shocker - dunno what is next...<br /><br />But nonetheless a movie made for what it was made for - entertainment worth @ A+.<br />No doubt worth watching and even purchasing.<br /><br />Again, if you have not seen it yet (probably not a GIJoe fan if that is the case) then be prepared to say &#34;...what the flip!!!!&#34;<br /><br />But good movie to watch, maybe more money went into the casting than needed and therefore lack of script and story value.<br /><br />But you can GO with JOE
B005ZOBNOI|5|A wonderful book and storyline. \\"Okay.....Okay....Okay is our always.....\\" Be prepared to wipe tears from your eyes. Very touching. I'm sure the movie will not do this book justice...This is a MUST READ!!

B00VFTCGES|3|Enjoyed the movie. Be prepared for a very long movie.
B000OVLBFS|5|Tom Selleck plays Jesse Stone again in Night Passage. He is still the hard drinking ex-LA detective and police chief in Paradise, Massachusetts a quite water front small town.  He finds a money laundering and murder that leads him to some of the town's leading citizens as suspects for these crimes. His quiet but effect techniques do not make him the most popular chief of police with the town council as he continues to drink and spiral downward into depression. The film has an element of suspense that keeps the audience guessing as he puts the pieces of his puzzle together in solving this crime. Our family loved this film as they have the rest of the series.  We look forward to more Jesse Stone stories in the future, as Tom Selleck looks great in this role of the rough and ready police chief and plays the character to perfection.

I plan to implement his recommendations not only at personal level but also for majority of my patients who are inflicted with multiple diseases as mentioned in the book. The biggest hurdle at present would be to convince the people to  make a change. It would be great if this book could be made available to all the physicians in the country with the hope to impact the health of millions of patients.<br /><br />Mohammad Riaz, MD

B001GCUO16|4|Here is what many fans including myself had been waiting for the chance to find out the back story of Logan a.k.a Wolverine. So many questions were left open in the first three Xmen movies about Wolverine and how he became what he was. And since he is suffering from amnesia and could remember nothing about his past but painful flashbacks, most fans (who again like me) weren't avid followers of the comics had many more questions about his character than we had answers regarding his very elusive past. This movie will fill in pretty much all of the blanks for you. We follow Logan from being a very young boy through adulthood and all the through the circumstances that lead to him becomine involved with the Weapon X program and how he became the Wolverine with that seemingly indestructible Adamantium skeleton.<br /><br />We also get to see several of the relationships that majorly shape his life throughout the movie. Victor a.k.a Sabertooth...and just how close they were only to become bitter enemys later in life...as well as several other characters that we come to know better in later movies too (Cyclops, Emma Frost, Gambit, and Charles Xavier all make an appearance).<br /><br /> I won't go into a lot of detail about what happens, because in doing so I would ruin parts of the movie for those that haven't gotten to see this one yet. But I personally loved this movie. In fact it just might be my favorite Xmen movie so far. I know that for some reason a lot of Xmen fans had very negative reviews for this one and I personally can't see one reason why. The story to me was very well written, the acting by all actors was superb, and it laid the very firm ground work for why Wolverine is the way he is. Maybe it had something to do with the comic books and the way the backstory was done in them I don't know. Although I am an Xmen fan I hasten to say that I am a fan of the movies and the Xmen cartoon that came on back in the 80's. I am not nor have I ever been a fan of the comics themselves, so maybe some of the rabid comic fans took acception to the movie conficting with things in the comics. I know some do that no matter what the movie so maybe that was the reason why some hated this one. That is the only thing I can think of why some didn't like the film.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman was simply outstanding, and yes he is outrageously handsome in this one ladies. He to me IS Wolverine now. He has become the complete embodiment of the character and I can't imagine another actor playing him at this point. He is perfect in the action sequences, tender in the scenes with Kayla, and perfect as the pained anti-hero we have all come to love. Don't think of this as some corny comic book flick it's much deeper than that. It's a very good action packed movie that the whole family from pre-teens and up will enjoy.<br /><br />http://romanceps.blogspot.com/2014/03/movie-review-xmen-origins-wolverine.htmls themselves, so maybe some of the rabid comic fans took acception to the movie conficting with things in the comics.

B00DJFIMW6|4|This game only enhances my love for the movie Despicable Me. This game makes me want to keep trying and trying to get a higher score. The only problem is the challenges that want you to use the Gru coins. I'm sorry but I'm not going to pay for more of those. Other than that great game!
1415926697|5|Elizabeth suffered a massive wave of depression after a painful divorce.  She took a year-long trip afterwards.  This book is her memoir of that trip.  In her words it turned out to be a \\"mega, jumbo, international, best-seller.\\"  I agree with popular opinion.  I loved it.  I primarily read romance novels.  So for romance readers like me, I believe you will like this.  It's inspirational, uplifting, surprising, delighting, enjoyable, and yes has a happy ending.  Her choice of words delights me.  There is plenty written by other reviewers, so I don't need to go into more.  But I want to encourage readers to get the audio version instead of reading the book.  The author is the narrator, and she has an enjoyable speaking voice.  I felt like I was sitting in a cafe, having a cup of coffee with Elizabeth as she talked to me of her thoughts and travels.  And, hearing her speak Italian phrases and mimicking the speech of Indian and Balinese people adds something important that I think you would miss if just reading the book.<br /><br />The movie is coming out in August 2010 starring Julia Roberts.  I'm eager to see it primarily to see all the locations Elizabeth visited.  I hope the movie is true to the book by showing the exact places.<br /><br />Genre: memoirs, nonfiction healing travel spirituality romance.
B004UPANGM|3|I wanted to see what this movie was all about prior to seeing the updated version. What a difference and amazing how far the movie world has come.
B001CDZZI6|5|It's spot on!! An eye opener for me. Very interesting to read and gives you a detailed description of your strengths as well as on how you can apply that in day to day living.
B00A3NQNUU|5|This is one of the best games I've ever played,and plus it's free! FANTASTIC graphics!!
B00AYR2FOI|4|Great music but very mellow and slow. Still, Boz Scaggs does everything so well can't fault him. Great listening music.
0446605409|5|This is my first book by Nelson DeMille and what a pleasant surprise it was. This is one of the best examples of great mistery novels. It has everything: great suspense, good character development, main character NYC detective John Corey is very likable and could be easily identified with, a lot of humor, etc. It's also quite informative on the some subjects that are related to the plot. If anything, I was a little surprised to read some other reviews saying that the first part of the book was a little boring and the last two pages is where the most action takes place. I actually found first part to be the most suspenful and thought that whole sea adventures didn't need to be covered in so many pages. Still, great mistery novel that is highly recommended to all mistery fans. I am looking forward to other books by this writer.
B00005Q4CS|5|For most people who have ever considered trying harder drugs, such as speed or heroin, this movie will probably change their minds completely. Not that the movie is simply an anti-drug statement. It's so much more than that. Requiem For A Dream is an outstanding film, with interesting characters and an intricate, if not ultimately desolate, storyline. That being said, it is not something to watch with your family, or even some of your friends. It's disturbing, depressing, and will probably give you nightmares.     The film-making is unique, especially in the scenes where the characters are using. You never see any of the characters actually injecting, I think, but the series of shots shown instead are just as intimate. I found it fascinating. The acting is great; I was really surprised with Jared Leto's performance. A couple years back, I was really into 30S2M. Eventually I noticed he had small parts in both Fight Club and American Psycho (two of my favorite films), but neither of the performances really displays his talent like Requiem For A Dream. Throughout the film, you see his life slowly deteriorate, and it's painful to watch. In fact, this whole movie is painful to watch.     The emotions this movie brought out in me are hard to describe. I was really moved by this film, it was unlike anything I've ever seen before. If you've ever suffered with an addiction, I think this film will appeal to you. It describes the misery of so many people around the world, and it does so with style. The ending is horrific, and if you don't lay awake after it, I worry about your sanity. Requiem For A Dream will undoubtably haunt me forever.    Fortunately, in my opinion, those kind of films are the best. If you haven't seen it, I dare you. Prepare to be shocked.
B00CF34B2I|1|So I got this game thinking it would be fun and stuff but no it was a stressful rollercoaster I seriously just barely got it off of my Kindle Fire. So I tried to get it three times and then it takes 2 hours to install and download. Then it takes up half of the storage space on your Kindle Fire if it's empty. If you want the full version it's 10 flippen rollers  to buy. This is just my opinion but if you want it don't say I didn't warn you this is a terrible game and is the biggest rip off
B005ZOBNOI|5|that one words sums it up, this was a great read!<br />a twist I didn't see coming, quite the tear jerker at some points.
B00G5G7K7O|5|I agree with those who consider it the best Disney musical film since the Lion King. All of the songs are enjoyable and a few are memorable.
B00005JKNF|5|Puzzled by the dead-split comments on this film? Don't be: it's a *subtle* movie, and Hollywood has just not geared modern audiences for subtlety. No car chases, automatic weapons, or technicolor explosions here.<BR>Yes, it's true that the heavy English accents can be daunting. But attention and thought are rewarded by a rich, coherent story of the sort most moviemakers don't bother with any more. And if you are willing to actually THINK a bit about this movie, there are ongoing worlds of comment on class, wealth, human character, etc. Repeated viewing actually yields more subtleties. The DVD transfers the very good sound and camera work of the film to the small screen about as well as possible.<BR>Gosford Park is a worthwhile addition to the astonishing body of Altman's life's work, and highly recommended to anyone starved of content by the flood of Corporate Mega Blockbusters. <BR>For everybody else, hey, there's always a new Vin Diesel flick coming out...
B00FI7XBIS|5|V for Vampire is very fun. It has a lot of levels.<br />The levels are very hard and long.  An overall entertaining game.

B004FGMDOQ|5|I'm not going to tell the story as some reviewers did. That would ruin the story. I had no idea what I was getting into and that's the best way to fall into this story. Only to say that it's about a 16 year old boy who wanted to know more about his grandfather's past. Who doesn't? Except that his gave him instructions with his dying breath to find it. I loved it and couldn't stop reading and it takes you from Florida to the UK. I wish there were more pages. I like big books and this isn't, that's why I have a Kindle Fire, so I'm not carrying around a lot of extra weight. I only had trouble reading 1 letter. The photos did give it more of a sense of \\"reality\\" in a totally strange world for this teenage boy. While some people compared it to superhero movies..I thought of Doctor Who.

B00008PW2D|3|When a show is as good as Sex And The City had been for four seasons, it's bound to take a fall. And when a show is as popular as Sex And The City is, everyone's bound to notice. That's what happened with Sex And The City's Fifth \\"Bonus\\" Season. The bonus word thrown around in an attempt to distract us from realizing that the whole season (only 8 episodes, but thank God cause who could have put up with more?) was spent reaching. The well had officially run dry. What's really a shame is that the whole season wasn't so terrible, but because SATC fans are so used to perfection, it seemed like a train wreck. <br />The most obvious problem was the stories. SATC, a TV show known for diving into the problems of four single 30 something New York ladies, quickly became a story about four bitter aging women who's fears had come true. Since the show's beginning they had feared becoming old, tired maids and that's exactly what happened. <br />On the season's premiere episode, Anchors Away, the ladies all but throw Miranda in a Taxicab so she and her baby can go home and they can go live it up at a party with the sailors. All of this would have been fine when the show first began, but later there's a shot of Carrie, Samantha and Charlotte walking to the party and instead of it being sexy, it was so sad. I actually felt embarrassed for them. The show has always been mostly true to life, but if three single worn out looking women pushing well into their 40s went to a party looking like they did with a bunch of 20 something guys, they'd get laughed at.<br />Miranda and Carrie's nostalgia quickly echoed ours as the viewer began to realize this was a preview of things to come. Out of all 8 episodes, I only enjoyed 2 of them and I was only really happy with 2 of the characters. <br />Carrie being sent to work for Vogue was a terrible idea. The fifth season saw her become more self centered than usual. I haven't always agreed with Carrie's choices, but I've respected them up until thisseason. Her selfishness pushed past its final limits and answered to pretty much everyone but her as to why she's still single. As for less important things, her hair looked God-awful. Her face was way too pale this season and the way they tried to hide Sarah Jessica Parker's pregnancy was just absurd. From everything to hideous dresses to giant magazines, it was quite noticeable and would have been more believable had she just \\"gained weight\\" from the stress of her book. <br />Samantha was a terrible disappointment this season. As someone who's deliciously decedent and so much fun to watch, I can see why the writers wanted to make her more human and see her fall in love, but what they did to Samantha's character was unforgivable. First she's in love, then she's afraid, then she's insecure, then she gets a broken heart, then she forgives Richard, then she's insecure again until finally she turns psycho and accuses Richard of cheating again when he wasn't. Later in the season she practically tries to kill two of Richard's houseguests when they won't leave because she's throwing a party in his house which she wasn't even given permission to do. <br />Charlotte stayed most true to herself than all of the other characters. She remained to be the \\"eternal optimist\\" and really kept the show alive for me. Watching Charlotte be herself amongst a group of people who weren't being themselves gave me a little sliver of hope. I enjoyed watching her fall in love with the hairy lawyer who's so not her type and I enjoyed watching her not give up on love. Kristen Davis was incredible this year and deserved a nomination, which she has yet to receive.<br />Miranda also made me proud acting like the only adult on the show. She had a baby, her and Steve tried their best to get their lives together and raise Brady as best as they could. Miranda often felt left out by her friends, she was. Miranda often had tough choices to make concerning her baby, moms always do. I liked watching Miranda struggle with this as it brought the only realism to the show.<br />As for the episodes, most of them were lacking. In one episode, Carrie freaks because she runs into Aiden's ex and she makes a face at her and Carrie realizes Aiden must have told her some horrible things about her. Oh no! Could she really have hurt him so bad, she later asks Steve, Aiden's best friend. Hello! She dumped him twice and cheated on him. How Carrie can be THIS selfish and THIS dumb is beyond me.<br />Also in that episode, Heather Graham shows up for no reason which becomes a theme in this season - things happening for no reason. Miranda asks Carrie to be her baby's Godmother instead of Charlotte. Carrie decides out of the blue in one episode, she needs to get laid. So she returns to Mr. Big. Why he sleeps with her after she made fun of him in her book makes no sense and gives guys like me a bad name. <br />This season was a big let down for me. Not only did it make no sense, but it was a slap in the face to those who adore the show. Uninteresting stories, new uninteresting characters (one who's name is Burger, don't ask) and favorite characters changing into paper thin shadows of their former selves made this a very forgettable season of Sex And The City. <br />The only enjoyable episodes were Unoriginal Sin, an episode where Miranda gets Brady christened and I Love A Charade, the season finale where Charlotte falls in love and a little Zsa Zsa Zsu is put back into the show.
B002ZG99QS|2|Tron legacy was a very hyped movie. my expectations were soooo high, and when i finally saw it, it ended being just a good B movie/action flick. i was turned off by so many things, like: the story wasnt exciting or engaging and the characters felt a bit dull (maybe because the not so good dialogue/script). after seeing the movie the first time i really disliked it, but when i saw it the second time i knew what to expect. i liked it the second time around, it was a movie with amazing visuals. dont mistake it for a masterpiece (not even close), its simply a visually fun  movie. surprisingly the characters grew on me.  buy it on bluray for stunning visuals. I have to admit though, the movie lacks thrill and interest half way into the movie. It's not a movie i would be willing to buy or watch frequently.
B008OOYALE|4|Love this game! Just wish it would be able to update like it does on my iPhone. I have things on my iPhone version that this game doesn't even offer. Only thing they should do is update it like the iPhone version.
B003YWUTKM|5|You know...  I have read some of the reviews and... I have to say, it is somewhat disheartening to hear others say things like... If you are expecting a solo Gilmore... Or... it just sounds like The Orb...  That is because it is The Orb featuring David Gilmore. And furthermore, to those who say it is the end result of a jam session... And the problem is? If you have ever just wanted to sit back and listen to Gilmore jam... this is your chance.  David Gilmore is a jam guitarist. In fact that is where he is at his best! This CD is a well needed fusion between two Greats. The Orb is awesome! Gilmore hands down is the ultimate emotive guitarist.   These two together have created something that was long in coming. If you loved  Pink Floyd's Echoes, or Shine on, and ANYTHING by the Orb, I urge you to buy this CD. It is worth it, and I could only dream to create works of the caliber of these fine gentleman.

B0037AGASG|5|This cd was for my daughter but I must say that after hearing it continuously for a week at a time (teenagers! ) This young man has a great deal of true raw talent!  I will confess that I enjoy his music - but please dont tell my kids that! He isn't just a teenage heart throb overnight sensation no talent young man. He writes his own lyrics and has a truly beautiful and unique voice. Love that tinge of Canadian accent!  You're kids will love it, and secretly you will as well ;)

0156030209|5|This book is simply incredible.  It felt like I was reading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" all over again.  Martel weaves a beautiful tale that asks the reader to suspend disbelief for a while and delivers a classic in taking that risk.  This book stays with the reader long after it is placed down.
B00BB8UJKG|5|A great movie!
B000006NPY|2|While this is not a bad album, it is taking a step away from what is good and taken a step closer to what we true music lovers hate. In this outting, Corgan has done his part to put his knife in the back of the dying art  known as grunge rock. While &quot;Perfect&quot; is undoubtably a catchy  song, it (like all of the songs on this album) is destined to be buried in  the junk pile known as pop music. The music industry today is about selling  out to a bunch of people who will all buy your CD and will listen to it for  about two weeks and then trash it. This is not what Smashing Pumpkins used  to be about and I don't believe that this is how Corgan truely feels. Ifyou  want to hear some classic Pumpkins, get Siamese Dream (ranks right up there  with Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; and Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;).  Don't participate in the mass murder of true music by buy trashy pop albums  that devalue and degrade our music culture. I give this album a  &quot;2&quot; only because &quot;Perfect&quot; is a decent song.

B008673ZAQ|3|I liked the book. However, there were times that I felt the book became redundant with some of the story line. I started to get bored with the story line until the last few chapters. But, I will still be buying and reading the third book in the series.
B005LJITS0|1|I would give it zero stars if I could.  I like action movies, superhero movies, and almost every actor involved with this film.  But this movie was worse than Spawn.  Boring, ridiculous and tedious all at the same time.  Sad that so many talented people wasted their time making this film.  I would not recommend you waste any time watching it.
B000W91RUG|5|This is the first season of the Funniest Show on Television. My family and I can watch it over and over again and we still end up laughing so hard we cry every time...in fact, knowing what's coming up makes it even funnier. We are constantly quoting from this show...it's pure genious.  I wish they would have included a blooper reel, although the jacket says it includes a \\"behind the scenes look\\". I haven't watched this, yet, so I couldn't say if this is a blooper reel or not.  If you've never seen the show, buy this set, sit down, and prepare to laugh outloud and hard!

B00009NHC5|5|Wait Until Dark is hands down one of my very favorite thrillers of all time, while not a horror movie the final act plays out in horror movie fashion and it's quite obvious many horror filmmakers were inspired by it. If I were to rate my favorite horror movies Wait Until Dark would appear even if not a true horror movie. This is one of those movies that once the suspense and tension kicks in it never let's up. Wait Until Dark has this great eerie and dreadful feeling and the fact almost the whole movie is set in a house it can possibly get boring due to that. One primary setting is very tough, and the makers of Wait Until Dark pull it off to near perfection.<br /><br />The screenplay written by Robert & Jane-Howard Carrington was excellent one of the finest screenplays for any suspense/thriller. They take their time and develop the character of Susy Hendrix played by Audrey Hepburn. The rest of the characters are excellent as well. All the characters are develop well you get a feel of what they are like, but a little more could have been done with a couple. The one complaint I normally hear is why the villains didn't just rip the place a part for the doll. Granted that would possibly make more sense since Susy is blind not much she could do.<br /><br />But where would the fun be in that? Either they find the doll or they don't find the doll. When dealing with movies like this you must suspend your disbelief some what. Actually that goes for almost any movie. If everyone did what they are supposed to it wouldn't nearly be as much fun. Bottom line is certain things happen and while they might lack some logic or happen to easy it doesn't hurt the movie one bit. When dealing with this type of flick you have to overlook certain things.<br /><br />The only other complaint is why Roat played brilliantly by Alan Arkin always come back to the house in a disguise; since Susy is blind she wouldn't be able to tell what he looked like. Well common sense; he does that so nobody in the neighborhood would recognize him. I always thought it was fairly obvious why he would do that. The mental torture Susy is put through was well done and you can really feel for her. Wait Until Dark does move slightly slow, but not in a bad way. The writers take their time and develop the characters mostly Susy, so by the time the plot starts to go full force we have come to know Susy and that makes everything the more traumatic.<br /><br />Director Terence Young does an amazing job; his scenes are all well paced and always moves the movie forward either in plot or character and once the suspense really starts to kick in it's actually one of the best I have ever seen. Several times while watching the movie I was on the edge of my seat. Even on multiple viewings it still holds up well. The final act is quite scary and horrific, which I'll touch upon later. This is very Hitchcock like, but dare I say better? The suspense is some of the best you'll find and Terence Young delivers big time. He had a clear vision and it works brilliantly.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn is one of my very favorite actresses; while I have seen a whole lot of her work I have seen enough to like her. Even before I saw any of her movies I was a fan. She was so beautiful and this charisma and charm that she has draws you to her and that's what makes what Susy goes through even worse. Seeing poor Audrey Hepburn terrorized makes it even more suspenseful. Audrey Hepburn was actually nominated for an Oscar for this movie. How she didn't win is beyond me. Her performance rates as one of my all time favorites.<br /><br />The cast was top notch; Jack Weston as Sgt. Carlino and Richard Crenna as Mike Talman both provide excellent performances. I'm a big fan of both actors and they were a joy to watch. Hepburn may be the star, but Alan Arkin is simply amazing. He's calm and cool, but a total psychopath and plays 3 roles and it's quite clear he was having a blast doing it. Some people complain about Sam Hendrix played by Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. saying that he was too cold. I totally disagree; after an accident left her blind, all Sam is doing is trying to teach her how to be dependent. Instead of doing everything for her he wants her to learn. And by him doing that in the end that is what saved Susy's life by not depending on other people to take care of her despite being blind.<br /><br />What I love so much about this movie is Susy who hasn't been blind very long and has to adjust to a new life. The villains think it's gonna be an easy task, but what she lacks in sight she makes up for in hearing and she's able to realize something isn't right. My only slight complaint is she's too trusting of Mike. Some people are very trusting and at first she has no reason to suspect him, but when she realizes something isn't quite right with Roat and Carlino she really should have suspected Mike, but it's an easy flaw to overlook.<br /><br />The final act to this movie is actually quite terrifying, like I said this isn't a horror movie, but does have horror movie elements or what would later be horror movie elements. It comes down to Roat and Susy and the showdown is quite chilling. By this time we have come too really like Susy and the fact it's Audrey Hepburn I suppose even if she wasn't developed we would still feel for her. What I love is how she takes out all the lights and its total darkness. Roat is now in a sense blind as are we the viewer. The final act Susy is pretty much the final girl, which horror movie fans should know that term.<br /><br />The showdown is downright chilling even though I already knew the outcome I was still on the edge of my seat. I kept moving around I couldn't sit still due to the suspense. Wait Until Dark also features one of the greatest jump scenes ever. I don't care how many horror movies or thrillers you have seen; even the most hardcore of fans are bound to jump. I won't give it away, but when it happens you'll know it. Even having seen the movie before I always jump at that, the first time I saw it I nearly had a heart attack. You know it's coming, but it still gets you.<br /><br />In all the reviews I have read I very rarely hear anyone mention the score by Henry Mancini; the score is one of my favorites actually and really adds to the suspense and tension and in many ways helps elevate the movie to an even higher rate of suspense. The score is very chilling.<br /><br />Wait Until Dark is one of the all time great chillers and still holds up well. Sure there might be a silly moment or two, but this movie is downright creepy and very suspenseful. It starts off a bit slow, but never boring as the characters are developed and once Wait Until Dark forges ahead the suspense never lacks and builds to a very chilling finale. This is a must see for fans of suspense/thrillers and horror flicks. Wait Until Dark truly is one of a kind. This movie has everything going for it, an excellent score, script and directing and some truly great actors.<br /><br />Trivia time; Julie Herrod who played Gloria also portrayed the character in the stage play prior to the film.t he was too cold. I totally disagree; after an accident left her blind, all Sam is doing is trying to teach her how to be dependent. Instead of doing everything for her he wants her to learn. And by him doing that in the end that is what saved Susy's life by not depending on other people to take care of her despite being blind.

6305313687|2|This movie has its heart in the right place, I suppose. A man struggles with his ignorant past, grows up,  and abandons his miserable lifestyle of hatred and violence. But this film's naivete and its imbecilic portrayal of prison life just cannot be excused. People go into prisons with the casual attitudes of ordinary citizens.  Then they experience the strict racial divisions in prison.  When released, they are racists for life. It never works the other way around. This film is a honkey fairy-tale for doofus liberals who think they're walking on the edgy side. The only controversy here is how woefully unrealistic this film is.
B009CGCQPU|5|I LOVE THIS MOVIE,BUT IT TOOK ME FIVE DAYS TO DOWN LODE MY KINDLE FIRE HD KEEP STOPPING AND TELLING ME THAT NEEDED TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR IT,SO I  DELETTED SOME APPS AND I STILL I DIDN'T SEE THE ENDDING.

B0002WZTOI|5|Not only is this movie awesome, but how fast it came was almost better! I bought it for my fiance's birthday and was worried about it arriving, but it came several days in advance! It was very nice and new, all shrink wrapped and it is a terrific copy. I was worried it might be not be quality but it was great. I recommend this seller!

B003YNFYD8|5|In my opinion there is only one reason to own this release.  That is for the epic A Day In The Life which is unhampered here by the applause that runs off the end of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise) and into the beginning of this tune.  You get to hear it clean.  Does it justify forking over the dough to buy an entire album?  That's for the consumer to decide.  It is a good collection.

B00AWQEKIK|5|For anyone growing up in the sixties, the harmony of Crosby, Stills and Nash was an integral part of the music scene.  &#34;Carry On&#34; highlights the wonderful voice and talent of Stephen Stills.  There are the familiar hits we have all heard plus never before pieces that give listeners a whole new view of Stills. It is simply a delight which one could (and does) listen to repeatedly.  Thank you for the experience.
B00AB7HESI|4|For some reason, in Super Scribblenauts, I really enjoyed having the ability to jump whenever you want. In this, it's kinda like playing both Scribblenauts AND Super Scribblenauts, but without being able to jump when you wish to. But the music IS better.

052594527X|5|The story is beautiful, narration poignant, plot moving, characters memorable, style artistic, imagery quiet &amp; nostalgic...  This little novel is a masterpiece, just like Vermeer's actual painting of the girl  with an earring. Chevalier deftly mingles history and fiction to produce  something exquisitely charming. I couldn't help but constantly glance at  the painting of &quot;Griet&quot; on the jacket as I devoured the book.   This is a must-read.
B00LZWV8JO|4|Very interesting book. I have been a fan of Mr. Stephenson for a while now, he never lets me down. This book is a bit more dense than others of his I have read, lot's of very fascinating science in here. I found myself taking breaks and then going back over things sometimes to be sure I was getting everything. The story is good and thought provoking in a number of ways. I will be looking forward to reading this again someday - it's going in my collections of favorites.

B00005AR3G|5|I love watching this movie for the wit and humor. Kronk is just the most valuable sidekick. It is a cut above other Disney movies because it lacks a pyscho villian, death, and other thematic elements. This is just a funny film for the entire family!

6302000823|5|paradiso must rate alongside jean de florette as one of the best foreign films of all time ( but watch the subtitled not the dubbed version). For acting and soundtrack as well as visual treats the film can only be  described in superlatives. Be warned however that after watching the  as-released version for so long the extra footage of the directors cut can  be disturbing especially the end - do we really need to know? Enjoy it  whatever your cinematic tastes.
B000OCXF0Q|2|Avril is one of my all time favorites... but in this album she shows she has grown up and run out of juice.... the songs lack spark and inspiration and the arrangements are too \\"normal\\" to attract any particular interest.  I predict she'll fade out from this point on....
B001F2W4Y2|4|My 12 year old son asked for this for his birthday and hasn't stopped listening to it.... and so, neither have I !  It's a great rock n' roll album..

6305076995|5|I remember going to see this concert in the theater when I was merely 12 years old. I was so captivated by the tight orchestration that the band provided, I went to see it almost on a daily basis (summer time) while it played. From there I collected what Yes had recorded by that time (Close to the Edge, Time and a Word etc..). A very tough sell to friends at that time as they were not a \\"radio based\\" group, but Yes certainly proved that there was much more to rock than what was being portrayed on the radio which offered such limited access due to music length.<br />I have to say that the line-up for this concert is what I truly consider to be Yes. Rick Wakeman simply cannot be touched and the same holds true for Steve Howe and Alan White. Which on a side note, Alan did join the group while the tour was on the road and he filled in without flaw.<br />I had the pleasure of seeing Yes in 1979 (the round stage) and again in 1984. By far the most compelling show was the '79 show which opened with Siberian Katru and went straight into Heart of the Sunrise (same as the CD version of this tour). Granted that there is not mega effects (like say Pink Floyd's Pulse), but we have to remember that this was the early 70's.<br />For true Yes fans, this is the DVD to own. Trust me on this. If you like Yes, you will truly appreciate this DVD.

B005U9QJY2|5|The Dark Crystal is just J. Henson showing off his puppeteer skills. Sure there's some beautiful imagery and definitive archetypes, but the stiff mouths and sometimes unsettling imagery is probably going to scare some small children.
B00HVOGHO6|3|I thought that the cast of the movie was fantastic! They all did an outstanding job. The story line was good but I felt it could have had a little more suspense. Overall I would recommend the movie.

B009AY04A8|4|It's not the best out there, but it will keep you busy as it has lots of hidden objects tasks/screens to resolve. A little repetitive and a bit too much dialogue.

0440237688|5|I originally read this for a university class on teaching reading to elementary aged students. I have passed it around to my whole family and everyone has loved it, from young to senior citizen.
B00ILHW6AG|5|Read and enjoy...shockingly good<br /><br />But read it away from electricity.<br />More great characters by the great one.<br />You will not be disappointed.
B009NFHF0Q|2|So glad this was a \\"short novel\\", as this book did not do it for me. I look over all the 5*, 4* and 3* and thought, \\"What did I miss?\\".  I wonder if you did not know the author and love him, would you still rate this so highly?  When you read reviews of people you respect that loved it, such disappointment, and you question yourself.  I trudged painfully through this short novel, missing what others loved, looking for it along the way.
B00CHCUR9I|4|Just too short<br />It was okay but in all it was a book that you would read once every year
1480135232|3|This book is enjoyable to read after having read Little Women. But it is a difficult cadence and takes a while to understand the way they spoke at the time.  You have to concentrate a little harder and have a dictionery close by.
B000AP04EW|5|this movie is freakin fantastic! i thought it was a kick- a** movie. i dont know why people didnt get the plot. i got it, dont take it so damn seriously. chemistry is totally out there between the two couples. acton scenes and stunts were nicely done. pick up the dvd when it comes out. wont be desapointed! <br /> <br />typed by her daughter colette &lt;----------- xD
B00BD99JMW|4|You have to respect an author who has the guts to do what an did at the end. People will be unhappy no matter what. I just finished and I'm still crying. But I think it was great. So good. I give it a 4 because I think it switched too often between Tris and Tobias's POV
B005KJJ4F8|4|Marissa Meyer is from Tacoma, Washington which is the same city I live in. I think this pre-programmed me to enjoy Cinder, us Tacoma girls gotta stick together!<br /><br />Cinder follows the story of a cyborg, named Cinder, in the city of New Beijing where there is a killer virus, evil lunar queen, and a swoony boy who happens to be a prince. See? It has everything you didn’t know you wanted to read about until now!<br /><br />Cinder surprised me with just how positive a heroine she was. She is a cyborg so many citizen in New Beijing are prejudiced against her. The man who adopted her died and left her with a terrible stepmother, and still she is hopeful about the future and willing to help those who treated her terribly. Cinder was selfless and I really liked that about her.<br /><br />Prince Kai was surprisingly down to Earth for being a prince. When I began this novel I expected him to be shallow and sheltered. Instead he was a prince of the people and I liked that he was willing to do anything to save New Beijing.<br /><br />The reason I wasn’t able to rate Cinder higher was because I wasn’t happy with the world building. It wasn’t bad it just wasn’t detailed enough for me. The society was explained at a superficial level but I never felt anything for it. In order for me to really enjoy a different world I need to care about it and I never found myself truly caring about New Beijing. Since this is a series though I expect more world building in the novels to come.<br /><br />Overall, Cinder was a fun mix of Cinderella meets Sailor Moon. I liked the premise and will definitely be reading Scarlet soon. I want to know what happens to Cinder, Prince Kai, and what role the Lunar’s will play in all of this.
B006UKFFE0|5|This book is a thoughtful summary of many lean startup principles. A great mash-up of Lean Startup, The Entrepreneur's guide to customer development, and Business Model Generation. We are using it as a textbook for an upcoming startup class here in Bellingham.
0739334026|4|Typical Grisham.
0783114893|4|What's it about?<br /><br />Tired eyed Jim Halsey decides to pick up a hitchhiker to keep him company. It turns out to be the biggest mistake of his life when the hitcher turns out to be John Rider, a deranged sociopath whose been murdering random strangers up and down the highway, now Jim must survive John's deadly game.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />`The Hitcher' is a take no prisoners road movie thriller packed with urban legends. The first ten minutes fools us into thinking we are in for a straight up psychological horror, it quickly becomes clear that action will take center stage. Rutger Hauer is truly menacing here, no other actor can play a soulless villain quite like he can; those eyes are ice cold. The fact that Ryder kills with no motive bothered some critics, to me this mystery makes Rider even more terrifying. `The Hitcher' is unapologetic and that is what i like about it; love or hate it, take it for what it is.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The opening scene is scary as hell; you will never pick up a hitchhiker again!<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />C. Thomas Howell admitted that he was actually scared of Rutger Hauer on and off the set because of the actor's intensity.
B002TYZKIM|5|Just those words spoken @ his last major press conference.  Did Michael know?  He said, \\"This is it, y'all.  This IS the final curtain call.\\"  On the surface, we know he meant, no more touring, no more performing.  But prophetically speaking, did he know?  I have been fortunate, as a child, to have seen him and his brothers perform in Atlantic City, NJ's Steel Pier as the Jackson 5ive as well as been present for many of his concerts as a solo artist.   So I have to ask the question again, did Michael Jackson know?  Did he feel somehow that his work here was done and he was leaving us?  Because if what I witnessed last evening was simply 'rehearsal footage' then maybe we, who he left behind, would not have been able to absorb the final product for that concert is playing non-stop on a much greater stage than what we have down here.  That movie/rehearsal is a masterpiece and a most loving, fitting, testament to what happens when GOD touches and enhances a soul.  I don't believe \\"This Is It\\" was just 120 hours of rehearsal footage for his final concerts, I choose to believe, that Michael Jackson knew.  He was so far ahead of his time, of course he knew and what that movie was and is, is a love letter not only to his children, his family, his fans, friends but to everyone that his music touched and will continue to touch.  This is it to those of us who never had the chance to see him perform while he was here.  This is it to those that saved up and then waited in line to buy tickets to these sold out shows.  This is it to show how 300% goes not only for showtime but for everything leading up to it.  His songs transcended and his music coursed thru you.  Well, it did me.  I can't count how many times he said 'God Bless You' during the film.  I can still see that haunting smile he shone as Kenny Ortega, said 'fade to black' @ the end of the \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" spectacular.  Some will say that \\"This Is It\\" is the final chapter in the life of an extraordinarytalent and humanitarian.  It will be nominated, speculated, win many awards, break world records and then they will make a space on the shelf in the archives, wipe their hands, and be done with it.  Well, the party's not over, I choose to believe it's the start of a whole new book. For as long as there are folks like y'all and me who love this man, his music, what he stood for and tried to do, the rest is not silent and the final curtain has not fallen.  I love this man so very much and I'm fixin' to cry so, thanks, for reading.  Just my 3cents.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Exactly what I was looking for
B005POK858|5|This is an amazing game, I got it via Amazon app store after buying Symphony of Eternity from the same Publisher. It is a very addictive game I couldn't put it down. The game has pretty deep mechanics and even has a game plus mode after you finish the final battle. There are a few locations and equipment (along with extra bosses) only available in the game plus mode. This is definitely well worth the price and better than a  lot of NDS/PSP games out there.
B0089LOG02|5|Although the description makes it seem the book is about Molly, the foster care teen, this book is a look back at the life of the elderly woman, Vivian. It is an easy and compelling read for adults and young adults. A great story of survival and human perseverance as you look at the life of orphans prior to and during the great depression. It should at least show most readers that life could always be worse.

B00004U8JV|3|&quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; is not a perfect movie. There are parts in this movie that, yes, are pretty dumb. But there's still the science of the first. Still the sense of awe. Jeff Goldblum returns as Ian Malcolm, who goes back to Jurassic Park in order to save his girlfriend biologist from what he thinks is impending doom. When he and his team get there, they discover the woman is just fine, but the dinosaurs are in trouble. Hunters are capturing the dinos and transporting them to San Diego. The team realizes they have to stop them and get off the island at all cost. Pretty exciting, right? Well, it is; until they get to San Diego, where the T-Rex is set loose and the movie takes a turn for the worst. Up until the end, this film was just as exciting as its predecessor, though a little on the simple side. It wasn't as technological as the first, but it was just as thrilling. Spielberg obviously wanted to make a bigger, if not better, film and for the most part he does. The charm and wit of the first is still well in tact, and the dinosaurs are still very cool. &quot;The Lost World&quot; is a very fun movie that should hold your interest and even entertain you in more than a few parts.
B00009P1O2|5|'Live At Wembley' is a superb live DVD of the final concert that Queen ever performed in July, 1986 at Wembley Stadium in front of 150,000 appreciative fans. Wow! That's a massive crowd there. The concert you see hear is a rock solid 75 minutes edited down from their actual two hour plus show.W hat that means is there's little bullsh*t, talking or stupid 'segments' that artists often stick between songs, especially on a DVD. If you're a Queen fan, you should REALLY enjoy seeing this DVD and will most likely wish to keep it in your collection for many years to come. I'm not complaining, mind you but the music sounds a bit different on 'Live At Wembley', perhaps it's because the large crowd is clapping so much. Really couldn't say for sure. Tunes I loved seeing over and over again are \\"One Vision\\", the foot-stomping classic \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"Under Pressure\\", \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\", their signature song \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", their cover of Spencer Davis Group's \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" and their anthem \\"We Are The Champions\\". Only cut here I didn't care for was \\"Tutti Fruitti\\". I mean, they should've (perhaps) edited that out. A must-have. Great picture quality. Highly recommended.
B001UV4XIS|1|WB had a good thing going with me... sell me the Bluray/DVD combo pack with the digital copy and I will gladly purchase it. Way of the future, right? But now, rather than simply being able to download the file as before and add it to your iTunes library or manage it however you see fit you have to jump through all these hoops, create new accounts, avoid being linked to Facebook, install new client apps on your computer and mobile devices outside of your library management process and on and on... terrible.  So, sadly, I will be returning my copy as this is utterly worthless for the way I want to manage my already substantial digital movie library. Do they honestly expect people to manage multiple libraries just to satisfy their marketing needs?  And since this is effectively one of the few platforms we have to complain about the lunacy of this process, let me just say to Ultraviolet, Rotten Tomatoes, Flixster and WB (the unholy alliance of marketing death eaters) that you are clearly creating such ill will amongst folks that are clearly WILLING TO PAY FOR YOUR MOVIES in the face of \\"the other option\\", then you really deserve all the terrible things you claim are happening to your industry. Shame on all parties involved in this utter sham product offering.
B008Y720JU|4|Really fun movie and great casting.
B007J4T2G8|5|Very intense book. However, I hoped for a much different ending. Oh well at least there's still 2 more books.
1577314808|4|I'm about half way through the book and am enjoying it very much.  It is exactly what I was looking for.  It's eye opening and inspiring.
B004H4XDBI|5|I enjoyed this book much more than the first book (If I Stay).  In &#34;Where She Went&#34; the story continues from Adam's point of view, picks up where the first book ends and has a much better ending...doesn't leave you wondering.  If you read the first book or see the movie, I recommend you read the second book to finish the story.
B0000214F0|4|I'll admit that this movie may be hard to take seriously with all the hard core sexuality. But if you are able to focus on the lengths and efforts that the film makers used to do this movie, its very well done. I noticed that this movie is loaded with symbollism, for example the bird. My favorite thing about the film is Malcom McDowell's performance. You don't see him in to many movies but when ever you do he is putting all he has into it. People who think this film is stupid and sick should also consider what it would be like to under go a film project like this. I can't think of many movies that would be much harder to make, and also that guttsey. Over all everything about this movie is great and educational. I highly recomend it to any serious movie fan.
1476770387|5|Love anything by Stephen King!
142311339X|5|The Lost Hero is the story of three new half-bloods: Jason, Piper, and Leo. The three are students at a wilderness boarding school for troubled teens, only Jason doesn't remember anything before the moment the story begins. Piper is Jason's girlfriend, and Leo is his best friend, and they've known him for months, so he must be who they say he is, right? Before they can unravel this mystery, however, they're attacked by a storm that seems intent on killing just the three of them, and their teacher suddenly has hooves.<br /><br />To say anything else about the plot would reveal some very excellent surprises, and one of the great joys of this book is trying to guess where the story is going. Fans should be reassured that old favorites return, and Riordan does an excellent job of including them in the story while still making this a new series. I can't wait for the next book, and I love knowing that there's a new Camp Half-Blood book each fall for the next several years. Percy Jackson fans will not be disappointed by this new series.
B000002W3R|4|This album is a fine effort.  Culled from recordings in 1976 and 1977, including songs that Elvis recorded at Graceland, it is a fitting finale to Elvis and his musical legacy.   The Moody Blue album is a bit stronger  effort than 1976's &quot;From Elvis Presley Blvd., Memphis,  Tennessee&quot;, his 2nd to last studio album.  Unlike the '76 LP, 77's  major studio/touring effort features songs that are intertwined with  meaning and impact.  From the haunting &quot;He'll Have To Go&quot;,  to  the personal &quot;It's Easy For You&quot;, this is a very personal album  indeed.  &quot;Moody Blue&quot; is a fitting title track and &quot;Way  Down&quot;, the album's biggest hit mirrors Elvis' drug demise only weeks  after this record's release.  Also, don't miss the cut &quot;Pledging My  Love&quot;, a remake of the old Johnny Ace tune.  Strangely, Elvis does  covers of Jim Reeves and Johnny Ace on this recording, both of whom died  young and tragically... just as Elvis soon would. This is a strong effort,  overall, and a very meaningful one too.
B004HWYTP4|5|Great movie!
B00G3L19ZU|5|This book is great for anyone (teens and up) struggling with learning anything.  It is easy to read & understand.  It introduces the newest brain research related to learning and the best ways to use that knowledge to improve both the speed of learning and the understanding of topics you are working on.  It also includes tools, such as some awesome flashcard programs that will play on almost any device - Anki is one.  You can create your own cards and make your own.  It uses spaced repetition, which is the best way to memorize (covered in the book).  I have memorized a pile of information using this method, and it is staying with me!<br />  The book also addresses procrastination & many great ways to trick yourself into getting around it - no, you do not have to use all your will power to do it!  One method is the Pomodoro.  It recommends that you to set a timer for 20 - 30 minutes, then just focus on the process of doing work (not on completing it!).  When the timer goes off, take a break.  Then either continue on the same subject, switch another, or do something else.  It really works & removes the painful feeling of having to finish something right now!<br />  I also highly recommend the Coursera.org course, &#34;Learning How to Learn&#34;, which goes over much of the information in the book, plus some.  It's free and all you need to do is sign up.  You can just watch the short videos & check out the links to additional info, drop out if it's too much, or you can get a certificate.  Next one starts in Jan 2015.<br />  I've been working on learning new things on my own for the last year and was making little progress until I read this book.  I am now zooming along, using the tools and concepts in this book.  I highly recommend it!
B00BEIYMAG|1|Not impressed at all...not true and not even close to being true.
B0031KC8OC|4|I happen to like the noir ish of it. I know some peole don't like that style. Its a good show
B004EBZX6W|5|I'm not ordinarily a big &#34;app&#34; guy, but I love this one. It gives me a very, very clear reading of the strength of the WiFi signal I'm using. I was able to use it walking around to find where in my building the best reception was. I only use some 10 or 12 apps much;  this is one of them.
1594484805|5|Great read with interesting facts, smart analyses, synthesis and humor too! (And nine more words of prase to comply to the system)
B00BAXFJ5M|2|It's just OK so far about half way through. Not as engaging as some of his other books. Might have made an alternate author choice.
B0094BB4TW|5|Was pleasantly surprised with quality & condition.  I am just starting to use Amazon, so far , so good.  Now looking for lighted magnifying mirror.
B00CHIMG6Y|5|As a man I am not one of those who can cry when watching a sad or heartfelt movie.  This movie really got to me, and I found myself starting to tear up at one point.  This was an awesome movie and I am happy that my wife made me sit through it.  I had to Google the family name and see if they truly existed, and they did.  This movie makes you think about what Mother Nature can do to people.  I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie, I am.
0316055433|3|The Goldfinch is best described as a collection of many detailed novellas.<br />Donna Tartt excels in her rendering of Theo’s long story. The characters [my personal favorite being Hobie] are real and fleshed out before us. They are kind, impatient, addicted, angry, distracted and many other things. They are imperfect. They are human. The novel’s creative plot involves movement to let us see characters in many different lights – high in the deserts of Las Vegas to wedding parties in New York to death. Although we only meet Theo’s mother for a short number of pages, I felt her death strongly and painfully through the rest of the novel. Tartt’s writing, with its prose-like quality, is mesmerizing to read and even more fun to picture, and I can imagine a film in the works soon.<br />While the book is beautiful and detailed, it is also, in my opinion, far too long. While reading, I felt that I could only read 75-100 pages without getting tired of the novel’s extremely slow pace, caused by long passages of meaningless detail. Another point of contention I had with the novel was the plot retrieval of the painting. The Goldfinch is Theo’s motivation to live – yet it is Boris who retrieves it on [of course] Christmas day. Rather than a satisfying ending, Tartt leaves us with a neatly tied conclusion followed by a strange ten-page lecture of Theo’s musings on chance and fate. I would think twice before recommending this book to a friend.
B009JZSC9S|5|Very well written and great acting...A must to watch from season one to see the development of the characters and the relationships as they evolve...
B00FAPF5U0|4|Good amusement easy way to pass tlme
B000OZ0NXA|5|Was introduced to the Jack Reacher character a couple years ago ... have now started to go back to the beginning of this series and the beginning, Jack Reacher No 1, is just as good as later books and fills in some of the gaps. A really well written series, and great character.
B00HA8WNZ0|5|Very picky about games, but I really enjoyed this game. Just the right amount of challenge to keep you hooked!
006202406X|1|I am truly outraged.<br /><br />I have been a devoted divergent fan and even took the day off work to sit at home and read this.<br />Only to find myself crying in my bed over the ending.<br /><br />I cannot wrap my head around this. I do not understand why Veronica thought this was necessary.<br />How could she do this to the fans?<br /><br />There is no lesson here. I am taking away nothing from this book but pain.<br />I can't even begin to imagine watching the movie now, knowing how this story will end.<br /><br />Save yourself the heartbreak and hold on to the first to books. Don't let it be ruined by the third.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|It's hard but it's still really fun. Me and my sister competition to see who can get the highest score.

B00EEDJHXA|5|Got this as the Free App of the Day, but it's been one of few games I've actually kept playing! It definitely helps kill time and keeps you thinking, especially as the board expands! I'd suggest anyone get this just to keep the brain working!
B000VDDDVO|5|This film is considered one of the great classics, especially around Christmas. Truth be told, it's good for any time of the year. I agree with it's status, and I feel that everyone should see this film
B000002AGY|5|I remember, while living in Chicago, a radio show in which *Sister (No Last Name)* spoke of when she spent 15 minutes in Heaven. Well to listen to the nineteen minutes of Concerto de Aranjuez seems to be a worthwhile, earthly, substitute.
B00BP4Z8XY|5|Great movie for the family, easy to watch/stream online, available immediately. Super satisfied.
B00003CX8J|5|I MYSELF HAVE BEEN AN AVID COMIC BOOK COLLECTOR SINCE 1961. SO TO SAY I HAVE A LOT OF PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE X-MEN COMIC WOULD BE PUTTING IT MILDLY! AS FOR THE MOVIE IS WAS MARVELOUSLY WRITTEN AND THE ACTING WAS SUPER AWESOME! IT FOLLOWED THE BOOK AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CONSIDERING THE DEPTH IT WOULD HAVE INVOLVED CONSIDERING THE LONGEVITY OF THE BOOK! THE X-MEN ALONG WITH MANY OTHER MARVEL BOOKS JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER ALL THE TIME. YOU HAVE PROVEN TO THE MOVIE INDUSTRY WHAT QUALITY REALLY MEANS IN YOUR MOVIE! ME AND A FRIEND WENT TWO SEPARATE TIMES TO SEE IT AND WAS VERY IMPRESSED AND WAS GLUED TO THE SCREEN LIKE KIDS AGAIN! THANK YOU FOR BRINGING EXCITEMENT BACK TO THE BIG SCREEN!
B005SFR7YE|5|This is an absolutely spectacular production.  The music is gorgeous, as is the video, with great choice of camera angles and well-selected close-ups so that you can get the feeling of watching a live stage production but with a better view of some nuances.  The vocalists, including the young Canadian Phantom, are wonderfully cast and all performances are excellent.  As a bonus, after the performance several past Phantoms come out on stage and do a number together.  If you like this musical, you will HAVE to have this DVD.
B00785P2QC|5|I love this game it's amazing..it makes your time go by real fast.and the best thing about this game..is you don't need internet
B0010T75W6|5|This movie has a special place in my heart, it is so different and out there but at the same time weirdly relatable. Many great things about the film: costumes, fun songs, hilarious one-liners. Most of all the lead actor is incredible. Not for everyone probably, but don't be intimidated by the premise. The story is a little sad and mostly about how Hedwig is trying to figure out who he is and how he fits in with the world; but at the same time there are plenty of comedic moments. Lots of heart.
B0067AC5KA|5|I have read these books several times, and I always enjoyed it. The final book is the best of the three, in my opinion. The court room scene is very intriguing. The three books are a real a real find for a reader like myself.
B008BRC7BE|4|Anyone who is a fan of Deep Purple or Back Sabbath and/or the album BORN AGAIN, probably the most under appreciated Sabbath release will most definatley enjoy this collaboration. Not only was it done for a good cause but it features other great icons of that Gillian and Iommi time such as Nikko McBrain and Jason Newsed, just to name a few. Gillian does not have the pipes he used to as you can see on the songs that were re-recorded but it still brings back great memory and is produced well. You also get a lot of raw unreleased music, most notably the last track which is basically just a blues jam session taken from some remote venue early in their careers.<br />******One of the best features of this purchases is the paragraph or 2 that is laid out explaining what was going on in their lives at that time and how many of these classics came to be. a la TRASHED.<br />One can only wonder what more creative genius could have been createdif these two masterminds were able to sustain a better relationship in their prime
B008T4HHWS|5|Pacino at his classic best!
B00FRVH3V6|5|I love this series and the last the characters are great.  I can't wait for the next adventure. hopefully there'll be more
B000AMJG4Y|4|My husband and I watched this the other day, and as the movie started, our eyes nearly popped out.  Wow, the animation!!  Brilliant!!  I've been saying there should be movies like this for years!  And the music...wow again!  Epic and amazing and full of atmosphere.  As we watched, however, we felt like we were getting left behind.  We knew this movie was a furthering of the FFVII game when we bought it, and I don't want to down-rate this movie because of my own lack of knowledge of the FFVII universe.  Bottom line is that it's beautiful and entertaining and we'll definitely watch it again, but for us novices to the plot behind FFVII, the characters felt light, and we never even knew some of their names.  A lot of them seemed to come out of nowhere for no particular reason in the middle of the movie, but we just accepted it and enjoyed it for what it was.  We would have LOVED to see the whole story of FFVII, video game and this extension, as a multi-disc anime series done in this style of animation.  Now that would have been WOW-tastic.  This CGI-type animation would work for any anime series...imagine Gundam Wing or Escaflowne...  That would be breathtaking!
B0011KQSZ4|4|4.2 stars<br /><br />Short version: The man who directed What About Bob? and did the voices of Miss Piggy, Kermit and Yoda makes a comedy about a funeral featuring accidental psychedelic ingestion and an extortionate gay midget (sorry, dwarf). If that doesn't pique your curiosity, this is not for you.<br /><br />Slightly longer version: Wonderfully off the wall British drawing-room farce writ somewhat large, with perfectly silly script and superlative cast. Director Oz was raised in Britain and it shows; he melds dry Brit wit with some of the better Hollywood tropes and dishes up an oft hilarious film that gets funnier as it goes, and at a pleasantly snappy pace. Tudyk is especially marvellous as the unknowing voyager.<br /><br />A must for any fans of British humor, gleeful weirdness, and intelligent dry wit in general.
0553386794|5|GRRM kicks off an incredible series. The characters are rich, complex and compelling. GRRM is compared to the venerable Tolkien, but where Tolkien's characters are shining lights, GRRM's are sometimes heroic, other times cruel, at turns repulsive and later sympathetic, depending on the point of view from which the story is told. The result is a brilliant tapestry and a flowing, gripping tale.<br />The book and those that follow are a revealing portrayal of feudalism. The term \\"game of thrones\\" is used by the characters in the novels to describe endless positioning for power among the 1% of an imagined medieval world.<br />GRRM's understanding of human nature is enthralling.
B009KS4XRO|5|This is bingo app is very hard to put down. You get 5 free daily tournament tokens. Not only do you have your normal level up stages but they also have special limited time rooms. There's a different set of collections and rewards for all rooms. I am so addicted to this game app I found myself using up my credits in no time. The only thing I don't like is you can not play if you are not connected to Wi-Fi.
B00GRHVIGU|5|Classic Croz! Harmony, clear voice and thought provoking lyrics. timeless music that reaches the soul. A must for anyone who appreciates great music
B0031RAOVY|2|I was really disappointed with this movie.  I like the Japanese tale much better.<br /><br />This movie was not about loyalty, it was about not being able to let go or move on.  Ten years later the wife comes back to the same small town to visit, and she looks like hell,  still as depressed as the day her husband died.  Why hadn't she tried to move forward in her life?  The dog got older and more beaten down as the years passed him by.<br /><br />Loyalty is one thing, but living in the past is another.  Could have been so much more.

0345409671|5|I think this was a great book and my favorite by far from Anne Rice.  I feel sorry for the people who gave this book a bad review because they felt it's purpose was to &quot;bash Christians&quot;, obviously they are not  very well educated.  If nothing else, this book makes you think about God,  the devil, heaven, hell and the theory of creation in very philosophical  terms.  It's purpose was probably to make everyone think a little  differently, not to make them reject any religious or personal beliefs in  God.  So if you want to sit down with a good book that gives you a very  thought provoking take on creation, read this one, it's worth it.
B001EN71DG|1|I went for a \\"used\\" version of the box set (sold by a 3rd party obviously). Instead of the six DVD box that is advertised on this web page, I received a 4 DVD set released in 2005. No original version in there ... Disappointed !
B005CRQ4XI|3|Oprah's list?  Overwhelmingly positive reviews?  This writing is certainly not bad, but I cannot see how it reaches the level of acclaim that it has received.  If not the writing, then the story? Okay, I'll agree that it is refreshing that Cheryl (I won't bother with the made up last name, why even bother with a last name if that is all it is worth?) is able to write honestly.  She does not appear to brag, or over inflate her story with dramatic scenes of bravery and courage on her part.  She does seem to write sincerely, and in so portrays the quiet bravery that is her story.  However, it is exactly this quiet bravery that many people, and, in this case, particularly women, face every day.  I do not see the uniqueness of her story.  I am amazed that she was able to accomplish a sole hike, but really how lucky was she that something more disasterous didn't happen?  And how reckless was she to live her life as she did, having random sexual encounters, shooting heroin, setting out to hike a trail with no real hiking experience (as evidenced by the worst of her travails - too small boots and too heavy pack)?  Is she supposed to be a role model for young women?  Sure, she had hardship in her life, but her reaction to it - drugs, casual sex, the ruination of a good relationship - is not especially encouraging.  And in the end, the book was a rather drawn out story of a hike that included basically the same experiences over its course, and thus from chapter to chapter.  Nothing to get all that excited about, and certainly not as inspiring as I had thought it would be.
B007BFSYMS|5|Best relax app I have found. Some of the sounds are annoying to me but may be soothing to someone else.
B0034GK7DM|5|I was four or five songs into this cd when I was remarking to myself, shaking my head, at how much I liked it.  I had heard his songs and honestly thought he must have three or four albums (I don't really follow any music scenes in the last four or five years).  When I went to purchase what I thought might be a greatest hits collection I noticed he only had two cds so I bought them.<br />After a short bit of thinking it dawned on me why I like both his cds. They have more than one incredibly catchy, well-done and popular tracks.  But the other songs are nearly as good, or even better in a few cases.  To me, they sound like cds I used to buy in the 90s when I was huge into country music.  I enjoyed this collection immensely and it is still in the cd player in my car ready to play next time I get in.  I can't describe how happy I am to find something right up my alley like this.  It was the first cd I bought (along with two George and Easton's &#34;All over the Road&#34; cd all together) in many years.  Makes me want to trust in country music again and maybe buy a few more.
0399143904|2|Mr. Clancy is getting lazy. This novel comes across as an expensive, overlong, self-indulgent Mack Bolan yarn. The author basically rehashes actual terrorist events, especially the exploits of Carlos the Jackal and  the PLO. The German terrorists who conduct the assault in Vienna are  virtual carbon copies of actual Red Army Faction members.<br />Another flaw  with this story is the near-invincibility of the protaganists. Clancy's  commandos are basically bulletproof, which eliminates much of the suspense  inherent in such a tale. The only &quot;good&quot; guys killed during the  book are tertiary characters at best. Clancy's vaunted penchant for realism  is sorely lacking here. I recommend Clear and Present Danger for a more  accurate portrayal of combat.<br />If you're interested in stories such as  these, pick up a copy of &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot; instead.
B00VFTCGES|3|Not What I expected.  There were a lot of What!! Moments and not enough explanation to the plot.
B008MG1E4A|5|I liked this book because it was a true<br />firsthand account of what happened. Not the lies of the administration that takes credit for the kill.
B000ZN258W|5|I don't know why industry hacks and some reviewers compare Dig, Lazarus, Dig to Grinderman. About the only real similarity is that the Bad Seeds seems to have gotten away from songs centered around Cave's piano and rediscovered the guitar.  Grinderman is a \\"half-back\\" journey that nods to Nick Cave's goth-punk roots. Dig, Lazarus, Dig is a leap forward into the kind of inventive guitar driven music that the Bad Seeds haven't touched in a long time. I liked this recording the first time I played it through and I like it more every time I hear it. There is so much going on musically that it just keeps getting better with each listen.  Real fans of Nick Cave won't be disappointed by Cave's return to the guitar. They will be delighted, because most of us as fans are not just aboard for the music, we are aboard for the lyrics. Cave is one of the few songwriters that can pull off the trick of making edgy, raunchy lyrics sound like the pinnacle of erudition.  There is nothing I dislike here in the fifty plus minutes of stirring rock and roll. But some songs are of course better than others. My favorites are Today's Lesson, We Call Upon The Author, Hold On To Yourself (with its haunting organ), Lie Down Here (& Be My Girl), and Jesus of the Moon.  If you are a Nick Cave fan, I think you'll find that Dig, Lazarus, Dig is his best album overall since No More Shall We Part. The booklet of lyrics you get with this import edition is fine, but I am curious as to what you get with the US release dubbed special/limited edition besides a much better price. The price of this has remained fairly static, the price of the other has done a deep Lewinsky. Whichever one you decide on, you are not going to be disappointed.

B000E41MS6|5|I wasn't interested in the old Doctor Who series when I was a kid and it played in the U.S.  After seeing Christopher Eccleston as the Doctor I became hooked and Billie Piper is my all time favorite companion for the Doctor.  Love these episodes, wish Eccleston had done more seasons.  He has the brains, courage, and passion that makes for an excellent Doctor Who.

0618680004|5|Dawkins hereby debunks nearly all (that I can tell) common arguments for the existence of a god, and lays out the case that all organization among lifeforms and the universe itself can be attributed to natural processes, and that a universe endowed with a meddlesome god would look much different than the one we have now. His arguments are effective and valid, although this is not a work for the layperson, as its language is complex and he goes into much detail, sometimes sapping it of a possible concisive and effective punch that would be more effective for converting the average non-intellectual Christian. But for sophisticated atheists, deists, or theists, this will give you much to think about.
B00H58VGIA|5|Sue Monk Kidd has done an unbelievable job in mixing fiction within historical nonfiction.  We have come a long way since the slavery  issue of 1800's but still have a way to go.  Her descriptions and stories of how the slaves lived and how they began service at a young age are excellent, but terribly sad at the same time..  The characters are so real and easily have an emotional effect on the reader.<br />It is hard to believe the cruelty and disregard that the owner had....to be &#34;the whip&#34; one day and not even acknowledge it the next (as if it were very well-deserved).
B00ISJSK7K|2|What a waste compared to the trilogy.

B00E8KLWB4|2|My grandson accidentally Uninstaller the game the first time. When I downloaded it again I had to start over at the beginning but at least I got all my friends back. Then I had to get a new phone and when I downloaded it again I had to start back at the beginning and this time my friend list did not return.  I give it a 2. It would be a 5 if you didn't lose everything when you have to reinstall.
B0094BB4TW|3|always connected me to update what is going on in my network. Daily routine, and check out before hit the road.
0743298039|4|This is a great story told by a first-rate storyteller.  The story unfolds at a natural pace.  If you appreciated THE SHADOW IN THE WIND you will enjoy this story.  Both include characters who have an affinity towards books and who love to read.  That is just one of the main attractions.  The biggest draw, I think, is the timing in which the mysteries manifest themselves.  This novel has a twisty, turning plot, characters that are fully developed, and a balanced amount of intrigue, sex and redemption.
B004TTZHBK|5|This is a well thought out, well implemented app. Works great if you follow advice to click &quot;Later&quot; for additional content and install from within the app. Galaxy Tab, Droid X
B00406O7YK|4|Hello Dolly!, as a show, always brings a smile to my face. Barbra Streisand's performance in this is a slightly different take on Dolly Levi's organized chaos, but none-the-less entertaining. The set pieces (locations) and costuming are breathtaking as well.
B00HDMMISA|4|Somewhat predictable but characters were interesting with strong women getting stronger and weaker women finding themselves.  Probably better suited for my wife but I enjoyed the read.

B0070Y46UY|4|This book is really good at some parts but boring. It doesn't get good until the middle of the book.
B000002LPH|5|Of the albums George Harrison released in between All Things Must Pass and Cloud Nine, this is my favorite.  Despite the uncharacteristically boring packaging, his self-titled album finds George more in his element than he had been in the past six years (though the subject of God is conspicuously absent, or maybe I'm just not looking hard enough).<BR>The optimistic &quot;Love Comes To Everyone&quot; sets the mood for the album.  Although it's a great song, the best is yet to come.  &quot;Not Guilty&quot; is a great song that George had since the Beatles' White Album sessions (why the Beatles never used it is unknown--they recorded over 100 takes!).  &quot;Here Comes The Moon&quot; (a &quot;little brother&quot; to &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot;) was written in Hawaii after George witnessed the sun setting as the moon came up...beautiful song, very visual.  I don't particularly care for &quot;Soft-Hearted Hana,&quot; as it seems somewhat out of place on this album.  It's quirky, though it doesn't spoil the album's mood.  &quot;Blow Away&quot; &amp; &quot;Faster&quot; (my two favorites) prove that, although his music wasn't the most commercial, George could still write an A1 pop song.  &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; &amp; &quot;Your Love Is Forever&quot; (two of my other personal favorites) are both soft &amp; warm.  &quot;Dark Sweet Lady&quot; has a spanish feel to it.  &quot;Soft Touch&quot; was written about George's newly-born son and is another warm, sweet song.  &quot;If You Believe&quot; kicks up the tempo slightly and finishes the album on a happy, hopeful note--full circle.
B0063IH60K|5|perfect solitaire set up.  very clean design and nice graphics.  and its free.  very quiet as well.  recommend to everyone
B000JMKQX0|5|I picked this book up before I heard about the movie and blazed through it.  Well written and captivating.  I only wish that the chapters were longer.  You would be getting into one of the many scenarios and bang it ends. Same thing with the next chapter until the end which made sense.  Good book affectionately worth the time.

B003UESJEW|5|great CONDITION
B009JBWOU0|5|My adult son suggested that I buy this set of DVD's.  I could have gone to our local stores and purchased them, but knew I wouldn't take the time to do this.  It's easier for me  to sit at my computer and click a few buttons and then the product just arrives at my front door.  So convenient.  They arrived in perfect condition and we have enjoyed watching them.
B00242KCSM|5|Excellent album..
B003TH14H4|5|great show!
B008Z9YGEE|4|This movie is VERY intense. The whole concept is set in this post-apocalyptic world where the inhuman and murderous and iron-fisted and Big-Brother-like government has set up these games where 24 children chosen at random are torn from their families and slaughter each other. I think it was part of their goal to shock about the inhumanity of the world. And it is shocking and somewhat disturbing. Rather violent, and realistically so, none of this imaginary superhero violence but real children with real screams and real looking blood.<br /><br />BUT, that said, against this incredibly dark background, the hero Katniss stands out incredibly well. She is the symbol of the person, of love, of teamwork and self-sacrifice, of dedication, of humility, and I could go on for a while. When people close to her die, it is actually really satisfying to see her exhibit the completely human emotions of grief and sorrow that are completely and very conspicuously absent in everyone else in her insane world.<br /><br />Her intense commitment to these ideals bring out the best in other people as well. As the show progresses you see people that otherwise were just going with the brutal flow of the society grasp onto her as a role model and example and start to be a little human as well. Unfortunately, some of those people get killed. So that's also a little disturbing. Overall I gave it 4 stars because of the disturbing-ness (definitely not for a kid under 15, I'd say). I don't want to watch it again any time soon because of the violence but it was SO worth it to see it at least once because I truly felt inspired to value the people around me I had been taking for granted.<br /><br />That's also not to say that I won't see the second one. I've heard that one's not as graphic.
B00IRMTTPU|5|I smiled, i cried, I loved this movie. The acting was beyond superb and you really felt as if you were in the time of the setting. This is a must watch movie... watch it with your kids along with The autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman during black history month or any time when the lesson of slavery comes up and you want to show the facts to them. Another great movie in this genre is Roots by Alex Haley.
B00000JNJ1|5|I love this album! No album this year has been in such heavy rotation as this one. They're up there with Led Zeppelin, Stones &amp; Who as some wild rockers. I can't believe it has taken me this long to realize how great a band Faces was...and I know music! Rod Stewart is one of my faves, but he was definitely at his best with Faces. My only complaint was that &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed (Live)&quot; isn't on this. &quot;Stay With Me&quot;, &quot;Pool Hall Richard&quot;, &quot;Wicked Messenger&quot;, &quot;Ooh La La&quot; are my jams. Rhino records has put together the definitive Faces album. A must own for 60's-70s rock fans.
B00CO4GO7I|4|Sad,but good
B00EJX2YGM|5|I thought the set was great,  a lot more pictures & information from all these DVD's.  going back thru this set has been fun, picking out things I had forgotten or had missed before.  Thanks, & if you love Twilight you need this set in your collection! pj
B000F0UV0E|5|As soon as I saw who the official Amazon reviewer was, and the fact that she dissed the album, I knew I'd like it.  This same writer was my touchstone when with Stereo Review.  If she liked it, I stayed away. If she didn't, I bought it.  Too funny.  Some things never change. I guess a few other people agree with me.

0316228532|5|It took me a good six months to get through this book because I chose to listen to the audiobook instead of reading it.  With kids around, I found it difficult to find time where I could turn on the book and listen, lol.  As you're probably aware, this is JK Rowling's first \\"adult\\" novel.  (Personally, I think more adults than kids loved her Harry Potter series, but since everyone insists on categorizing them Young Adult, who am I to argue?)<br /><br />The story takes place in a small rural English town where we immediately learn that a member of the town council has died of a heart attack, leaving what is known as a \\"casual vacancy.\\"  As they story progresses, we learn more than we probably wanted to know about the various folk in this town, some of whom are vying for this open council seat.  We see all of their faults....and holy cow, do they have faults.  Not to be judgmental here, but I can honestly say that any dysfunction my own family has (don't we all?) pales in comparison to the families Rowling introduces us to.<br /><br />Small town politics, Rowling shows, can be just as dirty as the big leagues and often with more dire consequences.  The central political argument in our small town here is the presence of a low-rent neighborhood.  Our characters vying for the council seat are split between eschewing any social responsibility and those who believe there can be redemption of the downtrodden.<br /><br />While it might seem that Rowling is blatantly championing social responsibility, in reality she goes to great pains to present reality....there is no right answer.  While it is certainly a noble ideal, Rowling shows that ideals sometimes fall far, far short.<br /><br />Ultimately, I very much enjoyed her work here.  Yes, as I'm sure you've heard, there is a lot of vulgar language, a lot of sex, drug usage, etc and so on.  And I thought every last bit was pertinent to the story!  Rowling has proven with this novel that she is a first rate storyteller.
B0036S4B6M|5|I read this in about 2 days! It was so interesting to read a first hand account of what it's like in prison. Not only was it interesting, but it was so funny! Very easy and entertaining read. Great book to bring to the beach or read on a long plane ride.
B00D8CSVLW|5|Having read a Time to Kill, this was a great re introduction to the main characters in A Time To Kill and their journey. The tough life of the African Americans was once again high lighted and the greed of some people. Some lawyers were once again shown to be shoddy, dangerous people, who will manipulate people and the law. Looking forward to Grisham's next novel
0582084865|5|&quot;Rebecca&quot; is one of the most haunting novels I have ever read.  The opening sentence alone is enough to give one the shivers: &quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.&quot;<br />The novel started as a project to see how long the author could go without naming her main character, and ends up as being a fascinating read.  Maxim de Winter is a man with secrets, and his new bride, who feels Rebecca's oppressive spirit everywhere in their new home, is an honest and brave character with whom all readeres should be able to identify with.  She is made of stronger stuff than any romance novel charcter I've ever read.<br />Rebecca herself, although her voice is rarely heard and she lives on through memories of the inhabitants of Manderley is still a force to be reckoned with.  Rebecca's loyal servant Mrs. Danvers (quite possibly the creepiest personal maid/housekeeper in literature) will make your skin crawl.<br />The book has an astonishing ending and I guarantee that anyone who picks the book up will not only be unable to put it down, but when the last page is turned, will start to reread it immediately.
B00CNQ7HAU|4|The old characters are back---matured a bit but still in good ole, down-south form!  The plot is suspenseful, and the characters are well defined. As usual, Grisham's style is a delight to read and easy to follow!

B00IHMEAYA|5|The author writes eloquently. The story takes us into the jungle POW camp run by the Japanese  in 1943. At the same time the story of the protagonist' s family  in Australia is told. Themes of love, good/evil, responsibility, spontaneity, lust, humanity are explored through the characters. I loved every page.
B003BW0CB6|3|Entertaining quick read.....good airplane book.
B005NJ9CHK|5|I first heard the music of the Beatles during my early teen years through stereo cassette tapes of the Capital albums, and the Beatles cover group Beatlemania. Eventually, during the Anthology period, I started building my collection of original UK/US vinyl pressings along with the original late 80s CDs, which followed the core UK catalog. Eventually the remixes and remasters came a long and everything started sounding better and better. By the time 2009 came a long, I had purchased the Beatles collection of music in several different formats. I've heard it all!<br /><br />With the release of the Beatles in Mono on Vinyl, I am pleased to say this is one of the definitive Beatles collections released to date. It is the Beatles in their best configuration (argued by the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, Love and Rock Band remixed configurations), and until the entire Beatles catalog is properly remixed, the original mono mixes is surely the way to go!<br /><br />Why mono? In stereo, Beatles music was often extremely panned with most instruments isolated in the left speaker, while vocals and other instruments were placed in the center. In general, the original stereo mixes were pretty unnatural to listen to, especially with headphones. In mono, everything comes at you directly as if you were in the same room with the Beatles. Much more natural sounding, mono wins!<br /><br />What about mono Vinyl vs. mono CD? To do an A/B test of the new Beatles Mono Vinyl box set with the 2009 CD mono box set, I ripped several vinyl tracks at 24/96, using a brand new needle and a 1980s Technics turntable, several CD tracks at 16/44 and loaded all files into iTunes while setting my Mac's Audio Device Output Settings to 24/96. The results were very, VERY close! Ironically, the CD versions sounded warmer than the same songs on vinyl! I'm sure if the same test was done with a more high end turntable, the results might be slightly different, but unlike a few other reviewers on Amazon, I'm not too convinced this vinyl box set will sound a world of a difference compared to the 2009 mono CDs. Both versions sound great! It really comes down to if you're on a budget, go with the CD box set. It sounds extremely good! But if you long for the Beatles on vinyl, and don't want to shell out thousands of dollars on overpriced eBay originals, look no further than this box set. It's perfection on vinyl!<br /><br />Is it fair to rule out the stereo mixes? Not necessarily. Later Beatles albums such as Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, the White Album, Abbey Road, and Let it Be shine in stereo and are worth exploring. In general, after hearing both versions countless times over the years, and seeing both McCartney and Starr in concert, I truly prefer the mono mixes.<br /><br />What about the remixes? That is an entirely different story all together. Truly mono is the best way to go at the moment as all four Beatles were present during those mixes. However, the remixes on Yellow Submarine, Love, Let it Be... Naked, and Beatles Rock Band really do offer a much cleaner sounding version of Beatles music. I don't care how anyone will try to spin this, remixed version of Beatles music instantly sounds better as the team at Abbey Road used the original multi-tracks rather than the original final masters. Original multi-tracks are often the first, or earliest generation tapes where as the final master tapes can be anywhere from two to several generations old. Remixes would allow for instruments and vocals to be better balanced with the aid of today's digital technology.<br /><br />In short, the Beatles in Mono is the absolute best way to go for listening to the Beatles as they originally heard themselves. Whether you choose the 2009 remastered CDs or the new remastered vinyl will depend on how much cash you wanna give up. They both sound excellent. And as for Beatlemaniacs, like myself, waiting for the inevitable third Beatles box set of a fully remixed catalog, we wait. I'm sureit's on the horizon. There are many fans who want it and Universal wants your money. Money can't buy us love, but we sure love the Beatles, and love is all we need!nt it and Universal wants your money. Money can't buy us love, but we sure love the Beatles, and love is all we need!
B009LOJK1Q|4|The 4 stars is for the fact that eventually I could hardly put the book down. But this is not King at his best, and this won't be a King classic. In his favour, as always, are his well-rounded characters. One cannot help liking Dan Torrance, for example. My problem with this book was The True Knot people. I can handle any kind of fantasy, but we were not told much about these \\"non-humans\\": how long they've actually existed, or  how they came to exist at all. They seemed to have come out of thin air. Also, that \\"taking in of steam\\" was not so much fantasy and science fiction as just too unbelievable. But once the story draws you in, you have to read on to find out what happens. And that is Stephen King's greatest talent: his inimitable, irresistible writing style.<br /><br />As previous reviewers said, the ending was a slightly damp squib, but at least goodness triumphed over evil, which is as it should be.<br /><br />I have one question for Mr King, though: how can a measles germ exist in bodies for more than 2 years ... ? I won't explain that one, as I don't want to be a spoiler. Just askin' ....

B00003CXI1|5|Here we find Harry and his friends facing the challages of growing up while also exploring the halls of hogworts the enchanted scool of witchcraft and wizardry, Harry and his friends must save the Magical world by Stopping Lord_V from coming back to life ! If you have not seen this movie buy it now and don't forget to pick up the next one as well Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
B00B8WXG9G|5|I saw him is concert and that made me want to purchase..I was not dissapointed at all...he sounds GREAT and the duet with Dolly Paarten is suprisingly awsome....
B001ANSS5K|5|This book was enjoyable to read. I couldn't put it down. Finished it in 2 days! I can't wait to see the movie & compare the two.
B00M7URUUE|1|Where do I start? Creepy CGI babies -- think &#34;Renesme&#34; -- and rock monsters without the cool Veggie Tales catchy tune. I was a bit annoyed that it went out of its way to actually mean the exact opposite of what the Bible portrays. Well, that's Hollywood. But badly done transitions, ponderous writing, Shakespearean-style agonized crying, and villains who are more relatable than the heroes just make this movie the ultimate bomb. I'll put it this way. Compared to this film, &#34;Twilight&#34; is deep-thinking and artistic.
B00J2VSS0C|3|Each time I play this game it changes
B005MH8ZTE|4|Beautiful baroque music... You won't be disappointed. Except, maybe, with the inclusion of the overplayed Four Seasons by Vivaldi. But even there, the interpretation in this collection is somewhat novel and unexpected. I'm very happy I made this purchase. I play them randomly on my car stereo, and it keeps me calm and happy during even the nastiest of commutes. :)
B00TEAVEY8|5|This game has kept me playing. It's fun to play, both with friends and with people from all over the globe. Its style is a little&amp;#34;tongue in cheek&amp;#34; and the humour is wry. Aside from an occasional miss spelled word, it's entertaining and fairly inexpensive to play. Much less greedy than a lot of games I have played!
B00J3AW23G|5|Fun & Challenging
B00FKF0F3C|1|Hard to believe that this book was written by the same person who wrote Pillars of the Earth ,  I couldn't wait for it to end!
B008GANNIC|4|Over all, album was good musically & by way of message. My problem is with the last song \\"I Am\\". Colossians 3:8 says, \\" But now you must also rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and ( filthy language from your lips ).\\" NIV. This is written to Christians. Paul said that we were (in) the world not of it. The album was like climbing into a race car, hitting the gass & enjoying the speed! Then you hot a brick wall! Message is clouded by the F bomb.  3 stars would have been a better score.
B000MGATTE|5|What can I say....it is Stephen King! I have read almost every book written by SK, including short stories and have rarely been disappointed. This was a bit different but I still enjoyed the read and didn't want it to come to an end.
B00003CXCQ|1|I would not use this seller as the DVD, that was supposed to be new does not work and I have not had time to try and track him down to return it but I need to.
B008Y73XTQ|5|This is a great movie for those that like WW2 or submarine movies.  I was in my living room sweating along with the crew as they were bombed (depth charges) from above.  A must watch.
B000001IQH|5|Excellent album. It couldn't be better than this.
B0051HNMTI|5|I enjoy using this product when I don't have time for regular workout. It gets your heart rate up and  is challenging. I don't need much room at all.
B004XQYBA2|3|I have the free app and love it. When thisthen this one became the free app of the day, I was excited. But it won't let me download.
B00DA6YEKS|5|Looking forward for more.  One has to place their self along side their hero.  It is not a quick read nor one for a person that requires easy solutions
B000002MUQ|5|Great band What else can I say? This is a great purchase a one of a kind cd from a unique band, this is more than awesome.
0670023329|5|This guy escaped from the darkest pit in the known universe. His story, and the brutal honesty with with it is told is unlike anything I have experienced. I devoured this in two days. Movie please.
0670023329|5|This book gripped me from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. Shows worst of humanity but also has redemption for the main subject of the book.
B000FVE3BG|2|We returned the watch.  Although we loved the color scheme, the face was way too big even for a man.
B005BRS8Z6|5|This is the second time I have read this book.  If you follow the 4 agreements your life changes and your outlook is brighter.  I have found the most important agreement to be &#34;be true to your word&#34;.  Honesty is an important commodity and if you are always true to your word you please your inner self and those around you.  I didn't find it to be a self help book exactly but rather a book for defining your life
B00005JLKB|5|I avoided this show thinking it was just a cheap teenage version of the great character Superman. I read some good reviews and I knew the show had survived for 5 seasons now, so I rented this entire season. I'm glad I did! The show is fun, funny, sweet, and just plain cool at times. I am also in love with Kristin Kreuk (My God...what a beautiful face). I would watch the show for her alone, but thankfully the show is almost up to par with her looks. I will be watching the new season that is currently running and I will rent the remaining seasons in the future.
B000HKW7E0|5|I have watched this movie many many times with family and friends. It seems to never get old.always makes me laugh. very funny movie.
B004MC8CA2|5|It's perfect with reading plans for anyone. The app works good and the catch up feature is really nice if you get behind. I love this app.
B001GUXJQA|4|A quite old Harry Bosch that helps you understand Harry. Lots of good police work. I can't give it 5 stars because the formula is clear, but Connelly does such a good job of telling the story, you forgive him.
B00C7JG0KG|2|All the hubbub over Disney NOT including a regular blu-ray with the 3D blu-ray is pointless with this particular movie.  It's just not that good.  I got the blu-ray from Netflix and it was only OK.  I doubt that 3D would have made it a better movie.  A better script and better acting would have done that.
0061950726|5|Very interesting
B006T5FDLG|4|They're exactly that. Leftovers. I mean, for 5 bucks and you're a Metallica fan, check it out. I'm not massively impressed, but I do like Metallica - and it's no Lulu. Ha Ha ! Right ? And I'm sure they could've blended these songs into Death Magnetic and it would've worked. The first track has some \\"Fuel\\" in there. The second track reminded me a bit like Slayer's Postmortem with a Master of Puppets mid-slow section. The 3rd track reminded me of Whiskey in a Jar (reminded me) , but it's the 4th track that rips. They could've made a single from the 4th track and release it as a Maxi-cd with the other 3 as b-sides and that would've seemed more acceptable. But like I said - 5 bucks and you like Metallica. Check it out. All in all : B- .
B005CRQ3NY|5|This book is one of the Best books I have read in My entire life<br />This book is Worth Every penny
B00HDMMISA|4|This story was told in such way that the reader was able to view domestic violence, love and the mind of a 5 year old's through many perspectives. I loved this book and loved the writing.
B00T3DNKIE|2|Since I always finish a book no matter how good or bad, I read the whole thing.  I was bored out of my mind.  Couldn't wait to finish it.
B00MN9PQ9Q|5|Wonderful packaging and recommend to everyone. New to blu ray? You won't be disappointed with this one.
B00DPM7RJW|4|This was an entertaining and engaging read. I really appreciate how the author took the love triangle and made it original. I really liked the characters and their honesty. But, the major problem I always have with this author and some others in this genre is the near perfect main characters that sometimes lessen the authenticity of the story. People are complex - especially people who have been mistreated early in their lives and I feel like some of those influences were minimized especially for Sydney's character. Ridge was a bit more realistic. Some less major characters were more nuanced and realistically flawed, but Tori and Hunter's characters were sadly one-dimensional. All in all this was worth my time and an enjoyable story.
B007J4T2G8|1|Stupid.
B00R4VIDMK|1|The description should say WHAT your product is FIRST, then talk about how great it is.  You've got a lot to learn about marketing.  I downloaded this as the FAOTD for the sole purpose of telling you this.  People don't want to wade through a bunch of reviews in the description.  That's what the review section is for (who'da thought, huh?).  I was about to simply move on when I decided you needed to be educated.  I how you take this as constructive criticism.  I assume you'd like to earn money from this app.  Don't make people skip right by it.
B00HDMMISA|5|I loved this book, I couldn't wait till the end. Lots of emotional bits and all throughout the book I just couldn't wait till trivia night!
B00E8KLWB4|4|Very fun and creative
B008Y212PI|5|Very cute but captivating puzzle experience. Going to have to buy more versions of the game to keep playing! Addiction!
B000I9YLUI|5|There are many renditions of pride and predjudice but this was my favorite. The cast was perfect!<br />Matthew macfayden perfectly delivers Mr. Darcy. Kiera Knightley captures Elizabeths spunk. It is well played.
B00CWY76CC|5|The game is pretty good. Kinda slow though and not enough levels. Better than a lot of other door games I've played though.
B007EECSFA|5|This was such a well-crafted story that just kept me turning pages.  The author did an amazing job of weaving the tale together without giving too much away until the time was right.  My book club members ALL loved it--which was a first for us!
B004GUSG4M|3|After downloading the sample I was excited about reading the rest of this story! Unfortunately, as I was reading I found I was pushing myself to the next page instead of putting the book down. It seemed as all I read about was that Christine woke up every morning not know who she was and little else. The book is a little over 500 pages and I feel would have been have as long it if weren't for the constant repetition. Also, it felt as if all engines went into overdrive to finish out the story once you were 90% done with the book. The ending seemed rushed and a bit over the top, it was not very believable. How is it that over the last 20 years she had achieved little progress in her recuperation, then all of a sudden a few weeks of writing everything down, something she had attempted before, started working magic on her. Overall, I could have better enjoyed my weekend than than to have read this book. =(
B000002UAU|5|Five great songs that rarely are found on FabFour anthologies make this musical wonder a staple for any perceptive CD collector - Getting Better, She's Leaving Home, When I'm Sixty-Four, Lovely Rita and Good Morning Good Morning are these lovable tracks. Along with the four mega-hit classics also included (need not mention their names), this album gives clear evidence to the incredible talent and ingenuity this band encompassed throughout the forefront of the R`nR era.<br />Not only did John/Paul represent a phenomenal exception with their songwriting abilities, but also and with the help of George and Ringo, were in a definite class of their own as far as the appointment, organization and arrangement of original album name/covers and the quick to become household group name itself. I'm glad my ink's not running out! <br />Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band remains today among the top three studio recordings these truly gifted Lads From Liverpool came to release - Revolver and The White Album quite possibly the other two. The Beatles I believe were and still are the ultimate music icon this modern day world has and ever will come to know...
B005UG53NS|5|Out of all the Harry Potter movies the final movie beats them all! It reveals more to the story. Sad to see the saga end. Has a lot of great actors and actress. Can't wait to see what else J.K. Rowling will write.
B0095P31L6|5|Rango was a enjoyable movie. It had a few words that some might not find suitable for kids 9 and under otherwise it was a great movie. We really enjoyed it.
073933235X|5|Loved this raunchy rip of a tour through the world of (upscale) restaurant meal creation.  And what a view it is of the unique characters who wield chef's knives!  Bourdain is a great writer as well as obviously a superior/successful chef, and to top it off, his baritone voice is perfect for the audio format....great inflection, drama, humor.
0440178002|5|One of the best novels of all time.
B002ZG97EC|5|This movie is so much fun and has quickly become one of my favorites.
6305426651|5|This has got to be the greatest movie of the 20th Century.  From comedy to  drama, from romance to suspense, this movie presents all the elements that  are exppected in the movies.  Seeing life in Italy before the  &quot;War&quot; to the effects and horrors of the Holocaust, one can really  sympathize with the message of the movie.  Philosophically it presents an  abundance of elements; theologically, even more.  Anyone, from within any  age group can come to terms with what happened.  And even more it presents  an objective view of the life lived.  I prefer the Italian with the English  subtitled over the dubbed English.  Not only does it help expand one's  horizons but it helps to set the tone for the movie.
B0064J6OMO|5|It's Freaky Friday for the modern age. Minus the lame attempt to send a wholesome message. It is instead replaced by what I recognize as a *successful* attempt at a relevant and up-to-date commentary on marriage, sex, and life as a modern-day man.
B00KT3LC7I|5|Great album
B00B2V66VS|5|it is awesome better than origanal<br />Wow awesome game gigantic monkey. k love it the best game ever hope they come out with number 3
B0063GORYU|5|Easy to play.  Cards slide quickly.
0345404475|1|I should preface this review by saying that I'm a huge fan of PKD, or atleast his short fiction.  I rank him as possibly the greatest short SF writer ever.  However, his novels stink to high holy hell.<br />The book reads like 3 or 4 short stories that have somehoe been slammed together and fused into some unholy spawn of the underworld that contains almost nothing resembling a coherent story.  There's obviously supposed to be a deeper question brought up by this book of &quot;What it means to be alive&quot;, but it's horribly executed.  The characters are often placed in unlikely situations and their reactions make little sense.  The plot twists double back on themselves far too quickly for someone to actually follow.  Often times the location and surroundings randonly change in the middle of a paragraph with little to no warning.  Even the final &quot;religious revelation&quot; of the main character seems trite and cliche.  <br />There are themes of religion vs mass media, artificial vs natural life and even good vs evil, but none of these are drawn out to anything resembling a conclusion.  Some of them never get past the set up stage.<br />Overall I was incredibly disappointed in this book and would recommend against it.
B00DUGCLY4|5|Awesome game
B0053O89XI|5|Great DVD collection. One of my favorite shows. I do not watch any extras but great quality and show for a great price.
1439165653|4|Hassan Haji starts life in Mumbia, India.  His family runs a modest restaurant there.  When prejudice results in a family tragedy, the family moves to London, but the damp, cloudy city is not a good fit.  While on a family vacation in France, the family discovers the French region near the Alps and purchases a home there.  It is directly across from a gourmet French restaurant run by Madame Mallory.<br /><br /> Madame Mallory is the terror of the town.  She gets first choice at the farmers market and the butchers, and a meal in her restaurant is formal and follows specific rules.  She is appalled when the Haji family decides to open an informal, loud, spicy Indian restaurant across the street.  However, when she goes there and actually eats, she realizes that Hassan is that rare find, a natural chef.<br /><br /> She extends an offer to the Haji family to take Hassan in and train him.  He makes the hundred-foot journey over to her world, and his life journey is set.  Hassan learns all he can from Madame Mallory, then strikes out on his own in Paris.<br /><br /> Richard Morais has written an entertaining tale that will delight foodies and those readers interested in family sagas.  The book is full of stories about food and all that goes into running a successful restaurant.  The food is lovingly described, and the reader feels full and satisfied after reading this volume.  This book is recommended for readers who enjoy food and reading about it.
6303983812|4|After watching 101 Dalmations about a million times with my son, this is a nice change!  Yes, it's kind of the same story, but with cats in Paris, but still so much better than most of the junk that is being put out now.
B003YL4LYI|4|Reread book 5 to refresh my memory for the upcoming HBO season. Still a bit peeved book 6 is still being written. Love you George, hurry the hell up!
B007J4T2G8|1|This is a seriously terrible book. The characters are annoying. The writing style is about as sophisticated as a teenager's text messages. Its far too cheesy to be sexy - full of expressions like \\"I glanced up at him through my lashes\\". Really? Through your lashes? Nobody says that. Ana spends the entire book flushing, thinking \\"holy crap!\\", and rambling on about her \\"inner goddess stamping her foot\\". And Christian is just plain creepy. Who cares how rich or good-looking he supposedly is? The S&M stuff is just the top layer of that crazy parfait. But if you've already bought it, I recommend reading it with a funny accent in mind to make it somewhat entertaining.
1907698930|5|A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO ACQUIRING LAND FOR DEVELOPMENT PLUS THE RELEVANT TRANSACTION STRUCTURES – WITH ACCOMPANYING CD ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you are a lawyer acting for a property developer, you need this book, which is now available from The Law Society.  Following on from its highly regarded first edition of April 2010, this new edition has been substantially revised and expanded to incorporate a number of new developments that have emerged since the first edition was published.<br /><br />Granted, there are a number of excellent books available on property development, but as the subject is so diverse and complex, such books usually deal with only one aspect of it; easements, for example, or land options or restrictive covenants, or landlord and tenant issues.  The aim of this book however, is to cover the main aspects of this multi-faceted area of law, thereby providing the busy practitioner with a practical guide to an often complicated subject.<br /><br />Primarily the book deals with the acquiring of land and is divided into two parts under the headings of ‘Site Acquisition’ and ‘Transaction Structures.’ Part I deals with everything from preliminary investigations (including site inspection) to drainage, planning, contaminated land and obtaining vacant possession. The second section gives succinct yet detailed advice on contracts and the full spectrum of transaction documents.<br /><br />The amount of new material in this book is considerable and reflects the important changes in property law in the last four years.  As Le Chat mentions, the chapters on investigating title, planning, drainage, conditional contacts, option agreements, planning promotion agreements and collaboration agreements have all be substantially revised -- and there is a new chapter on mixed use development.<br /><br />The author also notes that it is vital for a property lawyer to have an understanding of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) which is summarized in detail in the chapter on planning.<br /><br />The book also contains a wealth of sample forms, checklists, contracts, examples of model clauses and deeds and much more, all of which have been revised and updated. These are also included on the book’s accompanying CD ROM, which can be used to adapt these materials to individual requirements.<br /><br />For those in search of further information and authorities, the book, provides extensive tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments – and for practitioners under pressure, the book is easy to navigate, with a detailed table of contents, numbered paragraphs throughout and a useful index at the back.<br /><br />This is an ideal work of reference not just for lawyers, but obviously for developers and landowners.  Indeed, for anyone involved in property development, this book in this updated edition should be considered a must-have purchase.<br /><br />The publication date is cited as at 6 March 2014.understanding of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) which is summarized in detail in the chapter on planning.<br /><br />The book also contains a wealth of sample forms, checklists, contracts, examples of model clauses and deeds and much more, all of which have been revised and updated.

B00881VLCE|1|Much to difficult to move and turn the pieces.....frustrating.  Or is it the fault of the Kindle Fire?  I haven't tried other jigsaw puzzles yet.
B002SHD9E2|2|Lush, lavish, the beauteous music. All the ingredients, but staged around Butler's inadequate singing. Questionable direction, especially in the lair and Point of No Return. This was a a complete, unsatisfactory letdown that made me return to the 35th anniversary DVD to take away the bad taste it left. Substitute Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess, and it would be far better.
B0047E6LW6|5|The music of Ghost is very difficult to convey with words. Mix 1970's metal with cheery melodies... and dark lyrics about hell, unholy rituals, and all things that go bump in the night and you got one \\"hell\\" of an album. Every song is catchy with plenty of time changes to keeep any listener from being bored, dark lyrics that are sung in such a cheerful way that you will feel like every day is Halloween when you sing along. However, if songs about Satan offend your religious sensibilities, even in a light-hearted manner, this album is not for you. For the rest of us sinners, this album is a treat to our ears. The only trick is the songs are rather short -- the album could have used longer songs, or at least another track. Aside from that one complaint, I cannot wait to hear their next album as I just cannot get enough of this band's infectious music.
B00EJU8ZIG|5|What a refreshing sound from true vocal without all the highly produced electronic sounds of current music. Great lyrics and I'm very happy with this CD
B00006I53S|4|This lense fits my needs and I like that is is fairly flexable for using for several different situations. I can take close ups and telephoto without changing.
B00170DEM8|3|Not as good as white christmas.
B00BF11UM0|4|Pretty cold blooded and one sided, but interested in the process and the conditions.
B00004RFFS|5|great product and in a timely manner., it actually got here 2 days earlier than estimated time.
1594633665|1|Not one sympathetic character in the book.  Five main characters and not one of them has any redeeming values.  If this is the world Hawkins lives in, she has my utmost sympathy.  It is one of the worst books I have read in a long time and I read a LOT of books. If you want mystery/thrillers stick with Sandford, Child, Connelly, Silva, Flynn, Baldacci, Coben, DeMille, Thor, etc.  Do not spend your time or money on this book.  You'll regret it.
B00LZXOI5E|3|Fun puzzles with enough clues to stop frustration.
B005544TRQ|5|I love this show. The &#34;Secret&#34; thing gets kind of old and I don't like that it's left hanging there often. It has witty writing, a likable cast and interesting story lines.
B00QW8TYWO|5|10/10 It's better than flappy bird!
B003719GGS|5|Excellent book to help couples stay together and keep the spice going.  This book helped me keep my relationship with my wife strong.
B000002L71|5|I love this CD!  It has songs such as Once in a lifetime, Burning down the house, etc,  and this particular version of those songs is awesome!
B00632HWOG|3|Easy to use, installed on kindle fire original, but needs littile bit of work between screen navigations and font size maybe big buttons and there are alot of settings (not sure if regular users would get to use them all) in particular allow user to swtich between pages easier.
B008XKSW7M|5|mad me laugh
B00I3ULVLQ|2|not very happy with the design, the power button notch is not bumped out at all - too difficult to find - same for the volume notches.
B00HT944D4|4|It depends on your taste, I thought the movie was just O.K., my wife loved it.  Go figure.<br /><br />Tom Hanks as Walt Disney, I thought no way, but he really pulled it off, a great performance.  I thought the story line was too long and overall the movie was just too long for the subject.  But to be honest I like action movies.
B0058VW36U|5|A real thinking game.  Makes you think about move that are coming next.  Just plain entertaining.  Kids love it too :-)
B009HEJXFS|3|This is just a movie that did not have to be made , trying to follow on something that is not there. Pretty poorly made the whole plot just not making any sense.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Could not wait for this book and was not disappointed!
B00AIUUXHC|5|Eh. I'm not impressed but my kids like it.
B00992CF6W|5|I give it 5 stars because it runs on a NABI 2, that is all I needed to get my daughter off my Ipad. simple, easy and cost effective.
B003E6LC6I|3|It is easy to get hooked on this compelling legal series.  The characters are easy to dislike but you can't quite stop watching them.
B006LSZECO|3|This book was a good read but not one of my favorites. Most likely because I couldn't \\"like\\" either of the two main characters. However, I did feel that Flynn made some great underlying points about relationships and marriage. Good book for a book club.
B0091X2K0A|3|The acting was fair. The portrayal of the Marines is combat was a joke. They seemed to have no discipline, no comprehension of the chain of command. A colonel saluting an NCO first. Apparently there were no military advisors on the set.
B00FJ3CK2Y|4|Loved the book.  Not quite as good as his previous book, &#34;The Hundred Year Old Man Who Jumped Out the Window and Disappeared,&#34; but was thoroughly enjoyable and humorous.  Characters were very well developed and truly captivating.  Can't wait for his next.
B00992CF6W|5|Minecraft is the best game ever I build big hoses and sky scrapper. I can make survival houses and make a portal to the nether.
1400069807|5|When the food industry talks about you, the consumer, they think of you as their \\"stomach share\\" and try to sweet talk you into eating more. Evidently they're succeeding, since two-thirds of Americans are overweight or obese.<br /><br />The main way they do this is by cramming the most addictive food substance, sugar - which lights up your brain very much like cocaine - and also Fat and Salt, which are nearly as addictive.  These Big 3 ingredients in processed food are the main cause of the obesity and diabetes epidemic, as well as many of the early deaths from heart disease and stroke, hypertension, gall-bladder disease, osteoarthritis, breast cancer, colon cancer, uterine cancer, etc.<br /><br />Addiction is a main theme in this book, since most people have no idea how addictive sugar, fat, and salt are.<br /><br />Processed food \\"drug dealers\\" spend an immense amount of money to get you addicted.  Frito-Lay has almost 500 chemists, psychologists, and technicians paid $30 million a year to do research to hook you on their products.  They even have a $40,000 machine that duplicates a chewing mouth to perfect their chips by finding the perfect break point (which is exactly 4 pounds of pressure per square inch).  Another 10,000 salesmen are making sure store shelves are well-stocked with their addictive wares (p 321).  Nestle's research team of 700 staff has 350 scientists and they also collaborate with other institutions (p 332).<br /><br />The biggest revelation of this book is that food processors can't lower the amount of sugar, fat, and salt.  The only way this could happen is if the government required it (as most European governments do to protect their people).<br /><br />Fat chance of that happening in the United States!<br /><br />Below are 29 reasons why food processors (and restaurants) will never lower or get rid of excessive amounts of sugar, fat and salt.<br /><br />Reason #1: Wall Street goes ballistic over health initiatives & anti-obesity campaigns<br /><br />- Wall Street drives the price of a company's stock down at news of a health or anti-obesity campaign, because they know customers will buy less of their product(s) if the fat, sugar, and salt are lowered.<br />- Kraft's anti-obesity initiative versus Morgan Stanley, Prudential securities, & 17% stock price plunge (p 257)<br />- When Campbell's soup announced that they'd be adding more salt to their soups, \\"Wall Street appreciated that Campbell was now going in what it saw as the right direction. The company's stock price closed up 1.3% that day\\". (pp 300-301).<br />- Frito-Lay assured Wall Street in private meetings that their market testing of low-fat chips to satisfy the growing outcry against the obesity epidemic was just a small part of their strategy to make snacks a larger part of the American diet (p 322).<br />- Frito Lay & PepsiCo hosted a 2 day meeting with analysts from Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, etc., that included a private box at Yankee stadium to court Wall Street (p 322)<br />- \\"Food companies are deeply obligated toward their shareholders...Making money is the sole reason they exist--or so says Wall Street...Indeed, some experts believe that Wall Street was one of the chief causes of the obesity epidemic...\\" page 338.<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of sugar:<br /><br />1) Sugar both sweetens adds bulk and texture<br />2) Sugar makes the taste of food and drink irresistible<br />3) Sugar is cheap and is substituted for more expensive ingredients<br />4) It's essential to make food safe weeks or even months after they were made.<br />5) Sugar makes food look better: donuts full of sugar fry up bigger. Cookies, crackers, and breads without sugar are \\"shrunken, pale, flat, or distended\\".  Sugar gives candy bulk, texture, and crystallization<br />6) Bread with a lot of extra sugar takes longer to go stale<br />7) Cereal with lots of sugar is crunchier, fluffier and a pleasing shade of brown<br />8) Fructose: adds to longshelf life, doesn't form crystals so soft cookies don't harden, when baked mimics the finish you'd get if cooking at home, if frozen resists turning into ice, and it's much sweeter than table sugar. More research needs to be done, but a U.C. Davis study found fructose & corn syrup raised LDL cholesterol and triglycerides 25% (but not glucose).<br />9) Did you know that the starch in potato chips might as well be sugar - it's absorbed faster than sugar, and according to Eric Rimm, associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health \\"this causes the glucose levesl in the blood to spike, and this is a concern, in relation to obesity\\". P 329.<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of fat:<br /><br />1) Lowering fat can diminish taste or texture and lower sales (p 152)<br />2) Fat is very cheap ingredient (p152)<br />3) There can never be too much fat in a product, since fat is so pleasing that the brain doesn't send a \\"stop eating\\" signal. The more fat, the better (p158)<br />4) A combination of fat and sugar is the most irresistible, plus sugar makes the fat content undetectable, so people keep on eating. So to cram more cheap fat into a product, all that needs to be done is add some sugar and people won't even realize the food is high fat. So the only way fat can be reduced is to crank the sugar level up (pp158-159)<br />5) There's no funding for low-fat alternatives. A brand manager has a limited budget. So for example, to develop a low fat peanut butter might cost $5 million, plus $40 million to test it, and if it doesn't work, you'd lose your job (p 201)<br />6) Fat gives mouth feel to corn chips, crackers, ice cream, and cookies.<br />7) When a company lowers salt, sugar, or fat, they lose \\"stomach share\\" to companies that don't, i.e. Lunchables with less fat sold poorly, added carrot and apple slices wilted and turned brown because it takes weeks for food to be make it  to grocery store shelves (yecch!) so they wereremoved.<br /><br />Occasionally I see stories that it's okay to eat a lot of salt.  On page 304, Moss mentions that Frito Lay hired \\"experts\\" to badmouth studies linking salt to high blood pressure and write about the harms of too little salt, plus paid for research to cure the harmful effects of sodium.<br /><br />So I don't know if these stories are true, or if it's a tobacco / climate change denier \\"Merchants of Doubt\\" strategy, or if it's partly true -- okay if you're young and healthy.<br /><br />But there's an undeniable connection between too much salt and high blood pressure, which can lead to congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, kidney disease, and strokes.  The reason is that when you eat a lot of salt, the sodium pulls fluids from your tissues into your blood, and the increased volume of blood makes your heart pump harder, resulting in high blood pressure. Most of the salt people get is from processed food, not the salt shaker at home.<br /><br />Salt max/day: 1,500 mg salt if you have high blood pressure, 2,300 if you don't. Average consumed now: 3,500-4,000 mg<br /><br />Why Food companies will NEVER get rid of salt:<br /><br />1) Salt's greatly intensifies and enhances the taste and aroma of food<br />2) Salt's often cheaper than water.  The very definition of processed food is cheap ingredients (and no fiber).<br />3) Salt extends the shelf life of food<br />4) Salt makes sugar taste sweeter<br />5) Salt adds crunch to crackers and other products<br />6) Without salt, sugar, and/or fat, food tastes like straw or cardboard, and it's bitter, metallic, and astringent.<br />7) Salt hides bitter flavors<br />8) Moss writes: \\"Without salt, processed food companies cease to exist\\". (p 292)<br />9) Any product with meat must have salt to avoid what the industry calls Warmed over Flavor (WOF), when meat is reheated after precooking (i.e. soups, boxed meals, etc).  The taste has been described as damp dog hair, and people can smell and taste WOF at very low levels. WOF is also associated with a bad texture that is so objectionable people spit the food out.<br />10) WOF could be cured with healthy, nutritious, fresh spices, but herbs are more expensive than salt. Campbell's soup asked Moss to consider that adding herbs to replace salt would cost more, and who would pay for that? (p 300).<br />11) There's even more salt than you realize: dozens of sodium chemicals are added to delay spoilage, bind the ingredients, keep mixtures glued together, etc.  Here are some of the additional salts to look for on the label: monosodium glutamate, sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), sodium benzoate, sodium citrate, sodium phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate.<br />12) Salt is engineered for products. Cargill makes 1.7 Billion pounds of 40 kinds of salt per year: smashed, ground, pulverized, flaked, large granules, etc.  Their popcorn salt is designed to cling to popcorn.  A very fine powdered salt is used in processed meat and cheese.  Non-caking salt is used in dry soup, cereal and flour. Their \\"flavor burst\\" salt has a unique shape that dissolves 3 times as fast as regular salt and gives your brain an immediate jolt of salty flavor.<br /><br />Some companies keep their best selling products unchanged to give the customer (and Wall Street) what they want, and also make a \\"healthier\\" version, though if you know how to read labels you'll find that the \\"healthy\\" product isn't as much so as it would appear to be.<br /><br />Red meat: 18 ounces/week is okay. There is no safe level of consumption for processed meats - for every 1.7 ounces of processed meats eaten per day your risk of colorectal cancer goes up by 21%<br /><br />Addiction<br /><br />  Taste receptors light up for sugar not just on our mouth and tongue, but all the way from the esophagus to the stomach and pancreas.<br />  Sugar addiction: kids all over the world like food with sugar twice as sweet as adults do.<br />  Fat is equally addictive according to the latest brain studies (p 149).<br />  The food industry adds more and more sugar to kid's food.  Today's kids may expect, and want food to be sweeter than they otherwise would have when they grow up. Food scientist Danielle Reed says the food industry isn't just adding calories with all this sugar, \\"they're impacting the health of that child\\" when they manipulate and exploit children's higher cravings for sugar and salt.<br />  Companies spend millions trying to get the \\"bliss point\\" of their products just right - with just the right amount of sugar, not too much, not too little.<br /><br />White flour: a chemical-laden nutrition-free & fiber-free starch/sugar<br /><br />White flour is almost a sugar since it quickly converts to a sugar in your mouth. Your saliva has lots of amylase enzyme that immediately breaks it down into a sugar (p 14).<br /><br />Mayor Michael Bloomberg tried to get food makers to voluntarily lower the salt in their food.  Breads and rolls had an average of 139 mg of sodium per ounce and Bloomberg asked for the level to be lowered to 103 mg. (p 297)<br /><br />What Moss doesn't know about is why food made with white flour that has no salt, sugar, or fat tastes bad.  My posts on Kessler's \\"The End of Overeating\\" and \\"Chemicals added to White Flour\\" at wholegrainalice explain why in more detail, but basically it's because white flour has had nearly all of the flavor and nutrition stolen after the bran & germ are removed.  That leaves nothing but a tasteless which no longer behaves like flour, so up to 30 chemicals are added, and these chemicals give flour a bad taste with metallic and bitter flavors.  Bakers have no choice but to add a lot of salt, sugar, and fat to hide these off flavors, a great deal more than people realize.<br /><br />Walter Willett, in Harvard's nutrition department accuses them of stripping away the nutritional value of food - most grains have been converted to starches. You may already know that starch is just a short step away from being sugar.<br /><br />It's ironic that Kellogg cereal is so full of sugar, because the founder John Harvey Kellogg was a health nut who ran a sanitarium where sugar was banned.  He fed his patients a roasted grain flaky concoction he'd invented that they liked well enough, but when his brother Will began adding sugar to the mix after he'd gone out of town, they came back for second and third helpings. John was furious, so Will left and started up a factory making his cereal, and it wasn't long before a former guest at the sanitarium, C. W. Post started a competing company.  It wasn't long until cereals were half sugar and even 70% sugar and by all rights ought to be in the candy aisle.<br /><br />Random disgusting facts<br /><br />  Yoplait yogurt has twice as much sugar per serving as Lucky Charms \\"cloyingly sweet, marshmallow-filled\\" cereal (p xiii)<br />  By 1960 over 1,500 chemical additives were being added to food<br />  More than any product, sugary drinks are responsible for the obesity crisis, which began with super-sizing of Coca-Cola and other sodas. By 1997 Americans drank 54 gallons of soda a year, double the amount of 1970.<br />  Two-thirds of the sugar in American's diet comes from processed food and therefore a lot of America's dental decay<br />  Processed and restaurant foods account for more than three-quarters of all sodium.<br />  Reducing sodium levels in processed and restaurant foods by 50 percent would save 150,000 lives a year<br />  It wasn't the FDA, FTC, or USDA that alerted the public to all the sugar in processed food - it was two dentists (p73-74).<br />  Philip Morris, masters of getting people addicted to tobacco, own Kraft & General Foods, where they use that expertise to addict people to processed food<br />  Processed Cheese: There's no cheese in Cheez Whiz or Velveeta (p162, 166)<br />  Winner of one of the most disgusting recipes I've ever heard of: Paula Deen's bacon-wrapped balls of macaroni and cheese deep-fried in oil (p 178)<br />  Lunchables were invented because Oscar Meyer was desperate to sell bologna and other processed meats, which people were consuming less as they became aware of the health hazards<br />  \\"Pink Slime\\": ammonia-processed beef from the parts of cows most exposed to feces with E. coli that used to go towards pet food or tallow but became a favorite of fast-food hamburger chains and the school lunch program (226-7).<br />  Nestlé's snack \\"Hot Pocket\\" has over 100 ingredients including salt, sugar, and fat several times over (with alternative names). Each had the daily limit of saturated fat and salt, and 6 teaspoons of sugar - more than the average woman should eat and 2/3 of a man's daily intake.  These have a shelf life of 420 days.<br /><br />Manipulation<br /><br />  Cereal makers spend twice as much on advertising as they do on the ingredients in the cereal<br />  Young kids are so gullible that they can't understand commercials aren't true, or understand how much they're being influenced. The average 1979 child saw 20,000 commercials between 2 and 11, half for sweetened foods (p 80).<br />  The ads targeted at children were: 3,832 sugary cereals, 1,627 candy & gum, 841 cookies & crackers, 582 fruit drinks, 184 cakes, pies, & desserts.  4: unsweetened food (i.e. meat, fish, or vegetable juice).<br />  Babies do NOT like salt until they're 6 months old, but salt is put into baby food to get them to crave salt as soon as possible, because once they're taught to like salt it has a deep and lasting effect on what they eat the rest of their life (pp 279-281).<br />  Coke's strategy: Emotional. Sell cola where special moments happen - ball parks, beaches, always within arm's reach, ubiquitous.<br />  Put images of fruit and the word fruit on packages even if there's little or no fruit at all in the product (i.e. Kool-Aid, Tang, Capri Sun).<br />  \\"Fruit Drinks\\" have juice concentrate, which is \\"entirely devoid of fiber, flavors, aromas or any other attribute of real fruit\\". It's just another kind of sugar, equally lacking in nutrition.<br />  The last thing industrial food makers want is for you to feel full, then you'll stop eating.  They've discovered that big distinct flavors are easily detected by the brain and signals are sent back that you're full quickly.  So food makers are careful to add flavors that tantalize you but not enough to make you satiated.<br />  Pages 62 through 67 describe how home economics classes in schools went from teaching how to make healthy food from scratch to using commercial products so that when girls grew up, they'd continue to eat processed food.<br />  Food researchers now use fMRI brain wave studies to find out what you really like because brain waves are more reliable than what people say.<br />  Food companies add and tout the one good ingredient they've put in and hope you'll overlook all the bad stuff that's there as well.<br />  Kellogg claimed that eating frosted mini-wheat cereal improved children's attentiveness by nearly 20%.  Not true (pp 90-93)<br /><br />Tip<br /><br />Cheese should be served in very small portions as a special treat like it used to be, not as an ingredient in food.  The same for chocolate truffles or any food high in fat and calories: eat them in small amounts directly so they can be savored.<br /><br />Miscellaneous<br /><br />Some researchers think we don't eat for pleasure so much as to avoid the more painful feeling of true hunger pain, even though we can easily go without food for a day with no problem.  So at the first sign of hunger, we eat. Our bodies make us feel lousy if we don't, and our fear of hunger is so deeply rooted.<br /><br />Sugar max/day: 5 tsp. women, 9 tsp men. Average consumed now: 22 tsp/day<br /><br />100 names for sugar (from thefoodlabelmovement.org)<br /><br />Agave nectar, Barbados sugar, Birch sugar, Barley malt, Barley malt syrup, Beet sugar, Brown rice syrup, Brown sugar, Coconut sugar, Cane juice, Cane sugar, Carbitol, Caramel coloring, Concentrated fruit juice, Corn sweetener, Corn syrup, Date sugar, Dextrin, Dextrose, Disaccharides, Evaporated cane juice, Fructooligosaccharides (FOS), Fructose, Fruit juice concentrate, Galactose, Glucitol, Glucosamine, Gluconolactone, Glucose, Glucose polymers, Glucose syrup, Glycerine, Glycerol, Glycol, Hexitol, High-fructose corn syrup, Honey, Inverse syrup, Inversol, Invert sugar, Isomalt, Karo syrup, Lactose, Levulose, \\"Light\\" sugar, \\"Lite\\" sugar, Malitol, Malt dextrin, Malted barley, Maltodextrin, Maltodextrose, Maltose, Malt, Mannitol, Mannose, Maple syrup, Molasses, Monosaccarides, Neotame, Pentose, Polydextrose, Powdered sugar, Raisin juice, Raisin syrup, Raw sugar, Ribose rice syrup, Rice malt, Rice sugar, Rice sweetener, Rice syrup solids, Saccharides, Sorbitol, Sorghum, Sucanat, Sucrose, Sugar cane, Tagatose, Trisaccharides, Turbinado sugar, Unrefined sugar, White sugar, Xylitol, Xylose<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />Moss interviewed hundreds of people for his book, and they nearly all said that the food industry will not give up salt, sugar, and fat without a major fight because they're the very foundation of processed food.  He heard this from chemists, nutritionists, marketing executives, CEOs, lobbyists and many other professionals (p 337).<br /><br />Nearly all of them avoid eating their own products (p 341).<br /><br />You'd have to be in solitary confinement for the past 40 years to not know that restaurant and processed food are bad for you.  I have no sympathy for adults, but I'm quite angry that children are the target and life-long victims of this crap.<br /><br />Nutrition should be required starting in Kindergarten, schools should have gardens, and students taught how to make meals from scratch.  To fund these programs, the FDA & USDA should be disbanded - they're useless, toothless, and governed by revolving door insiders.<br /><br />All that time you're saving buying this crap isn't exactly saving time if you die early, or are miserable from poor health.  Moss says people buy this junk because they're short on time and it's cheap, but you can cook quick, less inexpensive, healthy food at home for a lot less money and live a longer, healthier life.  An internet search of \\"fast and cheap healthy recipes\\" brings up hundreds of recipes.<br /><br />Even if you read labels it's hard to figure out how much fat, salt, and sugar is in a product, because the serving size is ridiculously low, or the sugar is in the ingredients list has 5 different kinds of sugar to try to hide how much there is.  White flour is not required to list the dozens of added chemicals, so you'll never know what chemicals were used in a product that contains white flour.<br /><br />Many companies outright lie about their products, hoping the Center for Science in the Public Interest won't notice.  Food processors aren't afraid of the USDA or FDA, who seem to have forgotten that the American public is their \\"customer\\", not the food industry.  By the time the FDA tells a company to knock it off, the company is on to a new advertising campaign anyway (p 92).<br /><br />In the future, as increasing population collides with resource and energy decline, as topsoil loses its fertility from being blown and washed away, and the last schools of fish harvested, people will be envious and amazed there was ever a time when the problem was so much food that billions of people became imprisoned within their own walls of fat.

B00BD99JMW|1|I was so excited to read this third book and find out what was outside the fence.  I did not like the writing style of this book, switching perspectives from Tris to Tobias by chapter, but without any real reason for doing so.  As others have commented, there was nothing distinguishing them other than the chapter header, nor were there any insights or different perspectives shown by using this style.<br /><br />I did not like the storyline, as it took a strange-and what felt like a thrown together-plot twist that didn't make any sense.  I echo many of the sentiments others have posted in their reviews.  This book left me disappointed, and frustrated with the way it ended.  After being so excited and engaged with the previous 2 books.... this was a huge fail in my book.
B00000IQMT|3|Before Star Wars, there was the Phantom Menace, and before tPM there was the soundtrack, which had the unfortunate problem that it ruined a large part of the ending by revealing Qui-Gonn's death.<br />John Williams did a  wonderful thing when he established the major themes in the original Star  Wars soundtracks. Unfortunately tPM soundtrack seems to lack this sort of  definite organization. The tunes are not nearly as memorable as the other  soundtracks, which leaves a lot to desire in a movie soundtrack. Still,  Williams is an excellent composer and any chance to listen to his work is a  welcome chance.

B002DQLGHU|4|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a wonderful movie that does an outstanding job at bringing the excellent story of the book to life in a way faithful to the original material.  The story unfolds in the same way in the movie as it does in the book so this is a very satisfying Harry Potter movie. The casting is fantastic. In particular,Richard Harris was a PERFECT Dumbledore. Alan Rickman's performance as Snape was on an O+ level as well. And John Willams score for this movie is a treasure to behold. My favorite movie theme music ever! I go with 4 stars instead of 5 only because the visual effects were subpar (they would be fantastic in all 7 other HP movies). I strongly recommend this movie!
B0002VFXFE|5|Well it is not that old, but nonetheless it needed some help.  It was overheating and the best I could tell from the symptoms it needed new thermal paste.  From other internet resources Arctic Silver was a good brand/product.  Purchased it, used it and now my old MacBook Pro is like new again.<br /><br />Now when I say used it, I went way deep into the dark depths of the logic board (aka as a motherboard) of the laptop.  Wiped off the old crusted compound paste and reapplied this new stuff.<br /><br />Overall I would buy again and recommend this product.
B004ZMWUCU|4|I thought Misremembered Man was well written and thought provoking.  It would be a read for a book club.  Christina McKenna portrayed the life of  this sad man like she personally knew him.
B00C9U9YOW|5|QOTSA have done what very few bands do anymore and that is create a cohesive album that is not just a collections of tracks, I think of Pet Sounds in that it tells of personal feelings, moods, experiences, you could almost say it's a 21st century Pet Sounds for the demented but also very beautiful with pure raw emotions. You can tell a lot heart and thought was put into this record and not rushed to get a consumable product out.  I think of this album as a dream with a nightmare in there and a very much moody, to get the full experience you have to watch the videos with the great artwork and illustration to get a visual picture. I see the album as their masterwork, you get a combination of the stoner rock, slower ballads that explode and rock, trippy trance like music Kalypsio (sp) one of the coolest songs, straight ahead rock with swagger Smooth sailing...just an incredible album also do yourself a favor and watch the NPR show..incredible

B00000IREA|4|If you are expecting a great film, then leave this one alone.  If you want to see Jane Fonda, in her prime, in various states of undress, then you are in luck!   The 'strip tease' at the start of the film is infamous.  If you use your 'pause' and 'stop' buttons on the DVD, you CAN see Jane's breasts a few times.   Every costume Jane wears shows off her great body.  Twice, her costume is torn up, and we see even more skin!   My favorite scene is \\"The Excessive Machine\\".  Jane is put in this 'organ' and stripped of her costume.  The machine is meant to pleasure you to death.  Jane Fonda is great here.  She sells this scene for all it's worth.  Soon, she is covered in sweat, and we get many close-ups of her face, as she gives in to the pleasure.  Jane then gives what may be the best orgasm ever in a PG film.    Again, the plot, and special effects are not that good.  But Jane Fonda's body ROCKS!
B000UNYJXQ|5|This is a sad, sad commentary on the state of health care in the USA.<br /> To be fair, it is slanted. It is a one sided account of all that is wrong with our health care system and<br />does not address anything right about it.<br />But it opens your eyes to the fact that we must make changes.<br /> It is appalling  and shamefull that these situations exist in our country.<br />We have to change our system.

B0009UC7H0|2|Hollywood moguls should be required to actually READ the books they turn into movies. This is not a bad interpretation of \\"Sahara\\" but it could be so much BETTER.  Dirk Pitt, Clive Cussler's sophisticated, clear-thinking hero..sweaty, grubby and smelly looking with a Texas twang?? Pahleeze!! Loyal, sturdy, reliable Al Giordino reduced to being a goofy sidekick?? No, No, No! And Rudi Gunn, a brilliant scientist and 2nd in command at NUMA as - what? - a college sophomore on spring break?? Just when fans think it couldn't get worse..Admiral James Sandecker, a man of power and authority, turned into a somewhat befuddled mid-management type!! EGADS!! The travesty of it all!! I implore people with intelligence and imagination to read the book.  It's WAY better.

B004CGUC06|4|Okay, I'll admit right off that I am not a Fellini fanatic.  I haven't watched his work in the past with a critical eye, nor have I made a study of his habits, tendencies, world-view, etc.  So I watched AMARCORD with essentially fresh eyes, knowing only that it was considered enough of a world classic to be presented on Bluray by Criterion.  I'm not sure I understand why it's a classic.  But it certainly was enjoyable.  Full of unbridled energy, unconcerned with narrative coherence and clearly dedicated to celebrating naughty fun, AMARCORD is a visual feast.  Allegedly, Fellini said \\"Amarcord\\" means \\"I remember\\"...but it does not.  Much like the film feels very much like a recollection a childhood gone by...but clearly is NOT realistic.  It is set in an Italian coastal village during the early fascist era (before WWII).  We basically follow one year in the life of this little town.  The camera focuses primarily on one extended family, but also visits with several other characters.  I hesitate to use the word \\"character\\" since what most of the citizens of this town are is \\"caricatures.\\"  Each actor is a visual extreme.  Whether the irate father who yells far more than is realistic (and has a HUGE mole on his bald head), or the garishly dressed town trollop...no one in the film rings quite true.  The best I can describe it is:  imagine a full grown man remembering the town of his youth, but using the world-view and libido of a teen aged boy who is simply dying to lose his virginity.  AMARCORD is full of fart jokes, crude sex jokes, and has a teen's fixation on large breasts and general mischief.  Apparently, this village was just a swirling mass of horny people!  This is not to say that Fellini has made an art house AMERICAN PIE...the movie is too cunning to be dismissed so simply.  It is so evocative of a \\"simpler\\" time...when bonfires were held in the village square to celebrate the arrival of spring, when the whole town puts to sea in rowboats with the hope of spotting a giant cruise ship coming by, when the church ran the moral show and when fascism was still mostly harmless pomp & circumstance.  We feel the pride of the people in their town and in their country (still less than 100 years old at the time).  As we follow the main characters around, we get to know them at small family gatherings, at major occasions, at weddings, at funerals, at school & work.  The entire movie is a string of incidents, only held together because we're seeing the same people over and over.  It's like we've been invited as guests for the year and our casual wanderings through the village sometimes take us to momentous happenings and other times to trivial scenes.  And occasionally, a \\"professorial\\" character will ride on his bike into our view and speak directly to us...just as though we were tourists who needed a little perspective.  AMARCORD simply does a fabulous job of capturing a time and place, as well as the character of that time & place.  It rambles often, but never runs out of steam.  It has great forward momentum all the time, and you never know what's going to happen next because it's a series of sketches.  Visually, it's quite stunning (and the BluRay is awesome) and it features some great music.  The performances are quite unrealistic, but they are all very consistent with the tone Fellini is clearly aiming for.  The movie feels utterly loose and random...yet it is clearly under the director's complete control.  To me, the \\"classic\\" label is a bit puzzling.  It's a well-made film, but seems like such a trifle too.  I don't really glean a \\"greater meaning \\" from it, nor do I find it to make some universal statement.  It's too garish and specific for that.  I give the film very high marks for achieving its own peculiar aims so well...but can't quite put it into the pantheon of 5-star films either.  The Criterion edition is stellar (although the commentary and included essay don't really enlighten as to the meaning of the film...theyfocus more on Fellini, and how his life compares to the life on the film, and how the film fits his overall body of work).  The video is superb and the sound is excellent.  Subtitles are a little better than usual (sometimes Criterion has shockingly bad subtitles.)

B0001AP12G|4|Kanye West - The College Dropout (Roc-a-fella, 2004)<br />All the talk about Jay-Z being all that the Roc's got can finally be squashed. The Midwest's own Kanye West finally drops his heavily bootlegged (but now reworked) album, The College Dropout.<br />You've read all of the reviews; they're significantly split down the middle (&quot;The greatest rap album this year!&quot; vs. &quot;The worst album of the year!&quot;). Well, it may not be the greatest (damn, the year just started), but it is a really good album. The album starts with a Bernie Mac impersonator telling Kanye to kick it for the children, only to diss him after that song (&quot;We Don't Care&quot;) is over. That song has a sped-up sample of the most overplayed song in America, &quot;I Just Wanna Stop&quot;, but the sped-up function of it makes the song more interesting.<br />If you've listened to West's past productions, you would think that this album would be full of that sped-up soul samples and would want to steer clear before it becomes overkill. But the good news is that not every song is like that, for example, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (featuring Syleena Johnson; well, actually, it's her singing two lines being repeated over and over again). Also, unless you've been living under a rock, you heard &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; and &quot;Through the Wire&quot; and you know that West can rap. Though his delivery needs a little more work, he makes up for that with heartfelt, funny, and real lyrics. There are too many lyrics to quote, but for hip-hop fans who only buy albums for lyricism, they'll be in heaven with this album.<br />Song highlights include &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; (with Jay-Z--this song sounds like Kweli's &quot;Get By&quot;) and even the long outro where Kanye explains his come-up. And for people who thought that Common fell off after catching Baduizm and dropping Electric Circus can welcome him back to his old self on &quot;Get Em High&quot; (also with Kweli).<br />Unfortunately, there are way too many skits on this album and most of them aren't even funny, especially the &quot;Lil' Jimmy Skit&quot; (I'm a college graduate and I am VERY successful, thank you). Also, &quot;Breathe In, Breathe Out&quot;, &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;, and &quot;School Spirit&quot; are all mediocre. But this album is still a winner. We're not talking Illmatic, It Takes A Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back, or The Chronic status, but maybe Midnight Marauders status. Meaning that The College Dropout isn't the BEST, just the best compared to everything else out here now. -EJR

B00A8ECU24|5|When I was say younger then 5, I loved my little pony. I would line them up along my room and play with them. They made me feel good, comfortable, and happy. I went to my little pony live when they had the worldest biggest tea party. I told my parents, &quot;All my dreams have come true.&quot; I still have that DVD. I will never eve  get rid of my little pony toys or my movies. This game is very fun, the bugs that eat every thing that are cute are a little hard to get rid of. I have had this for about 2 nights and I'm a level10 a growing.

B005LAIIHG|5|Made good use of my AMC pass on Sunday and went to see the movie: \\"Life of Pi.\\" This is an intense movie no question about it. Half the time I kept wondering 1. if it was possible to survive a shipwreck (Elian Gonzalez) and 2. Life with a tiger on a lifeboat (?) and what would I have done in such a situation.<br />To me this movie was a mix between \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" meets \\"Castaways\\" (Tom Hanks) meets \\"Avatar\\", Hmmm. I was very pleased with the depiction of the Roman Catholic Church, it was complimentary for once...this time there were no demons, and Holy water didn't scald; there were no exorcisms or ugly gargoyles.-but a message of love and serenity  accepting the challenges of life with the help of Jesus the son of God. Beautiful.<br />The scenes involving the animals ( both before the shipwreck and after), were difficult to watch ( I closed my eyes) and yes I cringed with the scenes involving the Hyenna, but recovered because I was curious to see the rest. The Bengali tiger scenes were well done and I enjoyed the beauty of this animal. This savage beast was symbolic of our own human resilience, and I found found myself cheering for him to survive and felt sad for him, too...wow. the Bengali tiger reminded me of dog of mine, a Siberian Husky, who was alpha male, intelligent and very high maintenance.<br />I picked this movie over the others at the movie theater because of its length as well. At just a bit over 2 hours it was the right amount of time to sit for me. Still, I missed a bit at the end because I had to go to the ladies room. ( The movies are getting longer and longer nowadays and I prefer to sit for a play if it's more than 2 1/2 hours with the luxury of a break for intermission.<br />The 3-D experience was new to me, I haven't been interested in anything 3-D before..the scene with the fish as if floating out out of the screen was awesome...and the glowing flower, wow I can't top that. I was removing my 3-D eyeglasses from time to time to see whether there was a marked difference....I can't say I will watch  it in 3-D again, but certainly will watch it over and over at home when it comes out on DVD or Blue Ray.

B00TU9UFTS|2|Aims high, but ultimately misses. Nolan tries to tell a Kuprik like story using Michael Bays tool set. It's actually a fascinating compelling and well crafted movie... So long as none of the characters are actually speaking.  The ending has to be experienced for yourself to fully fail to understand wtf is going on and seemingly steps inside a Terry Pratchett novel.I kept waiting for the Librarian to show up.<br /><br />At the end of the day, It's mostly pretentious fluff. The characters while haveing relationships don't feel particularly compelling or empathetic to the audience and it's just meh. Go rent The Martian instead. You'll thank me.

0385534639|5|A delicious, sugar-spun tale with timeless elements which ring so true that it has the feel of a classic. It made a reveur of me, and I will wear my red scarf with pride. Although its magical qualities reminded me of Like Water For Chocolate and The House of Spirits, it deserves an enchanted circus tent all to itself. For beauty alone, this is my top pick of 2011.

B003UESJDI|4|TAMARA DREWE already had a following from her appearance in the best selling graphic novel by the same name by Posy Simmonds, an so it was probably not too difficult for the talented Stephen Frears to direct a pitch perfect cast to bring the delightful story to the screen.  Filled to the brim with excellent actors this strange little story has many levels of meaning, but the main story is very well served.<br /><br />Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton) was historically a face to forget in the town of Ewedon, but she leaves for the city and plastic surgery and returns with a new nose and facelift that makes her as attractive as any lass in the town. She plays on the talents of married highly successful crime novelist Nicholas (Roger Allam) to polish her writing skills - the cost is an affair that leaves Nicholas ready to divorce his perfect wife (Tamsin Grieg).  She also attracts the interest of her childhood solid friend Andy (Luke Evans) and the rather superficial and silly rock star Ben (Dominic Cooper) and eventually, with the running of interference by two loathsome little girls (Charlotte Christie and Jessica Barden), and it all turns out with many surprises!  It is a dissection of relationships a la Thomas Hardy and Frears know how to make it all work very well.<br /><br />It is always a pleasure to be in the company of fine British actors in a lovely English countryside setting and this is no exception.  Everyone in the cast is excellent - and it continues to be a pleasure to watch the very talented Dominic Cooper grow in the challenging roles he assumes.  There are many reasons to enjoy this film, and among them is the sheer craftsmanship of the British cinema.  Grady Harp, December 11

B00005JNEI|3|Alright for the most part this is a failry decent movie and attack on Bush. I myself support Bush but i still saw this movie to see the other side. There are a few moments where the film got funny when Bush was first in office and they asked him what hes goin to do and he responds \\" Well you'll see im singing stuff and making some decisions, you'll see.\\" Now that got me cracking up, but while he was firts in office there realy is not a lot you can do ohter then sit there so i dont blame the man. <br /> <br />  However when Bush found out abut the attacks while he was in that classroom he did just sit there when he found out, yet by his face expresions he appeared to be in shock. Perosnally i thnk anyone would be also. He did not look to intrested in reading that book anymore and appeared he was thinking on what he could do. Now This movie was only made for Bush to look bad and there are plenty of good things to say about the guy, even tho this war in Iraq is complete crap, at least let Bush finish what he started and not let Kerry take over and try to finish it becuase that will lead toa failed mission. <br /> <br />  I still support President Bush this movie only shows the bad, well if i were anyoen also look at the flip side because im sure there is a lot of good just not seen. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br />

B000087OR2|3|I was blown away when I heard &quot;Don't know why&quot; for the first time on the radio.  I was even more impressed that they were playing something in the jazz idiom on a pop radio station.  I immediately went out and bought the album.  To say the least, I was more than a little disappointed with the rest of the album.  It certainly wan't because the songs were of poor quality, but after a while they all sounded the same.  It's a shame that Norah Jones doesn't try to expand into something a little more up-tempo, or perhaps something with a latin rhythm?
0345803485|5|This is a good book and a great read, differently different and I love the cover of the book. Awesome.
1594203059|1|The book attempts to define what we call Western Civilization and provide the answer to the (mythical) Rasselas's question \\"By what means ... are the Europeans thus powerful.\\" The book contains a lot of material but it is poorly organized and I did not find any new arguments in it. The historical fact is that until the early fourteenth century Western Europe was lagging not only the remote Chinese empire but also the Muslim states of the Middle East. The following story is indicative. In 799 the famous Caliph Harun al-Rashid received an embassy from Charlemagne. When the embassy went back it carried Harun's gifts that included a clock that was the source of amazement amongst the Europeans. During the Arab Golden Age (roughly 750-1250) learning and the arts flourished. But that came to an end while at the same time Western Europe was waking up.<br /><br />Ferguson provides six factors that underpin Western civilization: Competition, science, property rights, medicine, the consumer society, and the work ethic. However these factors are not independent and it is clear that some of them are the fruits of learning and commerce. Furthermore the author wanders around when he discusses each of the factors. For example the chapter on Science contains a long discussion of the second siege of Vienna by the Ottomans in 1683 even though science did not figure out in the outcome of that war. The Ottomans were not well prepared but they had hoped to take advantage of the religious disputes in Europe getting some Protestant Hungarians to join them against the Catholic Hapsburgs. That alliance produced little and at the end the Ottomans were defeated by the Polish cavalry that came to the aid of Vienna. (I rely on Caroline Finkel's book \\"Osman's Dream\\" for my account of the siege.)<br /><br />When Ferguson finally gets down to discuss Science he makes a blunder by stating that in Christianity Church and State have been separate because of fundamental Christian tenet stated in the Gospel of Matthew. But that tenet (together with much of the Gospels) has been violated in practice.  The Roman emperor Constantine I presided over a synod of bishops that defined in detail the minutiae of the Christian faith (Nicean creed). About 50 years later the Roman emperor Theodosius I made that version of Christianity the ONLY religion of the Roman Empire. This is a quote from the Imperial decree: \\"It is our pleasure that all the nations which are governed by our clemency and moderation should steadfastly adhere to the religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Romans, which faithful tradition has preserved, and which is now professed by the pontiff Damasus, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of apostolic holiness ......  Besides the Condemnation of Divine justice, (non believers) must expect to suffer the severe penalties which our authority, guided by heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them.\\" (The quote is from Gibbon's book, Chapter XXVII.)  This passage is instructive not only because it puts to rest any claims of separation of church and state but also because the Pope Damasus is listed in the same level as the bishop of Alexandria. The Pope did not become independent of the emperor and the main Christian authority until several centuries later when Alexandria fell under Muslim rule and around that time the Roman emperors lost control of Rome. (Ironically, their state continued to be called the Roman Empire, although modern historians refer to it as the Byzantine Empire.)<br /><br />This is certainly the worst but not the only flaw in Ferguson's analysis. My main criticism is that there is no effort to find the underlying cause for the Renaissance that later gave birth to the Industrial Revolution. Ferguson points out the importance of the Rule of Law but the question remains. Why did the rule of law take root in Western Europe and not elsewhere? Fareed Zakaria (in his book \\"The Future of Freedom\\") has pointed out that in resource rich states the rulers become wealthy by selling resources (oil is a prime examples) while in resource poor states the rulers acquire wealth by taxing their subjects, so it is in the ruler's interest to have affluent subjects. That is however a modern classification and the rule of law did not always exist in Western Europe.<br /><br />The best explanation for rise of the West I have read comes from Gibbon. He states that the Crusades decimated the Western European ruling classes and that led to the establishment of the rule of law. For example, the Magna Carta was granted in 1215, past the halfway point of the era of the Crusades (1096-1272). Gibbon writes (Chapter LXI) \\"The estates of the barons were dissipated ... Their poverty extorted from their pride those charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters of the slave, secured the farm of the peasant and the shop of the artificer ...\\" He concludes the section with a metaphor: \\"The conflagration which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest gave air and scope to the vegetation of the small and nutritive plants of the soil.\\"<br /><br />This leaves unanswered the question of what caused the end of the Arab Golden Age. The most direct answer is the rise of religious conservatism in Islam. The story of Ibn Rushd (1126-1198), known to Europeans as Averroes, is instructive. He was a physician who wrote a seven volume medical encyclopedia and a physicist who first expressed what it became known later as the law of inertia. He achieved high positions and was a favorite of the emir Abu Yusuf al-Mansur to whom Averroes dedicated his \\"Commentary on Plato's Republic.\\" But in 1195 Abu Yusuf dismissed Averroes from his high office and sent him into exile in order to appease the Islamic jurists and theologians who did not like Averroes' rationalism.<br /><br />One could argue that the Crusades caused a rise in militancy and conservatism in the Muslim world that in turn caused the suppression of intellectual pursuits. At the same time the Crusades removed an impediment to progress from Western Europe. Progress requires freedom to experiment and make mistakes that authoritarian rulers are not going to tolerate. Ferguson quotes an Ottoman writer who stated that \\"the people of Turkey excel all other peoples in their nature of accepting rule and order.\\" (p. 86). Ferguson misses the chance to point out that this \\"praiseworthy\\" quality was exactly what kept the people of Turkey back.<br /><br />The view that irreverence is a prerequisite for innovation is expressed today in efforts of non-Western nations to emulate Western innovation. A recent issue (Nov. 26, 2011) of the Economist described how that realization is coming into play in the recently established Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology.me wealthy by selling resources (oil is a prime examples) while in resource poor states the rulers acquire wealth by taxing their subjects, so it is in the ruler's interest to have affluent subjects.

B00BB8SKPW|3|It was a decent movie but any that starts off with a naked women for first 10 minutes makes me crazy. Seriously in this day and age do we still have to go n for this kind of gratuitous image
B00CO7FLJM|4|I admire strong women in novels.  Our heroine in this one is not.  This premise of the story was good - and it kept me guessing.  Even more Interesting was what I learned in the epilogue - a lot is discussed here that I didn't even pick up in the novel.  The writing style is very good for the time period in which it was written and it immersed me in the time period and Manderley.  If you enjoyed Jane Eyre, give this a shot.  And our heroine?  Grows up a lot and becomes a women even I admire by the end.

B001FB55I0|2|The Bottom Line:    Between the lack of attention paid to the previous films in the series, dumb storyline riddled with plotholes (why don't the machines just kill Kyle Reese when they have him in a cell?) and vacant performance by Sam Worthington, there's a ton of problems with this latest (and hopefully last) Terminator film; whether you're a fan of the original series or a neophyte, there's really no need to watch this sorry excuse for a film.    2/4

B0069JBKHI|4|i like it; there must have been some improvements since some of these ratings came out. there is a tiny delay on the monitor (like 3 seconds or less), which may be more because of my wifi than the monitor. the only thing i find not super helpful is that the temperature gauge is a little off, and therefore i would think the humidity gauge is also off. not sure if it's my monitor or a problem with all monitors. we found it difficult to buy a room space heater because we couldn't tell which thermometer was wrong (turns out it's probably a little of both -- we tried fancy meteorology equipment [my husband is a meteorologist] and the actual temp was somewhere in the middle). however, i left this morning while my baby was upset and it was great coming to work, turning on the app, and hearing movement but no crying anymore. very useful!

B00003CXI1|1|I loved the books.  I loved the movie.  My kid was rivited to the seat during the entire thing.  Then we tried to find the Never-Before-Seen footage that's supposed to be part of the package.  Let me warn you - thus far I've been unable to find any trace of the Never-Before-Seen footage on either of the DVD's in the set.  It's just not there.  There's no menu item pointing to it, and there's no indication of that content being on CD2 either.  If your hopes are up on seeing that extra footage, this DVD is not for you.  My son is very disappointed.  This disc contains no movie previews for other features and strangely enough, it lacks the FBI copyright message as well.  If you like to collect movies and want to add Harry to your collection, I'd advise waiting until WB updates the disk menus and includes the features they've left out.

B00008977N|5|I caught this concert on television a few months ago and knew I would end up getting it cause it's Peter, right? I am so glad I did. I have probably watched it all the way through at least 20 times. Am I obsessed? Well maybe, but I've been watching it while walking on my treadmill every morning for over a month. I still see things I didn't and hear things I hadn't caught. Tired of it? I don't think so. I love the music and the band is really cool and fun to watch as well as Paula &quot;I don't want to wait&quot; Cole. Oops, that was bad, sorry. (-:

0446528056|2|...was because Amanda Seyfried of HBO's \\"Big Love\\" was in the movie (which I have yet to see) and the fact that I used to be a fan of Sparks, but stopped reading his work after the atrocious \\"The Wedding\\".    Let me say, his titles have no punch (\\"The Notebook\\", \\"The Wedding\\", \\"The Choice\\", etc.).  He should be thinking along the lines of \\"Gone with the Wind\\", \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\", or \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", to name a few.  Those were memorable titles, and yes, they were the only successful novels by those authors, but I say it's better to write one Great American novel than it is to write ten mediocre novels (though the latter is more profitable), but hey, it's a living.    I did get into this book, though the hook, as so-called writing experts call it, was nonexistent.  Mr. Sparks uses his name, his brand, to sell his stories--he no longer needs a hook because his preexisting fanbase are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.  The writing is poor and though the dialogue is believable, it's dreadfully dull.  All John and Savannah do are go on a series of dates (don't people ever do anything but go out to eat on a date?), argue and write letters to each other, few of which we read, but which I don't mind--I'm not a big fan of reading a bunch of italicized love letters, even in a love story, so I'm not complaining about that.    You know a love story is boring when the relationship between John and his father was much more interesting.  I had never heard of Asperger's syndrome (which is why I found it unbelievable that John's father, whose name I have already forgotten, was able to father a child).  I believe that John finally having a relationship with his father was worth his whole coin collection, for if Savannah did nothing else for him, she did do that, and I think it was a little nuts how John went off on her when she just mentioned that he might have the condition.  I did think John totally overreacted about that, like his father being less thanperfect was some kind of sin, when Savannah was just trying to be a friend.  I mean, what if she thought his father had cancer and didn't tell him?  As it turned out, she really helped John understand his father, which led to the mending of their relationship.    I did think John was pretty dense that he thought his father was normal with a few quirks.  No normal person, no matter how quirky, acts like that.      I thought John belonged more with Lucy than Savannah.  Savannah was okay at first, though her going into detail about her almost-rape after just knowing John for a couple of days was weird.  She wasn't a very smart girl if she accepted an open drink at a party, soda or not.  I've never even been to a party where there's been any drinking, and I am not nearly as naive as this girl.  That's why I don't go to those parties.      The author tells us that this girl is religious, but I got more of a spiritual vibe from her--religious people don't have sex before marriage, or at least they don't plan it.  CAUTION:  SPOILERS AHEAD!!!  I thought it was crummy of her to dump him for re-enlisting after 9/11?  Such patriotism would make me fall even more in love with him, but no, obviously she couldn't wait just nine more months, or even marry him on his furlough.  It wasn't like she was thirty-nine and her biological clock was about to time out or anything.  The whole premise just didn't make sense.  She didn't even love Tim the same way.  Was it the sex?  Did she feel obligated because he had picked her up and taken her away from a bad situation, what?    I couldn't dislike Tim--I couldn't blame him for going after Savannah, but why did he wait until John was serving his country to steal his girl?  He seemed to take advantage of Savannah's loneliness.  Why didn't he pursue her before she met John?  It was like he was content to have her as a friend until she found someone else, and then all of a sudden, he had to claim her.  His (Tim's) illness really seemed contrived, and I think John was a truly selfless person for doing what he did, but he needs to get over Savannah and find another girl who would be loyal to him.  I actually thought him and Lucy would get together, but that isn't implied--it's rather implied that John will pine for Savannah forever, which would be fine if she was worth pining for, but she isn't.      I did agree with John about going out with her friends all the time when he was on furlough, just so she wouldn't get too close and be too sad when he left.  How selfish!  I really think the only reason she married Tim was because she didn't love him, not in that way anyway.  She had never had a serious relationship before in her life, and didn't know how to handle it, so she settled.  Well, I hope she's happy!    Dear John, it's time to move on.

B00DPM7TIG|5|While I found this book extremely slow the first 100 pages, once I got into the book, I loved it.  Taking place in Paris, and other areas of France, it gave a different perspective of the reign of the Nazi party during WWII.  Full of the villains of the Nazi party, it also showed the humanity of those swallowed by the party, only as a means to survive.  While there was fiction interwoven in the story, it was very easy to relate to each characters goal of surviving, and regaining a life after the atrocities no one was immune to.
B00005R2M3|5|When I first saw Shakira's video for Whenever Wherever I knew she would be something special. The video was great and the song was amazing as well. I really liked the first two singles of Shakira's released. Whenever Wherever, an up-beat lively song and Underneath You Clothes, a slower, calmer song, are two of the best on this CD. Once you listen to this CD a few times, you'll really like it. Laundry Service includes a variety of upbeat songs, dance songs, and songs about love. The lyrics are great and usually pretty funny. Unlike Britney Spears, Shakira is very talented and her music is written by talented people including the song &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; which is written by Gloria Estefan. &quot;Fool&quot; is another great song with great guitars and vocals. &quot;Fool&quot; is song that you can easily relate to.<br />If you are looking for a great CD form a GREAT singer, go out and get Shakira's debut album Laundry Service. You'll be glad you did!

B00FQMVCEA|5|I'm so glad there is another movie my son can watch without princesses or violence! Perfect for my little guy (he's almost 4) and even his sisters like to watch it! My husband and I even got some laughs out of it. Great for a young family movie night - especially when you don't have all girls!
B002MQYOFW|5|I had my reservations about reading this book despite all the recommendations to do so. When I originally read the plot, I wasn't sure that I wanted to read a book about kids killing other kids. I am so glad that I did in fact read it. I couldn't put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. It didn't contain the morbid content that I thought it might. For the most part, any violence was handled tastefully, if you can say that. It's hard not to fall in love with the characters. Suspense readers will not be disappointed, and neither will romantics. Can't wait to see the movie now!
B001TCHDPS|5|Great cd
B002KVCA1O|4|GOOD RE MASTER. GREAT SONGS.
006202406X|2|I finally finished the third book of the Divergent series, Allegiant. I didn't plow through the book by any means, but instead read it over the course of about two months.<br /><br />Over those two months, I have to say my final review of the book is mediocre. Allegiant as a stand alone book MAY be okay - but as the third book in conclusion of a series? Not okay.<br /><br />First, the way the book is written is disorienting and confusing. Roth switched back and forth between Tris and Tobias' perspectives. Since I read the book over two months, however, this proved more confusing than interesting. At times I read Tobias thinking that it were Tris - and other times I read Tris thinking it were Tobias. I couldn't enjoy the plot.<br /><br />That brings to the second point - the plot. Like I said - the plot MAY have been a good standalone plot. Allegiant's plot, though, is incredibly different than the first two books. Essentially, furthermore, the nature of the plot semi-disregards the plot of the first two. All of a sudden the plot of Divergent and Insurgent don't matter in Allegiant - they'r just the &#34;things of the past.&#34; This was sad to see, because I feel Roth worked very hard to develop that world and conflict.<br /><br />I will not go into plot holes or mistakes I believe Roth made. Through poor character development (I didn't know who was who half the time - nor did I feel the need to care) and unrealistic plot advancements, I have to give the book a 2/5.<br /><br />Was it entertaining? Sure. But don't think too much into it.
B00066N8JS|5|As everyone else has pointed out this a great album and an absolute NIN classic, but what no one else has mentioned is that this cd was written as a soundtrack for George Lucas' film THX 1138. Start the cd as you see \\"Directed by George Lucas\\" go off the screen and sit back and enjoy the film and c.d with a new perspective. The c.d ends short of the film and that's when you pop in either of the further downward spirals to finish of the film in two different ways.

B003Y5H59W|4|I rarely watch movies in theaters anymore, because I just don't enjoy most of the ones coming out nowadays.  Still, I heard from a reliable source that this movie was good, so I checked it out.  I figured it might tingle my Catholic sense the way Spider-man 2 did, or it might not, the way Iron Man did.  Still, I knew there was a chance that it might really be good.  I love the true-blue hero types like Captain America, and I love the older comic books on which this kind of adventure is based, so I checked it out.    First, let me start off by saying that the movie gets a lot right.  A period piece set in the times of the 1940s near the end of the second world war, a wimpy little guy called Steve Rodgers wants to be a soldier more than anything, but no matter what he tries, he just can't seem to pass the army's tough recruitment guidelines.  Enter a military scientist; originally from germany, who promises to give him a chance to be in the army, by means of an experimental formula, which amplifies all the natural powers of his body to the absolute peak of human potential and, perhaps, beyond.  Rodgers undergoes the procedure and becomes Captain America; fighting in the war to protect his friend Bucky, and the other brave soldiers on the front lines.  Much action and adventure ensue.  This ultimately leads him into conflict with the Red Skull; a supervillain in charge of Hydra; a nazi splinter-group that uses advanced technology derived from a strange, recently-discovered power source.    The list of differences between this movie and the comics it was based on would go on for days, and don't really matter anyway.  In the comics, Bucky wore a costume too, but his role was otherwise the same, and frankly, I agree with this change.  Bucky didn't undergo the procedure, so it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for him to be CA's sidekick in a movie like this one.    The content of this movie pleased me greatly in some ways.  There was relatively little cursing, theviolence and death didn't get gorey (though in a story about war, there will never be a lack of death,) and the closest thing to sexual content was a woman yanking CA's necktie and kissing him.  The action is a little goofy at times, and overall, is has about the same vibe as a cartoon with more military types in it, which will appeal to some, and not to others.  I know some who were hoping this would be a legitimate war movie, but I don't see how it could have been.    The dialogue is rather standard fare, and the characters aren't terribly deep.  There's not much soul-searching, and the villain is rather two-dimensional.  In short, it wasn't Spider-man 2.  That said, I loved it, because this kind of storytelling really was popular a couple generations ago, when characters didn't have to be deep or excessively-complicated to be interesting.  Archetypes are strong and rarely deviated from in this movie, and I consider that a good thing, since when you get down to it, that's really what Captain America is about.  He's an archetype for the virtuous soldier.  Seeing him in that light, a whole slew of other things about the movie become clear.    On one level, the main character demonstrates tremendous courage, strength of will, dedication, humility and care for his fellow man, yet he knows what kinds of tough choices have to be made in a time of war.  He's moral to a tremendous degree, which is enough by itself to impress me, but the film has other things hidden in it as well.    In one scene, the doctor explains his reasons for choosing Rodgers as his subject; because he believed that strong men become used to their strength, and always want more, but weak men know the value of strength, and how to be good and true.  I don't care whether this was intended or not; this line sets up the rest of the movie as an allegory for Heaven; where only the most virtuous, couragious, humble people will go to be glorified, and receive new bodies, which can be used to help others.  That put a smile on my face when I thought of it in that light.    Still, the movie isn't without its downsides.  The hydra group takes center stage as the villains very early on, and seems to be just about the only group of nazis that cap fights.  Maybe I misread that, but I felt like this was an attempt to sort of pidgeonhole our hero into his own little world, so he doesn't bother the rest of the war going on.  I would have preferred to see real nazis with real villain motivations, or even a thorough characterization of Hitler, but that might have been too much to ask for, considering the direction that modern world events are taking.    There's one thing I'm sure of; this is a good movie, because it's a movie about good people doing good things.  It's no masterpiece, doesn't go too far into its characters, and the war action is, I feel, disrupted a bit by the odd technology being thrown around, but it's still a good film, and that's so uncommon nowadays, that I don't feel it would be right of me to give it less than four stars in any category.  It may not be very thought-provoking, but it's got its soul in the right place, and I couldn't be happier about it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|4|This is a readable and I think accurate summary  of one point of view.  Tells me more about Jesus humanity and Paul's influence on the New Testament than I had known.  Especially impressed in the  progression through the evangelists of Jesus relation to John the Babtist.  Also impressed with author's theory that most of the &#34;errors&#34; Paul talked about came from James
B00000AFDW|4|Bringing old bandmates, Ace and Peter, was a tough one for me, because I  felt the previous drummer and guitarist (Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick) were  superior musicians who are much more interesting contributors to Paul  Stanley and Gene Simmons' songs. Check out previous--neglected--CD,  Carnival of Souls, great tunes that showed KISS continuing to evolve after  20+ years. Psycho Circus has some great tunes on it, the title track,  Simmons' tunes, &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;We Are One&quot;. Peter Criss'  ballad is such a wannabe &quot;Beth&quot; that it's sick. That's probably  the song that will be released. Ace makes a solid contribution to the  album, but I can't help wondering if this album would have been better with  the previous guitarist and drummer. Still, the CD lives up to  standards--KISS standards--pretty well.
B00794ML3Y|5|I didn't know what this was about when I turned it on. Pleasantly surprised. Very addicting.
B00003CXBK|5|This is another must have for your collection, even if you are not knowledgeable enough about Japanese culture and history to catch the nod toward the Ainu plight that is made.

630529142X|5|\\"Water's better than gatorade\\", \\"but mommy said...\\" are just a few of the waterboy's catch lines from the Waterboy. This is definately one of Sandler's best known movies. Here he stars as a waterboy who claims that water is always better than gatorade...only to be knocked out or teased by the football players. But when Bobby (Sandler) makes a great play in football, he becomes a \\"legend\\". This is a must for any Adam Sandler fan!!!
B00FWPWNKS|3|All in all this game is great. Its asethically pleasing, simple enough for anyone to play, and is a great time killer. However, there is one fatal flaw and the basis for my 3 star rating. During levels it is beneficial to you to combine the flower with the \\"double fruit\\" for a power combo that clears the majority of the board. In the later levels and more difficult settings its extremely hard, if not impossible, to finish the level without this combo. Unfortunately, the game will freeze 9/10 times when you use this combo. The graphics are too much for it to take. The menu won't freeze and all other things are still available to do (such as pulling up the menu, going to the title screen, etc) but game play is not. It is just stuck. This can be extremely frustrating. This happens on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 8.0, LG G2 phone and Galaxy Tab 3 7.0. Definitely need a fix for this and then I can justify 5 stars.
1558807381|5|The review by Amazon states that this film is &quot;flawed&quot;, but I fail to see in what way.  I've owned a copy of the videotape since it was first released and I think it's wonderfully directed and masterfully  executed.  The story line is unique - a real departure from the standard  fairytale genre, and the message it sends is worth listening to.  If there  is any flaw in its production, that might only be that certain scenes  &quot;below ground&quot; in the &quot;devil's lair&quot; are a bit dark and  harder to see.  However, the special effects are excellent for their time  (we're talking 1986 here, folks), the music is good and the story contains  sufficient surprize twists to keep an adult viewer (to say nothing of  children) interested.  It's not a fairytale for small children however.   The theme and plot line are too sophisticated for kids under age 10, in my  opinion.  Buy it!  You'll like it!
B00005AXEL|5|This album shows the ever present creative genius of the mystical high priestess of rock and roll. Trouble in Shangri La is a lush mix of sweet love songs, hard driving rockers, and even a country ballad. This is a cd for anyone who likes good rock and roll because it has a little something for everybody. I have to admit I was a bit nervous about this album after 1994's less than impressive release, &quot;Street Angel&quot;, but after listening to just the first song I knew Trouble... was a gem. It shows Stevie's voice in top form as well as her unparalleled ability in songwriting. The lyrics are torn straight from the pages of her journals, which she has again shared with her fans. My only small complaint is that there surely was room for a few more fast paced songs.But hey, nothing is perfect. From the heart felt &quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Too Far From Texas&quot; to the tech rocking &quot;Planets of the Universe&quot; this album is sure to be a winner. This is by far her best work since &quot;Bella Donna&quot;. Good Going Stevie!

B000YIGNKE|1|I'm afraid there were few redeeming points to this production of 'Persuasion.'  So I'll start there.  Costumes:  Great  Cinamatography: Very Good  Actors: They could have been very good had the screen play been any good.    I kept commenting to my husband that I felt I needed a neck brace since the pace of the story was so quick.  It was so quick, there was no way to get to know the characters.  Jane Austen is probably the English Languages best female writer.  She draws her characters so well that you feel you know them.  You either like them, hate them, or endure them - just like in real life.    This production was poorly done, none of the characters resembled who they were.  to make an analogy - it's like watered down skimmed milk.  Ick.  Captain Wentworth had no depth, and Anne Elliot was so hopeless, she seemed of no use to anyone.     If you did not see this version of 'Persuasion' save yourself the trouble.      See the one acted by Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root in 1995.  [[ASIN:B00003JRCQ Persuasion]]   It's only 2 hrs long (approx) and even at that short lenght is faithful to the story.  Captain Wentworth has true feeling ... always watching from under his eyelashes without Anne ever knowing.  He is galant, and the abiss of his true emotions are just below his finely chisseled features.  Excellent!!
B00FAPF5U0|4|Keeps me entertained... I don't like that the harder levels do not provide more lives... Takes too long to move forward
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Excellent novel.  I couldn't put it down!
B001L63JC8|5|A must-have for me. I'm surprised (I suppose I shouldn't be) at how different it sounds compressed. My vinyl copy got broken during a messy break-up (What kind of woman goes after a guy's defenseless records?) but I think I remember way more spatial detail than there is here. Must have been the acid.

B0007GAERG|5|Mariah out did herself on this one!  This CD is tha bomb.  I don't see how/why people are trying to compare this album to JLo's...that is like comparing a hamburger to a filet mignon.  Highly recommend this album!
B00HWWUQWQ|4|Entertaining by not spectacular.
B00005JOFO|5|This film was an exceptional experience. It gave us a view into a deeply emotionaly love that was difficult for it participants to express or at points to even recognize and yet it held them together for nearly 2o years. Ang Lee showed us how love could be a \\"Force of Nature\\" almost having a life of it's own. I was deeply moved and will long be haunted by the characters in this film whom have become dear to me.

B000002J2F|5|Sadly though,  It will be the last time they have one.  Not to say they didn't deliver strong albums after,  They would just never be of this caliber again.  1980 found genesis merging from progressive rock into pop rock.  Duke became the bands transitional album.  This is a definitive symphonic progressive rock album.  The band is incredibly tight for this album and give the listener a variety of tones and styles that never gets dull.  One will notice a strong Phil Collins vibe during a few of the songs that would have probably sounded more at place on one of his solo albums.  His couple of songs are my least favorite but do not distract to much from the overall classic Genesis effect.  There is still a heavy dose of classic genesis to be found on Duke.  This CD seems to get better each time you listen to it.  It is so intricate and an example of how effortlessly Genesis were able to grow and change with the direction of popular music.  This would probably be considered \\"selling out\\" to some however,  given the fact that they were able to maintain most of their original sound while still doing music that would actually chart said a lot about their creativity.  Take David Bowie for example,  Does the Ziggy Stardust album sound anything like Lets Dance.  Genesis would become an even more \\"commercial\\" band after duke but at this point they were still the Genesis most new and loved.  I would put this in my top 5 Genesis albums including the Gabriel era, and that's saying a lot.
0231161174|5|The book is well written and informative.  Do not read the book like a novel, take time to insert notes in the margins.
B000002INJ|5|Manowar is the most perfect fantasy heavy metal band out there... there just is no substitute.  Eric Adams is one of the most brilliant vocalists i have ever heard (He is only rivaled by Bruce Dickinson of self-titled band  and Iron Maiden, Joacim Cans of Hammerfall, Tom Araya of Slayer, and  Michael Kiske of Helloween).      Manowar preaches brotherhoood and  sometimes it can come across as cheasy... but if you listen, you can tell  that they sincere.  Through great riffs and just plain great metal Manowar  should be one of the most popular metal bands out there... but they have  received a bad rep from some who no nothing about the band.      Kings of  metal is asounding, though it isn't the best of their albums that i've  heard (The Triumph of Steel is #1), it kicks the @#$&amp; out of damn near  every other album out there...      And just in case you were wondering,  Manowar has never sold out(Because of sissy Alternica I must say this)...  and when you hear their music... you will know that they never will.       Buy this album... you won't be let down.

B0050SYS5A|1|don't buy this zoom for kinect-xbox360. It is totally not any works my kinect for small area. And you will be regret as me if you still buy it. Because after you install it, you will found the kinect can not sense your area and change to motion to detect the area. So it is bad  product I bought.
B009POCFTG|5|Great, great, great movie!!!!! Performances are great, director, as always, great too!!!! Don't miss this piece of art movie, which it's hard to forget!!!!
B008QTV3X0|5|Great show, awesome video quality, downloads and buffers very quickly.  Will definitely look to amazon for digital shows and movies.
B000TGJ80I|5|I watched the second film first. Not only does the first clarify things a hundred times over. It's also a much better film overall. The storyline is much more intriguing and the characters have much more depth.<br /><br />I love the Blu-ray high-def quality. I played the film on my PS3 connected by HDMI to a Polaroid 15\\" HDTV and multi-out to a Durabrand 5.1 surround system.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I loved the way all the stories combined with each other and the out comes of each was really surprising in many ways.
B006886HDC|5|Just finished watching the full series of Season One, and must say how inspired I am by what John Adams and Thomas Jefferson did for our Country. They were quite different in many respects, almost opposites, but they both held strong to what they believed was best for our Country rather than themselves, each a great PATRIOT in themselves. I was spellbound for every moment of every part in the series.<br /><br />I thought the acting was great, particularly in the context of playing each person as they were purported to be. Again, they were very different. Adams appears to have been an arrogant, stubborn, very strong willed person. If nothing else, he was true to himself and his commitment to do the right thing... his duty to God and Country.  That was exactly what we needed to get through the founding of our Country, and the particularly delicate times as our second President.<br /><br />Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, was Adam's polar opposite in many respects. Though not much of a talker, he had much more skill in political affairs, and well though out ideas in what government by for and of the people was really about and should be. So many differences between the two, but bound together with the same commitment to do the right thing. Adams seemed to go at it more in the context of duty, while Jefferson did so because he \\"knew\\" what was right. I will forever be beholden for this great perspective into our Country's founding and two of our greatest Patriots and Founders.<br /><br />That is why our Country's founding was such a great \\"miracle\\". It was just the right mix of personalities, values and commitment all together at the right time and place. God Bless America!
B006PZBRCY|2|I have not seen such a forced, predictable, and poorly directed film in a long time. Total Hollywood schlopp. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of just one was the animatronics.
0451457994|5|\\"No one can truly say he knows God until he has handled something and this can only be in the holiest of holies.\\" Joseph Smith (History of the Church 4:608)<br /><br />First, I heartily recommend that a Space Odyssey omnibus be published.  Have all four of the novels published under one cover, plus include \\"The Lost Worlds of `2001'\\" as a DVD disc 2, the one with all the extras and deleted scenes.  If \\"2001\\" is the essential companion to the movie, then \\"The Lost Worlds of 2001\\" is the essential companion to the novel.<br /><br />Second, if we remember that \\"2001\\" is primarily a film event, then we can understand this book on its own terms.  This book is intended to be merely a companion to the film, and a reminder of that cinematic experience in the pre-cable, pre-VHS, pre-DVD days of a few decades ago.  That is why the early edition has the stills in the middle.<br /><br />In a side sense, you see how the filmcraft changes the book--instead of Jupiter, the book takes Bowman to Saturn.  In addition to being more plausible, stopping a Saturn would have been more dramatic and have better special effects.  If you have seen \\"Silent Running\\" and the Voyager images, you see what problems this would have caused. But Saturn would also undercut the thread in the rest of the novels. So, \\"The blunder may amount to the opening of a destiny.\\"<br /><br />To be sure, the story is thin--a good example of when to be minimalist, and how less can be more.  That we never see the aliens is the perfect touch.  Like Lovecraft, Serling, Hitchcock, and \\"Signs\\", we just infer things from the operation of the black monoliths, and what happens to Bowman in the ordered course of events.  But it is our wild-running imagination that chills our bones and tingles our spines.<br /><br />(BTW, In \\"The Lost Worlds of `2001'\\", the alien scientist Clindar is given a front and center treatment. Thus story just seems to be a run-of-the-pulp-mill tale, with not mystery and therefore no magic.)<br /><br />The minimalism also allows for several comparisons and contrasts: The Monolith versus Moon-Watcher, Moon-Watcher versus One-ear, Moon-Watcher versus Dave Bowman, Dave Bowman versus Frank Pool, Frank Pool versus Hal, Dave bowman versus Hal, and Hal versus the Monolith.  Each character seems to have several mirrors-be they Hubble Telescope precise, or fun-house absurdities.<br /><br />Thematically, however, the story is nothing new.  Clark previously explored the idea of alien uplift in his book \\"Childhood's End,\\" which reaffirmed ideas that were first articulated by Doc Smith in the Lensmen series.  Uplift, uplift, uplift.<br /><br />Thus, what is so surprising about this book is how Christian it is.  We have these alien Overlords who manifest themselves with the intermediary monoliths, and whose objective is to nudge other life forms up the evolutionary ladder.  Replace aliens with God, the monolith with Christ, and evolution with salvation, then you have the core Christian message.<br /><br />As Athanasius said, \\"God became man so that man might be god.\\"  And as C. S. Lewis observed, \\"In Christ a new kind of man appeared; and the new kind of life which began in Him is to be put into us.\\" This is both Moon-Watcher and Dave Bowman. The implication is that it is us, too.<br /><br />The only drawback of this book is the under-the-breath dread that the rest of the franchise does not have the same charm as the first book.  \\"2001\\" is euphoric, \\"2010\\" is idealistic, \\"2061\\" is optimistic, but \\"3001\\" is sarcastic. So as I reread the franchise, I keep bracing myself for a crash landing. Too bad--this series had so much potential.br /> <br />The minimalism also allows for several comparisons and contrasts: The Monolith versus Moon-Watcher, Moon-Watcher versus One-ear, Moon-Watcher versus Dave Bowman, Dave Bowman versus Frank Pool, Frank Pool versus Hal, Dave bowman versus Hal, and Hal versus the Monolith.

B004Y6MU6S|5|Brandon Sanderson has done an amazing job of creating a whole world in this book.  He purposefully spends time developing a vast  world for this book series to be written on.  He has great characters and an even greater magic system.  A fantastic read for anyone who enjoys a fleshed out fantasy novel.
B00F8L2VO4|5|This program is an excellent way to learn a new language, or brush up on one from long ago. The process is fun, and the in game awards make it motivating to continue learning. I use it on my phone and computer, and love it.

B00HME4I0A|5|Great movie
086571701X|5|good ideas and lots of information  and biggest part it is interestingly easy to read too  explains few of the better systems
B00NG6FMOE|2|Well, I'm clearly in the minority here but I thought that this was a terrible compilation.  The sound is all over the place and she is clearly not in her best voice on most of the cuts.  A few deliver the real Whitney but not enough to justify buying this.  There are much better compilations than this.
B0002Z9HT8|4|I was vacationing in Europe during the Live Aid concert and was only able to catch parts of it on radio.  I was really glad to hear about the release of these DVDs as they contain most of the concert footage from the Live Aid concert. I was a little disappointed that some performances were missing, but after reading the liner notes, I understand the reasons why.  But, I am truly grateful for the footage that is available.  Sting and Branford Marsalis' performance is alone worth the $20 I paid at Target.  With all the other great performances (everyone remembers the incredible Queen set), this set is truly a bargain! <br /> <br />The video and sound quality are surprisingly good.  Some of the performances were not very good technically, but they were all passionate which is more important on such an occasion. I highly recommend it...it will bring back alot of memories.  I did not give it 5 stars because although it is an incredible collection, it is not perfect (because of some missing footage).   <br /> <br />Some reviewers referred to Geldof as an opportunist or megalomaniac, but I admire him for trying to help the victims of the famine.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Love it!
B0063IH60K|5|I got this for my kindle fire and I absolutely love it. The graphics have a nice fluidity to them and I really enjoy the one-click option they give you in the settings menu.  I have also downloaded spider solitaire from this developer and I am happy with that as well.  I definitely recommend the download.
B005LAIH4A|4|Dr Seuss is timeless  I get tired of television and my family thinks I buy these movies so we have something for when the little ones visit.  I actually buy them for me and that benefits everyone<br />It was shipped and arrived without problem.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Really enjoy playing.
B00BPJ5Z96|5|still considered one of the great movies that he directed and starred in.....all his movies showed the dedication to the martial arts and he definitlely  was ahead of his time....this movie is still rated as his best, and will be for sometime...worth the price...
B00338QENI|3|After reading the reviews of this book and having been involved in healthcare for over 30 years, I thought I would find this book very interesting.  However, I must rate it a 3.  Perhaps it is because I am not too surprised at anything that happens in the area of research that could be considered unethical both now and in the era before there was required informed consent.
B000002U8A|5|If you followed Duran Duran in the 80's and 90's, you'd be hard pressed to find anything more energetically charged than &quot;The Reflex&quot;. That song, in my opinion, put Duran Duran on the map. The entire album, 7, is the best work they did to date, and it would be hard for even Duran Duran themselves to top. Union of the Snake, and New Moon on Monday also carried great beats as well as really well put together videos. The Reflex's video made you run right to the ticket window and buy a ticket to their show when they came to your town to play. If you like 80's music, this CD is a MUST for your collection.
B00DR0PDNE|4|Very cool to use took longer than hoped to hook up but was worth it, be sure to connect to wifi
B00GOZQ2E8|5|Not bad for a free game. Cute characters. Simple to understand.<br />Just got it so don't know much more. Have fun!

079073804X|5|Well this is defenitly the most horrifiying motion picture there is. If you got a party at your house and everybody is just smalltalkin around and you can't take it no more, just put in the EXORCIST and after 5 Minutes  everybody will be quite with their eyes wide open....<br />I guess the biggest  effect is that an inonocent little girl is able to say such terrible things  when she is posessed by a demon.<br />The story is so believable and the  atmosphere is so convincing that it is impossible not to be frightend by  this movie.<br />Don't you dare watch this movie alone in the house on a  stormy evening cause you'll get real paranoia which proves the movie is  great.
B0045XKJBI|5|From the first movie through this one, each one was wonderful and could stand on its own.  As a complete set, it got even better.  I didn't read the books until after I'd seen all the movies and was pleasantly surprised how close the story was to the movie.  I also recommend buying the books to get more depth to the story
B003VANOFY|1|The beeping is annoying. Returned
0671042858|5|i am into really scary books and alot of them try to be gross and use that to make up for  their lack of real writing well and interesting plot line  but this is a very well writen book and i am very impressed with it but if  you are looking for a real scary keep you up all night nightmare book this  is not it but if you want to kept up all night cause you can not put it  down beacause of it is very interesting and well written then i will  recomend this book for you. and please consider my advice i am 14 years old  but i do know a good book and this is it.
1416972242|4|bought this for my sister has a part of her christmas present. i've never read any of the series nor watched the movie. she's the reader and i'm not.
B0053YGYO4|2|I've been a Coldplay fan since the start as well. This album is absolute polished backwash. Every Teardrop is a Waterfall I can't even get through before turning the station. It's just boring as hell. Us Against The World is an attempt to do Johnny Cash all over again.  Hurts Like Heaven, U.F.O., and Up In Flames are the only tracks worth listening to on this record and if you can get past the Chris-Martin-Goes-Hip-Hop on Paradise then that track as well.  For people to call this brilliant...is beyond me. There's no stand out single that makes me want to hum along like the older stuff. And I really dug Viva La Vida. The only interesting thing about this record is the album cover and that's it ! Such ashame.  Coldplay  Random Album Title  Rating: 5/10  Check more reviews at: [...]
B00P596I8Y|5|This is not a horror movie, though what it depicts is truly horrifying. Agreed, the kid is not the greatest of actors, but his mom more than makes up for it, and she's the real reason we're there. Buckle up and enjoy this acid trip into Hell, and if, at the end, you don't get it, ask any Psych major to explain. They'll have a ball.
B00K2CHVJ4|5|Great set - my son loves it! Nice to have multiple copies.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Snarky astronaut in a terrible situation, doing everything he can to stay alive in the hostile environment of Mars. Really, the author had me at Snarky.<br />The plot works great—difficult problems, smart solutions, things go wrong, lather, rinse, repeat. Just when it looks like things will get better, they get worse. But our hero keeps on trying. Science geeks will love the chemistry, botany, and engineering. Astronaut geeks will love the details of the Mars vehicles and expedition. If you love tension, you’ll find it ratcheting up and up. If you love survival stories, you’re going to be gripping the edges of your seat. I especially like the cast of characters (female expedition commander!), the humor (disco!) and behind-the-scenes at NASA parts.  (True confession: I didn’t understand all the science bits. But I trust the author.)  It’s got humor, politics, some angst, a few bad words, and things that blow up. On Mars!
0736430512|3|This book is a good capsulation of the movie Frozen.  It would be a terrible substitute, as it doesn't really transition well between the plot elements.  It's more of a &#34;this happened, then this happened, then this, then that, etc,&#34;, until the book ends.  If you just read the book, then you wouldn't really get the story.  My 5 year old loves it though, and I like it because it's really short, so it make a good bedtime book.
039916409X|5|Much needed knowledge.

B005XQLBU4|4|Very good game wish their was more to the game, maybe better upgrades. I have not come along any glitches so far and I hope I don't I would hate too have to erase this game.
B000N6TX1I|1|PD James wrote a very interesting book, but this movie is just awful. Why a director/producers cannot replicate a book with the same emotional intensity is beyond me. The book has an incredible plot which the movie uses as its central theme -the reality that man is now infertile and the population is going to die off. The movie, however, becomes a propaganda film for immigration issues and a political agenda that is so overt that it is silly. The acting is sub-par at best. Clive Owen looks like he could care less about being in the movie and the entire cast looks lost at times. The dialogue is sloppy, the acting is poor and the book that is an interesting read is ruined by this sorry piece of film work.  <br /> <br />Read the book. Don't rent this movie.
B00D7NWTSI|5|The best Iron man yet!  Some do not like that iron man has a version of ptsd, but i think it humanizes him!  I love the story line and movie!

B00J2VSS0C|1|This game was fun to start, but I'm finding I don't get credit for achievements. The tasks are SUPER irritating (right now I show 60+ to complete), and the achievement board shows I've completed 1300/500, and no award. The gold level for houses shows 0, even though I have all houses at or above gold, and the achievement for completing a scene at gold level in less than 60 shows 41, and scenes at gold level shows 32.<br /><br />But the most irritating is that I can see objects for completing collections coming from friends, but tapping on an activated totem makes them disappear. Been asking for fixes for two months but just get &amp;#34;yeah, we're working on it.&amp;#34; Probably ought to have worked those things out and fully tested it before releasing the game.<br /><br />Overall, it gets one star because I play, but it's a love/hate relationship. Get it together, G5.
B00GTCECVG|5|Not only can I not stop playing but there's characters and update often. U can join groups, battle others, and I talk to REAL people not those games where it says u can with real people but u can't.
0061122416|5|Everytime I read this book I get something different out of it, and I've read it over 6 times. An amazing, timeless story.
B00007BH5C|5|I haven't heard the other two soundtracks but I KNOW that this one is an absolute gem. Every track is extremely emotional and conjures up very pleasant memories of the films. Howard Shore is at his prime here with a ton of memorable compositions (and for a movie that's very hard to do). If you're a fan of this kind of music or if you're a lord of the rings nut you'll no doubt love this CD. <br /> <br />Hightlights include: <br />the entire album!
B00015YVD6|5|This came from the amazon warehouse in Seattle, I live in the same state and got it within 2 days. The movie is great, and I was satisfied with my purchase.
B009KHBDUU|5|Loved this movie, funny and everything you would expected from a Tim burton movie.  A good story line with a good twist.
1421506270|5|This is a great installment in the Death Note series.  So far Death Note is my favorite.  I think it is very exciting and clever.  In this book, Light has passed his memory of the Death Note to someone else.  Rem, the Shigami shows herself to Misa and explains some things she has forgotten.  Misa discovers who the third Kira is and helps Light try to capture him.  I was absorbed in this edition from start to finish.  Really enjoyed it.
B00AREIAI8|5|I cannot stop playing. There is so much you can do in this game and it is so addictive! I highly recommend it. Go play now! Best game ever!
B00IIUATDM|1|No real plot! Junk movie! Way to much vulgarer language too!
0307277887|4|After ordering the book, I learned that it has been made into a TV series, and one review of the TV show mentioned that it kept to the book's descriptions of graphic violence. I was worried that the book would be too graphic for my taste, but the author doesn't really make the killing scenes too horrific. The main character is quite unique to the mystery genre, and the author's development of the supporting characters is also entertaining. I enjoyed the story quite a bit.

B00001SIES|4|Despite the recent explosion of dancerock from the UK, Muse is perhaps the most powerful Britpop band to emerge in years. If you want comparisons, they're equal parts Radiohead and Led Zeppelin, with a unique sound that is both melodic and raw. Few debuts are as intense as Muse's \\"Showbiz.\\"<br /><br />A steady piano melody ripples by, followed by some steady drumming. That, in turn, segues into the expansive bombastic rock'n'roll of \\"Sunburn.\\" Matt Bellamy sits in the middle of the song, singing in a trembly voice, \\"I'll feel/A guilty conscience grow/And I'll feel/A guilty conscience grow.\\" Then he bursts into an anguished howl: \\"And I'll hide from the world/Behind a broken frame/And I'll  run forever/I can't face the shame...\\" The music crests with it, a panoramic blend of guitar, bass and piano.<br /><br />And that's only the first song.<br /><br />The songs that follow are just as powerful, if a bit lower-key. Muse dabbles first in some truly ominous guitar pop, followed by acoustic ballads, and an angsty lament or two. Then, about halfway through the album, things get loud again -- songs like the title track have a wall-of-sound guitar'n'bass melody. In these songs, Muse sounds eerily like a British version of the Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />Good as their debut was, Muse wasn't at their peak with \\"Showbiz\\" -- they hadn't quite perfected the epic-guitar thing, and the production isn't at its best. But they are still a compelling listen -- the climax of \\"Uno\\" is the sonic equivalent of being hit with a tsunami. For a band that was still defining their sound, it's remarkable.<br /><br />Chris Wolstenholme does an exceptional job with the driving bass, while Bellamy pulls double, triple and sometimes quadruple duty, playing everything from Hammond to piano. His roiling guitar riffs are absolutely stunning. It takes a special drummer to have an impact with all of that going on, and fortunately Dominic Howard is up to the task.<br /><br />Bellamy also is the vocalist, and here he shines. Too often comparisons are made to Radiohead's frontman Thom Yorke. However, Bellamy's vocals are more versatile -- he starts off in a sort of trembly voice, sounding sad and vulnerable. Then he lets rip with anguished howls, purrs, murmurs and much more. And he does it in perfect harmony to the music.<br /><br />With their epic sound and excellent musicianship, Muse have the makings of a rock'n'roll legend. \\"Showbiz\\" was their first album and it shows, but even with its flaws, it's a stunning piece of work.re made to Radiohead's frontman Thom Yorke.

B007SYWFRM|4|Decent way to spend some time. My son loves the familiar characters. As far as the issue for closing the app on the kindle, just go to options and the home Icon appears. great free game.
B0086700CM|5|Free game that my children/children downloaded thanks for keeping them busy on car trips and during downtime thank you so much...
1451666179|5|The Depression sections made me cry. Not just a few dignified tears, but gasping sobs of recognition and empathy. And then the &#34;shriveled corn kernel under the fridge&#34; section made me laugh, maybe as hard as the author laughed. My first graphic novel, and I think it was a wise choice. Bravo to Allie for putting it all out there.
B00688628M|5|I have watched this series a number of times, and always enjoy it.  It is particularly informative in showing numerous aspects of the war in Europe from D-day to the end, such as:<br />  * Training Camp<br />  * D-day from the airborne perspective<br />  * The role and results of a good leader and a bad leader<br />  * What a WWII medic went through<br />  * The desire for action for the late replacements who &#34;missed out of the fighting&#34;<br />  * etc.<br />Though there are a few key individuals highlighted throughout, attention is also paid to lesser players, such a the medic and the staff sergeant.
B0040I09RM|5|Awesome
B007SGLZP8|5|Very unusual. Not quite his normal style.  Gripping from start to finish. I enjoyed all but one of his books but this, for me, was the best by far
B00N6PD3GE|5|Fascinating
140006922X|1|Too much of this book is spent wit the author trying to impress us with his scholarship, telling us about other good reads.  He is also apparently unaware of much scholarship of the Jesus seminar.  Some good insights but Marcus Borg, Dominic Crossen, and Albert Nolan are much better for persons being introduced to the historical Jesus. Lowest rating I have given a Kindle book: one star.
B000GFLKF8|5|The cast including Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer is outstanding. Spike Lee directing has always impressed me but his movies are not usually for the whole family. In fact it is rare that the whole family can sit down and watch an adult movie these days that will be only slightly offensive to some. Here is such a movie. At first you will think you know what is happening, then you will figure it out. That is until the next scene. This is one of those, so you think you know what is going to happen next movies. The ending will make you satisified and on many levels, including lack of real violence. After all it is the perfect bank robbery.<br /><br />We are led to believe this movie is about bank robbers and hostages with a tense stand off with police. Okay there is some of that, but it goes much further. Do the robbers intend to take the money? No, but perhaps not what you think to substitute for it. The story unfolds so that we now think an outside negotiator will settle the deal and that's the end of it. But no we have an honest detective that wants the whole story and that is where it will all end when he lays all the cards on the table. I recommend this to the whole family. It is slick enough that it has replayability and I suggest those that like movies like \\"The Italian Job\\" buy it since it has the suspense and con stuff less the violence.
B00FAPF5U0|5|I am addicted to Candy Crush Saga.  I play it on my phone and now on my Kindle!  Couldn't be happier!!!
B009IJJ5B4|5|I love this show.  Great rendering of Sherlock Holmes in the modern day world.  Amazons vid player works fine.  Cant wait for more episodes!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Really easy read; reader is able to identify with the characters and become invested in their story. It is not a typical &#34;happy-ending&#34; fairytale; it is a realistic ending; however beautiful in it's simplicity. I suggest this book to readers of all levels.
B0035LJY6C|5|Great movie they need to make more.
B007PKSN6Q|3|Took forever to get and then got misdelivered by post office the party called to say they had it even though package was ripped and case cracked
B003XRZZFM|4|I pre bought this album because I love everything these guys have put out. I got into the band with Enthrone Darkness Triumphant[[ASIN:B000000H22 Enthrone Darkness Triumphant]] I miss Vortex and Mustis! This album is a little heavy on the symphonic choiral arrangements...but I like those...some people may be put off by this. I was really surprised when I heard \\"Gateways\\" It sounds a lot like a Mushroomhead song! My husband even brought that when he heard it. I am very happy to see this song is in the top 5 at Liquid Metal the Sirius Metal station (even though it is a rare day when they generously may play a Black Metal or Prog metal song)The list is made by the listeners. So perhaps the station might consider adding some Black/Prog metal once in a while! I highly recommend this album and there is not one reference to Satan in all the lyrics which is refreshing!
B007J4T2G8|5|Love this book! Can someone please send Mr. Grey to my house!? I love the current day venue for this book. I loved the characters and personalities.
B007ELLDFO|5|Many people have never seen this movie made in the 1960s. It's a great read, compelling story, and I highly recommend it.
B004RJMUJO|5|Even my 4 years old nephews can play this game and they love it. It's addiction but because the you injured your finger :)
B00L9B7IKE|5|Convincing characters in realistic situations told with great twists and turns!
B004GHNIRK|3|couldnt get in to this
0439023491|5|Have you ever had to fight for your life? Twice? I don't think so this review is about the book Catching Fire.  This book is filled with twists and turns leaving u guessing at every flip of a page.<br /> This is a continuation of the Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Its about a girl Katniss and a boy Petta and how they face their devastating lives in district 12 (their city) and not knowing what they have in store for them next.  In their district they face people dying of starvation everyday with no solution because the capitol isn't feeding them. Well they haven't seen anything till the quarter quells come up....<br /> This book is mainly for teens around 12 to 16ish and this is a fantasy book about 16 year old boy and girl.<br /> This book is a lot like the Lightening Thief. If you liked that book u will absolutely love this book has many of the same characteristics. Like how there is a lot action and suspense.<br /> I think Suzanne Collins did a really good job in this book on never making u want to put the book down. I also think she did a very good job on the plot because not only was it well written the plot of the book is what made it interesting. This book flew past all my expectations with this. All though the begging was kind of slow once u get past chapter 2 u will love it, and lastly I think the ending was kind of bad it made it sound like my 3rd book wasn't going to be to good.<br /> As you can tell I really liked this book and you should go get it right now and I guarantee you will love it as much as me.
B002ZCY7SW|5|I have enjoyed '24' for all eight seasons (even the ones that weren't as 'up to snuff' as some of the others).  I'm sorry to see it go (though I think its format had 'run its course')!  SPOILER ALERT: I'm intrigued by the 'mysterious' / unresolved ending of season 8 and its 'tantalizing' prospect for the future.
B009UX2YAC|5|Awsome game very amusing also good for long trips
B000H5U832|5|All the kids favorite.  Will watch over and over.  Keeps them happy. Got to get.
B004K8WPUQ|5|Another great investment for anyone wanting a good DSLR mic. Batteries last forever. I have been using a Lipo 9v and its taking forever to die. Amazing sound quality and the +20 is handy for interviews
B0000026WD|5|In November of 1991, Michael Joe Jackson was once again going through a new phase as he had done some 12 years ago when he teamed up with Quincy Jones and together, those two created Off The Wall, Thriller and Bad. While their 10-year partnership created three of the greatest albums in music history, Michael Jackson still felt he needed to prove himself. At 33 years old, he was hungry for some blood. He had been introduced to Teddy Riley to help create a new style for him and his music. Many were quick to call him old hat by this point but after this release, things weren't exactly the same again as pop and R&amp;B/soul music goes. <br />A mixture of pop greatness, funk epic, R&amp;B head banger, soul healer, rock &amp; roll idoldom, new jack sensibility, great lyrics and of course the Otis Redding-inspired growls, the smooth tenor and of course that falsetto, mix them all up, put Michael Jackson in it and you have one of the greatest albums that was ever recorded and it isn't because I'm a MJ fan but it's really the truth.<br />This album was just a raw-sounding classic and it definitely was one album that you HAVE to GET UP and DANCE! And dance HARD as hell! Many of the essential jams in this baby definitely stand out from anything Michael had done previously. Songs like &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;Why U Wanna Trip&quot;, &quot;In The Closet&quot;, &quot;She Drives Me Wild&quot;, &quot;Remember the Time&quot; (EVERYBODY was bumpin' this song back in the day!), and &quot;Can't Let Her Get Away&quot; were essential hip-hop/soul jams that still sounds like it could be released right now (check out Janet's Damita Jo album for example). Songs like &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Give In To Me&quot; are great examples of classic rock and alternative/grunge IMO. &quot;Heal the World&quot;, &quot;Will You Be There&quot;, and &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; are classic gospel. &quot;Gone Too Soon&quot; is poetic-like pop. &quot;Who Is It&quot; is Gospel for the Soul of the Neglected (check &quot;This Place Hotel&quot; and &quot;Billie Jean&quot; for further example) and &quot;Dangerous&quot; is a 6 1/2-minute funk epic! <br />This album definitely proved he can rise without the help of a producer...and at the same time CAN! Three cheers to Michael Jackson for this amazing album! HEE-HEE!
0345803507|2|Not as interesting as i was lead to believe. Gave the trilogy away to a friend. It just did not grab my attention or keep it.
B00P9QQ0IG|4|Dont have the patience for this one but it was a blast for a while.
B007D2XSW0|5|Love all of the features and edits! Quick and easy to edit a photo...perfect for moms on the go. Def would recomened.
B00DPM90C4|5|I find this book wonderfully intriguing, in a mysteriously nice way. The photos were helpful and added on to the story in a way that wasn't to conspicuous.

1932100660|5|This, by far, has been my favorite book about nutrition of all time. It can get a little technical at moments but overall it's easy to understand - and most importantly, it truly makes you think about what you are putting into your body. This book was the ultimate deciding factor in my fight to be vegan or not. Any worries I had about the vegan lifestyle were silenced by this book. I have already been recommending it to everyone I know!
B00VFTCGES|4|Too damn confusing!
0345803485|5|Don't believe any negative reviews, this trilogy is a hot summer read. Its an escape from all that is stressful in a woman's life. The author created characters that women secretly dream about--uber protective alpha male, fairy tale romance, the security of wealth, tortured male in need of nurturing, and the essential...LEG CLENCHING SEX. No boring missionary nonsense in this read. Enjoy this book for exactly what it is AN EROTIC VACATION.
B002I9Z8B2|5|I love Wrath of Khan, it is my favorite Star Trek movie.  This was the first movie I ever saw alone in the theater (my parents wanted to see Firefox instead), so there is a certain nostalgia for me when watching.  Anyway, this is the best looking version of this movie I have seen.  About 2 weeks before I bought this it was on HDNET movies and there is a night and day difference in the quality of the blu-ray.  Picture is much sharper, colors are brighter, sound is crystal clear, overall I am very happy with this purchase.  Considering the age of the movie I am amazed at how great it looks.  I know some people were upset about this not being the extended cut with the extra 4 minutes, but in my opinion those 4 minutes don't really matter much (though I don't know why they were left out?).  I suppose you can wait for the eventual release of the extended super duper restored, remastered, re-filmed with new actors edition, but I don't see the point.  If you love Star Trek or just love sci-fi movies this is a movie to add to the collection.
B001GZ6QEC|5|* Fast shipping - 4 times faster than estimated - to Romania  * English, French and Spanish subtitles and audio  * Great movie - it's position in IMDB top 250 is totally deserved  * Great quality - HD 1080p
1451695187|5|I gave Proof Of Heaven a 5 star rating because  this book , extremely compeling and so well written,  captured my soul and I could not put it down.<br />I have read many near death stories over the years and have continued the search to understand  the meaning of our existence.  Eben's  account  made complete sense to me and has made the difference in restoring my Faith.<br />I am very happy for the reason that I can now believe that the strong sense of closeness and communication I have been feeling with my deceased husband is something very real . I no longer fear death.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander, for sharing.<br />I would recommend this engaging book  to anyone seeking to understand and be content with what may happen after our body dies...<br />I will be giving copies of Proof Of Heaven as Christmas gifts this year.
B006MGB31Q|5|I like Alien, and for this price is a winner. I never watch the extras so I don't miss the extra discs. The transfer quality of Alien is the best in whole anthology. I found the latest movies bluish in few scenes.  As long as you know the plot of The first Alien, second time, watching is rather boring experience. Many complain about &#34;Alien resurrection&#34;, but I found this one more interesting than &#34;Aliens&#34;
B00PJ5AUCO|5|I was playing on night 6 and I got killed by GOLDEN FREDDY yes for some of you people who think he is not on here well he is this fnaf game is the second scariest the third one is the scariest one yet beware night six is super hard and wind up the music box OR ELSE
B007MB5OCE|4|Charming and inventive!
B0033780Y0|4|Not a tell-all, not particularly scholarly but very informative and interesting. The writer does a good job of staying on the topic and not straying into self absorption. Fun to read.
B009ZM76J2|5|Unfortunately, there has yet to be a story about how the same was expected of Native American children in this country.  They were forced to attend boarding schools to learn the ways of the white man.
B004J4WLB4|5|This is an excellent story, very compelling, it was hard to put down.  I really liked that it was in San Francisco & Marin county settings.
B000VUCIZO|4|I really enjoyed read this book, knowing the history and roots of apple telling for the creator of the first PC and how wonderful life of Steve Wozniak.
0784011176|5|&quot;That Piano&quot; was definitely one of the best films of 1993.  The performances from the cast were spellbinding.  Holly Hunter certainly deserved the Best Actress Ocsar she earned for this performance.  It was a  while since l had seen her really fit a character like a glove since her  role in 1987 as a slightly cuckoo network television producer in  &quot;Broadcast News&quot;.  Even though she doesn't speak a work  throughout the entire movie, l got every emotion from her hands, face and  her playing of the piano.  Not many people know that Holly Hunter actually  did a portion of her own piano playing in the film.  Not all of it was done  by the composer, Michael Nyman.  Which leads my into the film's dramatic  score which was both haunting and dream-like.  Another point l would also  like to make is that director Jane Campion is the first and only  woman-director to be nominated for an Academy Award for this film. That is  quite the feat in itself if you ask me.  Newcomer Anna Paquin is  mesmorizing as the young daughter who finds out about her mother's extra  cirricular activities, if you know what l mean.  Anna Paquin would go one  to win the Oscar for best supporting actress at only the tender age of 11.   Wow !  I highly recommend this tale of love, sex, betrayal and  consequences.
B002ZG981E|5|First of all, I was surprised when I found, besides the Blu-ray disc, also a DVD with the movie, because the product details didn't mention it. The movie in itself, it's amazing and the features are also very good. The documentaries are very interesting, specially the one called \\"Dreams: Cinema of the Subconscious: Can the dream world be a fully functional parallel reality?\\", as it makes you feel that there was a very deep research on the matter before making the movie. Definitely a great purchase!
B00881VLCE|5|I like this app because it keeps you occupied for a long time and in my life I need that go to app that keeps you occupied for a long time. And that is why I like this app. So if you need an app that keeps you occupied for a long time this is the app for you.
B00000J2PH|4|When Tapestry was released in 1971, Carole King was really only known as songwriter of such 60's hits like &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot;. You knew she could write a good song, but what Tapestry revealed was Ms. King's vocal talents.  Her voice is sweet and comfortable like a warm cup of tea and wraps around the song.  The album basically created the 70's phenomena of the singer-songwriter and James Taylor, Cat Stevens, Harry Chapin and the like benefited from its mammoth success.  Ms. King explores real emotions from her own perspective and it gives an intimacy to songs like &quot;It's Too Late&quot;, &quot;So Far Away&quot;, &quot;Where You Lead&quot; &amp; &quot;Home Again&quot;.  &quot;Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow&quot; &amp; &quot;Natural Woman&quot; take on a new meaning from the originals as we get to hear them from the composer's point of view instead of interpretations by others.  Although she recorded and released it first on this album, she gave &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot; to good friend James Taylor as it obviously had a huge hit potential. People connected with the songs on this album and propelled it to number one. It stayed on the Billboard Top 200 album charts for over 500 weeks which was a record until Pink Floyd's Dark Side Of The Moon surpassed it.
B002I9Z8B2|4|I am glad that I purchased this movie and had a chance to see it restored on blu ray.<br />It sparked my intrest after I saw the new In to darkness movie<br />They did a nice job
B00PE26G7U|5|Love the characters. Especially Rebel. NICE READING. Colluding put it Down. Also enjoyed Murder at JADE COVE. Both written very well.
B00BAXFECK|3|While I enjoyed this book for the most part, it took me too long to finish and I owe that to meandering focus of the storyline. Tartt lost me somewhere after 400 pages or so when I began hoping that a change would come either with the lead character or plot. At this point, I gave up on following the story closely and focused on just getting to the end  of the book so I could  finally move on with my life. Somewhere around page 600, I began to see some plot resolution which propelled me to the finish, at which point I became engaged once again.
B00FQ5F5MC|4|Uh, the thing about this, is, when I put this CD into my computer, all of the names of the songs on the playlist (At least VLC) are in Russian. The songs themselves are in English of course, but the names are in Russian.<br />Product arrived on time. The packaging had some slight damage in the form of a small crack on the hard plastic case, but no problem whatsoever.
B00KMX5V8G|5|Really fun!!!
0316055433|3|I behave in opposite manners regarding film and books. With a movie, given that I'm generally going to shell out $12-17 for the ticket, plus whatever before-and-after food/drink I might indulge in, I want to make sure that I'm making the best possible decision. I'll read multiple reviews, check and re-check ratings on various websites, and many times I'll go back and forth on my decision for a week or two unless I can get a good opinion from a close friend. With books, however, I leave it all to mystery. I do generally pick a book up based on the recommendation of someone else, but I refuse to research the book (or the author, if I happen not to have read anything by them before) or read any reviews until I am all the way through it.<br /><br />I'm going to admit that with this one, I struggled. At nearly 800 pages (and a whole month of reading, since most of it was done on the train during my daily commute), there were many times that I felt the need to have a little check-in to see if anyone else shared my thoughts or feelings. I also wanted to know what the painting itself looked like, because despite a minor in Art History that I halfheartedly completed six years ago, I honestly can say I've never heard of Fabritius. Thankfully, I was strong in my resolve and I suffered through the final pages, just as many of you did as well, before unleashing myself on the internet.<br /><br />Listen. I had many similar gripes. I don't understand the cell phone usage earlier on in the book - my mother had a cell phone around 1999 but it was a brick of a thing with no texting capability. I'm confused about the progression of time with the Barbours and how Andy happened to have an iPhone when he did, and yes, there are several other technological blunders throughout. Anachronistic references could be excused though, given the overall quality of the writing.<br /><br />Tartt's descriptions are transcendent. To her credit, I'll say that the way she writes about New York (this coming from someone who lives here) can be breathtaking. Theo being carted away to Las Vegas made me feel a deep sorrow and even at times panic because I imagined myself in his situation. How can you even begin to imagine being extracted from a place that is so vibrant and unique and taken to a place that might as well be on another planet, and against your will, when New York is all you've ever known? She was able to make me feel emotions that many writers have not been able to (and that was true for many other parts of the book as well).<br /><br />That being said, there was a certain tedium to the way she wrote. This, for me, always centered around that stupid painting. Every time Theo looked at the painting, thought about the painting, envisioned it, or had some kind of bizarre fever- or drug-induced dream about it (and it's hard to tell, because he always seems to have a fever or be on drugs), I wanted to chuck the book (excuse me, my Kindle) out the nearest window, which given that most of it was read on the L train, would have involved it getting fried on the third rail, and possibly deservedly so.<br /><br />So behold, I make it to just past 90% (so my Kindle informed me) and what do I get as a reward? No advancement in plot. Just more of that self-indulgent overly-verbose drivel that I was willing to excuse earlier on. The worst part was that I felt like Donna Tartt, NOT Theo Decker, was telling me what lessons I was supposed to take away from the novel. Forget it. I actually felt like it didn't belong in the novel at all. It seemed like an Afterword. I'm sorry, but I felt like, at that point, I hadn't been trusted to draw my own conclusions and formulate my own feelings based on the previous 700 pages. I might as well have been boxed into a school desk, tapping my pencil or doodling on a sheet of notebook paper while my high school English teacher droned on about the significance of whatever we had just read for class.<br /><br />Now, to address what I liked about the book and why, prior to finishing it, I recommended it to so many people (in moments of what now seem like foolishly rapturous praise): Donna Tartt somehow, whether by knowing a friend or family member closely enough or experiencing it firsthand, understands depression and drug addiction very well. It made me sad to read so many reviewers calling the book &#34;depressing&#34; or saying that Theo is completely unsympathetic. To be astonished by his long string of bad decisions is to neglect to understand that sometimes people, at least in the eyes of society, are fundamentally flawed.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, I was haunted and yet comforted by the fact that I had so much in common with Theo. Certainly I have never experienced tragedy on such a grand scale, but if you think a person can't continue to make one ill-thought-out decision after another and back themselves into a corner and jeopardize even their own life in the vain pursuit of short-lived pleasures or, more often, out of fear, constant fear, and still be believable, you're wrong. Not only have I made some life-cripplingly bad decisions for some very inane reasons, I am surrounded by evidence that many other people have done the same.<br /><br />Spend some time navigating the NYC subway system and be confronted with pleas for a warm meal, hot chocolate/coffee, or any change that can be spared to help someone buy a winter coat when it happens to be 10 degrees out with deep snow on the ground and negative wind chills and you'll understand, instantly, that all bad luck aside, people can bring themselves right to the verge of absolute destruction and yet still plod on, day after day. Listen to the (likely apt) criticism of those who beg and you'll hear that no one feels like giving a dime of their hard-earned money to someone who is just going to throw it away on whatever substance or addiction got them into their predicament in the first place.<br /><br />So yes, Tartt's prose was often dry, certainly pretentious, and borderline preachy at times near the end. She exalted art the point that I was actually ashamed that I had ever decided to study it myself and wondered if I had ever sounded so insufferable. But her ability to carry a narrative in the words of a wounded, flawed, often despicable yet still, in my opinion, well-rounded protagonist such as Theo makes me believe that she is indeed a great writer.<br /><br />I don't care that some of the other characters were such outright caricatures. And how dare anyone complain about having to sympathize with such a disappointing anti-hero. This is nowhere near the first novel to struggle with a protagonist that is far less than perfect. And speaking of perfect, no piece of writing is perfect, either. Tartt is brilliant, and could have used a skilled editor to pare this piece down into what might actually have deserved the distinction of being hailed a &#34;masterpiece&#34; of modern literature.<br /><br />Take it for what it is. I gave it three stars, but in truth I feel it deserves about 3.5. It's a rather unbelievable story that gets wrapped up and tied together with a bow and string (much like the painting itself does) in an all-too-convenient way. And that followed by an epic post-narrative section that feels like an undergraduate paper on art history meeting and breeding with Philosophy 101 makes it even harder to still call this novel a success. But at nearly 800 pages, it seems rather unfair to discount the incredible work that most of the novel consists of. I can't dismiss the greater parts simply because of the lesser ones, and I think that, if you have the time and the will, this is a book worth reading.

B0051ANPZQ|4|I think the author did a good job of giving us different perspectives.  The story was well told with an absolute truthfulness to it.
B000MR9D5E|5|The filming of this series is simply stunning throughout the entire 11 part series.  It is like no other footage of nature and the planet earth ever captured before and the 5 years it took to film definately paid off.  Each of the 11 parts ends with a 10 minute section on how they filmed parts of the episode and shows some of the extremes the crew went to to capture this one of a kind footage.  Much of the footage has never been captured before and many of the animals never filmed in such a way previously.  This is more than just a another nature program, much more, it is the best insight I have ever seen or probably ever will see compiled into the life on planet Earth. <br /> <br />The series is not intended to boost the level of knowledge of NASA scientists in earth science or nature matters as the naration is not too deep however, for us regular folks this series should be watched for the revolutionary photography and filming alone which speaks volumes for itself without complex narration.   <br /> <br />This is a set every house should own and every child (and adult) should see at some point.  It illustrates how amazing nature and the earth still are despite the damage and destruction inflicted by humans.  It gives us a visual reasoning as to why we need to protect what we have left. <br /> <br />The DVD set is narrated by David Attenborough rather than Sigourny Weaver who did the version shown on American TV.  I wanted this set because a series of this calibre without the voice of David Attenborough would be unimaginable.  I also read that they had 'dumbed' down the American version on TV and this set with all of the extras such as 3 additional hours of the future of Planet Earth would ensure I didn't miss anything.
B00O8NUJAG|4|It is a fun movie if you like Dragon Ball Z.
B00C7TAF3Y|4|I loved this game! But I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't last very long. I was disappointed when it was over so soon. The grafics and actual interaction  with the game Towere incredible, the best I've  ever seen but when it got to the end I went back into the game to see if I missed something.
B0054JZC6E|5|I think this is an awsome game and u need to play it rely u bees to play it it is fun
B000009M5E|5|For a 1959 recording, the sound is quite good. The early experimentation with stereo is interesting and one gets used to it after a couple of listenings. The cast is superb. The CD was a pleasant surprise. For the relatively low price, I was expecting mediocre quality, but instead I got a beautiful recording with an excellent cast. I'm sure this particular version of Boheme will become a staple in my operatic listening.<BR>Addendum:  I have listened to this recording many times since I wrote the original review.  It gets better with each listening.  Bergonzi is unsurpassed in his rendition of Che gelinda manina (track 8 on CD 1).  This aria alone is worth the price of the recording.
B0027MJU00|4|So sad and heartbreaking. A real page turner. The characters really came to life, it feels as if you were in their shoes.
B00DYFCYSO|5|First heard the single on howard.  Bought the CD for my wife she lives it.  The entire album is good
0064431789|4|This one is a classic, of course. Chances are that you remember it from your own childhood, what more is there to say?    My nieces love this one. It's not too wordy, so it's great for very little children and for those nights where you really want everybody in bed five minutes ago! But the words that are there are perfectly selected, nothing is missing. Lyrical is the word I'd use.     And the story about Max having his time-out and repenting (or, for that matter, his mother changing her mind about her over-reaction) is one that most children can relate to, I think.
B005I4JG80|4|Interesting read.  I thoroughly enjoyed this e book.  In my opinion, the concepts have real merit.  It would be hard to implement unless you were raising bebe in France.  Thank you Georgie
B00005OM4Q|5|The DVD was in excellent condition for a used product, this movie is great and the director's cut adds a few extra scenes to increase the experience.  Great rock and roll coming of age movie
B005KISHDY|4|Regular price is $39.99  Shame on venders!  Shop elsewhere for this great product.  My son really likes all the characters and ship, but he was using his own money and needed a fair price.
039916927X|4|It's great
B006VRDZ44|5|Its really great.
B00CSR2J9I|5|Love the game I think it's really cool<br />Hope they make a lot of games like it they need to it would be bad if they didnt
B003VANOFY|4|This headset has alot of cool features.<br /><br />The mute and volume control on the ear of the headset itself are very convenient and i use them frequently when someone talks to me nearby. Although this headset is wireless there is no discernible time lag between input or output when compared to a wired headset.<br /><br />On the other side, the sound quality is not quite as good as i was hoping, certainly not as good as the Siberia V2s that they replaced(One ear stopped working, probably because of me rolling over the wires and causing the wires to get pulled on). It also seems to have some issues with VoIP clients like mumble where sometimes sound will only play out of the right ear and a quick restart will fix the issue.<br /><br />Overall a solid headset that i can definitely reccomend.
B000E1JOSE|5|For me it is his best selections.  I play it in the car and hope it doesn't wear out.  Great jam sessions.
B00FAX6XQC|5|This game is so cool best hunting game so far must get
B003ASLJKO|3|This movie is great.. Too much of Reynolds and not enough Clint Eastwood!!! Great Director and Good Acting... All I can say is I loved it!!!!!
B00007LTIL|5|HEY----What can you say to one of of my 3 fav dead albums?  Box of Rain Sugar Magnolia,  wit 5 live traCKS AT THE END!!
B0052VUNHC|5|I have read this book 3 times and look forward to reading it again and again til I memorize it
B00070Q7VO|2|There is simply no reason for this album to exist.  It will be all over the bargain bins within a year.  There is no added spark or anything but by-the-numbers arrangements-- it sometimes sounds like parody.  Who will seek this stuff out in 5 years?  No one.  Buy the originals instead.  Unless you like imitation swing like Rod Stewart-- then this is for you.  If you'd like to hear Beatles songs with a jazz/swing twist, listen to John Pizzarelli Meets the Beatles.
B0000024JN|5|Classic album!!! must have for any true hip-hop fans!!! fourth time buying it unfortunately
B00TPEMK3M|5|I love it because I love fairytales and musicals. This was both. The singers and songs were OMG so amazing! It's worth the money!
0736092269|5|Simply a MUST OWN.  If you are looking for a simple, yet thorough review of the human musculature, this is it.  The exercise examples are not groundbreaking, just nice and simple relations to exercises and muscles used.  I love it.
B00EMXBDMA|5|Great story. Fascinating science. Simplistic prose.
B00FWPWNKS|3|I really enjoy the game but I started on Hard and there are only 60 levels to play.  Now all I can do is replay them and try to improve my score.
B00A8MGIZG|5|what I was told,it was a good movie.  what I watched was fabulous and original. tom is back on top. could not shut off to use the facilities.  must see for series movie watchers.  adults only I think.
B008OM0EDO|4|Hilariously inappropriate. If you think Family Guy is bad this is not the show for you. Had me laughing the whole way through, one ridiculous scene after another. I definitely recommend giving it a watch.
B008IBPMZG|5|Loved it!
B008QE9VJI|5|very pleased !
B00FKAA3MA|4|Not my favorite album by slim but I do appreciate it, very we'll made album and the intro the  first song just pulls you in
0439023483|4|The story is of a girl who trades places with her little sister to join in the Hunger Games. The Hunger Games are a type of mandadory survival game where only one of 24 teens (between the ages of 12-18) will walk away.     The book has elements of adventure, survival, growth and love. I'm an adult and I enjoyed reading the Hunger Games. It was recommended to me when I needed another book to replace Twilight and I enjoyed it almost as much. Can't wait for the sequel.
B001NYTUXU|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when I watched it several years ago. I had always thought the music in the film was powerful. I bought the soundtrack to relive the experience while doing homework. I am not disappointed and if you like Hans Zimmer, you cannot go wrong here!
B000056VIY|5|J.LO is Jennifer's second album and I must admit that it's excellent.Here's my own review of each title:<br />1/Love don't cost a thing is definitly not the best tune, even if it's a good effort. 4/5<br />2/I'm real is a R'n'B song, it ain't revolutionary but it's  really good. An excellent chorus. 4/5<br />3/Play is maybe the best track on the album. A fantastic beat, an original sound and a very catchy chorus. 5/5<br />4/Walking on sunshine is an up-tempo song produced by Puff Daddy and it's not really wonderful.The worst song of the CD though it ain't dud. 2,5/5<br />5/Ain't it funny is one of the latino tunes; the beat and the chorus make it an excellent track. 5/5<br />6/Carino is a spanglish song with powerful cubano/salsa vibes and a catchy chorus. 4,5/5<br />7/Come over is the first low-tempo track of the CD;it has pretty hot lyrics.A smoothy song. 4/5<br />8/We gotta talk : another R'n'B tune, but not as good as I'm real though it has a funky atmosphere. 3,5/5<br />9/That's not me : excellent lyrics, and a tragic sound that makes the album deeper. 5/5<br />10/Dance with me : my favorite song ; a catchy chorus, with a jungle/latino tone. An incredibly addictive track. 5/5<br />11/Secretly : written by Jennifer herself, it's the other slow track on the CD.It has something like a jazzy atmosphere. 3,5/5<br />12/I'm gonna be alright is a very good song with positive lyrics. Once again, it ain't a new stuff but it still works well and makes you feel happy. 4/5<br />13/That's the way : produced by Rodney Jerkins; it's a brilliant track which sounds a little like If you had my love. Another catchy chorus. 5/5 <br />14/Dame is a whole spanish langage song and it's actually a duet with Chayanne. A conventional latino tune. 3,5/5<br />15/Si ya te acabo is a full spanish langage song too but it's far better from the precedent. 5/5<br />I hope it helped you to make your choice. See ya!
1476734941|5|lost 25 pounds in two months, and i'm stabilizing. Only occasional trouble maintaining the fast for two days.  I snack a lot on grapes.
B006QPVGKG|2|The atmosphere is captivating, but the movie really falls flat in the scare factor.<br />Another forgotten footage flick where the action happens in places that are far too convenient.<br />Pass on this one!
B00HBQWGXK|5|Excitement a mile a minute! Enjoyable read by Lee Child, if you're a fan get it. If not, enjoy your first exciting Jack Reacher novel.
B00GY0HJ4K|5|Fun yet challenging!
B00005JMFQ|1|This movie disappointed me greatly.  I love Hugh Grant, but this movie hurt me.  It was slow and not heart-warming and romantic.  The only part I adored was Hugh Grant, dancing around the Palace.  Other than that, I loathed the Porno actors scenes and the Guy who liked his best friends wife.  The entire movie was a let down.
B0059XTUVI|5|Great acting, as always, from Meryl Streep.  Gave new insight into the drive behind Margaret Thatcher, and how she became a definitive leader at a critical junction In her country' history.  I am sure that parts were played up or down depending on the movies flow, but it was a wonderful opportunity to see the thoughts and making of one of Great Britain's significant leaders of the 20th century.
B0013D8LCW|5|This movie, in my opinion, is a rarity among the coming of age movies. Usually they have a lot of gratuitous sex and little in the way of character depth. This movie however has the characters falling in love and really just being there in bed and not having sex is a big milestone for this genre. The acting is really great and believable coming from two straight guys
B009JBZH54|5|If you love the original Batman movies, this trilogy has a lot of action and a great story line to keep you engaged!
B001LNOOG6|5|1) Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.    2) Genre: Mystery    3) Synopsis: Danny Cartwright is sent to prison for something, he didn't do.  Prison gives him a lot of time to plan how to get revenge on those who put him in there.    4) Feelings: If asked I always say that Jeffrey Archer is my favorite author but lately I haven't been as confident in saying that.  No longer.  This book is excellent for every person out there.  It is a modern day Count of Monte Cristo.  I know it is probably sacrilege for saying so but it is a better read then the Dumas classic.      5) Final recommendation:  This is a great book.  I recommend if you know how to read to pick this book up now.  You will thank me later.    Ryan James Burt   Husband, Father, and Writer  [...]
B00K25GL7Y|5|it's a solid game to have if your a fan of magic, the cards are all the same cards you'd get in any booster pack at the stores. It does cost 10 bucks to unlock the full game but for being a fun magic game I think it was worth it, plus it has multiplayer
B007J4T2G8|5|Well I decided to give this book a try since everyone and their mom has read it and loved it. I read the story from a &#34;fantasy&#34; mindset-but I can see how realistically viewing this story people have become upset regarding abusive situations.<br /><br />To my complete surprise I actually loved the book...I felt all of the emotions on the roller coaster Anastasia was on during the book... and felt very ambivalent towards Christian-like she does. I enjoyed the easygoing language of the book and how Anastasia has an inner dialogue with her &#34;inner goddess&#34; and &#34;subconscious.&#34;<br /><br />That being said...I believe I am one of the rare readers who loved the book for the story- not the great sex or &#34;sexy&#34; Mr. Grey. There's no way in hell I'd ever want a Christian Grey or a relationship like that nor do I understand why he's so glamorized. But, Anastasia's story and wanting to be loved by someone who's messed up got me. I'm a 'fixer' too...
B004PLWGVG|5|I first listened to Florence + the Machine on SYTYCD live performance of Cosmic Love and fell head over heels.  Looked up more on youtube and enjoyed everything I was hearing not just one or two songs.  Excellent and distinct quality to her voice and good album continuity.  Good feel to the lyrics, music and basically there isn't anything I could say that I dislike here.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!! Can I give more than five stars?
B002SCKT0O|4|Was funny
B00CWY76CC|4|It is entertaining.  The use of tools to obtain keys for the elevator kind of makes me feel like MacGyver or Tommy from The Rugrats.  I hope there is an update for it soon, otherwise it is a very short game.
0762777931|5|This tiny, shiny, happy love bug of a lady has written a book that is more about loving yourself for the sake of your health, rather than restricting or limiting yourself. Kris Carr is my Supergirl:)
B00APUYWYA|5|Easy to purchase and watch.
B00FB13Y74|2|This game is a lot of fun ! And my granddaughter loves it .. I say give it a try
B000001EL3|5|It's very clear that this was the album that made KISS big, and I mean very big.  By this time they knew that they could do anything and it was gonna be right.  So, who could they hire that can make something different and make it sound it good?  BOB EZRIN.<br /><br />On this album they included almost all kind of music. This was done in '76, if they had done it today they could have included like 24 songs, because the music is so diverse.  Getting an album with \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Beth\\" together? WOW, it's got to be hard.<br /><br />To me, this album is very difficult to top.  They created a great atmosphere: 1) They included orchestra in a great way. 2) They started to use the comic \\"vibe\\" very good and it's when they create the \\"superhero\\" persona. 3) They included a very instrumental ballad (Beth) something that was never done before (at least no for a group like KISS) 4) They came out with something like \\"God of thunder\\" and it sounded like if it was recorded in hell 5) Well, they tried to do \\"Rock'n'roll all nite\\" 2,  but they came out with \\"Shout it out loud\\" which (and don't get me wrong) is extremely good but the first classic it's impossible to match.  Anyway,  it's impressive the sound on every song, all of them are instant classics.<br /><br />As an additional note, it's quite clear that they had personal problems from this one till the end. It's obvious that they were already famous and they could do anything they wanted, but Ace and Peter really lost the reality and they started to do stupid things.  That came out years after this album, but the true is that Ace didn't played the guitar on \\"Sweet Pain\\", and I won't be surprised if he didn't played on some others. Peter was as useful as nothing, the one thing that he did great was to pressure Paul, Gene and Bob to include \\"Beth\\".<br /><br />This is the first CD to buy when you're collecting R'N'R CD's.<br /><br />Highlight: Detroit Rock City, and the rest of the 8 songs.<br /><br />Lowlight: Nothing.Nothing. <br />
B00MU79IL8|4|Great collaboration CD, both Tony and Gaga do these standards proud.  I don't know what it is, if it's because her megastar cooled off a bit or what, but I have warmed up to more of Gaga's work, and this is no exception.  It shows that she is very capable at different forms of music, something I'd like her to explore in future albums.
B007IXWL2C|5|So sad they are over... love love loved these!!!<br /><br />Wish there were more, I could read these all day .. So inticing impossible to put down.
B002JXK5VU|5|Funny and geeky
B006LSZECO|4|I liked it because it kept my interest and I wanted to know what was next.  I really got into the characters.
B00L23RCPU|1|Horribly slow and boring
0312427565|5|I can't believe it took me so long to read this book. Now I can't put it down. I am a pilot and read a lot of aviation literature, and think this some of the best. The story is fascinating and Tom Wolfe is a wonderful writer.
B00881VLCE|5|Beautiful pictures.  I will be buying more of these very soon since I can't stop doing them! You will not be disappointed.
B007PTJOV0|5|so much fun...good distraction while on the subway. just like being 10 again playing Mario bros. for hours after school.
B004GJXQ20|5|Amazing and intense - such a good read. Love all the detail and back stories which you wouldn't be able to follow in the series.
B00AREIAI8|5|I think you should play it it looks stupid but its really fun!!!!!!!!!! I love it I'm almost have another horse
B00BVYNSLC|5|I love it
038533348X|5|I read this over forty years ago, and it still makes me laugh today. The book was in better shape than I expected!
B00KDHSNV8|5|I Can't even tell You how much I LOVE this CD !! Finally found an Artist who truly relates on a Sensual Level  in Music. I have enjoyed many songs by Richard Marx but this one is not like any other he's done before. This CD is a HUGE Hit in My Book !! I consider this Album Richard Marx's  Best to Date.  I simply cannot stop listening to it.
B000053VAZ|5|I ordered this because it's my favorite and I couldn't find it in any stores. It arrived on time and in great condition, actually brand & new still in plastic! It was only a few bucks and actually cheaper than buying it retail.
B000SC245E|4|Had to buy this product or the printer would not work, however it did not solve all the problems.  Would recommend it.
B004DI7HZ6|1|I wanted an easy, fun read, and heard good things about this book. Unfortunately, it was unbearably stupid. It was obvious, uninteresting, and unsatisfying. Finishing it was one of the greatest and most disappointing efforts of my life. I kept thinking some unexpected plot twist was around the corner, but alas, the narrative thread turned out to be as uninspired as the characters. I'm completely fatigued by the trite story of an intelligent woman becoming totally vapid after falling in love with a handsome, dominating man. 50 Shades of Grey (which would actually seem like a parody of itself if not for the horrific prose) actually did it better than this book.
B004XZ99LO|2|Ok
B000MCH5P4|2|If this were simply the segment set in Japan, it would have made for a wonderful film. As it stands, the Japanese segment is really just a long tangent, for it really doesnt connect all that well to the rest of the film at all. As for those other parts, its your typical interconnected stories sort of come together to create an overall feel type movie, the type of film Robert Altman made so well, and the type of film that has been way overdone in the past few years. The problem with these films is the writer figures that he can make everything sort of interesting, then cut away when it gets boring. It's lazy screenwriting. The real problem with Babel, though, is every time a scene starts to get interesting, they cut away. It makes for a very mediocre experience. Brad Pitt looks a little rugged and cries somewhat, Cate Blanchett sleeps or moans the whole film, Gael Garcia Bernal shows up and looks crazy and then disappears suddenly, and everyone else acts like an idiot. Not a single person in this film acts like a real human being would act. These characters act in accordance with the screenwriters ideas. Even the directing, which is usually pretty fantastic from this guy (even in the horrible, horrible 21 Grams) is drab, except, again, for the Tokyo scenes. All in all, a film that really could have used some great editing. If you didnt buy into the hype of Crash, then dont check this out. However, if you thought Crash was the apex of modern cinema, you'll most likely drool all over this one too. My suggestion- dont buy into the reviews.
B00992CF6W|2|I do not like this game.I played it and it  has box animals and no horses. I love survival craft. I would not pay for this game. I would  pay for survival not Minecraft.
0670020745|3|This story is amazing, and it was interesting to read about her experiences in both halves of her brain, but she didn't spend as much time talking about the right brained \\"nirvana\\" state as I had hoped.  This book would be good for someone who had a friend or relative who recently experienced a stroke or brain injury as she details her rehab & how it felt to relearn normal daily functions.
B00005RYLE|5|hey Deadites or to those of you that stumbled in.... this is a great movie and one of my favorites! the color is sooo cool, it's all squishy. the other cool thing is it has the pages from the movie book in it as well. it is a really cool item... this items is truely for those of you who love evildead and want anything that comes out for it.... if you have the ash figure ya gotta have this.
0743454537|3|Though I wouldn't call the writing spectacular, the subject matter of this story is enough to make up for it. Filled with tension, sadness, and many difficult decisions, it was a very interesting read and good for discussion. The ending was a little too convenient with a predictable movie-like twist, but beyond that, I was not disappointed. I don't know if I would be compelled to pick up another of Piccoult's works, but may give her another try in the future.
B00000K3UR|2|Pros:<br />*Rob Schneider and Jon Stewart,though secondary,are very funny.<br />*The kid was cute and convincing.<br />Cons:<br />*Very dramatic ending.If it were funny,it would've been better.<br />*The jokes aren't  much.<br />Bottomline:When I heard that it was a comedy that grossed about  150-60 million dollars,I thought that it could be just as funny as Kingpin  or Dumb&amp;Dumber.If you're an Adam Sandler fan,it's good.Otherwise,if a  few laughs make a movie worth it to you,give it a rent in a boring weekend.
B00HBQWGXK|1|Tedious, boring. The writing has been reduced to a litany of mundane factoids. Long for the early days when we discovered Jack Reacher series by Lee Child.<br /><br />Now, the reader wants to just skim over pages and pages of minutiae that just drags on endlessly. The sentence structure is similar to &#34;See Spot run&#34;, or &#34;Mary ate beans&#34;.
B00MIA0KGY|5|Barbara has always been my favorite singer.
B000WAXH2Q|5|bought this for my mom for her kindle fire. she is a rabid fan as am i. can never go wrong with diana
B00004ZB9D|3|Well, he put his hits in there, but there are too many songs that have the same beat that arn't all that good. I'm also a little dissapointed that he put some not-so-good hits on there, but didn't put &quot;If you can't say no&quot; on there. That was a great song w/ a great, &amp; unique beat, unlike some of the 70's sounding disco songs he put on there.
B00JP5GRVM|3|I chose this movie based on a short 20 minute  audio book narrated by Ben Stiller. It wasn't really what I expected because the movie did not really follow the short prelude. Although the scenery throughout the movie was really beautiful, it was very difficult to follow and seemed  to constantly jump from scene to scene so you really have to give it all of your attention.
B000W7JWUA|5|We received this as a gift from the same family that gave us [[ASIN:B0002TV2LU Ticket to Ride]] which we love. This game is even better for the ability to provide strategic thinking opportunities mixed with good old fashioned randomness. My youngest started playing at 9 years old and has actually won the game against adult strategists. The game plays differently with 5 or 6 players than 4 - not sure which I like better. But, both are fun, fascinating entertainment. We used to play cards - hearts, spades, pinochle but since these games came along as gifts the cards haven't been used much. We play this game at our lake house - which has no TV or computer, but I'm now purchasing one for the main house as we can't get enough of this game with just our time at the lake!
B0028K3192|5|Well, for one thing, this album is the first of a proposed trilogy of albums, hence the short length.  Second, why do people expect an artist to give you more of the same thing they've been giving you.  I like the fact that Maxwell has grown artistically and is attempting to give me something else than a retread of his previous brilliant work.  I like this album a lot...the brevity is a welcome change of pace from CDs with 20 plus tracks, most of which are filler.  Plus, after reading these reviews, I feel there is a definite lack of analysis here...the song \\"Stop the World\\" is a gorgeous and heartfelt composition.  I say give these songs another spin and to Maxwell, I say, \\"Brother, keep up the good work.\\"
0316223239|3|The choice of writing from the perspective of a 5 year old to an adult audience is risky. I tired of it after 50 pages, although the story was compelling.
B0055SWM08|5|Not only is the gameplay endlessly addictive, but this game is lovely to look at.  The music is pleasing too, and it seems to contribute to my inability to put this game down.  Best of all, it was a free app of the day when I acquired it.  It would have been worth the $0.99, though.  I might get the sequel when I'm done with this one.  The perfect puzzle game.
B0000035E7|2|Bleach is a decent enough punk album.  But to say that Kurt Cobain is a guitar legend and did more for music than any other musician is blatant lying.  He just happened to hit at a time when things were already  changing.  The truth of the matter is that they didn't hit the mark near as  close as early '90s bands such as Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.  If you want a  truly ground-breaking album from the early '90s, get MetallicA.  But don't  over praise Cobain.
B000JMKQX0|4|Very realistic view on a highly unlikely event. It was a great read. Very detailed look at how the world would fare in a zombie apocalypse. I actually had more fun reading the book the second time.
0756405890|5|Very good book. You don't even have to be a fantasy fanatic to love this book. Just plain good writing.
B00T74HTY0|4|As enjoyable as the first book. Really enjoy Marvin
B002KKCVWI|5|Sized as expected. Seems rugged. Just breaking them in. Straps are secure. Easy to put on and take off. Great!
B0084AZXKK|5|A classic read - very enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|3|Interesting and confusing.  Need to tread more to determine my tech thoughts and feelings.  Keeps your attention  and makes you thqink
B00BSBR9N6|5|Really enjoyed this book. Very different. From the viewpoint of a narrator who is Aspergers/Autistic seeming who finds love in spite of questioning whether he is capable of it. Very well done. A quick, smooth read.
0385522401|5|I have to confess up front that Ian McEwan is one of my favorite novelists.  \\"On Chesil Beach\\" further solidifies McEwan as a master of prose and the English language.  The story centers on the wedding night in 1962 of Edward and Florence -- fittingly before the sexual revolution and changing sexual mores of the later 1960s.<br /><br />From different parts of British society, McEwan takes us inside the minds of these two characters, both virgins, as they each ponder the impending consumation of their love on their wedding night.  As the night unfolds, it is more than uncomfortable reading the meticulous detail that McEwan paints of the awkward attempt of Edward and Florence to have sex.  While this scene doesn't occupy many pages, one has already sensed a classic cataclysmic moment that is the hallmark of McEwan's books.<br /><br />After that moment, the reader is left to ponder how the inevitable post -bedroom encounter between Edward and Florence will play out.  In the end, the dialogue \\"on Chesil beach\\" is perfectly constructed -- the only thing not perfect is the choice that both characters make that resonates with each of them for the rest of their lives.
B0074MZSWW|5|Saw them on sing a couple of songs on Saturday Night Live thought I'd take a chance on an album. So glad I did this album is great ,blues, rock ,soul, this chick can sing it all.
0316055433|5|Excellent novel.
B0063IH60K|5|works great on nextbook 2<br />would be great if taskbar wasn't covered by app. graphics are very good and app speed as well
B008XG1X18|5|Pinterest is definitely one of my favorite apps...works great. Makes it easy to find the things I'm looking for without having to use a search engine. Easy to use and always interesting.
B00E5N8DGG|3|Great to see them in concert again, but their vocal range isn't what it used to be.  I was hoping for a bit more, the range affected a couple songs.
B00QW8TYWO|5|It's just fun too see what the new characters do and it's very addictive!
081099741X|5|The large format is exploited beautifully, as each page is brimming with great visuals.  An essay and interview is devoted to each movie, with insightful discussions of theme and style, and lots of fascinating production trivia.  Chabon's introduction is a pleasure as well.  (And it pleases me to no end that Anderson does not come off as a pretentious blowhard, but charmingly self-effacing and amiable.)
B004GJDQT8|5|Good app, very pleased. Thank you Amazon!
0688014291|1|I normally don't understand how reviewers can give a book 1-Star when the majority of other reviewers have given it 5-Stars.  I've assumed the 1-Star peeps just didn't \\"get it\\" or that they were exaggerating their low rating for effect.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I now find myself in that position.  This book was horrible.  I tried to pull some value from it, but it just wasn't in there.  During the 30 minutes it took to read this (yes, it's that short), I found myself starting to feel bad for the authors.  Kind of in the way you feel bad for a child that does something totally incorrectly, but her parents don't want to hurt her feelings, so they give unwarranted praise instead.  But then I realized they've obviously made boatloads of money off of this thing, so now I just feel bad for everyone who has read it.<br /><br />Seriously, there are so many great business books out there.  How this one has managed to sneak its way near the top is baffling.
B002PQ7JQK|5|Excellent Blu-ray rendition of the original TV series.  Crisp colours, excellent sound, plus the option to view the episodes in original form, or with updated effects.  These new effects are seamless, not distracting, and do not detract from the original artistic intent.  In other words, both modern first-time viewers and nostalgic fans will love this excellently produced Blu-ray classic series.  I was surprised there was no box-set &#34;box&#34; (they're three individual season boxes), but this is trivial: it is the quality of a product that counts, not snazzy packaging, and this Blu-ray experience makes a perfect gift, or a perfect addition for your own Blu-ray library.
B00BHNQ5XK|5|Me and my wife both loved this movie. I don't want to give away anything if you've not watched it. But if your a horror movie fan it's a must watch.
B0070NSPCU|5|\\"Blood Song (Raven's Shadow Trilogy: Book I)\\" by Anthony Ryan is a wonderful, amazing, and magnificent fantasy/adventure story that will captivate and entertain you. The first words that come to mind when thinking about this epic novel are; wondrous, brilliantly written, enchanting, intense, magical, melifluous pacing, exquisitely atmospheric settings, elegant verbiage, richly developed characters, comradery, epic storyline, dystopian fantasy, a must read, and soon to be classic in this genre...5+stars!
B001GJOL22|5|If you were lucky enough to have seen a show form this tour and want to capture the essence of your experience, you can not go wrong with this purchase.
B00DU74U74|5|I would watch it again. I was very impressed with how well it followed the book. that was pretty cool.
B000XUBFE2|5|Worth reading the book after you see the movie.
0486290492|5|school book is being used.
B00BVYNSLC|5|The story is engaging from the first episode. Got me hooked. I didn't want the series to end.
B00BBI9WD6|3|I gave his first a WOW, but this book his editor needed to reel back his overly descriptive passages. Since noone did that the author became even more descriptive. Boring chapters lead to bored readers.
B00571F26Y|5|Have been feeling so much better after eliminating wheat. Fasting blood sugars are going down. Awesome book that will change life's.
0545305497|5|After seeing the movie I had to read the books. Which I did in about a weeks time, hard to put down after you start reading them. Now I can't wait until the other movies come out.
0060853980|5|Great book... The audiobook is great too. I got this for my son (and myself) and would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.. same wit and humor<br /><br />I would buy again
B001F12J0C|4|I have seen each of these movies a couple of times but now I can watch them whenever I wish to.  I love the action and car chases.  This was a good deal,
B0002Y4T92|1|I bought two copies of this from the Eric Clapton website (shipped from Warner Home Video). Both copies were bad on disc 2 starting at about chapter 20. I rented a copy from Netflix and got the same thing. It would be a wonderful disc set to purchase if it weren't flawed from the factory. Warner Home Video would not replace or refund since I had made my purchase over 30 days ago. Tell me how to buy in time for Christmas and then know within 30 days if the DVD is defective. I love Eric Clapton but his wonderful name was used to rip me off.
B004GHNIRK|5|Great book
B009ZQ8FQG|4|Wasnt sure about this series but, it had really good reviews so we decided to try it out!  After the first episode S1E1, we were like &#34;What do you think?&#34; and we found ourselves saying let's view one more to guage it better!  Well, that's all it took as you started to get a sense for the family member/roles coupled with the Servants and their roles!  Now we've watched the first 3 seasons in the past 2 weeks and are on the 4th season while wishing there was more time in the day to view a couple more episodes!  Overall the series is very good and the characters well orchestrated into the entire story line!  Well done PBS and have enjoyed!  Season 3 is a heartbreaker but, that's all I'll say!  Enjoy!
B005PK56TA|5|I didn't watch until this season. I like witch stories so I gave it a try. Held my attention week after week. Really hated to see it end but it did end well. Answered all the questions yet could do another season with some different cast members. Would like to see a Kathleen Turner type brought in. Give it a try Coven will impress.
B008KE3960|4|Very good game. Somewhat poor touch sensitivity. Generally not an issue unless you want to make loops close to each other. Have a Griffin survivor case and haven't tested it without that. I'll update after I try that.<br /><br />Have since played the game without the survivor screen, verdict...no change. Still a very fun game with good graphics.
B00H71PHS0|5|Love it
B00NAPEAQC|1|Not that good.
B0060MYM3S|5|I'm a sucker for commentaries, so I was thrilled to see that there is a commentary for almost every episode (and two for Blackwater)! The show, of course, is fantastic. Beautifully acted, perfect costumes and SFX.
B00F8H7DYQ|5|Arrived MUCH faster than originally stated, from Asia! It's a gift so haven't opened it yet but all looks good.
1780674880|5|Gorgeous drawings.  Very pleased!
B006GLLREU|5|Love to watch the characters evolve in this series.  I find it compelling to watch.
0743487486|2|This book has made me reflect on many aspects of my parenting.  Unfortunately, it did so by making me feel guilty and berated.  When I feel guilty and insecure, I become a worse parent - I fixate on my actions rather than on watching and responding lovingly to my child.    While reading this book I felt as though I was being manipulated by the highly rhetorical style.  Although it is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum to books like [[ASIN:0971453209 On Becoming Baby Wise: The Classic Sleep Reference Guide Used by Over 1,000,000 Parents Worldwide]], at the end, i felt with both books as though unworkable advice was being shoved down my throat.      I honestly wish I hadn't read it, because I can get the same parenting tips and information from other sources without the emotional baggage.  Try [[ASIN:0446504122 NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children]] for the same information about praise, for example.
B00EFWU91E|5|It was indeed a long wait for this book but<br />It it was worth it,  now I wish there will be another book.
0345529057|5|These are amazing books. I would recommend them to anyone who loves the fantasy genre, as well as anyone who is new to it.
B0086700CM|5|I love this app it was amazing and really addicting I really really really love how. you don't have to buy anything at all!!
B00L9B7IKE|3|The characters neurosis got a little old bit the plot was interesting
B007R7PPJK|5|I was using a stock CPU heatsink/fan for my Athlon 5200+ dual core processor.  My CPU temp was consistently at 100-115 degrees Fahrenheit for each core.  After replacing the stock CPU cooler with the Scythe Samurai (using Arctic Silver 5 thermal compound), my temperature never gets above 85 degrees on each core.  This cooler backs up what it claims.  Love the low profile.  Easy to install.  Glad I made this purchase.
B00F7YHDWC|5|This game is so fun because u don't need to buy anything and love the music video. And be safe around trains a message from metro. S
0896760278|3|I know it is probably heresy to say this, but I can never decide whether or not to keep Arnold's books in my library.  I love the fact that she gives you graphed patterns for historic clothing and her writing is clear and interesting.  The projects are not for the beginning seamstress, but are clearly explained by the author.  I guess I have a problem with some of the clothes she chooses to reproduce--not all the examples are good looking or typical of their period.  The choices seem very esoteric; for some people that is probably part of their charm.  If you find enough examples you like I would recommend the books, but you might want to take a look at them at the library first.
B008Y5N3O8|3|The film was a little slow, but great acting.
B00DJFIMW6|5|Love this game! So much fun &amp; entertainment, definitely a good choice!  The minions keep me laughing the whole entire time. It is quite a challenging game though.
B00A757EFW|3|Classic game has been around a long time and I can remember play it as a child. I don't have the energy needed anymore to keep up with the fast pace, but a good game none the less
1594633665|4|Very interesting because the author takes you into the mind of an alcoholic. I was a little confused at first but once I realized what was happening, I started to enjoy the book.  It's very good and surprising at the end.  My sister in law just finished it and she texted me to tell me she &#34;loved the ending&#34;.  We read this book for our book club.
B00MIA0L9U|4|I've liked the FF for a number of years, but I definitely feel like the last several albums have been very 'cookie-cutter' and I grew bored with them pretty fast. I was pleasantly surprised that this new FF release sounds fresh and new, while still having all the elements I like in their music. This is a very progressive album for FF!  I also can't wait to watch the HBO documentary (I didn't even know about it until after I bought this) which sounds very original and should illuminate some of the creation process around the music. I even heard talk of a sequel...<br />I don't usually rate music as 5 stars unless I instantly love it and continue to after many listens in the future. So for now this gets 4, but could very well be a 5 if I continue to listen and enjoy!
B005P1YCNK|4|Principles you've probably heard before but presented in a way that makes sense. It's up to you, the reader, to take action. I will keep this as a guide to reread often to keep me on track. I've also used principles and analogies in this book to coach my kids.
B000002UV9|5|I have all Queensryche cds.  I was introduced to this band about 7 years ago and I fell in love instantly.  My most favorite song would have to be silent lucidity.  I recently got the opportunity to see them in concert.  What a great show.
B008M721MS|1|This app was perfectly fine before the update... but now, I can't do video messaging, voice calls, or even instant messaging... I am very disappointed because I was very happy before, and it was totally fine...  -sigh- please fix this?
B002BJGYV2|5|It was brand new still in the packaging. I am very happy to add this to my collection. Hours of enjoyment.
B00EOARZ4G|4|While reading this book and then watching the news I had to continually remind myself that I was reading a book when reading and watching the news when I was watching.  The 'predictions' he made were remarkably predictive.  I was able to separate truth from reality when the news kept referring to President Obama and not President Ryan making me realize we are still in a mess.  Maybe we can get President Ryan now.
B000EQ5TSI|4|To me, this is the best M:IP movie. Great action and the story is great too. John Woo directed this so of course the action is very stylistic and cool. I think people will and have enjoyed this film
B00W6XM002|5|Fun game!!! I'm hooked
B000002IJO|4|This band shows that it can continue to put out the sound that made them famous.  'Dance' is the single that made people buy this album but there are a number of good tunes.  'Body Talk' and 'Looking for Love' are a little on the pop side but they have some nice riff's.<br />If you are a Ratt lover, I would get this album.
B00881VLCE|4|Not a bad ap. The difficulty level can be adjusted and the pictures themselves offer good challenges. I haven't tried downloading more images so can't comment on that aspect.
B0006L16N8|1|Let me start by saying that when I was first introduced to Colplay's music about 5 years ago, I thought they were the greatest band to come along in a very long time. They knew how to play, write and after seeing them in concert, I thought they were solid showmen. I also enjoy a good sappy love song as much as the next guy (if it's well-written).     That being said, what the heck are these guys thinking?? I am absolutely shocked that EMI have allowed Coldplay to release an album that is unimaginative, poorly written and filled with every cliche lyric known to mankind (you'll be able to sing along 15 seconds into the first listen).  Additionally, X&Y sounds like a thoughtless, watered-down version of everything they've ever produced. I'll even go so far to say that it's the crappiest piece of recorded crap in the history of crappy music.    If you're looking for something new, or something that is well crafted, look elsewhere. I don't advocate piracy, but do yourself a favor:  Save your money, and download it from Kazaa, or Limewire, 'cause EMI and Coldplay sure don't deserve one cent of your hard earned money.    My only regret is that I pre-ordered the album from Itunes, and could not get my money back.
B00000IZOR|4|The cord to the receiver is too short.  Otherwise grandkids love it.
B000001A3H|5|I had purchased this album on recommendation from an older friend in 1992, and have had to purchase two more copies since. There is only one way to describe this release,&quot;Simply Spectacular&quot;. While it may be heavy, it is simply an album full of warmth and plenty of groove. Kyuss is much more on the realm of &quot;thinking mans&quot; music then what they get credit for, and Chris Goss knew it. From start to finish, this album is a 50 million year trip with complex tempo and melodic changes. John Garcia may not have the voice of an opera singer, but it is used as just another instrument, and is absolutely vital to the cohesiveness of this band. Thumb, Green machine and Allen's Wrench may be the movers of this album, but all parts between and beyond is simple beauty.<br />Appothecaries Weight is astounding. While many believe this song is an instumental, it indeed has lyrics. Try for yourself and listen through headphones and without distraction, I think you will be surprised. John Garcia's Voice is turned from rasping cigarette laden growling, to muze like whispers. And once you hear the most obvious lyrical content, everytime you listen, more words will work their way out to you. <br />Then go to Nick Oliveri's project song on this album, Mondo Generator. Although this is a song about a journey into psycidelic hell, it is definately a groovy one. I listened to this song at night travelling west on the Chicago Skyway and had constant chills the whole ride. <br />From Start to finish, this album is a journey through the mind and the senses, and contrary to what you may think, you don't need to be stoned to appreciate it. Without a doubt, is within the top 5 albums of all time for me, and should be for you as well.
B0047Y0FGY|5|Tina Fey had me laughing from page one, I didn't stop laughing until the very last page. Humor with an angle that I totally get.
B00005JLRT|3|I don't remember buying this..but If I did...then okay...it was mean for my dad. i'm sure he enjoyed watching it.
B009YP9L7U|5|Nice romance to not think about any problem in the world and wish that you can feel the same kind of love!
B00CQHZ32U|1|I am very disappointed in this item. I feel like the past was misleading.  I will always read reviews from now on.  They are so tiny and not what I expected
B007GCY8FS|3|Interesting but predictable.....I read it through without skipping pages - which is unusual for me.  Very light read.  Slightly better than average.
B00A4W3AJC|1|If you want to waste your time and money, this is the blu-ray for you. Instead try the Qatsi Trilogy, which was recently released in blu-ray.
0736430512|5|Before my Daughter sees a movie,she likes to read a book.She was very happy to get this book for Christmas,excellent story line and great pictures,we hope the movie is also good.Great price and fast shipping!!!
B003MC5N28|5|Great concept, fabulous execution, wonderful conversation-starters for students throughout.
B000B5MI3Q|5|I like automatic (self winding) dive watches and have had several over the past 30 odd years.  (My last one did a suicidal leap overboard and is on the bottom of the ocean.)  This one is very well made and robust and performs exactly as expected.  I have not yet taken it diving but I don't expect any trouble with it given Seiko's reputation.  While you can spend a lot more, and certainly less, this is a nice price point.
B00NCGXYJS|5|Bette Midler never disappoints & 'It's The Girls' is no exception! This is GREAT! I love it!
B007P0Z9AY|5|Very well produced.
B002UM5BXW|5|Very Satisfied.  Will do business again in the future.  Highly recommend them.
B000002OX5|4|Everything we take for granted in the Whonivese - Townshend's arty lyrics and approach set to crushing rock 'n' roll, is found here. This album is essentially a transitional effort from the Mod days to the rock days. In the spirit of it being transitional, it's not perfect: Silas Stingy (one of Entwistle's worst), Armenia City in the Sky; Sunrise and Rael (only worth noting because its instrumental break was the basis for the Sparks riff from Tommy.<br />On the other hand, this is a lot of fun, and simply one of the Who's best. An ode to pirate radio, it's stuffed with mock-commercial jingles, all of which are a riot. More importantly, it contains some of the Who's key songs: I Can See For Miles was probably the heaviest song ever made at the time, and still packs a punch now. Marianne with the Shaky Hand returns the [..]theme from Pictures of Lily, this time with an easygoing (dare I say mellow?) folk-pop melody and such. Tattoo is one of the group's funniest, a song about coming of age told in a lighthearted way. Our Love Was is one of their best pop songs, and there's also the quasi-spiritual I Can't Reach You.
B004DLPXAO|1|Downloaded this app 4 times on android but it still does not display page writing on pages downloaded app for Ipad & works perfectly Web help from Kindle non existant
B003TQKVGU|3|Its a good read for those who believe in subconscious mind :)<br />Keep practicing the ideas to get more benefit out of it.
B0000029GA|5|Man it doesn't get any better than this, DJ Premier,Pete Rock,Q-Tip,Large Professor on one album. Remember they were the top 4 producers back then, A must have classic debut album from Nas. 9 straight unfast foward tracks, not a single bad track on here,flawless LP,go pick this one up.
B0015GF4FO|5|Best drama series I have seen in a long time
B004VMVTNU|5|This is a great app, works flawlessly on galaxy s epic. I've tried other alarm apps that have failed me, this app works 100% of the time and is easy to use.

0062364286|5|Thank You
B000JMKQX0|5|I don't normally read much fiction, preferring science and history.  Zombies in general are immensely not scary and stupid, due to my own educational background in anatomy and physiology. Picked this up in an airport because it was written as a history book, and footnoted like the science that I love.<br /><br />Well, I've read it three times now and given copies to friends.  I think Brooks nailed how world governments and people in general would deal with some large scale catastrophic event. The denial, the lying, the greedy profiteers, the noble and heroic responses of ordinary people.<br /><br />Cannot recommend this book enough.  It's a great ride. No, I didn't spell that last word wrong.
B0000C0FJB|5|Yet another Rush live album.  This is the third time some songs including Tom Sawyer, The Spirit Of Radio, Freewill, and The Trees have appeared on Rush live albums, not to mention the fourth time Closer To The Heart has appeared on a live album.  However, this is the first Rush Concert album. In the past Rush live albums have consisted of songs from different shows and different tours.  Rush in Rio documents an entire show, from November 2003, when the band played the country of Brazil for the first time in it's long career.  The result is nice.  The sound is pretty good, if not perfect.  The songs have not been altered in anyway giving the album a good live feel.  The set list is a lot of fun.  With the exception of Caress of Steel and Hold Your Fire, every Rush album is represented.  This is a nice companion piece to the Rush In Rio DVD.  A must have for any Rush fan.
B00DRPVE3M|5|I have been very pleased with the selections I have made with my kindle. Enjoyable stories and fun games in no time at all.
B009NQKPUW|5|enjoyed this
B004N622EY|5|A very solid story, lovely world with interesting developing characters.<br />Well written, and a good read for new readers as well as experienced.
B00FAPF5U0|5|Endless fun! Never a board moment. Each level brings a new challenge. As a matter of fact,I have to stop myself from playing. SO ADDICTIVE!!!!!! I find myself begging people for lives and entries into the next level.
B00QW8TYWO|4|Game is really great I wish there were more coins but other than that it's a really funny and fun game.
B003K025TQ|5|[[VIDEOID:mo1Q0STTV1XNGS2]]Lots of great musicians, good variety, great production. Buy it!
B00ESCJG1U|5|This is the most useful and professional photo app for any mobile platform. It really removes the haze that exists in many photos and automatically corrects white balance so that your photos look natural and just the way you envisioned before pressing the shutter button.
B002LC2DQ4|5|Good size and worked as expected.
B006IYG5HE|4|I like the concept of juggling between the different eras and detail about the war years in the author's country was very interesting.  Possibly because I read the book in bits; picking it up most nights before going to sleep, it took me a while to understand the why of floating between the two eras and how they were related.<br />I do like the main character and look forward to reading another (my second), with him as the lead.
0345350499|5|This novel tops my best-loved, most read list.  A deep and moving tale of Britain, in the time of King Arthur, when the old religion of the Goddess is being threatened by Christianity.  The story follows all the woman in Arthur's life; mother, sister, wife.   Although the length and size of the book tend to frighten, once you start, you won't be able to stop!
B00992CF6W|5|This game is so darn cool. It does not tell you what to do, so you decide what your world will be and how you want it, not how the game creators want it. It gives you freedom. You can tame a dog and it will protect you against attacking mobs. You could find villages, abandoned mine shafts, and things you never knew existed. It also has 2 options for a world Creative or Survival. Both are awesome. Build and do things you never knew you could. Overall I think this game is awesome and I bet you will too.
B005LAJ22Q|5|Very Quick delivery on all products!<br /> DVDs in Perfect condition!! I am definitely a huge Fan now!!<br />Great series that we enjoyed!<br />We ordered every season that is available!!
B004U7JYXS|4|I had ordered a 50 pack a couple months ago and it was perfect, all the film worked and the packaging was as shown a box with 5 packs of film.<br />  However I got another 50 pack just recently I expected to get another 5 pack film and I recieved 2 20 packs and one 10 cartridge only with the aluminum wrapping. I was disappointed because its easily damaged<br />  I put the single pack in my camera and ive wasted 8 pictures and they have come out just fine. I'll update my review of any of the film are defective, but as of now the film is great the packaging was a let down, so 4 stars. :)

B00BSBR9N6|5|At a subconscious level, I think I knew why THE ROSIE PROJECT attracted my attention. It has the colors of the Italian flag (I love all things Italian): green, white and red (this one happens to have a different cover...).<br /><br />Every time I stepped into Borders, I saw this book and picked it up to examine it. I never failed to &#34;scan&#34; it and I enjoyed reading the tweets and brief reviews that are included in the novel. According to my instinct, this is a fail-proof book, and it's guaranteed to make me happy and smiling. Yet, I didn't buy it until after three weeks from the first time I set my eyes on it.<br /><br />I reckoned 21 days were enough in terms of waiting to decide on the purchase, so I bought the book. I took THE ROSIE PROJECT by Graeme Simsion home with me.<br /><br />&#34;The world is going to fall in love with Don and Rosie.&#34; That's what Jill Mansell said. No kidding.<br /><br />Closer articulated my exact sentiments: &#34;Don's awkwardness and quirks are bound to charm the pants of you - and may even leave you with a bit of a crush.&#34; Yes, Don is pleasantly, intellectually awkward and he counts everything to its most precise timing. He has a fixed schedule down to eating lobsters every Tuesday (according to his Standardised Meal System), and has to recalibrate if his schedule is thrown off course. It's hilarious to see him recalculate or use the term The Rosie Time.<br /><br />Another thing that endeared me to Don is the way he project-coded everything—just like how I name my most-dear-to-my-heart project-of-the-moment Project Mozzarella (or other &#34;projects&#34; I called Project 50 and so on). Stuff like that, you know?<br /><br />Here are all the adjectives I can think of to describe this wonderful page-turner: romantic, funny, inspirational, thought-provoking, comedic, sensitive, awkward, quirky, charming, delightful, brilliant, good-hearted, gem, unputdownable, moving, touching, fascinating, adorable, smart, amazing, amusing, clever, different, skillful, special, extraordinary.<br /><br />Be prepared to be charmed by science. I love the fact that this novel—written by a technical guy—is so readable and awesomely romantic even in the most awkward way.ng, clever, different, skillful, special, extraordinary.<br /><br />Be prepared to be charmed by science.

B0035YTG30|3|It was cute and clean, but the ending was a bit of a letdown.
B004VMUS9G|5|This is a great app, I haven't had any problems with it on my Kindle Fire HD. Very customizable, great look, lots of options, perfect for your basic everyday alarm and/or for a different alarm for everyday of the week. My favorite part is that you can set the music on your device as the actual alarm tone. Love this app, would definitely recommend.
0743200799|5|The critics say that Gene Kranz isn't a writer, he's an engineer.<br />The critics should stick to reading &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; if they want flowing prose and exciting stories about space without regard to accuracy.<br />Kranz is a character, to be sure.  His personality looms large, even after the public's fascination with the space program has waned.  His accounts of the events surrounding the early days of the space program, the moon landings, and the following steps of man's ventures into space are a must-read for anyone interested in an accurate account of the unparalleled achievements by NASA in its early days.<br />In addition to giving his viewpoint on several well-known and frequently retold events -- as so many books on the space program do -- Kranz gives some as-yet-untold perspective on key parts of the program that are often overlooked.  In particular, Kranz shares the details that went into the development of the processes that were required to send men into space and return them safely to the earth.  He relates just what a monumental task it was to create the mission rules, the flight plans, and the contingencies that made the program a success.  <br />Also newly told was Kranz's recount of the scene in Mission Control as Apollo 11 approached a moon landing and program alarms began to sound in the lunar module -- and the role simulations played in saving the day.<br />&quot;Failure Is Not An Option&quot; is more of an historical account than a novel ... and it's much better that way.

B0089LOG02|4|The book was good. It kept me engaged and anxious to find out what happens next. The book left me hanging though so hoping there will be a sequel.

0449911357|5|Hello! My name is Sunny, and i am 13 years old. my mother gave me this book(fried green) for me to read for my book report, but i did not want to read it, b/c it was so long. so i read it in my free time. i loved this  book from cover-to-cover! it tells a great story about 2 women in the 80's-  one is a fat woman, eagar to lose weight, and is also going through a bad  case of menapause, Evelyn, and the other is an old lady, Mrs. Threadgoode  who has lived through the Great Depression, and everytime her friend comes  in the lounge of her nursing home she  talks about her days during the  Depression, and her friends during that time. she tells about the hard  days, when the KKK ruled over the South, and when a full meal cost 35  cents. they were hard days, but she tells how she and her friends, Idgie  and Ruth lived through them, making it an exciting and suspensful tale,  that really makes you want to have lived through that time, in Whistle Stop  Alabama.  If you want more information, read the book, cuz it is 10x better  than the reviews make it sound! Oh, and after or before the book, watch the  movie. you can rent it at a video store, but check your t.v. guide, because  it was on a couple of days ago. luv ya!, &gt;&gt;~~**sUnNy**~~&lt;&lt;
B006CQLGXG|5|This book is my all time favorite. I've read this book so many times and never get tired of the story. I encourage anyone who hasn't read this book please do so.
B00003CX5A|5|Director Tim Burton has directed many a fantastical lyrical fantasy, among his best are &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands,&quot; &quot;Vincent,&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; &quot;Sleepy  Hollow,&quot; however, outclasses these all in heart, pacing, character  development (excluding Christina Ricci's passable but utterly forgettable  female lead, that is), spirit, mood, and something called (in these days of  overly-glossy melodrama like &quot;Star Wars Episode 1,&quot;  &quot;Tarzan,&quot; and, sadly, &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;--Bond  19) movie magic. This is a film for the ages. Considering the critical and  box office responses (netting over $200 million), expect a sequel to this  heartfelt masterpiece!
B008XG1X18|4|Lots of great things available and most of it is pretty good ideas and projects but some I would never use

B00FAM0H0Q|4|great and recommended
B002WY65W4|5|Great movie!
B007GCY8FS|4|I found this to be a good Jack Reacher book. I delayed reading it due to some bad early reviews, however I was pleasantly surprised. I suspect much of the less than enthusiastic response had to do with the outrage of Tom Cruise be cast as Jack Reacher in the movie.

B003CR9BYE|5|I have always liked Bossa Nova - my first Jazz CD was \\"Getz/Gilberto\\". Most of these songs I am familiar with on the original Portuguese, I've heard them that way for decades. A few of Jobim's songs were translated over the years, but not that many. Portuguese is a wonderfully mellifluous language, someone could read the phone book in Portuguese and it would sound good. Other than the Getz Bossa Nova albums I like \\"Tom and Elis\\". If you look at Samba, it is much more percussive and upbeat whereas Jobim's Bossa Nova lends itself to melancholy treatment by Getz or Sinatra. For what it's worth, Jobim himself preferred these heavily orchestrated versions of his works to to the leaner version on \\"Getz/Gilberto\\", \\"Jazz Samba\\" and \\"Tom and Elis\\".<br /><br />Despite the rave reviews elsewhere, I thought \\"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\\" was disappointing, much too short and I had no idea why songs like \\"Baubles, Bangles and Beeds\\", \\"Change Partners\\" and \\"I Concentrate on You\\", non-Jobim song were included when so many of my favorite Jobim songs were missing.<br /><br />Well I found this new \\"Sinatra/Jobim\\" compilation just wonderful. There are a lot more of the missing Jobim songs from that other album but more important there are translations! I don't know if these are real translations, I don't speak Portuguese, sometimes singers just make up new words. But herein Sinatra does his peerless job of presenting the true emotional feelings behind the lyrics. Particularly good are his renderings or translations of \\"Agua de Beber\\", \\"Desafinado\\", \\"Samba de Uma Nota So\\", \\"Wave\\" and \\"Triste\\". Even if the older Sinatra does have a little trouble reaching that last note in \\"Wave\\", what he looses in tonal accuracy, he gains in emotional depth.<br /><br />I love early Sinatra's stuff, I mostly like his Capitol records and pre-fifties treatments, where he poured his soul into the singing. When he was in love with Ava Gardner, when he had the mob make an offer to a Hollywood director that he couldn't refuse to get Sinatra into \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and save his career. Much of his post 1960 Reprise/Rat Pack/Ringa ding ding stuff leaves me cold. But on this two album combo Concord has put together memorable Sinatra with translations of great Jobim songs I've never heard before. \\"Sinatra/Jobim\\" is much more Jobim than \\"Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim\\".<br /><br />Recommendedcouldn't refuse to get Sinatra into \\"From Here to Eternity\\" and save his career.

B004RCUJ9E|4|Great game, but it definitely suffers from the lack of ability to play others (especially friends) over a network. Kills what I wanted this game for to begin with.
B00BAXFECK|4|Enjoyable but Would have been better if 200 pages shorter.
B005HI4LLY|5|This is a very funny movie! First saw it on Netflix.  It was so funny that I wanted to purchase it to add to our movie library.
B00IKZX1ZI|4|its a interesting twist on bejeweled. nut it is a cute game for younger children. it keeps your attention fairly well.
1476734941|3|Saw the author on a talk show and thought the concept of ingesting 1200 cal or so, for 5 days then two (non-consecutive) days of 500 cal was something different -- I DID follow the program for THREE weeks and failed to lose a pound but it is/was a unique approach to wt. loss (some good recipes) just did not work for me...
B00003CXDZ|5|I was not prepared for the intensity of color, noise and closeups that begin the movie, but they worked - they took me right into the time and place.  I liked the caring group of misfit friends and thought Nicole Kidman &amp; Ewan McGregor singing quite believable, fun and heartbreaking.  The movie made me smile and laugh often, the contemproary music an added kick. Just a plain good flick.  What a movie should be, entertaining.
B007V2UGPE|5|so addictive can't stop playing. five star great game. g r e a t. g a m e . t o o. much fun
B00127RAJY|5|This is by far the HARDEST, but most awesome workout DVD I have ever tried. I could not even get through the first workout because I was not use to doing jumping jacks and working out without a break. If you can make it through the DVD without stopping you WILL feel the burn, and you will feel incredible when you are done. This DVD WORKS! I am happy to say I can now get through the workout without turning it off :)
B007ZGO7EM|4|As calculator go this is by far the easiest one I used.  I also like the fact that I can actually see the numbers.

0790749998|3|Jet Li's film \\"Romeo Must Die\\" is not a translation of \\"Romeo and Juliet,\\" it just mirrors the story a little. That's fine with me, as long as I get my fight scenes. There are tons of fight scenes in this movie and therefore, reasons to be pleased. My big complaint, though, is that not for one minute do we doubt that Li can't handle the black gangsta bad guys in this movie. They're too easy to beat up and provide no challenge for him. But his chemistry with Aaliyah works well as she was a good actress and had a nice screen presence. Li's acting isn't that good, but what do you expect? Oscar-winning performances? The guy whispers half his lines, for crying out loud! Overall, \\"Romeo Must Die\\" is a treat for the martial-arts fan in all of us.
B00004RFCM|5|I wasn't expecting it, but I didn't even pause before buying it when this gem hit the shelves. This is one of the smartest and funniest shows on television. Even better - it's affordable! It's far too typical for TV  shows to come out 1 or 2 episodes to a tape, all priced at $19.95 or more.  At this price, I'll buy the whole series - soon? I hope? I'm waiting for  season two...
B000XUBFE2|5|Such a unique and insightful story! Many books have been written about the holocaust and the atrocities that happened in Germany, but few have captured the emotions as well as this book. I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not read it yet, but the choice of narrator is both unique and unexpected. The prose of the story is very beautiful, and the characters capture your emotions and your imagination. After I finished it, I wanted to reread it again immediately just to catch all of the nuances that I may have missed the first time, simply from reading so quickly since I was so drawn into the story! Highly recommended for anyone interested in the Holocaust, or history in general, or who are just fans of great fiction. Read it, love it!

B000EULJLU|5|This CD is just as great as their other albums, people just built up their expectations waaaaaaaaaaaay too high. True, it does have a few recycled riffs, but even Led Zeppelin ripped themselves off too.  <br />  The main thing you have to keep in mind when listening to this album is that it is an album. Not singles. Album. Every song is part of a larger picture.  <br />  10,000 days is a little softer than Lateralus or Aenima, but it's still very good. It's a little bit of a grower too, so if you don't at first like it, keep listening to it and you'll eventually come around. <br />  This is definalty a bass and drum masterpiece though. The weekest part is the guitars, but the bass and drum (especially the bass) are awesome.  <br /> <br /> <br />    <br />1. Vicarious(7:09)    <br />2. Jambi(7:31)   <br />3.

0156030306|4|Flowers for Algernon, by Daniel Keyes is one of the most touching and interesting stories I've read in a while.  The plot follows Charlie Gordon, a mentally retarded man in his thirties, as he goes through a scientific experiment to improve his IQ.<br />This book is interesting because it is written (in the first person) as Charlie's journal entries; it even includes his horrible spelling and grammar like he is actually the one writing the book.  However, sometimes his spelling is so atrocious that I get headaches and have trouble focusing while reading because it is so difficult! After Charlie's brain surgery, his spelling and grammar progressively improve.  For me, watching his writing abilities and mental capacity progress is very amazing.  I was even moved to tears at certain parts of the book such as when Charlie starts to realize that not everyone is as nice to him as he thought; he realizes that he was being made fun of by others for all of his life.<br />Although there are many parts of the book that are very intriguing, other parts of the book are extremely boring and tedious to read. Charlie sometimes goes into tremendous detail about certain things that aren't even related to the storyline.  These boring phases happen very often throughout the story, especially towards the end of the book.  The book is a series of high and low points of excitement and boredom; sometimes the boring phases lasted just a little too long.<br />Despite the boring phases, I think this book is a classic.  I loved it because the whole idea of the story and the point of view from which it was written is just so surreal and intriguing.  It is very interesting to see the world from Charlie's point of view, even when he becomes very smart; he gets into so many situations that would never happen to an average person.  For example, he wants to visit his parents, but he doesn't know how to come back into their lives when they will be so surprised that he is now intelligent.  These problems aren't very common for most people, so it was very fascinating.<br />Although there were some boring parts in the book, I definitely recommend it because it is intriguing and VERY touching.  The boring phases of the book are worth it for the exciting high points.
B00GDT4M1A|4|Overall nice, box came a bit dented on the sides
0762434260|1|Item took over two weeks to arrive and then broke within five minutes.  It is made of very cheap plastic pieces that you must twist together.  Internal plastic threading snapped off with very little force and was unable to be repaired with super glue.
B003ODIZL6|5|Amazing and the best book I have read well not the whole thing thank u for the best book ever
B00H58VGIA|5|An excellent and very personal view of slavery and an very good read
B00003CX9Q|5|I loved it when I watched it when I was 5 years old. I loved it when I was 13, I loved it more when I am 19. This movie for me is the most emotional movie of all time. The music is my favorite score from Williams which maybe is 50% of the picture. I just watched the new Special Edition trailer and got tears in my eyes again just by watching the trailer. I just can't wait for the re-release. And I recommend this movie to every human of every age. Watch this movie to &quot;remember&quot; that friendship doesn't have any boundries.<br />P.S.<BR>I hope that in the DVD release of the Special Edition they put an isolated music track like in the Laserdisc Box Edition.
B00BUCXVPI|2|Corny role by Tom.. Way to cocky and predictable actions from his character. Would not recommend it to anybody looking to watch a Tom Cruise film
B0044DEAUA|4|State and town I still haven't used it as no one calls me when I am driving.  Must figure it out.
0879309210|5|Great Book!
1935670913|5|I purchased this e-book to get some ideas about how to market our own e-books and discovered a very practical, hands-on approach that can easily be implemented by any author, at minimal cost.

B00FB13Y74|1|This is not the game you want if you don't like thing freezing for 10 freaking minutes! I. Soo mad i waited almost 22 days for this and its not working. My opinion is to not get this game. The only good part is its kinda fun other than the freezing part. Thank you ,and good bye.
B004DLPXAO|2|I have used this app for a long time and loved it.  Recently I somehow accidently locked it in landscape mode and cannot figure out how to return it to the original mode so I can read it with my phone upright.  After trying to figure it out for myself, I looked for a place to report a bug or contact someone for help.  Couldn't find a place anywhere so I resorted to leaving a review hoping someone can help me
B00DPM7TIG|5|I loved this book.It was so beautifully written. The two lives of a sensitive blind girl and brilliant young boy during WWIi was told with compassion.  Highly recommend this book
B008Y7J91M|5|One of the best movies I have seen. Frances is always the perfect example of quality and courage. I admire the movie and the actors. It was only a minor issue that Fanny's brother William was not a player in the movie. I suppose this film will make me forever a fan of Victorian novels.
B00CBRADU2|4|Enjoyed it much more than I thought it would. Good to see Arnold have a leading role again
B00IRISI42|5|David Baldacci always takes his readers on a wild ride. He does not give his plot away too early and just when you think you have it figured out, you find out you don't. This is a third book in a series with the main character of John Puller, even though it is the third book he doesn't lose his punch. I don't want to say too much about the plot, but wow I couldn't put it down.
140006922X|5|good read
B003XTYDMQ|5|Kristen Bell is sassy and awesome and Jason Dohring's Logan is heart wrenching and hilarious. Can't wait for the movie.
B0091574VI|5|We watched this movie as a family and everyone really loved it.  How cute are baby chimps!  Beautiful photography and a story that has everything. This movie gives the viewer an inside look into the world of chimpanzes.  You will laugh & cry and most of all be touched by the extraordinary true story.
B008Y2FRFO|3|I'm gonna try it see if like it maybe I will maybe not<br /><br />Tex is out see u in halo reach. ( Tex ain't mi gt)

B000B589JI|4|Well built: except for it not being completely de-burred... nothing sharp at all:)  Just had to work it with a stiff brush to get rid of some fine filaments of aluminum I didn't want tracking in the treading. Just a little bit more than having to clean it. So far... I would still recommend this to a friend.
B00FWPWNKS|5|Addictive fun game
B00004X01U|2|The songs that are heard on the radio are great, but the rest are really in poor taste. They are short and not well written. It was like she went through a rhyming dictionary just to make her songs rhyme. Buy the singles, but don't waste your money on this one, it definitely doesn't come close to her past albums.
B000065U1N|5|At the being it starts out slow with boring stuff but it turn's into a whold new different movie when the war beings in the city part of Sombia. The action was long and more realistic. When one helicopter crashes it's about those soilders trying their best to get to the crash site then another one crashes. Even little aferican kids had machine guns trying to fight. It all ended when soilders got to Paskistan staduim.
B004Q7CIFI|5|I'm an unashamed Kennedy nut so I grabbed this up as soon as it came out and it did not disappoint.  The way King was able to keep going back, over and over, without messing up the details was nothing short of amazing.
B003UYUP58|5|Outstanding book.
B000B8QEYC|5|This CD is so soothing.  After her last release, I wanted more, and this CD delivers from the first track to the last.  Don't waste your money on Madonna's disaster and try this CD, and you'll see how good it truly is.

B002Q4U9YU|5|The collection is great even if it would have been better with live recordings from the \\"this is it\\" rehearsals.
B00A7OIXW6|5|Our whole family loves this movie and the Hero of the story is also the &#34;villain.&#34; My 9 year old has autism and major sensory issues. He is rough with things but has a heart of gold. He just wants to do things with and for others, but is often shunned due to his inability to be delicate and soft handed. Ralph is a flawed &#34;person&#34; and yet he is only a villain in the sense that it is the role he must play given how he was created. He is honestly the biggest hero and in the end he is loved and accepted for how he was made. God created our son perfectly and he is exactly who he should be. He watches this movie at least once a week and he really loves Ralph.
B00992CF6W|3|Better, not 5 why? The multiplayer mode not found
B00COGZ8FU|5|The guy has these roles nailed. The suspense, the cool, the hi-level action but at a believable level. Really enjoyed the story; nice job of a fresh story. The Duvall role brings a comic relief to a serious ending. Love that guy! Very good movie; romance, action, suspense, crime, comedy all rolled up together.
B000P5FH3K|2|By the time this 2:15 movie is over, I was fidgeting in my shoes because it just seems to drag on without end. Where was the editing? This needed a 30 minute haircut, especially the pedestrian courtroom scenes where absolutely no surprises happen to justify the tedium. Francis Ford Coppola was once a titan, but by 1997 when this bloat job was made, his talent had vanished. I did enjoy some of the acting, especially Jon Voight's shark lawyer. Matt Damon, then unknown, is okay, but not special here. He would do much more with the same-time-frame \\"Good Will Hunting.\\" The plot is standard courtroom fare, and all the characters are stereotypes, including the battered wife, the rumpled clown (Danny DeVito), the wise judge (Danny Glover) and the hard-luck family that wins over the cold hearted insurance company in the end. This movie is the film equivalent of the novel on which it is based: pop junk food.
B00I8H6MGS|5|Dallas Buyers Club was excellent...... the story, the acting everything.... was hard to watch sometimes but it was about a period that was hard for so many people.... took a lot of guts to do this movie and I am glad they did it..... just an excellent movie
B00H96FYN6|5|Excellent quality and excellent packaging.  If you enjoyed this series, you need this!! I would recommend this to anyone above 18!!
B007IXWL2C|5|These books are an awesome read, you can't just read the first one , love how delve into Grey's life and explain where his extra  curricula activities started and came about
0060254920|5|One of my favorite books as a kid!
B006VRDZ44|4|Great Show....just started season 1 and love the plot and the characters.  I am always excited to watch the next episode.
B00TJ69DHM|4|Great tune
0307165485|4|I  really like the book BUT I just want to mention that if you are looking for a book of STORIES, you should know this book has alot of pages that just label things....which is fine.  Like \\"work machines\\" labels all types of machine.....they also have pages on the body parts , food etc.....But if you are looking for a book of stories, this book is not  that....I find myself skipping lots of pages to get to actual stories with my 4 yr old.....I try to get involved on the labeling pages but she wants a story.<br /><br />Bascially I thought I was getting a book choc full of Richard scarry stories and it was not exactly that.<br /><br />But I still think it deserves 4 stars cuz it is a great book....
B001NLKT60|5|Excellent book!  I can't wait to read the next one!
B009WUAK2M|4|If you have lived with these actors throughout their careers, you'll catch on to more than one subtle wisecrack, and when Clint Eastwood's The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly theme music starts playing, and XXXX walks out onto the street, I laughed out loud.  Fun to watch.
B00AP9RQE4|5|Despite the fact that the protagonist is not Miles, but is instead &#34;That Idiot Ivan&#34;, this is a very enjoyable book in the Vorkosigan series.  I have already read it twice, and laughed both times throughout many parts of the book.  I highly recommend reading it.
0425098478|4|Good book that's short and easy to read. Helpful advice from a great author.  You will enjoy it for sure.
B00004YA66|4|Nice surprise! This flick had much more depth than I had expected  and had a really interesting and well-executed plot line. The movie doesn't get all  bogged down in the &quot;how this happed&quot; aspect  but instead just  sets the rules and jumps right in. Quaid shines as the father. I'm not one  to get emotional at movies...but was glad I had a handkerchief.
0767827694|5|This telling of Virginia Woolf's tale is a sweeping epic of grace and beauty.<BR>There could not have been a better choice to portray the gender swapping Orlando than Tilda Swinton.  She lights up the screen with her beauty, grace and subtle wit.  As a young man nervously reciting poetry to Queen Elizabeth, or a modern woman raising a young daughter, she embraces the audience and pulls us fully into her world.  The settings, costumes and music serve to construct a world of changing ages spinning around a single soul in flux.<BR>Orlando is an astounding piece of cinema history and deserves a place of honor in any DVD library.

B008TRUDAS|4|I recently have stumbled about Colleen Hoover and I am quickly falling in love with every book.  Hopeless and Maybe Someday are the ones I recently read and I decided to try her very first novel.  I did like it.  However I could easily tell this was a first novel not only for her but for the trilogy.  While I believed in the love that Will and Lake had, I definitely got annoyed with the 'oh I love you' 'oh I can't be with you' 'oh let's make out' 'oh I am a terrible person' 'oh but we have to find a way to be together' story line.  I also thought the ending was WAY rushed, and that is all I will say without spoilers.<br />I will continue to the next book because I want to see what happens next, not just with Will and Lake, but with Colleen Hoover as a writer.  How she went from writing an 'i like it book' as slammed to a 'i love it book' as is Maybe Someday.
0385495323|5|This is a great read, more of a series of short interesting stories about codemakers and codebreakers. It goes into some technical detail of methods used in cryptoanalysis for the more technically minded, extremely well researched with all the historical facts. One of the few books I read a second time.
B00005JNEI|5|Rush Limbaugh is fond of saying that liberals hate him because he shines the light of truth on them.Apparently that explains why conservatives think Michael Moore is the worth thing that ever happened to them.After his previous film, Bowling For Columbine, right wingers were up in arms, especially because Moore himself confronted NRA spokesmen Charlton Heston in his own home and asked him why that orginization always held rallies right after a gun tragedy happened...and the rally would be in the same city as the tragedy.It was powerful stuff to watch, not because you wanted to see Heston shrink and stumble for words, but instead because certain questions need to be answered. In Farenheit 911 Moore is doing a lot of asking and a lot of conservatives are doing a lot of dodging,i.e.especially when Moore tries to get Congressmen to explain why none of their kids are in Iraq fighting the \\"good fight\\" <br />  Moore, as a documentary film-maker is ruthless and that's why he is effective.Nowhere else will you see footage of a perplexed George Bush sitting in a schoolhouse chair on the morning of 911, seemingly frozen after getting word that something big was shaking out there.Painful to watch, but necessary.It used to be the presses job to give us the facts but these days there seems to be a gag order on members of the media, especially when it concerns this administration and the war in Iraq. You don't want your wife outed for being in the CIA, do you? <br />   Moore made no secret of the fact that he was trying to influence the outcome of the   2004 presidential election by putting this film out when he did...and it almost worked. But in the end Carl Rove and the other masterminds who work for Bush managed to prevail through smear and slander. They managed to trash Moore and his film and sent the swift-boat vets to take care of John Kerry.Republicans everywhere condemned Moores'film as a pack of lies but they had no real way of explaining away the facts presented in it.Limbaugh condemned the film but admitted to his listeners that he's never seen it himself...instead he took the advise of people who told him it was a \\"cut & paste job\\". Strange coming from a guy who often complains that people critisize his show without ever having heard it. But let's get back to Moore... <br />  \\"911\\" is a must for people who want to try and make sense of what happened in Washington and around the country after...and in some cases before...September 11, 2001. It becomes apparent that the Bush administration was not focused on the terrorist threat before that tragic day and after it was history they tried to take advantage of it in the form of convincing Americans that the country of Iraq and it's leader, Saddam Hussein, were an \\"imminent threat\\" that needed to be dealt with immediately. But \\"911\\" is also about much more than that. It is about corruption in all of politics and how that effects those of us in this country who still believe that America is a great place and freedom is a great blessing. The caveat in this movie is that our freedoms are under assault, not from without bit from within(,e.g the Patriot Act, illegal immigration, the silencing of the media)and the only way that we can protect that freedom is by dealing with the cold, hard facts. <br />   So we can harp on the fact that Michael Moore is an overweight guy who dresses like a slob or we can attest to the fact that he makes one hell of a documentary and forces us to think.
B001993Y2C|5|It seems most of the negative reviews on here are in regards to the packaging and lack of organization in the discs, as they don't have an episode list. Also, the discs are kind of cheaply put in the case. But this should not detract from the real reason you should be purchasing this...FOR THE FRAKKING TV SHOW! If you are only concerned with the packaging in this purchase, you have more problems than I can help you with here.    So where to start? I have watched this series twice. I watched it once by myself while deployed at my unit. Then after falling in love with the show, I felt compelled to spread the love and show someone else. So I showed it to my fiance. She doesn't play video games, doesn't like SciFi shows, etc. But after watching the first 10 episodes, she was hooked. She was dragging me out of bed to continue watching the show to finish it.    The acting, the story, the surprises, the soundtrack, just EVERYTHING about this show rocks. In Bluray, it looks amazing. It also sounds amazing. If you have a subwoofer, expect to have the entire room shaking. Bear McCray, the composer, uses a lot of drums and bass in his music...and it really gets you immersed in an audio scale..    So there you have it, this show will immerse you with its beautiful images in high def, immerse in full 5.1 surround DTS which sounds amazing, and terrifically put story line. There is a reason this show is award winning throughout the world...and you NEED to add this series to your shopping cart. It is well worth the purchase.
B00DUGCLY4|3|Some clues leave me clueless, so I often find myself seeking help, but<br />all in all, it's a fun game.
B002ZXGSWE|5|Great all arround.<br />Great for past time watching.<br />Easy to access, and a awesome movie and cast.<br /><br />Only regret is that there is not a third season.
B00I6JOD2S|5|Great movie! Good entertainment for the whole family.
B00EMXBDMA|4|A true page turner adventure with a lot of science to make it seem so real.  Could not put it down!
B000002LAB|5|Tutu is a classic within itself.  Marcus Miller had some wonderful ideas in mind when he wrote this one.  Miles' brilliant trumpet playing just added to the greatness of it.  This was actually the first album I bought of his and since then I started collecting the rest.  I mean, yeah ok the jazz purists may say otherwise but they don't really matter to me.  Great stuff, don't sleep on it.
B0031Q0XCA|3|It was a cute movie.  The character Summer was annoying..
B00ISS01RS|4|This app is fantastic...I hope they will bring out new templates and songs. Would not use same template more than once

B000FC10MU|1|What happens after page fifty six?  Does any care?  Should I care?  Should I burn the book?  Should I make an appointment with the groomer?  I ought to be doing laundry.  I can think of a thousand ways to cook chicken.  These are some of the thoughts I had on page three and I discovered that I have a wonderful imagination.
B00011F5DK|5|Our 6 year old purchased Blokus for his birthday and we have enjoyed playing it with everyone that visits.  All ages can play and everyone really enjoys it.  We've had 5 years to grandparents playing it and loving it.  We would recommend it for any family game night.  Enjoy!

B0083Z6AH6|5|Love it.
0307269752|3|Like many others, I was drawn in by the cover of this book, which can often be a foolish thing. In this case, it was relatively good. The writing isn't unbelievably lyrical, but the story is solid. I would have far preferred to have seen the hacker Lisbeth as the focal point of the story, versus Mikael Blomkvist, the financial journalist who has fallen from grace.<br /><br />Overall, a solidly 3 star novel. I doubt I will pick up the next, but I don't regret reading this first one either.
B001PPLJIQ|5|it was a movie in which you could not help but think about it and analyze it for a couple of days.

B005544TRQ|5|My friend recommended this show and I'm hooked. It's fast paced, smartly written, and so good! Check it out you won't regret it.
B0064BCNA4|5|Just what I needed
B008JGSM6G|5|Love it! Very addicting game
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Floppy bird is not a on my kindle so I got this game and it is awesome. The only bad thing is the bird poops while he is flying and it is pretty distracting and he also drops down pretty fast. Other  than that it's a good game.
