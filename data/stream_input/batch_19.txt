B001AGT3RY|5|I was replacing a complete exhaust system on a Scion XB; from the &#34;Cat&#34; back. I also purchased the matching resonator. The installation was pretty easy. I was lucky enough to have the use of a lift. My muffler pipe was rusted out right where it meets the resonator pipe. All that needed to be done was to cut off the pipe just after the resonator and to disconnect the clamp that clamps the resonator output pipe to the muffler. Im MY case the resonator was changed as well. You will need a &#34;doughnut&#34; gasket and clamp to transition from the resonator to the muffler. The one piece clamp, also is a walker part, is fairly expensive for an OEM style clamp. I don't recommend a cheaper clamp for the job. The hangers are the &#34;difficult&#34; part of the job.  They are rubber pieces with a metal tapered end pushing through the rubber hole. The job seems more difficult than it actually is. If you lube the rubber and metal stem up with a bit of oil or grease, you can force the mounts off a lot easier. There is no need to destroy or cut the mounts. The grease trick works. Remounting is VERY quick and easy. Walker is the only company making these replacement parts. They are a good company with a good reputation for quality products. I don't expect this to last as long as the OEM but its not a new car. The OEM lasted 10 years and 150,000 miles. My only wish is that walker would make separate pipes and resonator and muffler, instead of having them welded together as a unit. The fact is that the PIPES were what was causing the problem. The actual muffler and resonator were still in great shape. Fortunately the cost for the complete units is not too bad when you buy them here on Amazon. These are the same parts that would be used by a muffler shop, since Walker is the only replacement. If you can do the work yourself, you will save quite a bit.
B001JEIHAG|4|seems like a good thing feels good on shoulder
B00B5ZYY38|5|Great, Looks great and installed where I need them on my vehicle tags.
B000C9OS1Q|4|Ordered a bunch of AC Delco Pro. Replacement Parts for my steering system. All work well, seem sturdy, installed properly, and have proper ball joint rubber caps. Only complaint was the factory grease- half the parts had next to jone, the other half had none. Take advantage of the grease points and push out the stock crap for some decent grease.
B0023VIW4A|5|It worked out great!
B00UULX2ZE|4|work's for what is made for.
B00AAHOYJG|5|Perfect
B000W1QZPG|5|good quality air chuck.

B001CF1A6U|5|Nice and heavy duty! Good rugged construction. Very happy. Hope I never need them for myself...just maybe to help someone else out.
B00NPY02EW|5|works good just what I expected.
B00BTGSGFK|5|A perfect size for applying products like the Butter Wax or Black Light. They are pretty awesome for cleaning wheels too. They sponge inside is soft but not too soft. They are great, just the right size for your hands too. Another great Chemical Guys product.
B000C0TBBC|5|Worked perfectly on my 2005 E320 CDI

B001GG29QK|2|sticker was very hard to put on and the decals wasnt what i expected. has a clear background, not just the tree
B008BMQYGI|5|Exellent
B00NPYXAWS|5|Stocking stuffers for those you love. Remember not to put them in an open slot in your car. If you turn upside down they just fall out and you can find them while you're rolling down the river. Better yet...turn around...don't drown.
B004VDTFIK|5|They look good on my black 2010 Colorado.
B004EKYB7U|5|Fit perfect and blends in nicely with the other knobs so you have no idea it's a replacement. Very happy!

B00327B8P4|5|They look really nice fit really good... it's not factory quality but for the price what more can you ask...
B00IBZNH88|4|This is a very well made sturdy visor. Two strong magnets hold the shield in place so you can move it to any position you want. I found that the shield did such a good job of cutting down the glare that I didn't need to wear sunglasses. The instructions for instillation  (which I had a hard time finding) are found in a sleeve attached to the inside of the box the visor  comes in. I rated this a four because it is the most expensive visor I have seen in the market. If this lasts 5 to 10 years without getting scratched, the per year cost will make the price very competitive with other less expensive visors.<br />  The strap that is used to attach this product to the car visor was  attached  backwards. I eventually figured that out when I finally found the instructions.
B006WQYM0A|4|Just as advertised...
B010ROSQ90|2|One glove arrived with a hole in it and as soon as my husband tried on the other glove it tore around the wrist. Not great quality. Had to return.
B001KSA1WI|5|Original Equipment is worth getting if you're going to spend the time to do your brakes.
B004FWB2AG|5|they work as good as they look Nice
B00HW58R92|5|Works great!
B007ROUQ6U|1|i thought too when I bought these back in Feb 2015 I was getting a great deal only to find out the batteries don't  last. I got 6 months out of them before my gate opener started acting up. I tested everything before finding out it was the batteries. My last pair lasted well over 3 years with no problem. Do yourself a favor and I known it's hard to pony up all that money per battery, but buy the really batteries @ depot etc. Make sure it's made by the big company's GE/Slyvan etc. You'll thank me later.
B009E9LY4E|5|it works !
B006WN0TR8|3|Is this the prices for the machine or for the kit
B008BKLPWI|1|Not sticky at all. Lays down more like a sticker then vinyl.
B003UN4FXW|5|Just a tip<br />On my 2001 suzuki GSXR 600 the relay is located at the front of the bike in front of the handlebars on the right side.<br />Its exposed to you dont need to take anything off, just pop the old relay off and then pop this one on.
B00BJPY74A|5|product good
B00T7VEDUQ|5|It came with some very helpful instructions I finally read after peeling it off and being very confused after the &#34;-on&#34; of Dixon came off when I tried to re-arrange the sticker... lol oops. Read the instructions!<br />There was a cute little  &#34;Thank you!&#34; handwritten at the top of the instructions that was very cute, and very nice.<br />The shipping was very prompt, I ordered it on the 25th of August, and it arrived on the 27th of the very same month! And it seems to be very good quality, I expect it to stay on my laptop for a good long time!
B000C3B0QI|5|Fit perfectly
B005S0K1F6|5|Looks and fits great. Stands up to my Mustang Converible's gallop down the highway in style.
B003MR9BUI|5|very nice hat
B000C9S4Z2|5|As advertised, quick delivery
B00QU3IEF4|5|Excellent product.  They fit my remotes very well and I love the soft feel of them.  I'm expecting they will last a very long time even if/when I may drop them - they won't break.  Love the color too.
B00BQP97NE|2|The shocks were the correct length and fit great on my Chrysler 300 BUT it just so happens that one of the shocks broke as soon as the return date was expired.
B00JIBFMY6|5|Saw this advertised on tv, I live in Tucson AZ and you hear all the time about kids and animals left in cars so I am keeping this in my car! I like the way it feels and made really sturdy. I plan on purchasing more as gifts for my family.
B00Y8B523C|2|Not short as stated! Would not even come close to fitting the puck lights like I was led to believe they would!
B003S1RQ2S|5|Good price, battery was shipped quickly, and appears to work well.  No problems.
B0046I9FSU|5|Good remote...
B00LU4U5QE|2|Not good performance
B00N6D5QRU|4|look great, fairly easy to install, had to raise back to get drill in.
B004B61B34|1|The holes in the receiver don't line up. Seriously. I checked over and over because I could not believe it.  It was not the hitch, it was the receiver. I would have thought that was the 1st point they would be checking. I like rugged ridge and have bought parts in the past for my jeep but this is boneheaded.  I won't be buying anymore of their products sadly
B006YEBSK2|5|Fit fine works great
B0085OMBQY|5|Luved it
B0012INT98|5|as promised
B00LNJUNWM|5|Worked great and easy to install.

B0031P08DU|5|Its a switch, it does the one job it says it will, turns on and off:)
B010SD4F0E|5|they're cool, plus I got them 2 weeks earlier than they said they'd get here
B00BZVYM98|5|Works awesome! Mine did not come with directions, just a web address... Would have been nice to have directions included with the remote. Other than that, it's a great savings!!!
B00VU0YQ5Y|1|Received the wrong item but description on the ad was for my vehicle.Lost out of my money because it is more to ship it back than what I paid.
B008J4IRMW|3|They are not strobe lights,,they are too slow they look more like christmas lights.<br />But for the price i can find another use for it..
B00L237SUO|4|These are great for holding my purse in the back seat area.  It no longer tips over and spills its contents.
B004XRQ4BU|2|Packaging was old and the corners of the plastic wrapper were brown and crusty.  When you touched the packaging it was so bridle that it just opened.  Not to mention that the odor of this little trees air freshener was horrendous.
B0013FXXGE|5|Works great. Shipping was quick. Just as described. Finally have fog lights again.
B00631E14Q|5|It fits well and looks nice
B00HHGRXA0|5|parts were less expensive than I was thinking I would have to spend for quality parts. Detroit axle sent them fast. I am very happy with this purchase.
B00KDDZ5N6|5|great switch, love the light output from the light
B001DX5NCI|5|perfect fit ,good price
B001VMS0CG|3|Purchased 2 of these, one worked well and the other was bad. Amazon made it right by replacing the bad one but it took an additional week to get job done.
B003YMTJCG|2|save your self the problems wrong ones cost more to return than its worth
B00080QHMM|5|Works very well, and more easily read than the nondigital kind.
B003LIX8FM|5|perfect product
B000FIY08U|5|Works perfectly to run my small cooler.  Plus it does not get hot as did the one that came with the cooler.  Arrived within one day.
B00YNF8SSE|5|This unit works as expected. I used it to do the wiring for an automatic chicken door opener that is light sensitive.
B0002STSNU|2|I could not get this thing to work. Not sure why, but the one I got has some sort of sleeve in it and when I used it with an impact, instead of expanding it crushed the sleeve and stuck it in the TEST pipe. It did hold up to the abuse of an impact wrench though (harbor freight corded, great tool, unlike their expander of the sort that are all junk also, least the ones that have so many small sections). What did work, even on the stainless I was working on? The kind you use a hammer on. Even took turns using a sledge hammer on it to make the job go a little quicker, and while it is a little work (though can't think much more then using these types), it did a great job. Stood up to the abuse well also. Little bit at a time is key. In fact, I actually ended up over expanding it a tad. Glad they both came at the same time, or I'd have been screwed (doubt the oem one I have from autozone, which is like the harbor freight one, would have worked either, which is also not much use, and have used them both).
B008BR6UKI|5|Great product easy install
B004C6TYGO|5|I purchased a 2011 Kia Sportage 2 weeks ago and needed to be able to pull a boat.  I ordered this on Sunday, it arrived on Thursday, and i installed on Friday. It took me roughly 15 minutes to install by myself. I have no mechanical experience at all, and I had no problems doing this by myself.  A second set of hands would always be useful, but i used a standard car jack to hold this in place while i screwed in the bolts. I started on the passenger side first, got one bolt started, then went to the drivers side and started a bolt. Returned to passenger side and tightened both bolts completely, then did the same for the drivers side.  NICE AND SIMPLE. There is more than plenty of room under the vehicle to do this project.
B0071N4Z0K|5|Works great for my 2005 E55.  Basically Plug-n-Play.
B00QKE2M2E|4|I like that this product came with all the necessary pieces and then some.  I had no issues hooking this up and it works great so far.  I have not verified that the voltage reading is accurate or rather, how accurate it truly is.  I had a full battery and the reading on the meter agreed, when my motor was on (alternator running) the voltage increased so it appears to be accurate to me.  If I ever get around to checking with a quality meter I'll edit my review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Comes with everything you need (all harnesses and additional connectors if necessary)<br />* Has everything I want (12V standard outlet, USB charging outlet and a volt meter)<br />* Interchangeable - You can put them in any order you want<br />* Nice bracket to hold them together<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Unsure of the accuracy, seems accurate, not really a con but for someone only reading the pros and cons section of this review...<br />* The volt meter is shorter than the others, I was installing this in a 1&#34; thick wood dashboard so the voltmeter doesn't come through to the backside in order to secure it with the included nuts.  It's pretty secure just sitting in there but it's still worth mentioning, not sure why they didn't just extend it.
B000VKTUJG|5|This filter fit perfectly.  I put a couple dryer sheets under the seats.  Those marinated in the summer heat for a few days.  After the dryers sheet smell was gone, the cabin air is once again fresh.
B000LC87VG|5|I'm sure they would work just fine if they fit my bearings.  I ordered the larger size for my smaller buddy's.  Make sure you order the correct size/diameter.
B007Y1H0D8|4|so far so good.  a basic tool that works well on some cars.
B000BQMZ60|5|These are the best I have ever owned.  They fit perfectly and so easy to install.  Love them.
B004GCVIUE|5|Fit perfect just like oem!
B001TLC12E|5|I bought these seat covers for my 2004 Toyota Corolla S and they seem to fit it nicely. They are a bit baggy in the back seat but I think that with use after a while they should fit better. Installation does take a while if you want them to fit nicely so do it when you're not busy. Fabric quality is nice. Overall a good product.
B00JALAZQY|5|Strongly recommend this hid kit. I can actually see at night now. Thanks opt7
B002M3P828|2|I was really disappointed because it leaked!  I read multiple reviews where people said they drove long distances in rain and the carried didn't leak.  It is very large and fit all of our stuff, but all of our stuff was wet when we got to our condo.
B000BZN7LS|3|The bolt was installed upside down and I'm missing one bolt.  Seems common based off reviews on here
B005NFZ4V2|5|It's like the or is the OEM at a price point much less then the dealer
B00LH3QBCU|5|These gloves are very comfortable and breathe well on hot days.  Get a pair! 👍
B000CB2MFS|1|Streaky
B00E9D4NES|3|Front sticker on 2011 Chevy Cruze did not fully cover emblem. Only noticeable up close.<br />Back sticker fit perfect.
B000FW2NU8|1|Supposed to be chrome,instead its spray painted black,very disappointed
B00UC7Y9IU|5|GOD JOB
B003YL15V0|1|Rarely used it but after only a few times, the thing fell apart. All the tools fell out when the joint came undone. The whole thing seems very flimsily constructed. Get a real Swiss Army Knife. It's worth the extra money.
B004GCRF8I|5|Fit and looks like it came from the OEM factory.
B00IZRAEYW|5|AweSome sound ad look. Yes they fit a 2015 r spec. I have them on mine. No issues
B000C7YQVU|4|its ok
B0067DOAUK|5|I'm so glad we order the larger size... My darlin wears a 2x in shirts, has a 48 waist... we ordered the 5X and its perfect... hides his belly and little growing room... They run small in size... We love it.
B00PYBHONG|5|Just what you need to start the job
B000ELW9FE|5|standby incase original part breaks down
B000BUU5UO|5|It is does what it says and dissolves after use in a portable toilet. I give it an A+ and have used such tissue before, but not from this manufacturer. It feels like real tissue and does the job.
B003O9WONU|1|Cool decal
B001F7CFNW|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B00842A7F4|4|These are great and a heck of a lot cheaper than buying them in town. I have ordered these twice for two bumpers. You will probably break a few pushing them together, but you should have a lot to spare. They do feel flimsy, but when you lock them together, they are very solid. The first bumper I used them on has been going strong for over 6 months now...
B00CGUIXU6|5|Works
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very handy sunshade. The coverage is very good and it's easy to put away.
B000V5K8DI|1|Slow drying, takes many coats and coverage was not good.  Will have to purchase anther one to touch up areas of poor coverage.  Took all  day.  Will not take calipers off this time, just touch up areas that look bad.  I would use different brand next time.
B00U2TU7R0|5|I am doing an engine swap and restoration on a 1997 Lincoln Town Car and so thankful that this manual was available. It is outstanding and I highly recommend it for anyone who owns a &#34;97 LTC and  is serious about taking care of their vehicle and enjoys doing auto maintenance. There is a ton information in this manual that is simply not available in any other manual. The manual is in pdf format and loads easily. It can be saved to as many computers as you have....I have it on several including one in my garage that I use quite often while doing my own auto repairs. You can also print the entire manual, individual pages, or a range of pages just like an ordinary pdf document. Great product and a whole lot less expensive than the printed manual.
B00NWF5RUI|5|High quality OE fob.  Works like a charm.
B00S1NT2SE|4|These were gifts. Great quality in this product. Only one of the screwdrivers out of the four piece set was needed and used.
B000P58DMC|5|I installed this on my 2009 Explorer with the 4.0L and noticed improved throttle response as well an improvement in fuel economy, estimate 1 MPG.  It removed the slight sluggishness that the stock coil exhibited.
B001AY2WLU|5|Perfect size/fit for your altoid edc kit. Well made.
B001HATY36|5|Good quality item. very heavy, cant imagine how someone could break this open.
B004J9NC12|5|Cheaper than the local auto chain parts store. Perfect fit. No qualms.
B00LU0UBH6|5|The WilKan micro fiber car duster is the best duster on the market. use it on my 64 GTO at the car shows and it is very effective.
B000COC67O|5|very well made seat. strong frame, and big comfortable seat
B005O0QQ1S|4|Not explained well only can use on certain vehicles but not listed as to what.
B00AI2WCCY|5|Pretty AWESOME light.. Very bright, heavy duty housing. I installed as a back up reverse light. You won't be disappointed.
B00CU79KTS|4|Nice shades.
B004133E0A|5|Great product, just what I was needing. Could not find it anywhere else.
B00P0QOE74|1|Bulbs burn out after 2 months, DO NOT BUY..
B000CSGTXM|5|Got the filter quickly and it was perfectly packaged and just as described.
B007480MI6|5|Works as advertised.  My trailer is rewired and back on the road!
B000K020JY|3|The cap works fine.  I was hoping that by ordering this brand that it would be a more exact match to the original, so I could use the attaching strap from my old cap.  Alas, twas not to be.
B00S9U0K1M|5|Very comfortable!
B00D42AFS8|5|Great unit.  Have used it for about a year with no problems.  I've done everything from charge my phone to jump start cars.<br />BTW: My son bought a much more expensive type, but the only difference is it has more phone connectors and a 19 volt connector. (For what use?  I don't know)  Like I said, this is a great unit at about half the price.
B003UZ7SCU|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B000SL4AA2|5|This little device has been so useful. After NOT having it for two flat tires, I decided it would be better to just keep it in my car in case of emergencies and it's been a lifesaver. It blows up a car tire pretty easily, even if it take a little time. I also use it for bike tires or any other inflatables.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Excellent product! My car heats up so quickly in the Texas summer and the sub basically bakes my seats. This sunshade provides a great deal of cover and keeps my legs from being seared by my seats when I get back in my car. I'll probably order another for my back windshield to double my protection. 10/10 would highly recommend. Good and sturdy, plenty of blocking.
B013FJKJRG|5|I received one of these as a sample from the manufacturer in exchange for writing an unbiased review. Overall, I love this thing. Makes checking the OBDII data from my vehicle very convenient, and it works well. Tried it in two different cars and it worked perfectly in both.<br /><br />Great value for the money and will definitely save a lot of unnecessary trips to AutoZone to get codes read whenever a Check Engine Light or other error arises.
B00LBD3TQC|5|clearly states no bulbs. for this price why complain about no bulbs. the added benifit is you can chose the type of bulb.
B00B856ABO|1|my 2006 Pont G6 has 16&#34; rims.....so no they will not fit as stated above!!  and are not 17&#34; !!!
B001EOYIH2|5|Good product for price.
B000BQSIWK|4|Charges relatively quickly. It have left my headlights on a few times by accident overnight and this has gotten me to work within 30 minutes.
B006F8YTYO|5|Awesome grips for my little son's 12&#34; tire bike.
B00C0XC56C|5|Love them. They disconnect and reconnect so easily and quickly. Once disconnected we just bungee cord them out of the way and we are ready to go.
B004MDEV38|5|Fits great. I had to buy a tap to clear the threaded holes, no way were the bolts would start till the threads were cleared. It wold be good if buyers were warned of this in advance.
B000CMFETS|5|Product fits my 92 civic well , shipment was on time..
B00G620ZVU|5|Nice
B000CNKUGO|5|Great variety and value!
B00QU5CF0W|5|hi five arrived as described fit truck started right up
B000182F1S|5|These auto Ventshade Ventvisor window arrived and they were easy to install.  They look great on my Chevy trailblazer and they hold in place very well.  I have been through the car wash couple of times and they stayed in place with no problems.  I highly recommend these window ventvisors they are great.
B00UZUZPKK|4|The levels are a quality product and it met with my approval.
B002X9WYIM|5|Easy to apply and it looks fantastic
B0072U6ULY|5|I was very impressed with the design of the product.  However, I ran into an issue which I was only aware of when I first went to lock the bed extender into the mounting brackets--I have a soft tonneau cover.  I'm not sure how much the designs vary between manufacturers but my ACI cover has rails that the cover unroll onto and are mounted to the inside of the cargo box.  They stick out into the box two inches or so and run the length of the entire box.  In my experience, it didn't hit me until I went to slide the bed extender onto the mounting brackets at the prescribed 45 degree angle that I realized that those tonneau cover rails interfered with the bed extender.  Still trying to figure out a work-around but in the mean time I just pulled the tonneau cover off the box in order to get the bed extender installed, flipped it to the inside of the box, and then bolted the cover back on--my main reason for acquiring this product in the first place was to keep items organized inside my pickup box.  However, I'm going to run into the hassle of unbolting my tonneau cover again if I ever needed to flip the bed extender back to the outside or needed to remove it from the vehicle completely.  But overall, it's a solid product and if people are looking for a superior solution to cargo management in their pickup box, I can't think of anything better than this line of bed extenders.  It still gets five stars in my book.
B000C1OWRE|5|Perfect as always.  You will not be disappointed.
B0002Q7BYU|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B000M5Z5YO|5|Haven't had any issue! Bright enough for me. Seems pretty durable.
B00IZ3JD70|5|great
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Excellent
B00N3VGPYS|5|This is the best gauge you can buy for your turbo charged car and I have tried others - Installed on a 1997 Mitsubishi Eclipse GS TurboCharged.
B008HZM5SA|5|Works great. There was a very slight scraping noise at first but it went away after a quick trip around the block. After 500+ miles no problems. Definitely quiet and the wheels aren't immediately covered in brake dust like they OEM's would do.
B000GKD5UQ|5|Excellent paint sealant that I reccommend be professionally applied next time you have your car detailed.  The car should be washed, compunded, light coat of polish and then Gliptone applied.  The water will bead in pin head size drops after applied and it really seems to last.  My vehicle never looked better and its a dark color which is always a challenge to maintain especially when the vehicle is not garaged.  Very cost effective when you consider what dealerships charge to apply a Dupont paint sealants.
B00O81BMW2|5|Love this sign!<br />It sticks to your car as it grows on it!<br />It follows the natural curves of the car trunk - and looks just wonderful!<br />I love that it has no additional signs or logos on it, too<br />You can easily stick it and peel it back and repeat 100 times — it's sturdy and long lasting
B00N9LMXUC|1|Too big for my 2010 Subaru Forester.
B00JSJMTE4|5|This thing fits my 2015 F-150 XLT like a glove!  It adds a really nice touch, grip, and thickness to the non-leather stock steering wheel.
B00KLIC70M|5|The right size works great
B002PQJ8VY|4|These lights are good quality, but they are not a direct OEM fit for a 1999 outback. I had to bend the original brackets and file down the sides of these lights to get them to fit.
B008UYK7GA|5|These grips look great.  The manufacturer emailed me directly and answered all my questions.  If there was one thing about these it would be that they told me they were similar to OEM. And there was set screws in the left grip to secure it to the handlebar.  I assumed that it would slide into the housing like the other grips i have had.  All in all a great product!  Thank you
B008HZK7LW|1|Does not actually have the &#34;molded in&#34; backing plate - in fact there is no where on the pad that actually indicates that it is a &#34;Bosch&#34; part
B00GNU2194|1|If you are looking at these lights for a classic car, keep looking somewhere else.  They are not shaped like a standard stock headlight, and will not fit in GM muscle cars.  Octane Lighting is a poor company, and even though they claimed they would fit, they do not and expect the customer to pay return shipping and refuse to issue a refund.<br /><br />Do not buy.
B006BE0ZBS|5|Just as described
B00GP8FKGU|5|Definitely adds noticiable horsepower for my 2014 chevy silverado 5.3 V8. Easy install a 5 year old can do it. Has lots of pictures and step by step instructions. Yes a little pricy but after you install this the only regret you will have is not buying it sooner.
B000CB6ACO|1|Streaky
B001FCB64Q|4|Good cover.  There is one flaw... You have to stick the corners in the door which pulls it tightly and makes it seem like it will rip.
B004SFKJIQ|5|GREAT
B005ZWM0R4|5|Great tool.
B0081S8X7A|5|Fit good...worked well
B00LMUTKAI|3|These are nice for when you have an 11 year old in the front seat. Unfortunately, I swap from tube doors to regular doors often, so moving the striker plate isn't an option.  The latch system needs to be offset, so you can turn it up or down for a better fit. I had to drill the holes oblong, so I can move the latch up or down for my need. I also had to grind all the paint off the pins just to get them to fit in the door holes. Welds aren't very nice, a lot of sharp points. With a little bit of a redesign, these could be awesome tube doors.
B007KPJIRE|5|Had the trim removed, the new clips inserted and trim reinstalled in 5 mins. Wonder how much a BMW dealer would have charged ?????
B0042KJV9U|5|real good tool dont half pullnplugs now to test
B004SS8DCM|5|I love my Infiniti Lanyard and i love my G37 S Coupe. It's match made in heaven👍
B00526K6E2|5|Just by seeing it, how can you not love it?<br /><br />When received, kept loving it! Price could be better considering the materials are nothing out of the rare.
B0145R9IFG|5|I've had a set of these in my car that's similar for years and wouldn't do without them.  However, I paid WAAAAYYYY more for that first set and they are not made nearly as well as this OxGord set!<br />This really is one of those items that,you don't realize you need until you use them and appreciate them!<br /><br />Here's what I love about this set as opposed to the old ones I had...<br /><br />Snug fit - won't let even the sneakiest french fry between the seat and console!<br /><br />Pockets - These have 2 small pockets on the top which allow you to put coins or small objects you DO want between the seats and they stay put<br /><br />Universal Fit - They fit my Toyota RAV4 and our Toyota Tacoma perfectly even tho the seats are different sizes<br /><br />Price - These cost HALF of what I paid for my first set and the quality is far better<br /><br />I would totally buy these as a gift for someone who just got their first car to save them the frustration of trying to locate lost objects under the seats!<br />Hello??!!! STOCKING STUFFERS!!!<br />I'm also getting a set for my elderly mom as it's hard for her to dig around under the car seat when she drops something!<br />Great product - great company - I have a few of their products now and they sell good quality items at a very fair price :)<br />They were nice enough to extend a discount to me if I gave my honest opinion and feedback - glad I bought these!!!<br />Hope this was helpful info for you :)<br />Enjoy!
B000C1Q6LE|5|Comes with a small pack of brake grease, woo hoo!
B000NJ14CG|4|The originals have a thick clamp whereas these have a very thin clamp but seem to work fine.  The knobs were'nt round like in the picture but better with knobs so you can get a good grip.  Could only find knobs with no clamps locally.
B0000AZ7EY|5|Great product, works exactly as advertised
B0042HFX68|5|Very easy to install.looks identical to original.
B007NEK9RK|4|Love it. My friends love it. But like everyone else said... It doesn't fit QUITE as expected.
B00JIBFMY6|4|It seems like it is a good product.  I hope I never have to use it.  I gave this to my son.  It was reasonably priced, so I cannot complain.  I really like the idea of it!
B002E3FXB2|2|While the hitch its self gave me no problems the hardware provided was a bit of a joke. I got 3 grade 8 nuts which i needed 4 and 4 5.5 inch bolts that were grade 5 and the threads were so banged up you couldn't thread the nuts on. Once i went to lowes and bought new bolts and nuts all grade 8 which cost about $16 bucks it was very easy to install. I would have waited or return this but needed the hitch for a trip i was taking.
B000EQR5YE|5|Works perfect!<br /><br />I installed a new stereo in my 2001 Chevy Suburban 2500 LT.  Co-incidentally, that evening the dash lights failed to work.  Repair shops wanted a fortune.  I completely rewired the stereo thinking I had done something wrong or shorted out a wire.  Checked every single fuse in the truck.  Still nothing.  Repeat.  Still nothing.  I found this switch on Amazon and many others having a similar issue.<br /><br />Since Amazon Prime would allow free shipping and returns, and had it $20 less than Autozone, Checker, Napa, etc, I ordered one.  Two days later and after a quick 2 minute install, THEY WORK!  Amazing.  Wish I'd have done this weeks ago.
B002K2FS30|5|Love it.
B00HR26X6O|5|It's sometimes unbelievable how little changes can produce big results. Swapping the old yellow interior lights for led lighting is one of these changes, and it improved the look of the interior and the vehicle in general 10X. They provide an upscale and modern look, plus the lights are brighter and shouldn't need to be replaced again since led's last forever.  I was skeptical I could replace the bulbs myself since I had never done this before and the spaces are tight, but with the yellow tool that comes with the kit, it's easyy. It took me about 15-20 minutes, and that includes the time to do the license plate since there's 4 Phillips screws to undo instead of pop-out covers in the interior. Highly recommended!
B00EVQHGSI|5|I bought this for an 11 going on 12 year old boy for a trip to Europe.  I didn't want to have to worry about him carrying identification, money, and travelcards in case he got separated from me.  He LOVED the cool factor and it worked with the London Oyster Card (RFID travelcard) where he was able to tap in for the trains and buses without having to take the card itself out of the wallet, which is important because those cards can have a lot of money loaded on to it and takes a bit of time to replace if lost.  The only thing I would suggest is replacing the hook where it connects the chain to the wallet with a really strong split ring or similar.  That part started to pull apart about 2 weeks into using it but I just happened to have a good one floating in my suitcase.  A minor inconvenience if you catch it early or replace it right from the start, but a major problem if you don't catch it and you completely lose the wallet.
B00WM36XNG|5|Great product! Perfect for my car!  Fast service....Thank you.
B00KTJ0A0C|5|Really easy to program and to use. So much better than paying 85 per fob at the dealership.
B00NPYXAWS|5|The product easily breaks glass and cuts seatbelts. Great price for peace of mind.The seat belt cutter and glass breaker combination are an absolute automotive must if you are concerned about ever being trapped in a vehicle. My highest recommendations.
B00407TU8W|5|The color is very close to my wife's car. I wish I had it ready, my wife may not have ever noticed the nick I made with the snow blower.
B005G051V2|5|It feels like a new bike. I love it well worth the money it can turn 28 outlaws with no problem in 4wd
B000CIAX8Y|5|Perfect fit for my '89 Wrangler. Nice cast iron cylinder, not the plastic crap that you get at Autozone, or Advance.
B00QHZV7IQ|3|Update - the app is actually RamCam - there is an app called RunCam HD which is not the correct app. The unit connected with the correct app - RamCam Will re-evaluate when I attempt to use it.  ==== First Review === The unit arrived with minimal directions - it indicated to download an app called camrun - there was one app called cam run HD which may be the correct app.  I could get the unit to produce SSID and I could connect to the wifi connection - however when starting the app the app indicates it could not find the camera.  The app has a number of ways to connect to the camera - all of which appear to require a special cable or connector directly between the camera and the phone.  I'm not sure if I have the correct app since the directions do not precisely specify the app makes it hard to determine if the product is defective or there is an issue with the app.  If others have suggestions on how to get this thing to work I would greatly appreciate hints on how to proceed.
B000C30J7O|5|Works great.
B00ZVQGHIW|5|item as described, quick ship
B004TDMVC4|5|These fit a 2008 nissan versa without anti-lock brakes perfect!  I am not sure it may fit the models with anti-lock brakes as well.
B000C59MMU|5|Installation straightforward, quality superb, car rides much better now.
B011JA8BVE|5|This charger is really powerful, I love the fact that it has many different usb ports so I can change many things in my car, like my vape, tablet, and phone. It also charges really fast and doesn't over heat... like my last charger. I highly recommend it. I received this product for a discount or for free in exchange of an honest and unbiased review.
B00JBINW2K|4|what i was lookn for
B00IIN05UQ|5|Product was easy to install and really made a difference from my stock fog lights
B00873J0YY|4|This worked perfectly on my Rav4 for both of my kayaks.  They didn't take much time at all for my husband to attach. My only wish is they would fold down, when not in use, so that I could park in my garage, but you can't beat the price!
B000SOFE86|5|Excellent quality, my Kawasaki Nomad's gonna love this
B009FUF6DM|5|Can't beat the price for all of these. I use them for wiping down my motorcycle and I put one in my pocket for rides to clean my helmet visor. Cheap enough to toss out but I plan on washing them most of the time.
B00JBIA8MC|5|Put these on my buddys car, really made it look kustom, his little boy said wow dad will it go 1000 MPH NOW, ITS LIKE A ROCKET SHIP. easy to install & very affordable,
B00AKF1OSC|5|Third x buyung this.
B001AV9P36|2|cheaply made.  Very small. Rhinestones came off in a very short time.
B00J7HBRL8|4|ok my first review for anything. Ordered a pair of these to replace my oem yellow reverse lights. Shipping was pretty quick. Got them in less than a week. They are very bright. Looks so much better than stock. They are not 100% white but mostly whitish with a little  tint of blue. Looks almost like reverse lights on Cadillacs. But overall I'm pretty satisfied with them. Just put it in a few hours ago and so far so good. Will update review if any issues come up. But I would recommend them for the price.
B00J5QEK3S|1|Poor quality. The pleather comes all wrinkled. Would not suggest to anyone
B002FZJ806|5|Saved us time and a job
B001A3GE06|5|Great price, and its exactly what I needed!
B003GCSJAC|1|Was almost arrested for having it on my keychain!
B00KSDKWZ2|5|Looks Awesome
B00VW624QE|5|great engine kit good quality the pistons were better quality than I expected
B00KTIYXLU|5|Thought this was too good to be true since a single remote was over $50 at the local parts shop, but it worked perfect on my explorer.
B00U24MEIU|5|This puddle light is very easy to install. As mine is a 2011 MINI Cooper (LCI), I have to trim the hole in order for this too fit. Not a tough job, just need a knife to get it done.
B005R3HEHC|5|Very well made, soft fabric and it fits like a glove!
B00BV6E17U|3|not very well finished off made in china!
B002J7VX4Y|3|It DOESN'T smell exactly like new car, but it smells like a new above ground pool, or some kind of new rubberized plastic. Once the rubbing alcohol smell goes away, it smells pretty decent. Biggest problem is there was NO SPRAYER on the bottle!!! Don't expect to get a sprayer (or i probably got a bottle without one).
B000BRGAJ2|5|Total ice. Small amounts dilute and it will stretch to a gallon
B004SVFP8E|5|Fits like a  charm. Very easy to install. Had them previously. It was still in excellent shape after 6 years. This is my 3rd truck and cover in 12 years.
B0002UEPVI|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B004K9KETY|4|This car wash has been great to use! My only complaint is the cap no longer seals and I am unable to mix the wash any longer in order to use it. A piece fell out of the cap and will not go back in place.
B00MS9A33K|5|Love this lights. Will recommend.
B00FB3KZHY|1|Kit worked fine for about a week until my right side ballast failed. not sure what to do now with only one headlight
B00C2DSIAW|5|works great
B0051D3MP6|2|So had my car sitting at airport parking for a week and it wouldn't start. Pushed the car got it to start and the car charger kicked in and charged up the battery to where the car would start on its own but it would struggle a little and everything in the car had to be off A/c, radio, lights etc. So I got this B&D BM3B. It says charger and maintainer on the box, cool. Connected it my battery after removing it from car, and I've had it on charge for 2 days continuously now and the green light is still blinking. After going through the manual, it say that THIS CHARGER WILL NOT CHARGE ANY BATTERY THAT HAS FALLEN BELOW 2 VOLTS. I think I should get a real charger, not this guy. As a battery maintainer I also don't trust it as going through the manual there are so many precautions about fire that I don't know if I'd want a battery connected to this guy and leave the house  for a week vacationing in Colorado. Just a thought.
B000W0KTMW|4|Good lock for piece of mind.
B00KSZ5F5C|5|Great product. Has a nice look and feel. holding good onto the car for about two months now
B003LJ0VCE|5|very happy I found this item on amazon, fixed the problem
B00LML7GJY|4|This is great for trips where weight matters. I make sure it has a full charge before heading out, and then charge it day by day when I'm out.<br /><br />It won't keep up with heavy use, but this can really do a great job at keeping you connected when away from a power source.<br /><br />The built in power cord is a huge bonus, as it's one less thing to keep track of.
B00B90NGBK|3|Wish I would have spent a lil extra on a different brand. Some hardware wasnt in the bag. All said and done it installed good but for cheap
B00DJ5KEF4|5|A necessary addition to your motorcycle! Purchase the ring kit to connect this to the battery and you'll never be without a charged device.
B001NZQID4|5|Installed easily, plugged one end under dash and the other to the P3 controller.
B001EOYIRW|5|Great product, great fit
B000CFQNZO|4|as orderd
B000C9J1R2|5|awesome product.
B00BVPUEBI|5|good to go
B004940ZNK|4|just like factory new part
B007JG1W1E|5|Works great!!!
B001ED8IMO|5|fast just as promised
B004W4OAVK|4|These headlights have low-beam projectors, and they come with halogen bulbs. They appear to be very sturdy. The  headlamps have a baffle within the headlight that limits the height of the projected light. If properly adjusted, the projected light does not shine into the oncoming driver's eyes/car windows. The distribution of the top of the beam of light is S shaped.  My main complaint of this particular projector headlight is that I wished the passenger side headlight projected light more in an upward fashion on the very most lateral aspect of the light beam, so that street signs were illuminated. I found it hard to read street signs with these lights. These headlights on the 6th gen Civic have to be adjusted off the car because the height adjuster for the projector is directly in front of the metal housing for the headlight. You cannot get to it when it is mounted.  The medial adjustment is accessible, which adjusts the beam to the left/right. It can be easily reached after the headlight has been mounted, but unfortunately the height adjustor cannot be reached once the headlight is mounted. There are many videos on how to adjust projector headlights.<br />The halos on these headlights are not really functional/helpful. They are VERY dim and it has to be quite dark in order to be seen. I wish they were significantly brighter and could be used as running lights. These halos don't seem to add any value to these headlights. Having very bright LEDs within the headlight  would have given them a significant improvement and functionality.<br />The foam trim that is placed around the outside rim of the headlight did not fit properly. This is a small issue. I replaced what came on the headlight with M-D Building Products 1033 weather stripping, which looked better than what Spyder used. Weather stripping on these headlights does not appear to be necessary, and it simply fills a gap between the headlight and the car body.<br />Overall this is a good set of headlights at a very reasonable price. I like the projector concept much better than the parabolic lens, and it seems that most car makers have gone to this design. These headlights are an enormous improvement on the OEM headlight. They add a significant improved safety factor to night driving.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|Works pretty well
B004SSAER4|3|Not even close to water resistant, it fits nicely, bugs LOVE it, which sucks, but the best feature is, it tells you whats front and whats back very clearly.
B005CLMRCG|3|Fit well on 1999 Chevy truck.
B000C5C862|5|Perfect for Ford F150 slipped on in two seconds, no struggle as the are slit in corners for easy install.
B0031XUKQW|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B004RNOVTM|5|This is a great quality &#34;leader hose&#34; that worked perfect for my application. I recommend it.
B007J0V7MO|3|Bases do not fit standard receptacle. Had to hand sand for 1/2 hour and cram to get them to fit. Look elsewhere. LLights are bright, but should just plug in receptacle designed for.
B0127XSCC0|5|[[VIDEOID:7f66a8f84ddf874796c54efff9549d79]] A nice sized trash bag for your car that can hold a good amount of trash for those little road trips that you might take or for your commute to and from work. I forgot to mention in the video that the top part of the bag has a metal lining inside to help keep the rectangular shape of the mouth of the bag. It's really easy to install. The long velcro straps allow you install onto any car's head rest. The two mesh pockets on the sides are a nice bonus; you can easily store a bottled water there or tissue. The lining inside the trash bag makes it both leak proof and easy to clean. Materials used on the trash bag are of good quality which should make it quite durable.    I received a discount on this item in exchange for my honest review.
B000C57KVK|5|working well
B00RIVNP1K|5|Very useful.
B00KLKKPRC|5|Bought this fuel valve so that I could have a reserve tank on my 2002 Yamaha yz250f. It fit through the same holes and bolted up just like the stock one did. It even fit the stock fuel hose size.  The only difference in size from the stock one is that it is taller, so it hangs down about an inch further than the stock one, so it gets in the way of the choke and hot start levers. I just reach my fingers around it to get to them, and it is really not that hard. I would reccomend this product to anyone replacing a stock WR one or anyone who wants a reserve tank in their YZ.
B0006VORDY|5|We love this camp stove. Very easy to use, portable, and love all the add ons you can buy for it. We have the grill top add on which works great. Also is awesome for canning as it boils water quickly.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|So thin I didn't think they would work but boy was I wrong. So easy to apply to window & blocks the sun in all the right places. My kids are happy they don't have to dodge the sun anymore.
B010CIGY90|5|Works great description was right on and fitment
B000SL4AA2|4|Works well for the price point. I'd prefer a better storage system for the cables and hose but the compartment provided works well enough.
B00EPDLBDS|4|Not bad!
B0031C07AM|5|Very good
B000C902UW|5|5 stars
B001TK0DSY|5|To the people that ask &#34;does the Citrus/wax strip layers.  (A) yes.. It talked to CG's a few days ago because I had that problem of not all wax and sealants being removed.  Their answer was what they use on tough removals of layer is soak the mitt thoroughly first,  and in worse cases they apply the wash product directly on panels and then use the soaked mitt to spread it.  It worked perfectly.  It removed all but paint....
B002R0QTLA|5|Great purchase.  The product, supplier and shipping were all great.  Thanks,
B001VAB60G|5|Perfect fit great product
B00KZ54O20|5|They're fuses... they did exactly what they were supposed to do and at a fraction of the price I'd pay at a store.
B00N675IZQ|5|Very nice
B00QWWZF6E|5|Very reasonably priced . Have not installed yet, plan to keep it as a spare.
B00GBW9GJC|1|Poor resolution decal. Also appears to be printed on cheap &#34;no name&#34; decal paper. Look carefully at the picture, the stars are not the same as the actual Subaru logo. The lines from the inkjet printer are so visible it's like looking at an old tube TV up close.
B00IIVUXLO|5|I can fit 3 grocery bags across perfectly without worrying about them falling over in the back of my Honda Pilot. There are already built in hooks that accommodate this net so nothing needs to be installed. I posted pictures so you can see. Very happy with this purchase!
B006O87UYQ|4|Good product for the money. Makes the engine sound a little better and definitely better air flow.
B006EGAIJ2|5|great product/.PS. Don't be asking me a lot of questions, call the company they are very nice and get paid to answer questions.
B003UCJEOI|5|Very nice built well
B007V2EESO|5|The best we have ever had. It fits so is easy to put up.
B00IY2D1O8|2|Did not work with my vehicle as stated it would.
B00JXI2VNY|5|great
B000ET26RC|5|The only plug to run in a harley
B002N5LD1U|5|I had no problems installing this tank & the extra fittings I needed was at the local hardware store.  I think some here just don't read the directions & do sloppy work.
B000BQSYJ2|5|This product was exactly as it was advertised and suits our need perfectly.
B006ZBAM2E|4|Works great, arrived quickly with Prime.  Tested on 3/4 schedule 40 PVC, 1/2&#34; CPVC, and 1&#34; Pex-Al-Pex, left a nice chamfered edge on all of them.  The Pex-Al-Pex needed a gentle touch to not chew up the end, and this is less agressive when turned CCW than clockwise (the directions say it works both ways).  I found a couple leaky fittings in a pre-heating season check of my OWB plumbing and wanted something better than the deburring tool I'd used before.  However, if you live anywhere near a Harbor Freight, it's HF's house brand and a third of this price in the store.  I should have picked up on the HFT in the vendor code.  Disappointed to see Pittsburg on the package.  I'm 200 miles from the closest HF or I'd be even more disappointed, but if you're close to one skip buying it here.
B001EA0LTU|4|Looks great on my Camry
B00DBEMKF0|3|They look good but you will need a load resistor so the signal will work
B00KGP8IHQ|1|Well you get what you pay for. The first day I used this 2 of the buckles completely broke. The purpose of it is fulfilled, but with only half of the buckles functioning properly it kept slipping. I took the cheap route and got cheap results.
B005QION72|5|Got mine today, on time, white color. Packaging OK, the box for helmet had been opened but all OK. Comes w helmet bag. Fits well, got the XL for 7 5/8 - 7 3/4 hat size. It was all in tact. The shield did not fog up as I expected. The tint visor on mine comes down plenty far enough for me, unlike some other reviews. Good helmet.
B0002UQAXY|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B004C443PS|5|Obviously, at this price point the gloves aren't perfect but I think they are still a great value. Exactly what I wanted and the quality of the leather is actually not bad. Very satisfied.
B00CH6T18C|5|Yes, it really does work!  The bad thing is that it left clean streaks on my light colored leather easy chair, so now all has to be done  HA!  Thanks for the recommendation Mary Hunt / cheapskate ideas!
B002SIR8MA|4|Thank you!
B006JRJ5L8|1|I am returning this because on the item itself, but NOT in the product description it states..&#34; WARNING: This product contains chemicals known in the stat of California to cause cancer, birth defects  and other reproductive harm!.&#34;  To say I am mad about having to return this is an understatement!
B000IZ3K4U|5|Exactly what I needed, well packaged and works perfectly.
B004ZZVNOI|5|Quality product! Typically sits taller than stock ball joints....remember to reuse the stock ball joint seat (a removable part; after taking out the stock ball joint, hammer off the seat from the stock ball joint and put the seat on the new whiteline ball joint....if you forget to do this, you will damage the whiteline ball joint rubber)
B00A4B57I0|4|Looks well made. For the money you would think that  you would get a tool box decal with your order.
B00MB3IYWK|4|I have Rally scooter and this fits over very well. I have not yet tried it on the carrier I purchased but I'm hoping it will do well to protect my scooter.
B000C0CW2W|4|Thank you
B001Q4UC52|4|I have a Honda pioneer 500 side by side. I ordered the Stealth Exhaust and the Honda adapter, I found that I do not need the adapter for this unit. I discarded the box before I found that I did not need it. So I can't return it for a refund. Darn Me.  The Stealth cuts the noise some and takes away the high pitch from the stock muffler. I like it, but a bit disappointed that it did not cut the noise as much as I expected. I would buy it again.<br />Thanks<br />Don Foust.
B00R9GO8WE|1|The box showed up on time and not damaged. The problem is the key would not fit the lock. I asked for a new lock and offered to return the bad one. NOPE!! Send it all back.<br />I bought a lock and installed it my self. NOW it works great and looks good on my 2015 Mule XP PRO
B000GV59OK|5|I like the product tht was sent too me
B000IYA6KM|5|Works great
B000Q6UHQ0|2|It's not very easy to use on my '07 G35.  Since it is a universal cap, it doesn't seal 100%; the metal chain that goes around the brake and clutch fluid reservoir to create the seal works but the reservoirs aren't perfectly flat on the bottom to prevent the chain from moving.  Therefore, the chain can move loosening the tension and breaking the seal.  I would recommend to either pump the brake and clutch pedals the old fashion way to get an actual cap for the vehicle you're working on to make sure there's an appropriate seal.  Brake fluid is very abrasive and having it spill all over the paint is not good, which is what happened to me :(
B00SH1SN6C|4|I purchased this because you just never know when your battery will die on you.  I also like the fact that you can use it to charge your cell phone or device.  It is nice and small and it comes in a carrying case.  I have had no reason to use it yet but it's always good to be safe than sorry.  I keep it under the passenger seat of my car for easy access.
B002E3FXB2|5|works great
B00KYQQWOI|3|Not all bulbs work even after inserting opposite way as stated, tried in all different parts of my 2008 Rav4. The dome light and cargo light ID numbers for DE3022 and DE3175 were stated to be included but none of the 3 fit my car. Unhappy about that, have to go buy different bulbs now.
B00LNN3MRQ|3|I gave this 3 and not 4 or 5 stars because I paired this with the 3.5 Lonewolf connector and the gun double taps. Does not provide much as far as a reset that you can really gauge. I will take to my gunsmith to check (install & trigger pull) and follow-up with appropriate rating. Just wanted to put this out there for obvious safety reasons. No for those that don't care about safety...This with the Lonewolf 3.5 connector has a trigger pull that is AMAZING!!! Pulls like a knife in warm butter, does not make the gun twitch and I wish all of my guns felt like this (I obviously need some trigger work on my other guns). As long as this is not under 2.5 lbs, I will keep this set-up and recommend it to everyone

B007P744S0|5|These pistons are made in Japan by Nippon Piston Ring. I Inspected these closely with barrel micrometers, they are dimensionally identical to factory pistons except for the oversize diameter that you select. They have the cast-in-place steel ring land support that the factory pistons had. The oil ports in the lower ring groove are slightly larger than on the factory pistons, which is fine. The taper and thrust face are exactly as specified in the toyota service manual.<br />I recommend these, they are a high-quality, faithful reproduction of the original toyota parts.
B000C2YAOS|5|fits good but will need a flat washer to clear the wall
B00150T13G|5|Smells sooo fresh. This has always been our car freshener for all of our cars. I highly recomend it to my friends. Thanks Air Spencer for keeping our car smells fresh all the time.
B00J9MQVIK|3|It's OK. It's a little expensive for what it is.
B000QUXYXE|5|Fit great! Went ahead and primered and painted them! Got my tailgate working like new again!
B000E28C7M|4|works well
B0031XR1EG|5|As described and works well.
B000CNHDLY|5|Nicely loud and deep! Sounds like pure American freedom.
B004SIOTGG|5|Product arrived promptly and exactly as described.
B00J9VYMIM|3|Got it worked great for a few weeks. Then the paint  turned red instead of black and the led lenses melted. They sent me a new one works great so far.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Worked perfectly
B004HCS4P0|1|Dulled the finish of my seats and interior surfaces and smells really bad. Maybe I got a bad bottle but this stuff was terrible. I usually like Meguiar's products but this Ultimate Protectant is going back to the store. I was going to buy Meguiar's leather conditioner but the store was out of it so I thought I would try this Ultimate Protectant. I've been working and cleaning cars for a long time and have tried all types of interior cleaners/conditioners and this Ultimate Protectant is not very good as it made the seats duller than when I started.
B00NJICISC|5|awesome!  xl fit a little tight (my hat size is 7.250 but probably should for best protection.  beautiful and well made - best price out there for this quality!
B006A49J02|3|Way to expensive for the use.  However it is what the manufacturer required.
B00T0WHSE0|4|Takes some installation, the product seems to be cut to specification, but I will need to pay a person more experienced than I that can install the film properly.
B008CE06ZA|4|This is a good product for towing items less than 5,000 lbs.  I like that it is adjustable and easy to use.  Quality seems good to great.  I would recommend.
B00GWFOJBI|3|Coverage is great. My complaint is they move around too much. Front ones stay in place real good. Back not as good. Slide under front seats easily.
B007SP0B04|4|Went on easy and fit good, the console cover not that great-just used the top cover on it anyway.
B007R4UCW8|1|Did not have good luck with these.  Two of them did not spray.  I finally ended up opening them and pouring the solution onto the floor.
B0016J1R0G|5|I replaced the electric tailgate in my classic Blazer with this, no more electrical issues for me. Great that this is still available.
B003N9MQCK|5|Great mugs! Nice to have them back!
B003BG4PUQ|2|Very cheap.
B00I2MWR1S|1|Wouldn't stick to the tank. I made sure it was cleaned and held pressure for quite some time. It didn't stick and was too easy to peel off (it started to peel itself). I cut it to fit so I can't return. I just wish it worked.
B00F0QAOOG|5|Fast shipping, arrived just as described. Perfect fit with quick and easy installation
B008LL7SEG|5|Shipped fast and fits my 2001 Mazda tribute perfect! I was worried because the dealership said they didn't sell it anymore but it's the exact same as the original.
B00032K32A|2|Pretty cheap.
B000C9426W|5|Better than the crappy pads the Dealer installed last year, nice and quiet unlike what was put on at Honda
B00SNA16S4|5|nice product fast service
B00HZB6XFI|2|looks like it was printed on a really bad printer. took a small picture and enlarged it so it now looks all fuzzy.
B012AHL50E|3|Guess I shouldn't have expected too much....but I was disappointed.  Pretty cheap.  The adhesive that comes with it is garbage.
B001TURT54|3|Worth noting I looked at these as a mountain biker and thought they didn't fit the bill for that.<br /><br />Very breathable and they seemed durable enough. But the fabric was thin around the fingers and didn't cushion me much. Kind of abrasive after a while, actually.<br /><br />The thumb fit kind of awkwardly. Never had that before. Also definitely fits a  size smaller than most gloves I'm familiar with.
B006N91C2M|5|Did what it was supposed to do, can't complain about that.
B00M9MH7DK|4|Nice bars and as advertised.  Think they will work well on my bobber.  Not sure of the quality of chrome as it takes time to see.  Fast delivery and product is as advertised.  Thanks
B00QZBKYNG|3|Nice & neat
B003CJEACA|5|Service was great had a mix up on part  they figured out which one I needed and resolved the problem
B00KE17CK6|1|The first problem I had with it was the fact that it would whistle.  At any speed above 45mph this grille will whistle.  Customer support on the issue was ok, but extremely slow.  Finally fixed it by adding weather stripping to the top center of the grille.  Now it has been on my truck for about 3 months and the hardware is rusting.  Brand new truck and a rusting grille.
B000VKYB9U|5|Perfect and Quiet
B00DJ5KE9A|5|What a simple way to check your battery !
B00HTP8N0I|3|Fine
B00KWDTAW4|5|Looks good !! Just as described OEM part .
B001LRJHFK|5|I have purchased this product three times. I give it as gifts because it really helps relieve some cramping/tingling in the hand. I own a Triumph Bonneville and have never had any issues with it sliding around. It always stays put and works very well.
B00N998UTW|5|Great stuff, got on time and it's just what I wanted .
B00JD7ZUBU|5|I changed both left and right side on my 2009 4WD 1500 Sierra truck. This is the only way to go. You don't have to rent a ball joint press and struggle to press the old one out, or the new one in. You can &#34;rent&#34; presses for free at some stores but my experience has been they are worn out or don't have the right fittings. This comes with new bushings so all you have to do is pull the bushing bolts and pop the ball joint taper. I didn't have to pull the hub off like you normally would. It took me about 4 hours to do both sides. I am not a pro just a shade tree mechanic. I could have done it faster but I am getting old and slow. :-)<br /><br />One thing to note, Moog changed their boot seal design. The new design is now part of the ball joint fitting so the unit looks like there is no seal on it. Old style boots use to slip on over everything and was easily visably. They have published a pdf document about the change. When I went to get it aligned, the mechanic instead that the boot was missing on the right side. I had to show him the document. The left side was old stock so it had the original designed boot on it.
B007OXCIB0|4|Cool arived on time good quality
B0107U9FVM|5|It fit's nicely look's good
B0015PK3AG|3|The tool works ok I guess. It's just a shame that I need to use it in the first place. I have changed my own oil on our family's cars for the past 30 years, and was always able to remove the existing oil filter by hand, and apply the new filter by hand as well.<br /><br />Now, through no real obvious reasoning I can think of, we now have to build our own oil filters using filter membrane and O-ring kits - but why? If Toyota was customer focused, how would they think this is better in any possible manner? Is it easier to change? Hell no. Does it filter the oil better? Doubt it. Is it less expensive? Again, hell no - it's actually more expensive. Is it easier to use? Double hell no. It's a process only someone who hates mankind would think up.<br /><br />First you need to use a screwdriver to unscrew a little cover that exposes an opening to the oil filter. Then, you need to screw in this little plastic jobby that is supposed to drain your oil filter - what happens is the oil runs all over the place. You actually need to buy a small piece of tubing to attach to the drain thingy, so you can aim the draining oil towards the oil collection container.<br /><br />Second, you then use this oil filter wrench to remove the oil filter housing. For that it works ok, but the lug that you use to apply removal torque is something like 24mm - who has 24mm sockets or wrenches? You can use an adjustable wrench, but those are sometimes challenging to fit just right, so you don't round the corners.<br /><br />Even though you have &#34;pre-drained&#34; the oil filter (see above), oil still goes everywhere. You need to remove the old filter membrane, and o-rings, clean the casing, install new membrane and o-rings, then reassemble.<br /><br />It used to take me about 10 minutes to change my oil, and I rarely spilled a drop. Now, it's easily a half hour job, and a messy one at that.<br /><br />And before you blast me for giving this 3 stars when most of my complaint is about Toyota, the 3stars are for the difficulty in finding a wrench that fits this tool. If they had gone with a 19 or 20mm size, most wrench sets have that size. But 24mm - most socket and wrench sets stop short of that large a size, so you either need to go buy a single wrench just for this, or make do with an adjustable.<br /><br />There. I feel better,
B0039HLGJ0|1|This air filter does not fit a 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited as the results stated.  Wasted my money, and it is too late to return it.  You would think Amazon would allow for return as it was their mistake.  But no.
B002VPRQ2W|5|I just hope it fits under the hood of my 72 chevy truck.  it looks close but I just have the motor on the frame with no body.  crossing fingers since I already painted it.
B00F9RNIPI|5|Should last a lifetime. I had a cheap set of jumper cable that just broke, so I looked around and this set was just what I was after. Heavy duty and plenty long. I have not used it, but see no reason it would ever fail to do the job.
B00Z7KIZPA|4|Item was as advertised. I carry a large purse but still use it for other things.
B000E63LYW|5|reserve part
B006TMKU1W|5|Worked great and kept my old crappy car on the road after a minor fender bender.
B00O7UFX1K|5|These are great. There are two in the package.  You heat them up with hair dryer to soften them and mold them into the door handle space.<br />They are really a magnet, not a sticker, so you can use them safely with a leased vehicle, then remove them.  Adds a little personality to your vehicle while protecting from scratches.  Good product.
B006922IHG|4|cool
B00266Z8MQ|1|These lights look kind of cool, but are very dim. WOULD NOT recommend.
B007WCNGD2|5|Really like this Series Heat Shield Custom CoverCraft, fits really good in my Buick Verano and car is cooler when I get in car.
B0051V7AXS|4|after reading tons of reviews and being totally unsure of what battery to buy for my Honda Recon 250. I finally decided on this one. I have only owned it a few months and so far im satisfied. My quad starts the first time every time. and you cant beat the price.
B002IPODA8|5|Great it is just like I says and got here very fast. Thank you
B00MBPTH56|5|Important part of my body work arsenal.  And, I really like the size of the lot (5).  I wanted more than one, but did not need a whole case.
B005DS7DPO|3|If you order this cart,  be careful when you open the box...all of my hardware was loose and rolling around in the bottom. There was an empty plastic tube taped to the frame that was probably intended to hold the hardware, but it was open on both ends. As others have mentioned, you can assemble the cart without instructions...this is good, because mine didn't come with any. The paint job is nice, but easily scraped off (no big deal for an aluminum cart like this one). With all of that said, the cart is sturdy and should do the job.
B00KZD8ME8|5|Easy install and even came with tools, love it. Hope it last long. Just installed them today!
B00A192SE6|5|Fit perfect works great.
B000C2WDBU|5|This actually fits the first gen 2.7 Toyota Tacoma (mine is a 1998). Amazon says it does not, but listen to to manufacturer of the hose. Fits perfect.
B00J53GVP6|5|As described and delivered on time.
B002IPQ5IG|5|Great product
B00N2T7216|4|The suction cups help it stick to the window but not for very long if it gets too hot in the car. It just needs a better attachment method and it would be purrrfect.
B00ARUR0SS|5|Good product.
B0006H938M|3|I would have give it a 5 but the treads were messed up on the part that screws into water fitting. Thought I was going to have to send it back, but my husband was finally able to get it to screw on straight. A 5 minute job turned into about in 45 minute. I believe the part was messed up from factor!
B00RZXVQSU|5|This is awesome!
B00S0V20AO|5|The best  order 2 for my 07 ram 1500 ands its perfect performance
B0091U4MR2|5|great product to add Satellite Radio to your Mazda Car
B00VIVGRS4|5|It works. Jump started a V8 Jeep. Kept 2 iphones charged for 3 days with heavy use on one of them. Inflates tires slowly but a nice addition. Inflates balls fast. Glad i got one. May be purchasing another.
B006NZTZLQ|5|I keep this plugged in at all times, six months and going.. Never had a problem. Works better than the few others ive tried. Seems to have quicker realtime data transfer. I'm using this in my car connected via Bluetooth to my in dash nexus 7 running obdwiz via tasker.
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Great bulbs, they help with your vision so much while reversing out of a parking spot at night. At first I was worried they might be too bright but then who cares because I use these for reverse lamps not headlights. These also help with my reverse camera vision. Highly recommended, perfect white color, fantastic looking.
B00S7CMO52|2|Not the greatest product. The extension seems to be made out of some sort of soft metal so it just keeps getting loose. I tightened mine down real well and it was loose and twisting within a week. Use of any kind of tools to make it tighter will leave indentations in the metal. I'm sure I could use glue to keep the threads in place but I plan to just find a better product. My extension was plain black and did not have the logo on the side like the one pictured.<br /><br />Like the other review said it came with all sorts of extra items. I would have preferred that the extension cost less, perform as expected, and not come with extras that I just ended up throwing out anyways.
B00G620ZVU|5|Arrived fast and just as described. Very bright lights. I did disassemble and add silicone sealant to improve water resistance. Worked great through the fall, winter and spring. No issues, well worth the money spent and will be buying more for another vehicle.
B000C57KK6|5|love them, saved a bundle and easy install, drives nice
B00F68HINI|3|Installation was not as easy as advertised.
B000BUOSGG|5|Great for apartments.
B00G71MTKA|5|Very well made and looks great.
B005FL70KM|5|Brakes installed on my 2008 Altima S with no issues at all. After break in they function much better than the oem's I had before and they look great.
B00IIVRZWE|4|I'm just over 6'1&#34; and the jacket is really short on me. If you're looking for a new jacket it wouldn't be a bad idea to try them on in person or at the very least order longer, i.e. xlt or2xlt
B00LV2UKQK|3|The color is starting to fade already, so they're trying to turn pink, not my husbands first choice, but they are solid frames.
B0009IQZH0|5|Good quality easy to use towel makes polished car stand out.
B00K8K104W|5|Awesome
B0039HD4RM|5|A very quick, inexpensive upgrade. Creates a nice looking finish on the door handles. I love it.
B00BT0KZ6E|5|great lights, I should never need to buy any others again.
B00IO12YZQ|5|work great, much cooler, won't destroy the sockets for the DRL's , another bad Chevy design
B0007VFMA0|5|Great product, shipped fast. Everything lined up perfect for my 92 f150. Easy install. A couple hours, brewskis, and busted knuckles is all it took. Looks great, quality stuff. Very pleased. Would definitely recommend.
B00YNNAQI6|5|This is the best all-weather trunk/cargo protector you can get, hands down.  The manufacturer weather mats are not even close!  This is worth the extra money to have.  I had this in my Nissan Altima for the trunk, and now in my Nissan Murano for the cargo area.  Easy to clean and looks/fits great.
B007R4GRDQ|5|Timely delivery,  fits very well, I very happy with my choice.
B001O0XE1M|5|Excellent
B00CS720N8|1|This is a joke, product came dirty first of all ok no big deal so then it's time to kick back with a cold one with my new cool coozie. After about five minutes trying to get the can into the coozie I finally get it. Crack open the beer and of corse since I struggled the beer is now all shaken. It comes with this plastic sleeve that I guess is suppose to help get can in but it's almost useless in fact entire product is useless, though looks cool. So don't buy this and plan to actually use it clearly ODI didn't except people to.
B009X1U9OO|5|Perfect fit.
B000IDYKNC|5|Purchased a few years ago and blade retained sharpness
B002ZBWKAU|5|love it and I am always eager to use it. No need to run to the gas station pump any more. I've had it for nearly a year and still works fine.
B00TA9XB4E|5|cool tool
B00D6WWAZW|5|Awsomw
B00D9C2CDO|4|Worked great, held much much more than expected (when packed correctly). Drove 750 miles in the August sun without an issue. Cant speak for leaks as we didn't drive through rain. I strapped all 8 straps to the side roof rails (no crossbars) of a 2014 Toyota RAV4 and had no issues. I doubt this thing would really stand up to years of use but its a fantastic economical storage solution for the occasional road trip.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/30/15: I have to lower to 4 stars from 5. We used it for a second trip of 1600 miles through some light to moderate rain. There was definitely some water inside the bag when we opened it but nothing significant. I guess it came through the zipper because there are no holes or tears. I would describe this bag as &#34;water resistant&#34; rather than the &#34;waterproof&#34; that its advertised as. Still a great bag at a great price.
B008EDIPL6|5|beatifull tire, fast shiping
B000B8JUNY|5|perfect
B0040CWY58|5|Exactly as the stock ones for the 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.
B002WH7B0G|5|even I can fix my van
B00IKLL9QA|4|It works good and great price. Good purchase
B00563HXV0|4|Simple press-fit piece. Took me all of about 10 minutes to install, and that was about 8 minutes spent finding the tool pouch and lowering/raising the tire. The 2 minutes spent installing it was making sure I had it all the way in there. Might not, but, it's in there pretty good. Someday, I'll try sinking it on there with a hammer, but, for now, I have piece of mind that some jackhole that wants to steal my spare will be thwarted as this will make it clearly more difficult than locating another truck.<br /><br />Got this after my license plate was stolen, got me thinking what else can they steal off my 2014 Tundra 1794?
B000CIT3N0|5|This is the filter, I've been using Mobil 1 products for many many years and don't plan on switching.
B00062Z0D4|4|It works great, easy install even for a beginner. Make sure to buy the cleaning kit in a year instead of replacing. Used this on a 2001 Honda CRV.
B004UR1NOQ|5|I use this filter on my TurboCharged Eclipse and it works great - awesome airflow.
B00YML13OU|4|Nice quality!
B00CJIXAYO|5|Great price for new EZ-Pass transponder holder.  Makes it easier to switch to a new car.
B00H36XX6C|5|I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of this light. It's bright as all heck, and has a nice feature where you can set the light level by how many times you click. However, unlike other multilevel flashlights I've used, this one is smart enough to know that once you've chosen a setting, the next time you hit the power button it should just turn off, regardless of the light level. In other words, if you set it to dim, you don't have to cycle through &#34;bright flashing&#34; mode to turn it off.<br /><br />The flashlight doubles as a cell phone charger, and itself charges off of any USB port. Given that most cars these days have USB ports in the glovebox, a nice use for this light is to keep it charging in your glovebox, ready for use in an emergency. You'll be guaranteed to never be stranded without a charged cell phone if your car ever breaks down!
B003BZD08U|5|Heavy brass, don't waste your money on the cheep plastic regulators. Most RVs are rated to 50lbs max. One ruptured internal line you will wish you had one. Water pressure will vary depending on where you are on the water main. This does limit it to 50 lbs.
B00K1KZACC|4|Works well but the clamps wont fit the pipes had to buy seperate ones but for the price good buy
B000CMIG66|5|Just installed it last night... car runs the same but with less noise lol
B008G28OXE|5|Beat fast shipping excellent
B000E28N2G|5|This filter has a fine mesh screen element and offers very little restriction to flow as compared to the paper element type. I made the mistake of putting a paper element type on my 5 KW generator and it would starve for full after a minute or two. This filter works great for gravity feed fuel delivery and solved my problem. You can see the screen through the clear plastic. You can also clean it by back flushing with air, solvent or both.
B008697KXC|5|Amazing keychain. Arrived a day earlier than estimated. Great quality great price. 100% would recommend. And would buy again.
B0002JMTLW|5|This was a perfect fit for my 87 El Camino. The original switches' plastic bezel had broken, so I was lucky that Amazon had this part number. Our local parts store only stocks the switch itself.  Would buy again!
B0099RZNDY|5|Five months ago i purchased a 125cc from Greater Sports and it is still broke they will not honor the warranty.  Three weeks ago i purchase a 300cc trail master  they were very helpful in resolving all issues. If you need a go-kart, atv or parts anything listed on their website i would recommend it very highly.  The product was wonderful and just what we order.  can not give enough praises for this company.
B003TQD14E|1|Very disappointed in this product, more so in their support. I followed all instructions, used exclusively all their listed products from the primer, to cleaning agent, Lacquer, and clear coat etc. I even went as far as to build a temporary spray booth with fans and filter system. Granted I haven't used automotive paint in over 10 years but it's not that difficult to follow directions. IN any good paint job 95% of the work is in the prep.<br /> The parts were primed wet sanded and allowed to dry for a few months while I waited for better weather to paint, Once ready I cleaned using Paintshop cleaner, tack clothed all parts prior to base coat, Sprayed a flash coat let dry then sprayed 3 coats and allowed that to dry for 1 week, wet sanded, cleaned and tack clothed then applied 2 more coats, dry for a week, wet sanded, tacked then sprayed 4 clear coats using same process allowing 10~15 minutes between coats. All this per instruction. there was no drips or sags during any of this.<br /> Now the problem, the paint never seemed to cure even a month later the surface is susceptible to having texture transfering to the surface from objects placed on it. I put towels over the parts to protect them from possible damage while working on my projects, the texture from the towels left an imprint on them.<br /><br /> The kicker is their customer support is absolutely insulting to your intelligence, after providing all the information they required, barcode, date of purchase, products used, process I followed  and Photos. The last email I received was basically a cut and paste from the instructions from teh side of the can which I told them I had followed from the beginning. In other words they have no clue why the paint remains soft.<br /> I've attached a side by side photo showing the parts after being buffed and polished and after I wrapped it to protect it from damage. You can see the texture being transferred to the paint.<br /><br /> In short if you're serious about your project and value your time go to a reputable autopaint supply and purchase a quality product.At the very least you'll have someone to talk to face to face about your project.ject and value your time go to a reputable autopaint supply and purchase a quality product.At the very least you'll have someone to talk to face to face about your project.
B008FCE8IA|5|The instructions were pretty good, but it was confusing to have three different pieces of paper. Anyone with a little bit of mechanical ability can install these side and cross rails. The rails themselves were a perfect fit and installation took me less than 30 minutes. Be sure to pay attention to  whether the side rails are for the left or right side of the car and also which end goes toward the back or the front. If something doesn't fit perfectly, you probably have the side rail in the wrong way. These things work great, are sturdy and held about 200 lbs. of luggage on my family's recent vacation.
B0022ZR3XS|5|Worked just like it is supposed to.
B00OXLPWO6|5|I love these, make my car look awesome. I will buy from seller again. Ten stars
B00UGJX9R6|5|Perfect fit for the Evoque & half the price of Land Rover brand!!!  Very easy to install & they look great.......... 5*****'s
B0041G1C0Q|5|These didn't come with any diagram for drilling the holes like stated in the directions but I'm not an idiot so I measured and mocked it up with the tailgate open and closed and drilled them without the diagram. You can find it online and print it out if you don't have a measuring tape. These don't allow for the bed extender to be rolled back and forth from open/closed position you have to unclip it and clip it in to position manually. For instance if you have a tonneau cover you can unclip extender from underneath.
B0073WEZU4|1|Doesn't work very well with XM satellite radio. Not to good with local stations outside most major cities.
B000CGARD2|5|great job
B00Q344V2U|2|Smell takes forever to go away! Bought this a few weeks ago and I'm still waiting for the smell to get better
B000WNWFP8|5|shipped before promised am very happy
B00EZXW6GY|5|Nice light and does throws a good bit of light out.
B00ERXG4TM|5|3 weeks and 15,000kms. Worth it's weight in gold.
B0002MABGE|3|This is an okay product.  I would think it would work better for smaller dogs but it doesn't seem to hold up to my two German Shepherds.  When installed, it can be moved around so I think that if the winged nuts were stronger on the legs, it would be helpful.
B000WJEP3C|4|Much easier to manage than I thought.  I am not a biker but have very long hair that needs confining in our breezy climate.  Very useful. Perhaps for a broader appeal offering also in brown would be nice.
B00GWFOSBY|5|I bought this for center cap removal on 1999 F250 superduty.  It works perfectly for the application.  I would buy again.
B002WH7ATS|5|Great.
B00BG5EY7I|5|It´s a gorgeous item, excelent quality and finishing. The clasp that holds the body to the ring swivels, very confortable to use.
B004VR0EGI|3|-Received the wrong parts at first.  Return was easy though.<br />-Product is an ease to install.  Took 2 hrs.<br />-Looks great in place of stock.
B005XA71MW|5|Went on the side of my computer tower with no problems. Really great decal.
B00HHG910A|5|Cool product
B001P2DTY6|5|Took 5 minutes to install nice and quick process.
B000S2SSUE|5|As advertised, quick delivery
B0036VQUOA|1|Did not work on even the smallest of scratches! Total waste of money!
B00DH0A1X6|5|Will recommend to all my friends and family will buy again from them
B00AK1IJK2|5|need better instructions for putting the seat covers on
B007QV1RLM|5|Great product and fast shipping. Would never buy any other air hose.
B002G47GE6|3|I'm sure the product is fine, but Amazon's selector tool said these were compatible.  They were not.
B0016GZQ60|5|Excellent vendor and great product
B000SL4A84|4|nice.
B011NSMVZ4|5|There are so many people selling this product which made it hard to choose however I'm glad I chose this one. You can never go wrong with something fulfilled by amazon. Anyway, I am very happy with my gift. The material is excellent nice almost like silk and the material is definitely breathable. Cant wait to take it out on a test drive on my friends motorcycle. I was really happy with the shipping, (my mom has prime) so its a two day free shipping and I received it the next day.It was well packaged and the masks came in 3 individual bags wish is perfect as 2 of them were gifts. I gave this 5 stars for the delivery and for the overall product. ***only thing that I wish is that the actual skull was printed and the top and not inches below because in order to align the nose of the skull you have to fold it inward.  Other than that, I am really happy. **ONE MORE THING**don't order this from anywhere else - I don't recommend it.☺
B00029J5F0|5|One of the required items to have on hand to fine tune a holley carb.  they came in a pair and were natural aluminum finish.<br />After I fine tune to find correct squirter I buy the more expensive tipped squirters for more precise flow.<br />I wish these came in a kit with about 10 pairs for cheap as they are a required step in tuning your carb, along with jets, and power valves at a minimum...
B001UOPRS0|5|Works GREAT!!! Purchased a vehicle that had been smoked in and this helped tremendously!!!
B00UJA1GI6|5|[[VIDEOID:f7379c74ec22daaca751ac6fad52880d]] I wanted to put a set of these on my Tahoe for some time now and I got the chance to review this set so I did the install. In about an hour I had everything bolted on and wired in. I was shocked at how bright they are. With my normal reverse lights in the lens I could see about 4 feet and had to ride my brake down my long driveway just to see where I was going. These however, light up my entire driveway and the neighbors too.  I dont know if he is to happy about that just yet....They are bright. The mounting hardware that came with it was easy to install..Mount the bracket via one bolt that is provided and then attach the lights via 4 bolts (2 on each side) to the bracket. The bracket does provide about 80 degrees of pivot..loosen the bolts, adjust them, tighten it back down. that easy. The brackets are tough too..heavy duty..not chincy big box store junk. The housing on the light itself is also heavy duty with large heat sinks on the back. This will help keep them cool. Now mine being used as reverse lights I don't see it being a problem. They won't be on much.  These are listed as IP 67 Waterproof, dust-proof, rust-proof..Really only time will tell on that part. I have mine mounted to the side of my Reese hitch so it will see some water being thrown from my 4x4 tires I am sure.  I looked over the lens before the install and you can see bits of silicone around where the housing goes together..So I know it's there..Just how well its there is another story. If anything changes during the course of my use I will update my review. The color temp is a bright white 6000K ..I wouldnt say 6500K...I dont see any hint of blue in them at all. Its pretty much bright white.<br /><br />As of right now I am giving these Hausbell® 2x 4\\" 18w 6 Cree LED SUV Off-Road High Bright Boat Headlight Of Spot Driving Fog Light + Mounting BracketD 40W CREE 4x XML-2 LEDs Spot LED Driving Lights+ Brackets Set of 2 (18W Spot Light) a 5 star review.<br /><br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments.

B0017K69MA|4|Invaluable for cleaning the interior of a rear window in a sedan as it lets you get in there and get rid of the haze that builds on on interior glass.  Great for the front as well.  I recommend not using any cleaner with this product.  If you have pretty filthy glass, use somthing else first and then use this to finish when dry.<br /><br />My only complaint is the hand could be a little longer and the head should be a little more felxible.
B00CFCHSS8|5|Works great in my 2012 Nissan Altima.
B0093A9JIW|5|Perfect fit ! Helps tremendously to reduce the heat in the car in florida
B000J2I7T0|5|This is perfect for the purpose I intended. I have this hanging around the front of my stationary bike to hold my phone, ear buds, TV remotes, etc. So easy to change volumes, channel, etc. without having to pause or slow down to reach for something. It seems to be well made and is perfect for what I needed.
B0028R1IIG|5|want world peace
B00NGZ5SLM|5|Easy installation.  No extra parts needed.
B000UUMM6K|5|As advertised. I recommend this seller.
B00GV0OQVC|5|I changed both left and right side on my 2009 4WD 1500 Sierra truck. This is the only way to go. You don't have to rent a ball joint press and struggle to press the old one out, or the new one in. You can &#34;rent&#34; presses for free at some stores but my experience has been they are worn out or don't have the right fittings. This comes with new bushings so all you have to do is pull the bushing bolts and pop the ball joint taper. I didn't have to pull the hub off like you normally would. It took me about 4 hours to do both sides. I am not a pro just a shade tree mechanic. I could have done it faster but I am getting old and slow. :-)<br /><br />One thing to note, Moog changed their boot seal design. The new design is now part of the ball joint fitting so the unit looks like there is no seal on it. Old style boots use to slip on over everything and was easily visably. They have published a pdf document about the change. When I went to get it aligned, the mechanic instead that the boot was missing on the right side. I had to show him the document. The left side was old stock so it had the original designed boot on it.
B000RN04VU|3|hard to get your leg over it.
B004NFU300|5|This treatment is difficult to apply, but it works very well.  Just watch a couple YouTube videos before hand to figure out how it should be used.<br /><br />I applied it a couple months ago (to a 2000 Chevy Malibu) and water still slides off like day one.  I would say it's almost dangerous to drive without a treatment like this after the night and day difference vs untreated.<br /><br />I still have some streaks where I didn't get it wiped off quickly enough or applied it too heavily, but its only noticeable in harsh sunlight.
B001URT1DO|5|A little stiff at first - these are sturdy gloves. Well made.
B00TPLW0DU|3|it was the wrong one. had to get a different one
B003VXRPL0|5|Too bad you can't get blue anymore.
B001TGH9OE|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B003SZ3F3S|5|fits the dorman intake perfectly.  My intake wasnt particularly clean and it still sealed fine.
B001CF1A7O|5|Perfect for the trails. Rear tow point is a must.
B00H7EEO7M|5|Fit like a glove on my 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 WT.  Great quality at a great price with incredibly fast shipping!
B00PHMGT6K|5|HAVE ONLY USED IT ONCE, WORKED GREAT ON A RUSTY FORD ESCAPE FROM WISCONSIN.
B000C9MITU|5|Hard to mess up on a solid piece of metal. Fit properly, has adequate rust protection.
B00BEVZCDE|5|As described, delivered early.
B002PQOBD4|5|excellent
B0032Z0OSI|5|Fits like a body glove. Sporty look on my van.
B00TI1D5JK|5|Completely satisfied. I was aware over other reviews that the fan is constantly on, always running. that is somewhat true. I have the remote installed and the off button on the remote shuts the entire inverter off when used. I'm happy with the cost, but keep in mind that other items are necessary, fuseable link and holder, remote (if desired), battery cable I used 1/0 it's expensive, electrical wire, all these items are extra no matter what you buy so don't get bent out of shape for the extras. The unit powers both TVs in my trailer, with lights during the early night, for 8 hours, longer than I would use them. I also use two 6v batteries wired in series, for 12v with 220 amp hours. The transfer switch is great in keeping everything in sync with shore power and battery power. I also have 200w of solar power to recharge during the day. A great deal, but I understand it is not going to last as it is a fairly new item with AIMs and they are trying it out. That only means it's going to go up in price sooner or latter.  I should also mention that this is hard wired as mentioned in the advertisement. which I prefer. Great deal for what I'm using it for.
B004I0YNMO|5|Flawless replacement on my 2006 Odyssey. Did have to pop the panel above the license plate to get it installed, though (thank you Honda engineering).
B0000AXY62|5|haven't had it long enough for a real test.  five star is just for appearance and master lock reputation.  who doesn't love a nice chunk of stainless steel?  cap on the key end may prevent some water and salt intrusion.  gone is that rusty rod that's been rattling around on my hitch for years.  also, very reasonably priced on amazon.
B008JYXYNY|5|I drive a large Metro bus. I'm required to wear seat belts with shoulder straps that are very uncomfortable - - too tight and uniform destroyers. This great device gives me the slack I need and keeps the belts from destroying my uniform shirts. All this while still being legally compliant and not compromising safety.
B000COSAM4|1|Received two front shocks and one of them is severely damaged. The box was opened when i received it and the upper shock is bent. See photos.
B00397KVGE|5|best ever....
B006G2MJZU|5|Happy. It is an exact replacement to the OEM socket that came with my Chevy Tahoe.
B0095WPO5A|4|after searching fare and wide, these were the bigest fenders I could find for the lowest dollar amount. they work well, and keep our boat safe<br /><br />Best buy for the money
B00JPZFKHY|1|I don't recommend these, very thin and fragile. I chipped one during application. I over paid for these.
B0009I5WS8|4|Very easy install. The plug on this is softer than the plug on the trailer. Gets a little chewed up. Works just fine though.
B00NFCBY1Y|4|The grill is actually about OEM quality it fit great and seems sturdy, with a killer finish. The lights seem to be the cheapest of the cheap with a little care I installed them with out breaking any plastic. They DO NOT come with bulbs you must re-use your old ones, or get new and probably brighter ones because the reflectors or tint in these seem to be dimmer than factory. Not a bad deal for the money if you take some time and install it carefully and slowly it does look amazing.
B0024E6W02|2|Had this installed for 12 days, and just noticed multiple splits in the piping, and leaking sewage on the ground. This is totally unacceptable. The idea is great, but this one must be old and brittle or something. It will most definitely need to be replaced.
B004RZU3Q0|5|These are great. They re bright and seem durable. Got them used at a great price and couldn't be happier. Hopefully they will last longer than the bulb version.
B000BK8RZY|4|looks great
B00BXLQ946|5|Show the love for your car, I love my TSX
B008FCE6KK|5|Perfect!
B00FK336QW|5|Very pleased. Thanks.
B00MXLI0VK|4|The grill looks good on my truck bumper. The truck should have been built that way at the factory in my opinion.<br />Upon removing the grill from its packaging I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of structural design in this grill. For the $92 price I expected more substantial plastic framework in the fabrication of this grill. It looks great but I question it's longevity.
B00KTIY6BW|5|Met all my expectations and it was easy to program.
B004GE31CA|5|Awesome Product and fit perfectly without any issue. I would most definitely would purchase this product again, but lets keep our fingers crossed. Took me less than 2 mins to install.
B00MB0EXGE|4|I ordered 2 of them. One was missing 3 stones so i glued 3 stones on. They look great on my suv. Love them!!
B0049MTGXM|5|Perfect fit!  Just right for light trailers and mounting bicycles.
B00DBEMH8U|5|works and looks great
B007TY4ESO|5|great deal!!
B0024NSMBU|5|Excellent
B004LF8WKK|5|Perfect fit, easy install.  Works great!
B00840JOWS|5|Fit great!! Came on time. Worth every penny!!
B001B55GG6|5|Ordered 1 they sent 2,looks good
B007P05FBW|5|Great product easy to follow instructions well worth the money. I purchased 2 but only takes one per tailgate, gave the other to a friend now have two well satisfied customers. Thanks Dee Zee for a good product..
B0016GRTVU|5|great for me (short person) to reach the back window....
B005EKY1EM|5|these things really work
B00XT9ITNO|5|Product early n in good condition..Looks great on my 2015 Chevy Silverado LT! :) be very careful and patient in applying it though...wipe down car before attaching the moldings :)..
B00O9AREXI|5|great
B00BD4SP4A|5|Fits well.
B00TITQWFQ|5|Great replacement for failed speedometer. Works as described.
B003DK74YY|5|works great on Chrysler, dodge, and jeep swollen lug nuts
B00DMHS1JK|5|Great seller.Great product. Fast shipping.
B00KGNT4VM|1|The contour of the part doesn't match the vehicle.  Also the dimples fit into rubber grommets that are not included and mine were tired and will not hold the badge.
B00Y53AYL8|1|The photo is misleading. Read closely, you get a single hose with a gauge on one end and a female compucheck fitting on the other. This wasn't enough to check fuel restriction for us. We needed to adapt the hose/coupler configuration. Not Happy!
B000CIMP12|5|Works well in my 1987 El Camino / TH200-4R.
B002Y1RQDM|5|Perfect for those cold days
B0053H3SCW|4|good buy
B001S6LJ2S|5|My 01 Focus ZX3 loves this flywheel - great stock equivalent.
B003IOITIK|5|Perfect little tool. Small enough to keep in the truck all the time
B003V1LTHI|5|Made with good quality material
B000C2WETG|5|ok
B008PBRGZ8|3|HAVE HAD HID KIT ALREADY INSTALLED INTO MY CAR WITH 6K AT WHERE A WHITE WITH A HINT OF BLUE,WHEN I GOT THESE ONES AND INSTALLED THEM THE WHERE JUST WHITE SO THERE MORE LIKE 5500K SO IF YOUR LOOKING FOR JUST WHITE THESES ARE THE ONES FOR YOU
B006M6DGL6|1|Bad seller. Does NOT fit my 2014 jeep grand cherokee. Not even close.
B0002H335A|5|Might have been a little overkill, but when you are working below a heavy truck you want to feel safe, these are big, heavy and sturdy. So far so good, haven't died yet. The only thing is, they are quite tall, so if you are using them on a ordinary vehicle, you will probably have to lift a LOT, to fit them below. I am using them on a FJ80.
B00S02LFIG|5|I was able to easily replace my cracked passenger mirror with this. It fit my Hyundai Santa Fe (2008) perfectly. Removal of the old mirror and installation of this one was very easy.  My mirror looks like new!
B00G4S4LOI|5|Great product. Perfect color match. Had two big gouges into paint. The provided brush was perfect. Took several coats to fill the void but almost unnoticeable.  Plenty of paint for this scratch and the many more to come.<br />Brush provided was good applicator. Directions provided were clear and concise. All is all a great product.<br /><br />One suggesting for the seller might be to offer additional brushes for purchase. I would of bought more brushes if available as the one I used is now a bit hardened from the paint. Just a suggestion.
B009PHUGMG|3|Good when it works this is my second one I used the first one about three times then it died.
B000C53RZI|5|Perfect fit on 1997 Ford F150.
B00DU6R7R0|5|This helmet is such an awesome deal for the price.  I love the dual visor and the multiple vents; you actually have to try to get this helmet to fog. The fit out of the box was a little snug with the padding, but after a few days of breaking it in, it fit perfectly.  I would definitely purchase another.
B004X184GE|5|Use on my mailbox - super nice
B001KS6GIG|2|Installed this, and bought the LED bulbs.. Worked awesome with my headlights off, once i turned them on, it caused every single light to flash, ( lic plate lights/ directionals/ everything)
B000W0KTMW|5|Easy to use with a nice little pouch and extra keys.
B00HG76A9A|5|As advertised!
B003CGDSBC|1|Can't handle the weight of the fire extinguisher and it already ripped. Had to use a velcro strap to keep it from falling.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works great.  Very easy to use.  Cannot beat the price.
B00KGGTF9U|5|A perfect fix and good quality for the price
B000FQ79JO|5|great price, good shipping
B00U2LHKMI|3|Works good wish they had a positive and,negative side so you don't need to play the guessing game for it to light up. But the color is great nice and bright.
B00852684M|2|These weren't as cool as I thought. Just made my $800 bike look cheap and childish. Part looks very cheap, and since the first day I removed them from my wheels. Good for people under 5 years of age.
B00MFEBRPG|5|Husband very happy, came on time, great price!  And they look great.
B0047VVBUG|1|Purchase a piece of plexi-glass for a fraction of the cost.
B00BY2220O|1|Being so tall, it is flimsy right at the hinges work touches the floor.
B007TY06JA|5|Perfect fit on my 04 avalanche
B003D29T4A|5|fit perfect on my 65 Plymouth
B0011FLODA|5|Perfect at a great price
B00K779EH6|5|Good product. Was easy to change out, fit perfectly, have already recommended to some fellow RV'ers.
B0117TAUH0|5|It fits and looks great
B004ZF39T0|5|It arrived on time, was the correct parts. Had them installed for three days no issues so far
B00387OSDC|5|cheap and looks better then stock.
B000IZ12NQ|5|Great unit
B000GKEZ1E|5|Still holding.  Had had trouble for years. Had professional company do it.  Tried two other products.  Did not work out.  Hope this time is the last time.
B00D6RR2OQ|5|good product
B0074BG5YS|5|My lower shift boot in my 90 Miata had badly deteriorated, this was just what I needed. Only took me about 20 min to install.
B00F1RIQSA|5|Perfect fit on a R-Line Tiguan 2015
B00KTJ4RUG|1|Didn't work for my 2001 Pontiac Grand Prix
B00X5EO716|5|I Purchased this Scan tool as a replacement for the previous one I owned that broke. Wow! I wish this would have been around/available back when I bought that one. This worked perfectly on my 2012 Chevy Traverse, so I decided to try it on my 2005 Jetta, I was a little skeptical because the VW's usually require a special diagnostic cable and laptop software (Which I do own it's not cheap). The Vgate Scanner, Linked up right away and I was able to scan all the codes & modules. needless to say I was very pleased. (I also like that it came with a protective case & Instructions). I would not hesitate to buy this brand again or deal with the seller. (They were great & shipped a perfectly described product.)  Thank!!!!
B001FCLX6W|5|love it makes my liberty look great, easy to install
B005HR200E|4|I installed them on my motorcycles passing lights and they are as just as bright as the site says and the reviews that I have read.  The price was also very reasonable and Kuryakn is a very reptile company that makes very good products.
B00480GYSA|2|Not that bright expected much more
B00T3W3FB2|5|I just used this bleeder yesterday work great
B00HQPV29U|5|Would buy again. Great quality.
B004ETGQKG|5|save me (short person) from a lot I mean a lot or trouble....
B00KDNRJC6|5|Excellent!!
B00AOAO8QI|5|These parts were the perfect parts I was looking for, thank you.
B00UYHP1SK|1|Arrived not working.  Could not get the card to initialize.  Suggest you buy a different product.
B00ZU0X0FW|4|Good quality product, delivered as described.  Easy install. Definitely upgrades the appearance of the truck.
B00CPL8OVE|5|Excellent product. Running it concentrated through the fuel line is best. In the end, the solution was came out pretty dark. Noticed a smoother idle, smoother ride, and slight improvement in throttle response. The car used to be a little jerky when letting off the throttle, almost like downshifting too soon on a manual. Cleared that up.
B0054RG4QI|1|First time out it melted internally and locked up. Replaced with AEM Tru-Boost. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00JDPT0B8|5|Great product  love how it looks on my bike
B0041U6MYI|5|Fit perfect and was reasonably priced.
B005NLQAHS|4|OK.
B000C2AMQ8|5|great
B0002JN3GC|5|fit great and no squeaks!
B00THNFTWK|5|I absolutely love this item on the back of my Jeep Wrangler (Tank colored). It looks terrific and appears to be durable. It's expensive along with the cost of shipping but I think it was worth it.
B00SAD2TP8|5|Love this cushion couldn't ask for anything better
B004M4WHHE|5|they fit perfect and shipped fast
B004BCLBJM|5|Bulbs fit as advertised. They look just like OEM. Fraction of the cost. Great purchase.<br />2001 Acura TL
B00D3QUIUA|4|Ordered on Tues and got it on Fri. OEM quality. Had Made in Germany tag. Great product, would recommend.
B00CIH0N7S|5|ODI is the best as usual
B000BZJSMK|5|works perfect
B00KBC5RSM|5|Loved the extra pink one
B003CVKXME|5|Good rollers at a good price.
B003RATVVE|5|it works !
B007ZDBHSO|5|Please refer to my review regarding this and the air intake, keep in mind this won't work on every vehicle due to intake designs and setups so it will only work on certain vehicles
B000CMJQHY|5|I put 4 of these on a '95 Dodge Ram 1500.<br />First class.
B001PWA0IO|5|work's great, no more having to hold the tailgate slamming down when opening.
B00LG07MZE|5|Nice item, collapses to a very compact easy to store size. Fits my Ram 2500 winshield nearly perfect. An absolute must to help protect interior and dash from sun damage.
B002UC4Y6C|4|For both my GMC Envoy and Chevy Tahoe I notices that Pollak is the OEM that originally came on vehicle. They hold up well but need replacing approximately every 7-10 years or so depending on use. Mine was constantly dipped in the water backing up to load a boat on a trailer. Had to replace the fuse for this circuit under the hood as well.
B008PRIKOS|5|This fit perfetly!!  Went on as easy as the old broken one came off.
B000X240VU|5|Great product, it fits perfectly on my 2010 toyota venza.. shipping was fast and item was on great shape.
B00AQ2D568|3|I haven't used it yet or even taken it out of box. I had one before and it worked ok. Sure this one will be on.
B003DV78LM|5|So far, it's worked great! Only done one set of struts, but this compressor worked like a champ.<br /><br />Update! This thing still performs flawlessly. I've used it to replace 12 struts (3 cars worth) so far and will be doing more soon. I should also mention that the build quality is top notch. This isn't some knock-off compressor with cheap materials and blotchy welds. Every component is high quality and functions exactly as intended. With that said, when using this compressor I feel completely safe the entire time with no fear of a 20 lb steel spring flying out at ungodly speeds to crush my face in.
B00COAP45K|4|This item is not chrome ! It's plastic chrome plated. still very nice,would buy this item again !
B003KWPT06|1|It fell apart in minutes of use.  WORTHLESS!
B0022ZXOE0|5|Nice quality, haven't took it out for a test drive yet.
B000HEBR3I|1|waste of money. I do not recommend  purchasing this item.
B00KTHWXH2|5|Fast, prompt delivery. Works great.
B00GN0V8W0|4|Good quality for the money.
B005KGIZIS|5|good length and I got exactly what I ordered
B00R6RQBDU|5|Worked perfect on my 1998 honda crv-EX<br />Leave the old cracked mirrior in place, clean the old mirror and if it is cracked use GLOVES you can get cheap mechanix gloves at harbor frieght as you do not want to cut yourself<br />I just sprayed my old cracked mirror with Windex. cleaned it with a lint free cloth, let it dry about 45 minutes and applied the slicky tape then the mirror it went on great this is a full sticker not just a few strips like the other junk out there<br />Shipping was Super Fast!!
B001S8F2V0|4|This actuator was a real PITA to get back in place.  Works like it should.
B0000AY4YT|1|A lot of rubbing for small progress on heavy oxidized surface. Couldn't return because it is past the 30 day by the time I tried it out (had bad weather). So I'm out of $
B00PB625C4|3|The product was as pictured but arrived with no instructions for assembly. We think we did it correctly and while it was not very sturdy it served the purpose well for our 1000 mile trip.
B00SO1YXY6|1|Ripped as soon as I used it.
B00GHSE0BE|5|Good product
B00TG3CV68|3|Bright but not as bright as larger name brands such as Whelen.  This was actually too long for the original application so it was used for a different installation.  One half of the bar is red and the other white. I had to move the modules around to get them RWRW Etc.  for the price it's not bad but for professional response lighting I would use a more widely known brand
B00SSKUHAC|5|Defiantly worth it, keeps everything organized instead a giant mess.
B00GRMS6OC|5|Amazing product!  Very happy with everything about the cat-back system.
B00KDRXDEU|5|These are so pretty on my vehicle. They were received quickly and were very easy to apply. Vinyl seems to be of good quality. Definitely recommend these.
B00075OSD8|5|Very good battery.
B004I12CZI|4|Just what I needed and way cheaper than an auto parts store.  Installed both sides in less than an hour.  Ordered the Dorman 923-030 circuit board and was glad that I did because mine was corroded and may have worked but a new board was a good decision.
B00652G4TS|5|Excellent product easy to use with my iPhone 6+ app works great gives information on fixes for the codes pulled..
B00471T798|4|After about a year two caps lost the TRD sticker and the other two are damaged from the sun. I wouldn't buy again.
B0043DQOYG|1|Did not fit the muffler it was matched up for.
B00PYCXMYK|5|Love it with the polisher
B00429NKWK|5|Follow the directions and it works!  Don't worry about the cloudy white appearance during the sanding.  One thing to be careful of is the final step. When it says to put the final coating on only once and don't go over it again - don't.  I went over twice on the corner of the headlight and it does show some streaking (I didn't put enough on the applicator).  Hoping it lasts for a long time.  The headlights look crystal clear and brand new.
B002ZTNVBY|3|WeatherTech needs to go back to the drawing board on this one.  If it wasn't for the fact that you have to &#34;cut&#34; out a piece of the floor liner, I probably would have returned this item and tried the Husky brand on amazon instead.  The fit is just not that good for a product that they claim is laser measured.  I also own the front liner from them , and I must say that It is real nice.  Maybe try recalibrating your lasers and try again on the back one.<br />2014 F150 XLT
B00S4LXI3S|5|Nice grill, oem fitment on my 2010 Bmw 535i. Looks fantastic in black matte.
B00QUT9AHE|2|It's too long for the space. It never unfolds and goes back to a &#34;pretty&#34; shape, the edges are always wrinkled from rolling during shipping. It moves everyday because of the slick underside. I will look for one made of hard plastic/rubber with nubs on the bottom to keep it in place. Until I find that one it will protect the carpet.
B000J2JE0G|5|It does what it suppose to do. It is a tough little light bulb and lasts years.
B00F33L5B2|5|Good brakes fit fine Big Bear 400
B00ROSVP1E|5|perfect
B00BTLEIIY|3|I sent item back. Did not fit my 14 Silverado as described. Also material was very cheap. They did refund my money very quickly tho!
B0002KKTFO|5|Well built & doesn't leak a drop when not in use. I'm sure I'll have it for life.
B00I9AE392|5|Perfect fit works great
B001PNMC52|3|it works
B0050EEO94|5|I installed this item to replace the original vent in the rear of our 5th wheel..  I was so impressed by what a difference it made, I installed a second one to replace the vent that was located directly over the bed.  I also upgraded to the larger Maxxair (00-933072) covers.  I was able to wire both of the units by tapping into the ceiling lights that were nearby.  The units are on two different 20 amp circuits.
B00CO2QQQ4|5|They work good and a good price.
B005X7P6XG|5|Fits perfectly  fast delivery
B0015KTWLM|5|good quality pipe
B000UV8FNS|5|Bought these a few months back.  Easy install on my f350.  I like that you can cycle through the light options on the remote.  Didnt have to splice any wires at all.
B000ARPVOI|5|noticeable performance improvement<br /> on my vehicles
B00GSAUHB8|5|This sun shade is of very high quality and fully covers my SUV windshield.  Far better than any sun shade I have ever purchased.<br />A total necessity living in Phoenix, AZ to preserve the inside of your vehicle.  To store in car, just line up the circles and twist.  I then slide it into a door pocket or between the console and the passenger seat.
B00JW7PX2W|3|Construction quality looks great, perfect fit, white light (6000k), but not very bright. I'm disappointed with the brightness. May be good for interior, but not good for puddle lights
B00HBHGXH4|5|Received in 6 days. Fits perfectly on my '04 Kawasaki KDX 200
B0036IA6JI|5|Perfect fit and easy install.  My fingers appreciate no having to deal with a broken handle any longer.  Feels strong and works with ease - good quality.
B001B4ROD0|4|Easy install, looks great with my tinted windows...very sturdy..would recommend..
B0031C5OCI|5|Perfect fit
B000VKOD9S|3|As advertised
B00XZ9MYRA|5|Having bought a new remote car key for my 2003 Mazda 6 at the dealer in the past, I am very pleased to have purchased this one for much less through Amazon and without the trouble of a trip to the dealer. Even though I did receive the programming guidelines, I found it easier to follow the YouTube video and it only took a few minutes to get it done!
B00480J4JG|5|Saved a ton of money installing this myself. This is a great bulb for the price. Check out you tube for directions and you are good to go.
B00U7TZ5S6|4|gone through two of these damn things in three months
B00QL6PJY4|5|Switch was perfect fit right in blank space
B0031I20RE|3|Fits my Burgman 650 almost like it was made for it (I doubt it would fit with a rear case or saddle bags.).  Not waterproof (it doesn't seem the least bit water resistant, but it is not advertised to be waterproof).  Not sure how well it will hold up to the weather, but it seems like a bargain for a light weight travel cover.  I'll post again after I've had it for a while.
B00YXDOYMU|4|SO GOOD
B000VLF9NQ|4|It works great, there was only one sunrise to me. This cover can only be used when the soft top is down. It took me reading the distructions to figure that out. It does not matter too much
B00EAOIRI4|4|Fits perfect into 2013 Honda fit, easy installation after watching a youtube video however there is no special scent and it seems to be the same quality as most other similar products.
B00OZH3KIS|3|Thin metal will support a kayak. Not as good as a Thule or Yakima, but works ok on my trailer.
B007ZYP0IQ|5|Fits JDM 2000 VItz. Stock sending unit went bad and was too expensive at the dealer. This fit and works perfectly.
B001O2T43M|3|be careful the plastic brakes easy.
B01092IEEM|3|They are okay, the rear one was a pain in the a%$ to put on. Quality is okay, would buy a different product next time.
B000GOG3PG|5|Worked Fine Easy to install
B000BYELQY|5|BEWARE!  You must use correct wiper blade.  The Driver side blade is not the same as the passenger side blade.  Yes, the size is different, but the blade itself is different.  Be sure you use passenger side and/or driver side to order.
B00029WVIS|5|Yiu may take some time to get used to this. But know i wonder why this is not standard on all cars.
B005Q75XIQ|4|Great way to light your Kato passenger cars!!
B0036E9VB6|4|I decided to try this instead of a jump starter with a compressor. Good choice! My car has very small tires, but this filled them very quickly, as opposed to a regular compressor which if you ever needed to use in a pinch, you know can take forever. Tried it on a friends car with 18 inch tires and again, tire was able to be driven on in about 2 minutes and at full pressure in about 3. Cord is long enough to easily reach front or rear tires. Comes with accessories to fill balls, etc, but have not used it for that purpose. Be careful how you handle it when finished, as it says on the box, it gets hot. I would give it 5 stars if it had AC cord.
B00NTOJU28|3|Very bright and I'm sure they work very well in an automotive application.  I tried them in a low voltage under cabinet lighting system powered by low voltage AC and the flicker is intolerable.  Stick with automotive.
B00KQXKG46|5|Heavy duty light - I just got them today and installed a smaller version my the same manufacturer on my mower and they were great so I have no doubt that these will be AWESOME!
B007SOODHC|3|As other have warned, it may not work for you.  The T20 bit was the size I needed for my project (Mass air flow sensor on a Porsche Boxster), but the hole in the middle for the &#34;tamper proof screw&#34; was too small.  I tried drilling it out, but none of my drill bits worked.  Napa has the T20 screwdriver I neede for $4.04 available in 24 hours.  Price for these bits is good and they are a welcome addition to my toolbox, but I suspect they will sit in the back of a drawer and gather dust.
B0076O5XD2|5|Good protection for the surface
B004FP5BYQ|5|Good quality decal.  i did my first full this year at IMMT and felt like getting a decal for my truck.
B000CO7W1E|5|work great for a nice price
B00FGSN7Q0|2|I purchase this product online in July and did not get around to install it until this august. in the installation process I noticed that the outside housing had hairline cracks. The direction state to tighten by hand which I did but still notice the cracks and since this was going to be install inline with the radiator house and exposed to heat , i did not want to take a chance on it failing while driving. looking for warranty information from vendor as I waited to long to install for amazon warranty. Will follow up once I get a response from vendor or amazon.
B004WMDY82|5|Excellent product
B0049IZSS8|1|Good idea, but not for every receiver and hitch!
B000H29WL4|5|Money well spent
B00B2A8ZOU|5|Its is an awesome addition to your truck for sure if you hate how far the front slants down buy this lift. It brought it up and just about level with the back of the truck a little bit higher without the blocks in the back. It took me about 3 and a half hours to install and once you figure out all the things you need to do it goes right along and your done before you know it. Definatly worth the money over a leveling kit
B007FHSDM8|4|Can get a little too tight on my 98 vtr1,000. But it does work perfectly and not leak.
B00144AHGI|5|fit my woods zero turn mower perfectly
B005OXVO5S|1|Had two of these go bad in a year ordered from amazon. First one went out a week after I put it in the car, of course it was after the replacement warranty. The second one went out about 10 months after being installed.
B000C10EVW|5|compatible
B001OCXGJK|5|Great quality, could use another 12&#34; wider optional size to compliment the other boxes they selll / offer
B000WGNNUQ|5|I now have this installed. The instructions said the fan would vary according to temp. Not, it runs all the time. But I'm OK with that. I prefer the fan running and making sure all stays cooler. I mounted the remote inside the trailer, and it will totally shut off the inverter killing the fan as well. So I guess you can say it turns on with the power and off without. I am complete satisfied with the results as I can run both TVs front and bedroom. It will run for 6 hours and charge the next day with my solar panels. I do have two 6v batteries wired in series for 12v giving me 220 amp hours. that makes a total difference. I'm a happy camper and the price was acceptable. But keep in mind you still have to buy the battery cable (expensive for 1/0 cable), fusible link and holder, electrical cable, remote is separate charge. All the things are part of installing a inverter so don't get upset over the extra cost. Oh, I should mention this is hard wired which I also prefered.
B003UHNMMS|5|No complaints on the product or shipper.  Inexpensive, seems to be of a decent durable quality, it's in the toolbox now if I should need it.
B004K23KQ0|4|thanks,paint doesn't last long
B00VNBDWPK|2|Product was shipped out quickly & is so described. BUT, as with hids the throw pattern is poor. Yes they are bright, however they don't light up the road nearly as well as a pair of regular Sylvania bulbs. The leds are not matched to the reflector points of the headlight housing , at least on my gmc Denali HD. In order to not blind oncoming traffic I have to aim all the way down and then I only light up a few yards ahead of me.
B004PX1F9S|5|all these products are great so far
B00MOQXL3Q|1|I had high hopes for these wrenches. I watched a couple of online reviews and they looked pretty good. I work on heavy equipment and big trucks and use mostly snap on tools. I figured I'd give these wrenches a try mostly just curious about the 160 tooth.  The 1/4 inch broke in less than a day.  The mechanism simply started skipping and not grabbing teeth.  The 3/8 is holding up a little better but does occasional skip teeth.  Overall I wouldn't buy them again.  If your in the market for a good ratchet Get your self a snap on a matco or gear wrench and be done with it.
B003LIV38G|5|very happy with this product, fixed the problem
B00396B25E|3|Not as sturdy as first thought.  It works, but I would look for a more robust set up next time.
B000MDZLR2|5|Good and economical tire cover for my 2003 Honda CRV spare tire. Perfect fit for oem size tire.
B0068FZ6Z0|5|Good quality help me a lot, fast delivery service. I recommended
B00VNBDWPK|5|Wow! Is what I said to myself driving to work this morning. Ive tried other leds they always had dark spots but these are awesome. Its like having the sun on my grill!
B000ZIZHKK|5|My engine in my 2001 Mustang had a constant miss on cylinder 5.  I decided to replace all of the stock coils with the MSD coils. My order arrived on-time and complete with no damage. The MSD coils looked and felt like a quality product.  I had the coils on my Mustang about 30 minutes later.  The engine started quickly and the idle was noticeably smoother.  The miss on cylinder 5 was gone as well.  The engine no longer has an occasional miss when the engine is under load at a low RPM. It has been a little over a month now with them installed and I still have not experienced any noticeable misses and the engine continues to start quickly and idle smoothly.  Great product.
B009TBQRJE|5|Hi there!  I don't normally write product reviews, but I know how difficult it can be to find good floor mats, especially for your beloved Prius.  (And thank you for driving one).  In short, I love these mats.  They are every bit as good looking in real life as they are in the pictures, probably even more so.  In my subjective opinion, they are durable yet very simple and almost elegant in their design.  I didn't like my other options, as most of them look too industrial, with their thick, heavy rubber grooves.  I've had them for probably a month, and they don't slide around at all.  They are surprisingly light, but tough.  My son spilled a bottle of water on the passenger side mat, and the water just beaded until I wiped it up.  They are extremely easy to clean, especially with a product like Vinylex, which also protects the rubber from UV and gives it a nice, non-greasy shine.  I honestly couldn't be happier with my decision to purchase these mats.  I purchased both the front and rear mats, and all of them fit perfectly in my 2012 Prius.  I can't remember if they offer a cargo area mat.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase it as well.  However, we sometimes do some car-camping or drive-in movies, and I like to lay in the back with the rear seats down, so I wanted the relatively level surface of the carpet mat in the back.  My ONLY complaint with these mats is the logo that's installed on them.  I don't like advertising for anyone, so I decided I would remove the logo from both driver and passenger mats, (the rear mat doesn't have the logo).  The logo fits on the mat like a shirt pin- where the logo has two posts coming out the back, and is pushed through the rubber mat all the way through to the other side, where the posts are held by two crimped buttons.  I simply took a pair of wire cutters and twisted the buttons back and forth until they released the posts.  Then I just pulled the logo off of the mat.  The VERY minor downside of this is that there will be two tinyholes in the mat as a result.  I tried filling them with different black materials around the house, including cutting down the posts so they would be the right depth, but I just couldn't get it perfect.  In the end, I just left them and you really can't tell at all, as they blend right in with the material in the mat.  I'm going to try to post some pictures with my review.  In any event, you might not mind the logo.  Either way, they're great mats. Good luck, and many happy miles to you and yours.
B00230A5NW|5|Great quality!
B005JZSP08|4|BE  CAREFUL - I thought seat belts were basically the same.  Should be able to purchase this and it will work with my car.  WRONG.  Seat belts are not the same.  I tried to use this on a 2007 Ford Edge.  Believe it or not, the seat belts aren't even the same in my car!  This fits on the front seat belts, but not the back. I purchased this to make it easier to hook up the middle rear seat belt around a car seat.  Well, it will not fit and will not work.  This unit looks great; looks like good quality, etc.  If it fits where you want it to, I bet it will give you years of good service.  But I am having to return my purchase because it doesn't fit and will not work with any of the seat belts in the backseat of my Ford Edge.
B00H5XFG9U|4|It is the OEM set for the vehicle.  Not bad quality, but just average.
B000HUM4IO|4|These work so long as you don't have any missing exhaust manifold bolts.
B000P7R8QC|5|I had a very bad smell that I could actually taste in my 4runner due to an air freshener. This filter removed the smell in about two days.Its great and for the price I'll change mine out regularly.
B002L1EQO2|5|Very nice seat. Good lumbar support. Comfortable even for my 260 pounds.
B003JTYGPO|3|The bottle leaked some, but not a lot.
B00BYX62J0|4|Let me first say that it was really easy and simple to put together and into my car.  The directions were fairly simple and easy to read.  Now that I have that out of the way.  It didn't come with the right screws for everything.  Luckily I had plenty of screws around that did the job  It didn't take more then 1 hour to put together and that is with taking the old intake out also.  I havent really noticed a huge difference in the sound so not too impressed with that but I mainly bought to see if I could improve my gas mileage on a 12 hour round trip im taking this coming week.  Other then that I hope it does what it says its supposed to!!  It does look pretty cool though that's for sure.  Update - ok just got back from my long road trip. Defintely made a difference in avg mpg at one point I even got it to 30 mpg going just under 60 miles the road trip itself was mostly about 70 mph roads and at its peak I was averaging about 27 mpg. Also in my initial review I stated I didn't notice much of a difference in sounds but I defintely have noticed it now and it really is a clear sound a lot more gruff then the stock intake so imnprety happy with it.
B000V2W0GE|5|Added this to our Shurflo waterpump in order to catch any objects that may have entered the fresh water tank. Item came with everything you would need and we have had no issues with it. Make sure to check/clean the filter regularly and this product will help to protect your fresh water pump.
B00LQHR9GE|3|Good
B006VYFHBQ|3|They were nice, brand new, but they did not fit my radio.  I'm not sure why yet?
B00QKPQ31E|4|Fits my Ranger 570 Full-size just fine, but the sitching pulled on one strap. Price is right and looks good. One weird thing, I think the stock picture has the top on backwards. Look at the side view and you can see roll bar showing towards the rear. I put the logo towards the rear and it looks much better
B007KPUFIK|5|i love it
B00PY1O5CY|5|THEY WORK GREAT
B00HTOXOWG|5|fits my feet well
B007VRBH8E|4|i like the fact i can perform my own alignment,but you need to be very gentle to not move the plate....you can get good results with these.....
B00ZI7VGPS|4|Right brake cylinder wrong brake handle used the old one
B0016KHD8A|5|Teflon 5th wheel disc is the only way to go, stay away from the mess of grease.
B00MLI6Q5W|5|Nice light bar for the money. I really like the rocker switch as it fit perfect in the dash of my 2015 polaris ranger. The wiring was a breeze also.
B007V2CN1O|5|Exactly as described. Great custom fit. Would buy again.
B003B1W71U|5|Great Product. Very Nice!
B0002NIJ8A|5|Looks great on my boat!
B000F09CF4|5|Big helper for loosening rust frozen items.
B008NYAOCY|5|I love this thing! It came within 4 days and is still installed on my car!
B000AS1XYE|5|Arrived fast and as described.
B00029KBF8|4|well made product.  sturdy and an easy install.  bikes are secure to rack, rack secure to vehicle.  easy to lock bikes in place when desired.  can now open my rear door with bikes in rack, as apposed to the receiver rack I had previously.
B002VIDP24|5|These are working great on my 2012 Pilot
B000BUQOGI|5|Camco's quality and price is second to none. I have multiple camping plugs by this company.
B000ET8D0G|5|Don't need to take flat tire to a tire shop for repairs anymore.
B004KED8CO|4|Bar connection looks pretty lame but hasn't failed on me yet. Would prefer a solid weld
B00EJPOQRU|5|Worked perfectly on my 2008 Suzuki GSX650F.
B00MMLIXPO|1|Did not work with my Honda Accord
B00AC6ZCYQ|5|Very nice pack.
B001CF1Y0C|1|I most definitely would never buy anything from or made by Smittybilt again! I could review a product if I had received the right one. I could review their customer service - if they had any. If you buy from Smittybilt, you're rolling the dice. If you get the right product and it works, you may be OK. If you don't get the right product or a product that works, use it for an art project or a boat anchor 'cause you'll never hear from them.
B0016ZBP1Q|5|Perfect replacement!
B00FYHGD46|4|No clips as advertised, otherwise perfect fit & finish.
B0050EFZGK|5|Works great!
B001G4Z5J0|5|Great!! Love being able to haul items behind my vehicle instead of in it. Keeps the mess outside!!
B00YD2HN7O|4|worked as expected
B00937XNL4|5|Great cheap replacment product.  It saved me from screwdriving the ignition swith with the broken key.
B0051PJWQW|4|My sole gripe is that the directions say to shake well and spray onto the plastic lens material. When I did, the sealant sprayed in a very wide pattern, all over the adjacent hood. I then sprayed it onto the corner of a microfiber cloth and rubbed it in (like waxing a car). I did two applications and then &#34;buffed lightly.&#34;<br /><br />I only used it a week ago, but so far, the lenses are clear.
B002R0QNWA|2|The light looks identical to my other light but the brake light stopped working about 1 month after installing.  The rest of the other lights work fine but the brake light doesn't.  I have yet to figure out why it doesn't work and really don't have the time and money to buy another full light.
B008SEBQ2G|1|Piece of sh*t couldn't even get one station
B001Q8DMA0|5|These things are unbelievable at drying your car. A tip.... purchase a can of the car detailer wax in a spray can....walla...you waxed your car while drying it plus it cuts through the whitr ring that have already developed.... Great towel...
B0087WDNYI|5|I just ordered these brake pads. I´ll let you know how they fit my Kia Spectra 2005.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Great product at a great price.  If you pay attention to your tire pressure, this gauge will pay for itself 100 times over.
B000066OC7|3|Works okay, but density has flattened in the 2 months I've had it.
B005EJGSQ2|2|I returned this because it did not warm up at all.
B0027I4JVE|1|Very week pump. Pumps extremely slow. Would not buy another one.
B000COBANA|5|Easy to use.
B007KPERVG|4|Worked great on my 1990 Silverado with the exception of the side markers. They are the later type that wrap around toward the headlights.
B00651BVQA|5|easy install and great reception.  very flexible and no worries about getting antenna caught on branches or removing to go through the car wash.
B001ABFVFW|5|Perfect
B009UODKTU|1|From afar they look ok. But the welds look bad and not polished well at all. If it didn't say &#34;Flowmaster&#34; on it I would have thought it was from China made by a 8 year old.  The nut and bolt to clamp it on is even cheaper quality. Both bolts stripped easily when tightening.  Now I have to get higher end real steel bolts and nuts.  Im a mechanic and know what I'm doing but I wanted to share my experience.  I would not recommend.  Should have gone with a weld on system
B00NWT608W|5|perfect
B008ALTQZG|2|Grommet came out right away.
B0002STR22|1|Piece of junk.....first time my son used it, it ripped
B000EDST6K|1|Does not work with paper bowls made in USA.  This hold 6&#34; bowls, I have only been able to find bowls that are 6 7/8&#34;
B000C9QZ62|5|Fits perfect. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it also comes with 3 butt connectors for connecting the new wires to the old ones.
B00PSRORH2|4|Car window shades are just what we ordered, fits properly to the car windows. good product and quick delivery.
B00TKONJBY|5|Excellent hub + quick release.
B008O1N1JE|5|Works great on my 2014 taotao scooter  50cc
B001NZQIDE|5|Easiest plug and play set up for a 2006 F150.
B00BCRMA9Y|4|These have saved my legs and other exposed skin from getting scorched on the leather in my 1997 4Runner, the install was easy, i might be a little rough on the clips but i got them to work
B004GCVS1S|5|The mirror seems to be a good quality replacement. Installation instructions would have been nice but not really hard to figure out.
B00M3Y8LT8|5|this is the good one,  the one I rated by mistake was the upgrade Carburator assembly replacement for 1989 ez-go the cart would not run at all because the gas flow was out the choke to the air filter not to engine
B00AQFEBSG|5|bas ass clevis and never lose the pin.
B00FPR1SXG|4|It seems that the smell is now lasting less than before. It used to last for over weeks but now it's just a week or so. Maybe they changed the formula? Who knows.<br /><br />However, I love the smell and the price. So 3 for that price is not a bad deal at all!
B000CN6TPU|5|This unit is very tidy and compact. It feels very solid.
B000CAINEI|5|Perfect size.  If you own a truck get this one.  The JUMBO size.  I have an Ford F350 and it covers my entire windshield and able to cover even a larger windshield.  I'm so happy I found this one.  I couldn't find this size anywhere and the one I've been using would fall out of the windshield.  Also, this one has cloth binding covering the edges, which the other one I was using didn't, so the edges start to peel and you'll have bits and pieces of foil all over your floor mats.  I'm a happy camper now :D
B009HXFFKG|5|These are awesome!  Good solid quality with a little personalization for your ride. Now I'm just afraid someone is gonna like them as much as I do and walk off with them. Luckily they're not too expensive to replace.
B0009TU57A|5|Exact fit on a four winns trailer. and comes with replacement screws as well which is very nice because all the old ones are rusted out
B008G3AD0A|4|It took about 1.5 hrs to install.  All the plugs fit and connect correctly. The lights came with both high and low beam bulbs installed. I did have to use the existing blinkers. The units did not come with bulbs for the blinkers. They completely changed the look of the car. Definitely check YouTube for video instructions. The video saves you a lot of time. The only minor complaint is that the fit of the lights to the body panels is not as good as I would have liked. May need further adjustments. I'll check it again after a few hundred miles and see if it may be adjusted better. Overall, very pleased with the purchase.
B00LCBJF0W|5|These struts were so easy to install. Excellent product at a great value.
B000C71KX2|5|Couldn't be any better.
B003EZHNOE|5|Fit like a charm, did the trick and fixed the problem
B00LATB2IE|5|Great product.  I will definitely purchase this brand again.  Super fast shipping.  Does exactly what is described.  Easy installation.
B000N9MV82|5|Used this upstream from my Garmin GFS10 Fuel Flow Sensor. Right price and quick Amazon shipping.
B00C5RB03W|5|Fit perfectly.
B004L1S9JS|5|nice
B002QGVW3K|5|Unbeatable price and works hreat
B00GQO5C9S|5|Good sturdy wheel chock.  Was a little smelly when sitting in the garage but that went away after about a week.  Worked real well on my garage floor with my trailer.  I woudl buy again or recommend
B00HJDI22E|1|2 sets of bulbs burnt out within 1 week of install. These are not ready for prime time. Save your money, go buy the standard LL (long life) bulbs and skip these LED bulbs.
B009BGLZRG|3|ok
B00CGTVCIC|3|Inexpensive,  provides good protection and easy to install. The inner edges of the cover do not meet and is uncomfortable to hold. I would not buy this again and may return this product. This does not have a professional look to it.
B00C59F51S|5|Looks great and easy to install.
B004G8XZJ0|5|hard to find, work great, heavy duty
B00BJN2C4O|5|Good
B006PJIAKW|4|so far so good have to see how its doing down the road (or should I say water)
B00XP533RO|1|Bad quality
B007J4FBZO|5|I absolutely LOVE this decal!! It is EXACTLY what I was looking for!! I am so impressed with what I received and the time I received it in! Definitely would recommend everybody to buy from this seller!! Phenomenal service, along with GORGEOUS DECAL!! LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!! ♥♥ xx
B00F2PQQI8|1|Increasing airflow while lowering the amount of fuel given will cause a lean fire condition.  In a supercharged engine like the Ion Redline, this is very very bad and can cause detonation which will result in holes being blown into your pistons.  Please explain to me how this product allows the intake to flow more air?  The only way to flow more air is to supercharge, turbo charge, create less restriction (then you lose velocity), or increase compression (which makes the engine more volumetrically efficient), or put a bigger throttle body on the car.  There is no way a chip can increase airflow.  What it can do is modify the fuel/timing table to provide more fuel, less fuel, higher rpms etc etc.  Now if you chip provided more fuel with a higher timing curve, then I would say that there would be some power gains especially on a forced induction engine.  However, in the case of the ION, these injectors are almost maxed out from the factory anyway and you will not see much gain.  Stop mis advertising your product.
B00Y98AP1S|1|Does not even come close to functioning on a 1993 ford ranger.
B001GG2ENI|5|Very cute and easy to put on. I stuck it on my laptop and it arrived sooner than expected.
B00NIOBC02|5|This cable was long enough to install the outlet in the rear of the cargo compartment of a 2001 Ford Expedition. I attached the ring connectors to a 12 volt point near the battery and a ground point on the firewall and ran it through a large passthrough in the firewall. I was then able to pass it under the door sills and run it behind the wall panel to the back where I installed the outlet. I flush mounted the outlet for a very low profile and unobtrusive installation. I am also considering installing a regular cigarette outlet and a Powerlet socket [[ASIN:B00LB4ACSO Powerlet PSO-001 Standard Socket]] next to it as there is plenty of room.<br /><br />The cable appears well made and I expect to last as long as my Expedition.
B005S5DDGK|5|Received quickly and was as described. Happy with my purchase.
B00KZD8ME8|2|Mines went bad after 3 weeks don't know why, tried using the back ups and still didn't work :/ i loved the product it was awesome and everyone was impressed. Give it a two because mines went bad after 3 weeks and it's 45$
B0010G9WMA|5|thank you for having such parts
B00VV7122G|5|works great
B00252BYUG|5|works great
B00SJTMFBG|1|I installed the kit and rode it easy through the break in. First day I started riding it a bit harder the piston cracked and S&S wouldn't even send me just one piston, I didn't even want a whole new kit. Since then Ive heard a lot of bikers say S&S doesn't stand behind their product and to buy another brand that does.
B001P00Z8G|5|Excellent
B0067O63SG|5|amazing quality amazing ride.
B00EGX15TC|5|Worked great on a 09 v6 ford escape.  I was getting p2119 error codes and it was past the warranty period.  Took like 5 minutes tops to change it out.
B00COOS3DG|5|Good!!!
B000GZTGE0|5|worked very well
B001O12MEQ|5|I thought rotors were sold in pairs. So when my order arrived, to my surprise,  only one came. So I had to order another one. Not a problem though. These are rotors are actually great. I would buy them again..
B00A2B748I|5|works amazingly well
B000PGVZ30|5|Camco's price and quality is second to none. I have multiple plugs made by them.
B009XP18F4|5|Warm, fuzzy, and functional. Several different ways to wear it, my primary is as a neckguard for scuba diving/ neck gaiter for Motorcycle riding. Great product
B00JPJYCII|5|A great value
B0091HEOXC|5|Received
B00A1UNT2A|5|Appearance: awesome and looks great Installation: very easy to remove to remove the stock air cleaner box on my 2014 street glide. You will have to remove the throttle support bracket on touring models, you two options. raise the fuel tank up for easy access to the two allen head machine screws securing the bracket or use a 3/16 angled (L-shaped) allen wrench. I opted to not raise the tank. It was a much more time consuming method turning the machine screws in a limited space in small increments but it was less painful than removing the tank and just required a little more patience. you will be left with a dangling wire bracket that clipped on the support bracket that will need securing, I haven't figured out where yet. its a knuckle buster and a little blood, bring an extra allen wrench, you will drop one behind the throttle body..lol  Performance: I was using a Vance Hines FP3 Tuner and Rush Big Louie Slip-ons (everything else is stock OEM) prior to the install of Arlen, NO remapping or auto tuning required with the FP3 set-up configuration. the exhaust note is a little more deeper and throttle response is better. I cant say I feel a horse power increase but I can say torque snap is greatly improved in lower rpm ranges and as well as, the 4k to 6k ranges, which is awesome for a large heavy touring bike. Large air volume intake with a large air volume exhaust managed by a good tuner has been a huge performance improvement over stock OEM. no regrets on my purchase of the Big Sucker, Arlen Ness.
B00G620ZVU|5|The best
B00KBF1PUI|3|Somtimes it looses connection in kwy switch
B008CF8TL2|4|Exactly what I need
B001KSE0Y8|5|Been on the car for over a year with no problems, can't tell its not factory.
B00M78820I|5|Great product & fast shipping  too!
B008SEBQ2G|2|Not very powerful
B00E1XZ20K|5|These are gorgeous. I love them in my truck. Worth the purchase. Yes, these are carpet material, but since most of it is black with just a strip of pink on the sides, you don't notice any dirt you attract from stepping on them. I have already cleaned mine and they turned out beautiful. I really love the look of these. The only thing I was unhappy about was that when I got them from the sender here on Amazon, the mats were stapled together with 2 big staples. The problem? Yes, you'll notice you have 2 holes all the way through on all of your mats. Not good but since the carpet is black it is hard to see.
B00UR6GQXM|3|As good as any of the others ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
B00029WSVI|5|Excellent
B00LWFMNY8|5|Daughter loved this to add to her red VW beetle!  Thanks!!!
B00REQ22KO|4|Haven't installed mine yet but very very nice quality! ;-)
B004MDEV38|5|I actually bought this trailer hitch for my father and it was the wrong model. They replaced it without any questions, even after the 30 days was up. It's a fantastic company. I actually bought the correct model after I returned this one and it was easy to install and works great!
B00AYEVRWW|5|Worked like a charm for my 2010 Chevy Cobalt! Changed it out and my check engine light is now off! I changed this one and the other one next to it. I'm not a big car person so I found out about this part while watching YouTube videos. Code P0013 is the code that kept on popping up. No problems since changing this. Day 2 now!
B00DNX93CW|5|Not bad for the price. A decent bag for the rider on a budget.
B00FR2JF0W|3|Small tear in one of the outlet covers when I received product.  Used super glue to repair.  Covers are very cheaply made and I don't have much faith in their durability.  Unless you pay extra for upgraded shipping , standard shipping is very slow.
B000A09MGI|4|appears to work as designed. I did have a fitment issue with the first one but it was replaced and the replacement fit great.
B00QFY2BCK|3|it really works only for a week, after that it was blurry again, basically you get what you pay for.. :(
B0015PPZMC|5|My stock lenses were really frosted and the bulbs were dim making it hard to see at night.  When one bulb went out I bought these instead of just buying new bulbs.  WHAT A DIFFERENCE!  Mounting was easy and aiming wasn't hard to do, but a little tough to get it right since I don't have a flat driveway, but that has nothing to do with the product.  And I like that these are clear lenses instead of like the stock ones.  I highly recommend these light housings!
B00OJDZ5EU|1|XXL is more like a small, very poor quality shirt, did not know it was coming from China till the order was place.  KTM should take a look at who is using the brand name.<br />Returned the shirt.
B001N2O3PM|4|nice metal frame
B00X90IMN0|1|Received with manufacture mold marks and color variations. Cheap.
B00CVVUQ50|1|The look is very nice and its would be a good product if they would stay in. I have lost all but 1 of them in a few days. Don't waste your money.
B003RQBKLC|5|Good
B002VVNXCI|5|I ride a 2013 Road King. This year I had the stage 1 upgrade, had the cat removed, and then did a dyno tune with my new V & H . The engine runs strong with a lot less heat. I love the sound of these pipes, not too loud, but a nice growl, and when I wind it out in 4th gear, hold on. Almost gave 4 stars just because the inner &#34;slash&#34; spacing is not the same on both pipes. There is a little bolt on the underside, I'll try loosening it to see I can move it a bit.<br />Rick, Montreal
B0033XYBC4|5|Works great
B000C9TAR8|4|Good quality for a nice price. These are a bit hard to find locally so I got these. As they should be, proper size, a good filtering material (looks like) but one small thing: There should be two plastic &#34;shims&#34; (for lack of a better term) to hold the filter tight to the housing preventing unfiltered air to bypass the filter. I simply detached the glued on old ones from the old filter and used those, so no big deal but it would be nice if they were there. I expect more from a good company like Wix.
B009B05PAA|4|I'm sure a great tool but this is for use with a welder.
B00FFHY2RK|5|Item delivered on time, was as described
B00FPL00FY|4|it fits what more can I say
B007IIXFUY|5|These are just like the Morosso mounts to the tee very happy with them Thanks SRP Racing
B004MDT8MW|5|good
B00EKEGRVS|5|did what i needed it to
B00SWGPT0A|4|This is a very well made and designed product. I tested the water fastness, water roll off the slightly fuzzy cover material. It has the softer white felt material inside that protects my vehicle paint job. No complains on the product; in fact for the price I felt it was appropriately high quality. I have not yet test this for its longetivity under the sun but will update my review after a longer use. My only downside for this product experience  was the recommended size M that I purchase did not fit my E89 BMW Z4, per suggestion on the manufacturer's fit and size recommendation page. The length is slightly less than the 170&#34; measurement. Even though my car spec says it is 167&#34; long, it is best to go with a slightly larger size. It covers the width of the car well but is about 8&#34; short of fully covering my Z4 end to end. I would suggest the manufacturer publish clearer Length, Width, Height specifications to aid buyers assess their true vehicle fitment. I will be getting another Leader Accessories cover as I am happy with the material quality.
B00W3EHXRO|5|I purchased a set of these dragons as well a some additional motifs years ago. They are truly beautiful and the quality is outstanding.<br /><br />Once applied they will not come off without a fight - in my case this was fine as I meant to permanently attach them. They'll attach to any smooth surface and a nice decorative touch to windows, mirrors, cars, fridges, folders - you name it.<br /><br />They have a nice shine and reflectiveness to them. The cut is very precise/detailed.<br />I'm in the process of buying additional stickers.
B008PPGAEM|1|Bonnet's color comes off on the vehicle.
B00RW3QV0Q|5|great product - would buy from this seller again- got them in less than one week . not flimsy at all and they stay put so you don't have to keep adjusting them like other mirrors i have had . came with all bolts needed to put them on about any bike. took less than five minutes to put on and i had no issues with the bolts like others have said
B0001EW4DG|1|I have used ventvisors by various makers for many years. Some were not very durable and cracked or broke after a year or two. I paid the premium for the Auto VentShade brand because I thought the quality would be superior, but was disappointed. Some of the pieces were scuffed or scratched to the degree that I was unable to buff out the defects. On other pieces, the plastic edges were conspicuously rough and jagged, and ragged tape was showing beyond the edge of the plastic (see photos). I made the mistake of installing these on my new car but, due to the shoddy workmanship, I'm not at all pleased with the appearance and will probably remove them. Really!!! Four pieces of plastic for $50 and this was the best they could do?
B000JZYSU4|5|Great product
B00J2CI5EU|5|Look cool. But are just blue leds not the best for a replacement if your looking for a lot of light. Don't expect it to look anything like an HID bulb like the pictures. It's just neon blue
B000BGM2XG|5|Works  excellently as a faucet for the camper-style sink we installed in the living quarters of our horse trailer. Installation was straightforward and not difficult. Very easy to use and sturdily constructed. Not bad looking, either.  Also was considerably less expensive than comparable faucets available from RV suppliers in my area.
B002MQKTQ0|5|Product as described and easy to install.  I was even able to use the painted panel from my old mirror on the new one to get a match without trying to match paint.
B003BYPV8S|4|A little bit smaller than original so had to cover up existing holes on one side, but works great for a replacement.
B000CLYV7U|5|Perfect packaging was good, product is as described. I want to add we have had these for 2 years now, they have held up to being outside in a salty environment good quality.
B002UPKEQ8|5|Works great. I have been using this product for a couple of months on 4 of my cars. Living in California, drought, I can use this product to was my vehicles anytime.  Leaves a nice wax behind.
B00NJ9MZH0|5|great light, really bright. has the one year warranty, I bought the cree brand and only lasted four months, paid 30.00 for them to only be able to use them for four months
B00JA3BMDW|5|does what it says and extremely fun to use!
B00J2VULQ6|5|Strongly recommend and endorse this product.  Small quantity does go a long way.  This product has a low odor, but must be removed promptly if it accidently gets on your skin (one dried it takes several days to remove w/o scrubbing skin).  Have purchased this product and this size and larger in the past and would always recommend to anyone with resulting or wishing to protect anything exposed to harsh salts and weathering.
B00R3GQNRI|5|worked fine
B000221H08|5|Easy to apply to a convertible top.  More like a silicone and if you get it on the paint it just wipes off easily without a mess.  Really beads the water.
B00MK563W2|5|Shipped quickly.  Quality is great!  Looks great on my Ram!
B000WJF4HS|5|Can't beat it for the price, granted it's not pretty chrome, but it works and at $120 cheaper a no brainer purchase!
B0050M32MG|5|Very complimentary on my lady. Sturdy protection with great looks.
B00ZD31WVA|5|These mitts are handy if your like me and usually use a rag to wash your car. These mitts make it easy to apply soapy water to your car. They soak up a lot of water so you don't have to keep dipping your hands over and over. I will say that they seem to run just a bit small. If your a man with slightly larger sized hands these probably won't fit you. I haven't had a chance to wash them yet so I don't know how well they will hold up in the washer but they seem to be made of decent quality materials. You could use these for dust mitts too which I love! Overall I'm really happy with the product. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for a fair and honest review.
B00KWLM2YE|5|This throttle cable worked awesome it fits really good thanks so much! This is what I needed to fix my broken throttle cable for my dirtbike thank you!!!
B004BTOTZ8|3|Will not work on Honda Odyssey 3.5 L EXL and touring models.  These models have the electrical connector release pin on the front of the connector.
B004AG6KMC|5|I've known about BOSCH quality for some time - since owning a Volkswagen back in the 80's - so I had no hesitation with making this purchase. I have a FJ CRUISER w/ 123K miles and I figured it best to be proactive vs. reactive and moving forward with replacing my original rotors & pads. Easy install and excellent performance afterwards. Found that my factory rotors had practically no wear to them so I kept them (high 5 for Toyota quality!) but I will of course see how these hold up compared to the OEM and at 200K + miles will make a decision about which is best. All that being said, if you get these rotors you won't likely be disappointed.
B00IGCW9V2|4|Save me lots of money to go to dealer. recommend the product.
B00TEA11O6|4|Built well, covers more than other skid plates (mostly the exhaust loop area). I was unable to get this to fit my 2015 wrangler, but i am pretty convinced that was my error. I could not follow the instructions well enough to install this, so i had to return this item.
B004QJLEOM|4|every good tool, it is realy needed to replace the fuel filter
B00RM327NG|1|Does not hold the phone magnet not strong enough
B00171Q3HU|5|Fit perfectly in my sons 1999 Chevy Silverado. Priced right.
B008ZCEBGY|1|wrong partd
B000YQQZCW|5|Seems to work pretty good, not exactly sure on accuracy as I have only used it once and it was right where I thought it would be.
B004D5LB10|5|Excellent.  Would have purchased in the auto store, but they did not carry this exact model.  Arrived in great condition.  Brand new.  O-rings were included.
B00J09FREQ|5|perfect replacement for damaged cover on dash
B00GLLW3AM|4|Works great, small and seems like they are built well. 4 stars because they aren't as bright as they make them sound but work well for reverse lights on my travel trailer.
B004YTOJ4G|5|Great product. Thinking about purchasing another pair.
B00GK6OCK2|5|She loved it
B000O3K2OW|5|I was having trouble with my tail lights staying on. Wasn't sure what was going on until I did a little research.<br />This brake light switch fits the '95 Ram 1500. Goes in behind the brake pedal. Out of my league, so I took it<br />the shop. 30 bucks to install.<br />I'm back to saving my battery's power.
B00RDJE516|5|Looks cool on my rifle case. Sticks well.
B00HBHCA8U|5|Looks good on my car :)
B00V8YPTX0|5|We love the cushions. They have worked very well for my husband.
B0002SR7TM|4|I always try to avoid buying Chinese &#34;cheap&#34; junk, spending a little more, to buy USA made. In this case, not much better than the off shore junk.  The instructions were horrible, other than the EXPLICIT insert to NOT use a powered screw driver. I did use a hand-turned  Phillips driver to mount the wheels.  My biggest concern is that the included plastic cap, for the drain hole doesn't even come close to matching the threads. Sealing the container to transport for recycling is extremely important. I expect this type of non-matching issue from over seas stuff, but NOT from USA made.  I've not used this unit yet so my evaluation is in the &#34;out of the box&#34; context. However, much worse than buying over-seas crap, is spending a little more money for the same quality. Make it right Lisle
B0009IQWO6|5|Great product
B000E4U18I|2|Power didn't work after I had it painted and out on....ugh.....thanks alot
B01173KISW|1|Don't like it.
B00757KJTI|3|looks nice. radio reception not good.
B00HZBC03M|1|Did not arrive on time as promised (arrived 20 days after order placed). Product does not appear as described on &#34;high quality vinyl&#34; - it is just a large sticker. Disappointed in product.
B00C5RN0VM|4|It does what it is supposed to do.
B003R8GXTO|5|i have a 2015 ford flex.  the part number is for a 2014.  fits great.  like the look and feel better than the two other major manufactures.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|More than enough products to take care of your car.  Not enough towels so I purchased additional terry cloths.
B00EZ9Y33W|5|All you need for the led bar installation. Very good product.
B00B5HKM6Y|4|very useful. my husband likes it. it works easily and is easy to use. my husband used it to pump his fishing float. he likes it and said it works for what he needs it for. I received this product for free for review purposes, all opinions are our own unbiased thoughts and opinions.
B003BMCL4M|4|I bought this battery box for a small speed boat.  I was drawn to the dual auxiliary (cigarette lighter) power outlets.  We plan on using this to power a 12V air pump to blow up towables.  I made a video review of this smart box showing some its features.<br /><br />You can view it here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBa8iG8riDo<br /><br />Neat LED power meter and I love the external rubberized wingnuts allowing the terminals to be recharged with my trickle charger without opening the case.
B006IPTOWQ|1|These died very quick, don't waste your money them. The regular less powered bulbs are equally bright and last much longer.
B007GH3ZGQ|5|Perfect
B01092ICIA|4|These seat covers fit my moms Subaru really well. She especially likes the back seat covers because it has a zipper and gives the seats a snug fit. I definitely recommend these seat covers.
B006BCRNYM|5|Amazing....shipping was fas ,and product was excellent. I got one for my 2004 g35 and it took me less than 2min to activate...works great. Best money I've spent all year. I can't wait to buy more and tell all my friends. Thanks!
B000NJ39CY|5|Just like orginal easy to install
B001DDCPB0|5|These are a great value.
B00E1SR42Y|5|Worked out great everything fit just wright  I'll keep buying my parts from AMAZON  Thank You Amazon
B007S0LDME|5|My trailer tank was starting to have a slight smell....put these in and VIOLA cleared up!
B0059JGTQG|5|Perfect fit for my 13 Chrysler 300...
B003SYHVVQ|5|Exact fit to my 1999 Pathfinder, it came on time, and it came with a bulb already installed!
B00480FIEG|4|Very bright
B0049MKQD6|5|I would pay more for this item. Not only is it above quality standards it showed up earlier than expected
B00NWGZ3A6|1|You get what you pay for, I guess.  I should have paid more.
B00PC0G07A|5|my error I thought i was getting a steering wheel cover instead i got two needles, some thread and a piece of material.  I cannot do anything like that too old so I tossed it and learned my lesson read and look at pictures i don't give this any stars
B000F7VKD4|5|Best leather cleaner and conditioner product on the market!
B0068FZ22C|5|This helmet is DOT and Snell approved. Materials used are adequate and build quality is strong. At this price it's a steal. I find this model to hold up better then the Sparx S-07. The drop down visor works well but does not block wind, and the white paint shows nice little sparkles, but is not sparkly. I agree with another reviewer to order one size up. At least if you wear ordinarily wear an XL. I wear an XL in other helmet brands and models, but the Sparx Tracker XL is too small for my head. However the XXL fits perfectly and snug once broken in. I own three of these helmets and a fourth may be ordered soon. 5 Stars at this price and 4 Stars otherwise.
B00SCKAUNC|4|Nice lights , but anchor bolt threads are a little weak, work loose after riding for awhile
B001F0O19U|5|On time and matched advertised
B00AECPU18|3|not oem
B00HRSTRAW|3|Install was easy no tools are needed for the map lights. The fitment is very tight bit of a struggle to put in the led bulbs.  The brightness is much better great upgrade.
B004TDMVA6|5|The items that arrived is as described.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Very Bright!
B00GRY31KY|4|Good quality seal and has new clips. It fit well.
B00312727S|5|This is a good product. The delivery was fast and the quality of the flag mount was amazing.
B00VDQNELW|5|Fits very well over center console in my Jeep Wrangler. I purchased this to avoid getting claw marks from my dog. It's soft for leaning my elbow on and from what I can tell, it will in fact prevent claw marks.
B0041CDPQO|5|good and fast
B009HL704W|1|Not very happy right now. This was supposed to be the correct belt, shipping was very expensive for two rubber belts that could have been put in an envelope. Then, when the belts are not the right ones, the shipping back is another $7 off the refund. So, I just lost $20 for belts that were supposed to fit and did not.
B000GZLQNO|5|These worked well for the outer right side of the 200o year Big Bear 400.
B0094FYSBO|1|One already had chipped paint before they were opened. Not too sure if I'll even use them
B0023VKPZ4|4|They fit and look just like the originals, for a fraction of the price. They even come with new bulbs. I just wish I had replaced both headlights at the same time, because now one side looks a lot newer and cleaner than the other.
B00S0F25BO|5|Great item; great price; super-fast shipping!  Worked as advertised for my 2014 Chevy Silverado 1500 WT.  This is definitely OE and my Chevy dealer thought I ordered it from them.  Took them less than 15 minutes and $17 to program.
B00VZ9EUOC|5|Perfect!
B00VJUN5ZM|5|Bright, high visibility lights. Fit the holes in my new step fenders perfectly.
B00CS8OX8W|5|I can now tell which car is mine in a crowded parking lot.
B004AHQ4J0|5|Wow, completely exceeded expectations, it actually included 2 filters and great quality!
B00T7L0DKK|5|this little light is blinding super bright and waterproof
B00CO8UENY|5|Works fine.
B007AOQORC|4|Great Product. Very Nice!<br />Could fit better.
B0002SRCYW|5|A must have tool for a Ford owner doing his own repairs. Simple tool that does the job. I may only need to use two or three times, but when I do, nothing else will work as good.
B00E16LTTK|5|My first impression was that this is just what I need to add the extra boost to the 6 volt starting system for my Lincoln.  Just the added revolution speed is all that is needed to successfully  start my car.  I am extremely pleased as to the outcome of the whole set-up.  I highly recommend this to anyone who has a 6 volt car.  CJG
B0002SR4Q8|5|good quality A+++
B004RLVZFC|5|easy to install vehicle protection
B00M5YC7Q4|5|nice switch easy to read wiring diagram and the backlight feature is nice, when powered up the &#34;LED lightbar&#34; is illuminated and when you turn on the light the &#34;lightbar&#34; is illuminated so you can tell the light is on, plus the backlighting is not very bright so it doesn't interfere with yourvision at night.
B000VS8DZU|5|this stuff is amazing.  It will both fill a small hole and act as a glue for a patch
B001COAL20|5|After waking one day to find that my 2003 BMW M3 suddenly had misfire issues, a little diagnostic work (read OBDII codes, swap ignition coils, clear then reread codes to see if trouble follows) I decided that I needed one new coil. Decided to get all 6 and these had good reviews. Changed out the OEM NGK spark plugs, put in these new coils on and my baby is a screaming banshee again.
B0059HJZO6|4|is an ok product
B008AYLO0S|3|I like them alot, and customer service was very helpful, however I would strongly recommend getting the ccfl lights. The halos on these are just extremely dull, and be ready to invest in HIDS!
B00IUE5S5U|3|Seems to clean well but it has a cheap leather/vinyl type of smell. Imagine a  &#34;cheap leather&#34; coat rack at Big Lots. That&#34;s the smell. Probably going to return it because of this. Only Griot's product that has disappointed me. They need to work on this in my opinion.
B00EFDAH1K|5|It works for me.
B00V30J86I|4|Small but it holds box of CDs from the library that I'm always trying to stash when someone gets in the car. Pretty easy to install. Looks okay. Can't put stuff in and remove while driving. Not big enough for a pocket book.
B00A740VQM|1|Product not as described in picture.  Does not include flexible shaft.
B003U1NQOS|5|Compliments start with a giggle, then 'I like it' & often a picture taken.
B000C2AI5I|5|Good Quality Fel-Pro Gasket set. Cheapest price going here on Amazon. All gaskets are as expected and included. The new 78 SE Trans Am is coming along.
B00UY2COP8|1|I read a lot of reviews before purchasing, and it appears this product works for a lot of people.  However, I'm not one of them.  I had two major problems:  1. The light would never shut off.  It's supposed to only come on when the motion detector is activated, but this one would shut off after 15-20 seconds, then come right back on.  Not a huge deal, but annoying.  2. The main reason I returned the product is because I couldn't see the lasers in the daytime (nor could my wife).  In fact one day she thought she was in far enough, but unfortunately she wasn't, and the garage door clipped the back of the Camry.  Estimated repairs at $500.
B010LEVC1A|5|Fits perfect. Keeps my tongue jack out of the blistering az sun.
B002KR1OEC|5|Easy to install, fit perfectly.
B00S8OJK92|1|Very cheap plastic definitely not worth $15. Very disappointed by the quality.
B0032J1KAK|1|Junk! I will not be using them. They are super cheap plastic. Straight out of the package they are completely fogged up and scratched and unusable. I am now looking for real glass.
B00062Z2W8|1|WFTis this o_O? not a steering wheel
B0006SU3QW|5|I am Happy!
B0008G1OII|4|Perfect. Awesome chrome look.
B00BYRNZNW|4|Mercedes 2005 C230 Kompressor owners: Amazon's &#34;yes this fits your vehicle&#34; is not true if you have the standard model.  It is ONLY true if you have the sport package.  At least the front ones fit and they are good so far.
B00842A7F4|5|Just used a couple of these on 2005 Acura RL plastic cover over top front of engine area today.  They fit perfectly.  And, later they were very easy to remove and reinstall.  Best plastic clips I've used, and I've used around 10 types before.
B0068ERNNE|5|This suit is WAY better than the Dowco Guardian suit I previously purchased from Amazon.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Battery arrived faster than anticipated, which was great, because low battery chirp was annoying on the home alarm. Fit my older brinks system and install was very easy. Had to use the enclosed clips to make a good fit, so I was glad they were included with battery. Low battery indicator did stay initially on alarm but within a few hours it was charged enough to make chirping stop.
B000CODGYQ|5|Works great for a straight pull with a 9,500 lb. Warn winch. 10,000 lb working load, the webbing is rated for 30,000 lb. The loops are adequate for a clevis ring to fit through easily, that's nice too.
B0001EWQYS|5|Very good it fix my sienna 2002, I love it
B003G0Q5MI|5|Great cargo mat. Highly recommend if you want to protect and keep the cargo carpet clean.
B000GKB0FI|5|Great quality and very nostalgic
B004H4ALIQ|1|Only lasted a month, no way to switch the power unit cause the serial number is on it and must be same as invoice. The only thing I've been checked on return, so they must fail every time!<br />I would give a negative 5 stars- getting a Coleman, parts available,...
B00T36HLYU|5|Great, easy fit. Does not move or vibrate
B006A50NX8|2|The fitment on these things are absolutely horrible! It's like they just eyeballed a 3-series handle from pictures on the internet and never really looked at one. The chrome cover overlaps the handle in the wrong direction, so when you pull on it the handle stays open. This requires trimming of the bottom cover just to get the handles to close again. The piece that goes over the lock or dummy cover on the other doors doesn't fit properly either. I really cant get over how poor the fitment actually is, even the &#34;break&#34; between the two pieces on each handle is going the wrong way! The only reason I got these was because I had to replace a door handle and couldn't find one in the same color as my car. They look good from a distance, be when you look at them up close they just scream cheap chinese stick-on garbage.<br /><br />We'll see how they last in a northern New England winter!
B000BRFQKQ|5|There great for replacements
B00FMBCIZW|3|Very hard to make stick but the picture itself is so cute I couldn't rate it too low
B007Q7SUXE|4|The u bolts supplied are slightly to small, you either have to bend them a little,  or use the oe bracket and u bolts, other than that it made a world of difference
B0076QWIXI|4|Surprised how well the holes lined up, easy 6 bolt install. works fine.
B000CB42EM|5|This fixed the sloppy steering response on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.
B000CCMMOI|5|my 4runner has 135k miles and runs great with this.
B000C1Q6MS|5|Great pads. Good stopping power, low wear, gentle on rotors and clean wheels. Ticks all the b
B00IZYRLEQ|5|It works, and was delivered quickly.
B007Y5F7UM|5|Fit perfectly. .... must have if you love your car.. it's well built and seems that it will last a long time...
B002OUMVWY|1|Crumbles like paper after 8 months of use… what a waste of money. Poor quality. Hoping for a replacement at least.
B0018JVEEI|4|Great spark plug and the gap was correct for factory specs.
B00EMJMTGI|4|Great lights, lots of wire. The instructions were a little hard to understand and the switch button had malfunctioned on me. All in all, great quality lights
B000C02E8O|5|Used this for a 2009 Polaris Sportsman 850.  It was vaporlocking at altitude before this pump.  Now no problems.  Not even a sputter.  Not a direct fit, but really easy to install. No cutting.
B00AN5RC9O|5|Nice
B00009AOCF|5|Thank you
B002M1PLKE|3|As alot of reviews stated, the fuel level was a bit wonky after installed, i dont know if it was getting any better as i blew the trucks motor 3 days after install.
B00SXJKZDW|5|Awesome product and very fast shipping
B002OKGZ9E|5|The price is great once you factor in free two-day shipping with Prime.<br /><br />As far as the RBF600 fluid itself - great fluid, handles track abuse and doesn't boil. Just remember to change more frequently than regular, cheap DOT 4 fluid.
B00IRWFQUW|1|These things does not look like the picture they look like absolute junk
B007HOWUF0|5|Puchased Mann cabin air filter from Amazon. Good quality filter and highly recommend it. Delivery time sooner than I had expected which was a plus.
B007CJ6MGI|5|Worked like a champ and a lot cheaper than the auto stores around town.  I think this is my 4th window regulator to replace and have got it down to about an hour of work.  Pretty easy for slightly mechanically inclined individuals.<br />I woudl recommend buying some of these little plastic washer/grommet for holding the actual window onto this regulator.  They always break when swapping and it wont go back on right without them.  Sorry i can remember what they are called but they basically protect the window from the screw that holds the window to the flat metal part of the regulator.
B004QPI15Q|5|I think this is a great boot! It is really well constructed and the BOA lacing system is well implemented and very convenient. I really love the boot. I've only had them a few months so I can't yet comment on long-term quality but they seem great.<br /><br />My only problem with them...which is my own fault...is that I have a cruiser and these don't work particularly well with a cruiser. The seating position on most cruisers simply doesn't lend itself to wearing such high, stiff boots. But if you want good protection you sort of have to go with a touring/sport style boot. This is a problem with the cruiser culture as a whole...they tend to not take safety too seriously in my experience. Boots for cruisers tend to be low-cut, or high-cut but ONLY leather with no actual protection.<br /><br />Anyway, these boots are comfortable, appear to afford a great deal of protection, and are well built. I highly recommend them.
B00VR6ZX9Y|5|I bought these license plate frames because I don't get paid from the dealer to advertise their business. Simple, sturdy, great-looking frames. They're subtle and perfectly matches my black Prius. I definitely won't have to worry about my plates being bent from wind with these installed. I would definitely recommend this product.
B009W997X6|5|This is a heck of a product.  I bought it not for my motorcycle so I cant address its usefulness in that regard. I needed to install dual ovens to replace my old ones.  The ovens weigh 325 lbs and needed to be picked up a foot or so to fit in the cabinet.  Worked like a charm and saved me a $375 installation charge quoted by a Lowes installer.  Heavy construction.  Can't believe they can build it for that price.  Ran the lift up with my 18 volt Dewalt screw gun and it worked fine even with a heavy dual oven on it.  Someday I;; try it on my motorcycle.
B00192JGY4|4|Worked beautifully for me. I did read other reviews and as suggested I swapped out my tank when the pointer went into the yellow section.
B00QQZN7WG|3|looks good but funny fit
B002E5HMSC|5|Works as advertized. Keeps air clean.
B00IXQS4QA|5|Time-Sert makes the best thread repair systems money can buy. Done per their instructions the repair is stronger than the original hole. *20+ year ASE certified Master Auto Tech*
B000WJX4BQ|5|Got the battery for my V Star 1100, fit was fine even if it is slightly wider than the stock one it replaced.  Set up was pretty easy, just fill it and charge.
B0043063JU|3|This was nice for the price I guess, but you get what you pay for. After less than a year on my back porch, the rug fibers are coming apart everywhere and it is getting carried in my house. Had to throw this out.
B005FKSK7A|5|Fast delivery, great fit, definitely more stopping power.  Great looking too.
B00265FWIC|5|GREAT price!!! Works wonderfully.
B001BFTRWK|5|Perfect fit! Would definitely buy again! I would recommend it to anyone.
B005DOQYNU|3|Not as bright as I thought it would be.
B006PJSOO4|5|thanks
B00WID0OEE|5|This thing works great and shipping with spare blades is a plus.  We've had ours for probably 6 months now and the original blade still has a nice edge on it.
B000VWQ3QW|5|easy to install and looks well made
B0077FI1X4|4|Some shipping damage but other wise it works as it should.
B000GZV8FK|5|Good deal the only thing was that it didn't came with the liquid but I went to a yamaha dealer store n they fill it up for 5 dllrs but other than that it was a great deal n it's the original brand that yamaha use.
B000X20CHQ|5|Fits perfectly and is great quality for the price!
B001RYJOEG|5|Awesome quality.
B000CMKE8O|5|These mats are bulletproof. I have had sets of these in every vehicle since the Eisenhouer administration, and will continue to own them until Donald Trump gets elected. (Not really.)<br />In all serousness, though - they are realy well made, fit really nicely, and are terrific at acting as a barrier for all of the mud, sand, grime, and gunk that would otherwise get into your carpets in the car - really good stuff! Just pull them out, hose them off, let them dry, and slipo them back in. They look great, function like a champ, and are VERY durable!
