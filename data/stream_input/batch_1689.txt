B003VS0CX8|5.0|A Great classic got it for my 8 year old daughter who is playing the songs from the movie on her piano.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|El envio llegó a tiempo y en menos de 3 semanas, bien protegido y el booklet inmaculado. Imagen y sonido como nunca antes habia experimentado con alguna de las peliculas de esta saga. Por $29.99 es compra obligada si eres fan de la serie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was well worth the reading!  Both women and men can learn something from reading this book!!!  For me, it was really about unconditional love.  Loved it!
B0019NB9A2|4.0|overall the movie was good, I thought this version would have had the interviews with the actors still alive concerning the movie
B000SXOK0A|5.0|Nobody mentioned Scatterbrain. It is a harrowing piece, Thom Yorke is wailing, giving voice to the the disillusioned and resigned.It is an eerie calm that surrounds us, we are in the eye of the storm. The effect of his voice and the guitar is anguishing, it is just so beautiful and sad. This is way past 1984, the machine won, everybody is scatterbrain! And if you are the last one \\"Somewhere I'm not\\", there is nothing you can do.<br />I don't understand how people classify Radiohead, this is the best album, this is second, etc.<br />How do you classify masterpieces? Is Beethoven's 5th better than the 9th? Or Guernica better than The Old Guitarist?<br />I can't do that. kid A, In Rainbows, this, Amneziac, how can I pick, why would I?<br />I' m just going to mention the other masterpiece of the album in my opinion, Where I End and You Begin - there is nothing like it- bone chilling, fast, tense, with some amazing guitar strokes, it is one of my all time favorites.<br />How can you define an album that contains these two pieces?<br />This is an album about the war in Iraq. The allusions are clear but the music withstands the historical limitations, this becomes an album about any war and alienation. Yes, The Final Cut comes to mind but the music in this one is so much more complex, diverse and intriguing ( in a word: beautiful!) that it will sure lure in more than this generation.

B00902MCVY|5.0|It has been a long wait for this release but to fans of Wintersun, it is well worth it! I have already heard the album as it is nothing less than a musical masterpiece, and quite frankly may be the best metal album of all \\"TIME!\\" My actual copy is in the mail and when it arrives I will save the album for autographs when they come in December on tour. Like I said, may be the best album of all time...MUST OWN!!!!

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Call of Atlantis is a very fun game. The one thing I don't like about it is the fact that you do the same thing over and over again.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|I love this app! Perfect for taking and organizing lecture notes, making to-do lists and even just doodling with a stylus. Good stuff!
B0053TMP24|5.0|AWESOME BOOK RIORDAN!!!!!!!!!:-) I loved the Son of Neptune. It is one of the best books in the Heros of Olympus series.<br />  The Son of Neptune is mainly about three people, Frank Zhang, Hazel Levesque, and of course the one and only Perseus (or Percy, which ever one you prefer) Jackson. They gone on this quest to defeat a giant named Alcyoneus, free Thanatos god of keeping people in the Underwood, and save Camp Jupiter from another giant called Polybotes, all in one week. Not something you do every week, eh?<br />  This book is funny, shocking, and I am sure that you, just like me, will be unable to put it down!<br /><br />  Lotte LeBlanc
B002BI6SMI|5.0|The movie was very well acted. It kept you in suspense most all of the way through. Liam Neeson played one of his best roles.
B008TMA1LY|3.0|I got on lvl10 and I completely redecorated my room, and the next day everything was gone, and my money was too.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|Avengers continues in the genre of comic book super heroes adapted to the big and small screen.  Lots of action and special effects without much of a plot aside from Good versus<br />Evil.
1451626657|1.0|Wow.  I just made it through the first three chapters without<br />tossing it out the window, which I really wanted to do.<br />I kept reading, hoping I would eventually \\"get it\\".<br />All I got was Highly disappointed.<br />The writing is repetitive, confusing, and has no substantial point.<br />What is all the hype about? I feel like the little kid in the<br />Emperor's New Clothes story...
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I can't add much more than what has been said here and all over the internet.<br />I will get the Prometheus part out of the way and go from there.<br />Watch it-make up your own mind, its not the worst way to spend a couple of hours.<br />It is totally dysfunctional-TOTALLY.  I am a huge fan of Alien and Aliens-I refuse to acknowledge the existence of the mess that followed. Once a story goes beyond it's first initial shot, it rapidly tilts more towards the let's make every last cent before we sink this mutha!<br />I didn't see it in 3D or at the theater so I was left with what used to be called a movie.  I did watch is on Blu-ray so there was that.<br />So here is my brief maybe you will read rant, whereby I imagine it making a difference in a galaxy far far away ;)<br />I will preface it with, I LOVE sci-fi.  I love what CG can do for a film...I actually kind of like the fact that there was part in the film where he could have went CG but used practical(you have to see the deleted/extended scenes).  I think what made a lot of the earlier works of these great directors of the late 70's and early-mid 80s was hunger.  They had to work hard with limited and often reducing budgets and resources(until they made a blockbuster then you got either an amazing next film, or ewoks-ok too easy;) so story and practical effects were required or in the great tradition of cinema, sparse or dark filmography....leaving much to the imagination...who knew WE were actually the best at making these movies ;)<br />Our brains can smell CG a mile away, although we are getting numb to it so our brains are caring less.  The thing about practical models and effects is you can't fake real...and our brain gets that.  So why doesn't Hollywood?<br />My fear is that all the good practical guys are slipping away and their trade is dying to CG..I LOVE CG it can do amazing things.  I get that more and more the technology and skills required has come way down(anyone ever watch a show on SCI-fi channel-yeah I know they DUMBED down the name for us...yup fans of SCI-FI...meh.<br />Please give the money to a thousand smaller less known film makers who are hungry than 1 director who is easy money.(they all make the same movie-WOW where would that go...)  Whatever the results probably would be great cinema, but not profitable, which is why we have Prometheus and the many other sequels that we as sci-fi fans convince ourselves to see and then punch ourselves in the face for being so gullible, or hopeful, or whatever we need to sleep at night...
B0098VYCCE|3.0|Like others, I wanted to like this movie; however.... I like a twist on a known tale, and I was happy with the premise.  The cinematography was good and the darkness appropriate, lending the movie a good grittiness. What really killed the movie for me was the acting. Kristen Stewart was Kristen Stewart - it didn't really add anything, but wasn't wholly distracting either. However, if you've seen any of the Twilight movies, it is exactly the same - same expressions, same delivery, except with a par English accent. Perhaps this isn't entirely her fault, as the character is similar - a girl finds herself a target and is helped by anyone and everyone to stay alive. I wish my thoughts of Charlize Theron's performance were as positive. I don't  dislike her, and think she's done well in some of her movies - though not this one. It was as if she had substantial problems with her English accent, so decided to speak. very. slowly. to. compensate. Perhaps it was meant to be more dramatic, but I found completely distracting. The men's acting saved this movie for me: Chris Hemsworth was good, and the cast of dwarves was outstanding: Bob Hoskins, Ray Winstone, Ian McShane, etc.  And it's a shame we didn't see more of Willam (Sam Claflin).<br /><br />The other niggle I had with this movie was the lack of originality in some parts. For me, the entire sequence of the group going to meet the duke was entirely too similar to the Lord of the Rings, down to the a cappella song accompanying the group walking along a cliff. Perhaps this was hard to avoid, considering the group was of similar size and make-up, but I think more effort could have been made to give it its own character - especially since they are looking to expand on this franchise.<br /><br />Again, I didn't hate this movie, but I far from loved it. I didn't think I went in with many expectations -- I was hoping to really enjoy it. Unfortunately, that was not the case.
B002H0C2T8|5.0|Cry-Baby is one of the best John Waters films and even though it was intended to parody Grease I think it's even better... Great cast, songs, costumes and action.  Plus Iggy Pop is in it, 'nuff said.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Definitely among my top 5 superhero movies along with Batman begins/dark knight.  A must see if you're a marvel fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Sometimes, trying to find how to connect the dots with pipes is not as easy as it seems.  There were a couple of times where I had to replay because I did not go through all of the squares.  Sometimes the \\"short cut\\" is not the way to go.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was a great movie! I stayed interested throughout the whole film. It has been a while since I bought a movie because I usually rent them once then wait until they show up on TV. But this is one movie that I had to own so I can watch whenever I want. Two thumbs up!
B005FPT51K|1.0|Actually I had very high expectations from AMAZON, and I really thought they take care of the products ordered. I ordered 4 IBABY cameras, they arrived on time, but when I set them up, what a surprise!!! three out of four cameras did not work!!!!!<br />It is very sad, I had the impression that a company like AMAZON.com would check and verify that the products they sale as new actually work.........<br />so, in summary.....bad experience......so, now you know, buy it at your own risk......
B004EPZ02A|4.0|(Possible Spoilers)<br /><br />So after the first one showed what happened to an adult Katie, then the second showed what happened to her sister Kristi and also Katie after the first movie. This third installment takes place in 1988, where Katie and Kristi are 8 and 5 respectively and after moving into a new home begin to experience strange happenings. Kristi in particular as she talks to a being named \\"Toby\\" who seems to want her to do things that she doesn't mind doing at first but then later when he gets more violent towards Katie, their mom and their new father.<br /><br />The father does wedding videos and also sets cameras up around the house to capture any of this activity, he records these on VHS tapes and the more he sees on film the more he tries to discover what this being may be and what they want. The scares are a bit more conventional than the previous two, however I do admit this was pretty scary in parts, mainly cause the being \\"Toby\\" seems far more real of a threat quicker than in the other flicks.<br /><br />This was not the \\"Unseen force takes its time to make its presence known\\" flick, well at least not as much this time around, I admit its not as good as the previous ones but there's plenty of good scares and the closing minutes are very chilling. If you enjoyed this series then you'll likely enjoy this one. **1/2 out of 4 stars
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|My kids love this movie and it's great that i can download it to my kindle so they can watch it anytime.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Rick Riordan keeps improving his style. In the Mark of Athena he balances seven main characters, sometimes in an artificial way. He creates a very good story with the Greek/Roman mythology background that is the trademark of the series. The mythological background isn't always as accurate as I'd like, but, nonetheless, it's an awesome introduction for kids.<br />The hook in the final is excelent and makes us wait anxiously for the final chapter of this story.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I love this show. It hasn't gotten old or boring in the 4 season's it has been on. The new police chief could really go away but other than that I have loved it and look forward to the next season. I bought it off Amazon instant play because I was too impatient to wait in the long line on Netflicks and didn't want to wait for it to be shipped from amazon. Next season I will just buy the first episode and buy the disk because then I could sell them back after I am done watching and not feel like I have spent 20 dollars on air. I don't know if I would ever watch this season again without owning all the rest. As far as the Instant player goes we did have one night where it kept telling us it could not find my internet connection so I just plugged my laptop in to the TV's HDMI port and watched it like that. The fast-forwarding and rewinding are a pain and require you to wait till everything loads again.But over all I have been impressed with the Instant play.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book & would follow the author for other reads.<br /><br />Maybe it could have moved a bit faster in places but, all in all, a great book.  You won't be disappointed.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|i LOVE this game. the graphics are wonderful. keeps your mind going and thinking. finished the whole game and since none of items are ever the same..you can replay the game without losing interest. reason for 4 stars is as of today i cant even get the game to open. all day ive tried. it goes to open and then immediately shuts down
0061692042|5.0|Canada is a beautifully written novel.  One chapter melts into the next which made me not want to put it down.  This is an excellent read about misguided parents, hopeful children, and reluctant relatives all under the \\"Big Sky\\".
B007TK77QE|4.0|Despite the grim subject matter, JKR manages to weave her magic yet again, with an engrossing story set in \\"small-town\\" UK. Jo has great insight into human nature and uses her astute observations to create disturbingly authentic characters. Despite disliking most of the villagers of Pagford and the Fields,I was still compelled by their stories. I am an incorrigible optimist, so despite the tragic ending of the novel, I felt encouraged that at least some of these fictional interpersonal relationships were redeemed. I look forward to more adult novels from this discerning writer.
B00932IP1W|5.0|Probably everyone now knows how exciting and thought-provoking this series turned out to be. I was gripped from the first moments and couldn't wait to see the rest of the episodes. I was very pleased to be able to buy the whole first season from Amazon and watch it on-line without any breaks.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It deals with a difficult subject honestly and prompted me to think about the issues surrounding quality of life.  Be warned, not a book to read on public transport unless you don't mind having an emotional melt down in public!!
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Great story.  Hoping for a series of puzzles to be solved that are as intriguing as the puzzle in this book.
B007THA4FI|5.0|J K Rowling is amazing! Her ability to intertwine the lives of a community, the haves and have nots, yet show no judgement on either side was just brilliant.
B008M4MB8K|4.0|If you're keeping score, this marks something like the 47th separate release of Blade Runner since the invention of the DVD. They will eventually put one in your home, and then we can all watch it at the same time. I suspect this may bring on the singularity, because I can't think of any other purpose for facilitating this mass viewing. It will be a singularity of DVD players, however, which should have little to no impact on humans. Carry on.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game.  Very different from other HOG's I've played.  Will buy part 2 immediately!  Great graphics.  great intrigue. for this type of game.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|I am a fan of Ridley Scott and Alien is one of my all time favorites,  he outdid himself in Prometheus.
0307949508|5.0|I am not through reading this book yet.  However, what I have read is riviting.  I have, also, read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and this is another great book by the same author.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not the best, or the worst, Kay Scarpetta novel I've ever read. While it's always fun to spend time with some of my favorite characters, I thought too much of the novel was spent focused on Scarpetta's fears about getting old. As like the last novel, I also found the progression of time to be a bit off-- there really is no physical way that they are able to do as much as they do in 24 hours. It's almost as if Cornwell is trying to delay Scarpetta's aging by making each novel span less than a week.<br /><br />Overall, not the finest addition to the series, but you know if you're a Scarpetta fan, you're still going to read it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wow!  What a book!!  I was mezmerized by the last third, especially.  The first half or so is a LOT of set up, techincal explanation, history, etc. but once you get to the real meat of the story, the actual mission to get Bin Laden, it's really hard to put down.  I read much of it twice! I just loved being able to peek behind the curtain on how these things are done.  A glimpse into a world most of us know nothing about.  Thank you, to Mark Owen, for having the courage to write this book.  I know much controversy swirled when it first came out, if it was right to write a book like this. But I think, as Americans, we should be able to understand just what it is our military does and what kind of strength and determination is involved in this kind of work.  Bravo to all who made this happen.  You rid the world or the worst demon since Hilter!
B008NABUU8|1.0|on my kindle fire hd 7&quot; the orientation is upside down. ok, so i flip it over but the game also flips. of course i have to laugh about it some but the game cannot be played.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|Azealia Banks is bringing something interesting to the female rap genre, and she's quickly became one of my favorite female rappers. I love 1991 & you should buy it if you love up-tempos and great rap skills. It's just 4 songs, but it's still a good listen.
B008ASLK8A|2.0|This movie is no where near as good as the first one.  The plot was not that great and the pace of the movie had me checking my watch to see how much longer I had to suffer to the end.  Downey, Jr. and Law are good in their characters as Holmes and Watson and that is about it.  If there is to be another Sherlock Holmes sequel, it needs a much improved script or it will be the last episode.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|I did not care for this app and canceled as soon as I could. I am not a gambler. I felt threatened by this app.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great Book!!!! I expected it to be a little longer. The last chapter of the book could have been longer. While enjoying the last chapter the book was over and I did not want it to end. I am patiently waiting for the third book to find out what happens next. It was really interesting reading and I have informed my friends and family about the book. It is a must read and to think I was not going to read the first or this book...
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love this movie, love that I can download it to my kindle fire and take it with me!! It was easy to buy and to play, I don't have to worry about the disc getting scratched or running out of room on a self.
B0092MIHSY|5.0|I was first introduced to Jens Lekman when I found a cell phone video of a concert where he covered Paul Simon's hit \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" ([...]). Beyond being just a SOLID cover of a great song, I was amused by how Jens playfully teased the audience by refusing to sing the chorus of the song. The little wells of laughter from the crowd just killed me.<br /><br />Fast forward a few months and scrolling through Amazon's digital music deals I see his name and a $5 album and say to myself \\"Why not?\\".<br />Pretty much the rest of the week, I'm calling friends over to my desk and showing them the music videos for \\"Erica America\\" and \\"Become Someone Else's\\" simply because I needed someone I could sit with and say \\"Isn't that just SO GOOD?\\"<br /><br />It's not my normal type of music, but I'm glad I have it to listen to on a good long drive, or when I'm just looking to end the day on a good note.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day has me hooked. Reflected to you was AWESOME. Even better than Bared to You (book 1 in crossfire series)She left me wanting so much more. You can't help but fall in love with Eva and Gideon. There love story is so messed up but exciting.  I can't wait for the 3rd and final book of the Crossfire series.<br /><br />I recommend this series to everyone.
B0053O89WY|5.0|If you like The Big Bang Theory, this DVD is for you.  I own Seasons 1 - 5 & love the series.
B004XZR63M|4.0|This is a good and informative book; however, there wasn't as much substance to what the author wrote or his examples were not always clear. The ideas were very helpful and does bring insight to how one should view finances. I would recommend this book.
076790592X|2.0|I went into this book with rather high expectations. I had heard good things about it and was looking forward to finding out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />By the time that I had finished it I must say that I was a bit disappointed and that it did not match my expectations. Maybe this is because my expectations were too high, or maybe it was because this is not the typical style of writing that I read (my typical fair consists of novels and fiction). Either way though, I found it lacking.<br /><br />Now, this is not to say that the idea behind the book is bad. This is not the case at all, and in fact I think that it is a good story and I'm glad the author has learned something from such a life-changing event. That being said, I really don't think that the author is a good writer. The book dragged on and never had the very engaging aspect that most like their books to have. There were certain moments that caused me to say \\"let me just read a few more pages\\" but they were few and far between unfortunately.<br /><br />In addition, the author does not come across as a very likeable person. His words say that yes, he realizes the areas that he's wrong in. But, the way he writes, describes things, and the actions he takes during the book show make it difficult to believe that he really has changed much or has much motivation to change.<br /><br />All that being said, I can't say it was a bad book. It has important lessons in it, and while at points they seem a bit preachy and forced on the reader, the world would be a better places if more people thought to follow them. I can say that I did not enjoy reading it though, and it might be that it's just not my cup of tea. I recommend that people at least give it a shot and see what they think.<br /><br />2/5
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I you like action drama mini series, this is for you. A great buy that does not disappoint!  You will also want to see Spartacus Blood and Sand, as well as, Spartacus Vengence.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A lot of fun for a phone game. good story more with a over 30 levels and I still haven't finished it. Overall runs smoothly, doesn't drain the battery quickly, and the game does what it is designed to do, which is to keep you entertained.
B008220DGE|3.0|I don't normally review anything anywhere but I just returned home from the theater after seeing \\"The Master\\" and I just felt compelled to say a few words about this movie.<br /><br />PS Hoffman is my favorite actor. Phoenix was brilliant in \\"Walk the Line\\". Both actors here give amazing heartfelt performances(especially Joaquin Phoenix who deserves an Oscar for this role). But I left the theater feeling so empty inside.  There is no substance to this story at all.  I don't believe it wanted to follow the historical \\"Scientology\\" view but PLEASE give us something as to what it is. I love to actually think and figure out where a movie is going, but to me this movie had no direction whatsoever.<br /><br />\\"Magnolia\\" is one of my favorite PT Anderson films that I watch over and over. \\"Hard Eight\\" is just as good.  I didn't like \\"Punch Drunk Love\\" that much but only because I have no liking for Adam Sandler. AHHHHHHHHHH I don't know. To sum it up, I think I just expected a little more from The Master. Trust me you won't be bored during this movie but at the end of it, I just asked myself....what was it all for??
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|This is the clearest, easiest to follow cookbook I have ever used and now it's on my Kindle too. I love French food and everything I do from this book is a success. With it on my Kindle it travels with me. Prior to this time my large book would have to remain in my kitchen while I would often be traveling and wish it was with me. Thanks for making it portable.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Since my childhood days I have always been a fan of comics books. With all the great movies they been able to transcend from the comic books and for me to say that this movie is the best out of the Marvel Universe so far says a lot. From the acting, to the plot, and every detail of the movie I don't believe they could have done a better job. Just looking forward to the next one and I don't want to spoil it for those that have not seen the movie, but the main Villain for the next movie is the real deal compared to Loki. Looking forward to Thanos and how everything will unravel to the plot. I thought watching it on IMAX was an experience, but I have to say that the detail, picture, and 3D of this BluRay on my LG Trumotion Smartv is second to none! Movie looked amazing and the surround sound I have made it feel as good as the Theather! This movie definitely worth having in the collection.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book for me was a blunt look at how patriarchal values undermine human relationships. It presented this indictment in inviting you into the lives of people affected by not being truthful and conscious of how their words and actions can destroy people.  It made you care about the people in all their flaws but at the same time wish they would wake up to their responsibility to make their world better.  I would say this is an adult call to be responsible for how you are involved in politics and religion.[[ASIN:0316228532 The Casual Vacancy]]
B008RC72G8|1.0|I have watched every episode of the original series and the revival series created by the late Dan Curtis believing that they are outstanding without a peer to compare to.  Dark Shadows 'the movie' with Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter is awful in character changes, dialogue and casting.  The writers should be chained in coffins and the keys to the locks thrown away.  The music is a horrible distraction and not worthy of Robert Cobert, who was the musical genius of the original series, the two movies out of the original series and the revival.  Gothic romance and slow developing horror is substituted here for fast paced special effects that do unjustice to building suspense.  While I normally am a fan of Mr. Depp and Ms. Bonham Carter;  neither could save such an empty, modernized distortion of a true classic.  If you are have been unfortunate, like I believe I am, in purchasing this version and watching it, please take the disc out of the case and use it for bird cage liner.  Your friends will thank you for this, but your bird will give you the bird.  If you are reading this considering whether you should purchase this, I suggest you do not buy it.  Buy the original series in the coffin version, buy the two movies from the original series and buy the rival series which to me was the greatest of all, but pass on buying Dark Shadows the movie starring Johnny Depp.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Good continuation of story line.  Good plot.  I like how we get each person's view on not only what they are doing but you understand how each individual's choices affect the others.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I am proud of my fellow navy sailors and have a lot of respect for the seals. I would love to meet Mr. Kyle and Mr. Luttrell (Lone Survivor), they are my heroes. Go Navy
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is \\"GRAYT\\". The story lets you know that there are many types of people. And you may not know your type as well as you thought. Read 50 Shades of Gray to find out if you have a different type that is dying to get out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is awesome and fun. It has lava  rivers and carts I love how the graphects work and has fifteenth modes. :)
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest. If I could only have one thing on my computer, it would be Pinterest. There are so many great ideas, photographs, and motivation on this site it is fantastic. The only possible down, is that it is addictive. I could be on here all day.

B008NABUU8|4.0|a few glitches, but all an all, fun game. I ran into one map, the first one with ropes, i was unable to use the building dot to the far right of the map, thats my only complant thus far. just cars could go across. i bet if i was able to use that build point i could have had trucks go across.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|only problem I have is with th online. Idk if its just me but ive gotten disconnected from almost everygame (including my own). not only that but for some reason my characters got deleted. other than that, pretty solid game
B002MQYOFW|5.0|What an awesome read! I only wish I had kept it for the summer holidays so that I could read it in one go!
B008NABUU8|4.0|the UI seems a bit clunky but overall it is challenging and fun. the use of alternate materials is an interesting twist.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|Alright, this is by no means a 'bad' movie, but when following up a classic like 'The Dark Knight' it will make a sequel look worse if it does not come close to matching up with its predecessor.  And the 'Dark Knight Rises' does not come close.  This movie had a plethora of problems.  For one, a jabbering story line about identity theft which disappears mid-way through the film.  It merely served as a plot device so it would justify the catwoman being in the film.  Also, the complete lack of build-up to Batman's first confrontation with Bane.  It reminded me of George Clooney's Batman fighting Mr. Freeze with no build up whatsoever.  In the movie, Bane does not rely on the venom to give him super strength, which means he beats Batman without the aid of anything.  This means that some guy who grew up in a prison can defeat a man who has mastered every form of martial arts? eh,no. They should have done their homework on that one.<br /><br />Another unforgivable flaw is the fact that Joseph-Gordon Levitt has more screen time than Batman. What? (Meaning more screen time than Christian Bale in the Batman costume).  The run time is a bloated 2hr and 45 mintues, filled with too many philosophical conversations.  Basically, this movie takes the plot from the Arkham City video game (Gotham becoming an isolated island with roving criminals) and the Dark Knight Returns (where batman has taken an eight-year hiatus from crimefighting).  So much for original ideas.  By doing this, Chris Nolan cuts off the cliffhanger from the last movie at the legs.  Weren't the cops supposed to be chasing batman around as a fugitive?  They just fast-forwarded that and that is how the storyline is resolved.....awful.  The puzzling romance between Bruce Wayne and Talia, one moment their talking business, the next their doing business in bed.  Again, no build-up, it just sort of happened. Awful.  The action sequences are few and far between. To make matters worse their not exciting, they come across as flat and bland.  Listen to the music during the movie, it's just the main theme over and over again.  The variety for the themes from the last movie is gone.<br /><br />  I think the momentum from the last movie has carried over to this one, making people believe its better than it really is.  On the plus side, Christian Bale does a more palpable Batman voice, gone is the growl.  Tom Hardy steals the show as Bane. And the first fight between Batman/Bane was easily the best scene in the movie (despite no build-up).  As a stand alone movie, this is a decent action film.  When compared to the 'Dark Knight'.....not even close.  When they release the trilogy, the should just put the 'Dark Knight' twice.

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I loved this game and enjoyed playing it because I THOUGHT I was playing, gathering the prizes, finishing the puzzles as they came along, TO KEEP GOING. But in this game, once the puzzles are done, the player continues to play (push coins) and gather the prizes, FOR NO REASON.<br /><br />The game simply turns in to coin pushing where you keep getting thousands of coins and tons of \\"prizes \\" that you can't do a darn thing with except keep collecting FOR WHAT? It also never gave nearly enough Dozed Dollars to unlock the increased abilities from the prize screen.<br /><br />If they had made it an ongoing game it would have been terrific. Sorry COIN PUSHER.

0307270807|5.0|Dispatches by Michael Herr is NOT a soldier's portrayal OR the ultimate book concerning the Vietnam War. There can be NO book written that can make such a claim as it depends where you were at that time.  Reporters like Michael Herr and photographers like Dana Stone, Sean Flynn and Tim Page DID travel across most of the country and were not in the military. People who cannot see the brutal honesty in Dispatches should put it down afterr page 50 and read something else.<br /><br />Herr's memmoirs include his fellow reporters and photographers, along with the the LURP's, Green Beret's, Infantry, Navy and Marine units he met. Dispatches cleverly describes their collective and individual journeys into hell with the War as its background. Herr describes his lack of feeling when he views his first combat deaths, and  asserts that he does not know what to feel and when the war becomes insanely ugly from late 67 to early 1969.<br />Herr states that he feels like he is watching porn, in fact \\"all the porn in the world at exactly the same time\\" but does not know what to feel.<br /><br />I did not enjoy Disaptches on my first read. I re-read it and loved it. What can I say, it is rock and roll, glamour, the late sixties and of course the Vietnam War rolled into one. It is an honest read for a difficult period in time. It encompasses Dien Bien Phu, French Plantations, Ho Chi Minh, the Marines in Hue, Da Nang and  Khe Sahn, China Beach, The Beatles/Rolling Stones/Zeppelin/The Doors/Jimi Hendrix/Bob Dylan and Zappa and the Mutha's:  General Westmoreland, LBJ;  Loaches; the DMZ and let's NOT forget ....the jungle . The jungle is quote \\" where they all took their orders from anyway \\".<br /><br />Herr's book could easily pass as the ultimate in black comedy had it not been for the Vietnam War. The excerpt below makes me laugh every time I read it.<br /><br />  That December  I got a Christmas card from a Marine. .... It showed<br />  a psychotic-art Snoppy in jungle fatigues, a cigarette<br />  clenched in its teeth, blazing away with an M-16. It read, and<br />  best Wishes for a Happy  one-Niner-Six-Niner,'<br /><br />If you're looking for a typical day in the life of journal .... you will be sorely disappointed. This is NOT a linear book that claims to be an actual historical portrayal of the war a la Chickenhawk by Robert Mason.  Herr is involved in combat or \\"contact\\" situations, and tells the reader, that he was happy to avoid actual contact. If the truth be known, so would most of the soldiers whom he went out on patrol with. Herr does not have a camera like Tim Page and Sean Flynn, that he had a hard time in Vietnam as he does not produce photographs and is not a slave to deadlines, a la the reporters from Time, The New York Post, The Washington Post etc , etc<br /><br />Like the Vietnam War there is NO beginning and there is no logical progression. Yes, as Herr states on the last page ....<br /><br />  The war ended, and  then it really ended, the cities \\"fell\\" ....<br />  And one last chopper .... Revved it up ... flew out of my chest.<br /><br />5 Stars for Dispatchesa's psychedelic war, with a rock and roll soundtrack and it is a film with \\"real life\\" as its director. Everyone who went there used the phrase \\"when I got back to the World\\" insinuating that the Vietnam War, was an individual experience, that is, each to his own.  Herr concludes \\"... Vietnam is what we had instead of happy childhoods.\\" Prophetic words indeed.

1439170916|5.0|Author Mukherjee is a cancer researcher and physician, so I expected something relatively authoritative and detailed. However, his 'The Emperor of all Maladies' goes well beyond those expectations, and is very readable as well. He begins with a brief overview.<br /><br />Cancer is not one disease, but many. Nearly every known cancer originates from a single cell that acquired the ability for limitless cell division and survival. Unfortunately, it is also an evolving disease that creates mutant clones of that original cell. In 2010 more than 7 million are predicted to die of cancer. His book is a 4,000-year history of cancer; its ultimate aim is to question whether the disease can be eradicated. It was first described by the Egyptian physician Imhotop around 2625 B.C. In his case description of what is believed to be a breast cancer case and 47 other medical issues he wrote in the section titled 'Therapy' - 'There is none.' No subsequent reference has been found until about 440 B.C. - another instance of breast cancer. Around 400 B.C. the disease was named.<br /><br />Why so little mention long ago? Mukherjee tells us that cancer is an age-related disease - one's immune system ability to overcome initial cancer cells decreases with age; that coupled with the intervening massive improvements in public health, and successful treatment of other prevalent scourges such as typhus and T.B., allowed many more humans to fall victim to cancer. In addition, our ability to detect/identify cancer has also improved.<br /><br />The earliest treatment involved draining away 'black bile' believed secreted by the kidneys or spleen. This was succeeded in the late 18th century by surgery. Fortunately anesthesia and sterilization had been discovered several decades prior to this time. Early cancer surgeries, however, often removed far too much tissue in an effort to reduce recurrence. Later it was realized that surgery was useless when the cancer had already spread, and such expensive/radical surgery was excessive when it hadn't.<br /><br />X-rays were discovered in 1895 and a year later a young medical student tried using X-rays to bombard an elderly woman's breast cancer. Her tumor ulcerated and shrank, though she died a few months later because it had already spread. Others refined the approach and it proved remarkable effective treating locally confined cancers such as breast, lymphoma, and even brain cancer. Researchers unfortunately also found that radiation could cause cancer.<br /><br />Sidney Farber (1903-1973) is regarded as the father of modern chemotherapy. He'd been chief of pathology at Boston's Children's Hospital when in the mid-1940s he decided to try and develop a cure of leukemia in children. His initial effort, injecting leukemic children with folic acid to restore blood normalcy, instead considerably sped up the progression of the disease. He then tried a few newly discovered antifolates. Temporary remission was achieved in the majority of cases, but the disease always returned. Yet, he had not only extended their lives for several months, but more importantly shown the potential for chemical treatment. WWII analyses of the effects of mustard gas revealed that it made normal white blood cells almost disappear. In the early 1950s physicians tried using a similar compound on pediatric leukemia, with results like Farber's - including the cancer's developing drug resistance and returning full force. The 'good news' is that Farber, with the help of others, had created large-scale research funding and had cooperative researchers at several sites - combining patients and results, using random clinical trials. By 1957 there were combining drugs and achieving longer remissions.<br /><br />Meanwhile in Chicago, another researcher was bothered by the fact that a cancer market's level did not go to zero after initial positive treatments. He continued the painful treatments until it did. Unfortunately, he was fired for this 'torture,' buthis patient did not relapse - the only one that did not do so. Another important lesson. A ten-year clinical trial ending in 1981 showed radical mastectomy no more effective than simply excising the tumor. Unfortunately, 500,000 women went the unnecessarily painful and disfiguring operation.<br /><br />In 1775 a surgeon named Percival Pott noted a sharp rise in scrotal cancer cases at his clinic. The patients were almost all young indentured chimney sweeps who had been cleaning out chimney insides, often nearly naked and covered in oil. After considerable thought and analysis Pott concluded the cause was chimney soot chronically lodged in the skin. This was the first evidence that cancer had environmental causes and could be prevented. About ten years previously an amateur scientists had claimed that data linked snuff to lip, mouth, and throat cancers. Pott's conclusions were taken seriously and the chimney-sweeping was first limited and then banned, while Hill's findings were ridiculed. By 1953, the average American adult male smoked ten cigarettes/day. About 45% of all men smoked but only some developed cancer. In 1948 credible studies were published in both the U.S. and England linking smoking and lung cancer. The tobacco industry responded with obfuscation and by setting up their own research program. The debate raged until tobacco ads were banned on broadcast media at the end of 1970.<br /><br />Other linkage findings followed - eg. mesothelioma vs. asbestos, as well as links to industrial dyes, benzene. A predictor was found by noting bacteria growth rates on substrates normally hostile after the bacteria had been exposed to a suspect carcinogen. Chronic stomach inflammation (gastritis) was also linked to cancer, and Pap smears were found to detect precancerous conditions about 20 years earlier when the problem was much more curable. Hepatitis B was linked to cancer, and a vaccine developed to prevent the disease.<br /><br />Mukherjee also points out the complexities of screening tests - problems with over- and under-diagnoses, as well as simply providing early detection w/o affecting length of total survival. Mammography posed additional test evaluation problems, finally settled with recommendations for regular mammography only for those 55 and older. Research fraud brought another problem - involved high-dose chemotherapy and bone-marrow transplantation.<br /><br />Between 1990 and 2005, the cancer death rate fell nearly 15%. Lung cancer via prevention, colon and cervical via early detection, leukemia, lymphoma, and testicular reached 80% cure rates via chemo.<br /><br />Final note: The book was dedicated to Robert Sandler, 1945-58, the first childhood leukemia victim whose life was prolonged, but unfortunately not save, by research and new therapy.his patient did not relapse - the only one that did not do so.

1455527475|3.0|Author Greg Smith publicly announced his resignation from Goldman Sachs after 12 years there in a blistering essay in the New York Times in which he accused his former employer of routinely deceiving and overcharging clients. At the time he was head of its U.S. equity derivatives business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. His 'Why I Left Goldman Sachs' details the story of his resignation and fills in the details outlined in his New York Times essay. It does not, however, contain any blockbuster revelations, and makes only generalized assertions. While Goldman vigorously denies all of Smith's allegations, its also paid $550 million to settle a case brought by the SEC in which it accused the bank of selling investments that it believed would fail.<br /><br />'Why I Left Goldman Sachs' opens with Smith's recounting of its twice-a-week 90-minute Open Meetings held among its interns. Smith saw them as an interrogation chamber testing knowledge of markets, Goldman Sachs history, current management and understanding of the business (eg. 'How does a trader quantify risk?'). Performance in these meetings was an important determinant of hiring attractiveness - on average, only one in 45 got an offer. The meetings emphasized that they should not make things up or exaggerate, and admit mistakes immediately. Etc., etc. with more details of Smith's early hiring experience - far too much in fact.<br /><br />Smith contends that Goldman encouraged employees to persuade clients to invest in products the firm was trying to get rid of, and to get one's clients to trade whatever will bring the biggest profit to Goldman.<br /><br />Smith contends he was not an disgruntled employee - he received a bonus, had reached mid-level V.P. status, had been selected as one of 10 (out of a firm of more than 30,000) to appear in its recruiting video, and had been told he was two years from reaching partner status. (A supervisor's e-mail, however, was quite negative towards Smith's request for a $1 million bonus.) His intent in writing the book is to allow readers to realize what the typical conflicts of interest are that involve Wall Street bankers.a $1 million bonus.)

0762777931|4.0|I really appreciated Kris Carr's story and her fight against cancer with food. So many people are oblivious that what they are putting in their mouths are causing their medical illnesses.  Very, very few doctors would tell you to fight heart disease and cancer with organic broccoli and carrots, and become a vegetarian. \\"That is extreme!\\" Yet, they will cut open your chest and take an artery from your leg and sew it onto your heart, to me THAT is extreme. Americans are waking up and this food movement is gaining energy. Through voices like Kris Carr we can make a regulation changes in Washington when it comes to our food supply.<br /><br />The juicing and food recipes are delicious! I would also recommend the cookbook: Forkes Over Knives Cookbook. Another must have.

The second I heard \\"I Will Wait,\\" I knew this was gonna be another excellent album.<br /><br />I purchased the deluxe version the day it was released, actually I was waiting outside of Target 10 minutes prior to opening.

B000000XB9|5.0|What can you really say about a CD that is this good?? Like millions of others out there, I've had this classic album in my collection for many years. It belongs in every collection of every rock fan on earth! Creedence Clearwater Revival represents everything that is real and right about rock n' roll. These twenty endlessly appealing tunes represent some of the most enduring and enjoyable music the world of rock n' roll will ever produce. If you are a music fan born before 1990 who doesn't like at least a few of the timeless songs on this CD, you wouldn't know a great song if it slapped you in the face! Song for song, Chronicle is probably the greatest rock n' roll album ever!  The Beatles had a bigger impact on the world and the Rolling Stones stayed together a whole lot longer, but neither band consistently produced as many pure rock n' roll tunes of higher quality than the songs in this album. I might get beat up by a lot of Beatles/Stones fans for my statement, but repeated listenings to these 20 golden tunes will make it hard for many to disagree. As Bruce Springsteen said when inducting these guys into the hall of fame, &#34;they weren't the hippest rock n' roll band in the world, just the best&#34;. If Creedence Clearwater Revival isn't the greatest rock band of the 60's and 70's, there hasn't been a band on the radio in the past 30 years who can touch them!  The legendary John Fogerty managed to take everything that was great about the rock n' roll pioneers of the 1950's and make it popular all over again at a time when psychedelic excess and flower power had taken over the music world. Creedence offered nothing but good-time rock n' roll with as much beat, rhythm, and soul as Elvis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, or Jerry Lee Lewis had ten years earlier. Their music was simple, direct, raw, powerful, and totally infectious. The everlasting quality of these 20 songs offer all the prove you need that Fogerty is one of the greatest rock n' roll songwriters of all time.  This is pure American &#34;feel good&#34; rock n' roll of the highest quality folks. Let's be honest...rock n' roll songs of any era just don't come any better than &#34;Travelin' Band&#34;, &#34;Proud Mary&#34;, Fortunate Son&#34;, &#34;Up Around the Bend&#34;, &#34;Bad Moon Rising&#34;, &#34;Commotion&#34;, &#34;Green River&#34; or &#34;Born on the Bayou&#34; which is the only essential song not included here. Although most of the tunes on this CD have been played to death over the years on classic rock radio, they still pack a punch 40 years later and never get old! Creedence produced more great songs from 1968 to 1971 than most rock bands come up with in their whole careers!  Unlike many bands, the music of CCR appeals to both the old and the young. My mom grew up in the 50's with Elvis and Chuck Berry on the charts and couldn't stand the new wave of rock that came with the British invasion a few years later. Then she heard CCR and realized this was a band that captured the same beat, soul, and feeling of the legends she heard on the radio a decade earlier. One listen to &#34;Traveling Band&#34; proves without a doubt that Fogerty could deliver the power and soul of Little Richard as convincingly as Richard himself!  Amazingly and thankfully, Fogerty is STILL on stage somewhere tonight in 2012 playing the best rock n' roll America has to offer. I saw him two days ago at the Arizona state fair and at 67 years young he hasn't lost a thing. Playing solo after solo and belting these classic songs in the original keys, the fabulous Fogerty put on a high-energy show that had the crowd roaring! If you have any doubt, check out John's AWESOME concert DVD's available here on amazon {&#34;The Long Road Home&#34; from 2005 and &#34;Royal Albert Hall&#34; from 2008}. Both of these concerts are two of the greatest rock n' roll shows ever released on video and should be your next purchase after getting this CD!  Long after your favorite karaoke contest {American Idol, X-Factor} has went off the air and today's talentless Top 40 jokes are forgotten in six months, these songs will still be wiping the floor with anything on the charts in the 21st century.  Long live REAL DEAL ROCK N' ROLL!  COOKIE-CUTTER NEVER....CREEDENCE FOREVER!!!

B005F9TQ9C|5.0|It ages well.  I remember how reviled it was as a kid.  I recently listened to Bringing it All Back Home and imagined how incredible it must have sounded to unexposed years in 1965. The music and poetry are incredible. Likewise Self Portrait is just a Dylan album and a great listen. Dylan had removed himself from the turmoil and was enjoying making American music. Finding himself like all of us do.  A great chapter in the life of an incredible artist we are lucky to have experienced.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|I have read every one of the Jack Reacher series so I am a big fan and willing to make allowances.  However, this book is not as good as his earlier ones in the series, but better than his last one.  At least Reachere doesn't drink coffee in great detail every few pages.  It has enough twists to keep you interested even though the ending is pretty far fetched to say the least.  But, it is so good to be along for the ride with another Jack Reacher story, so I am happy to recommend it to you.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I compare the book a little bit to \\"Enders Game\\" since in both kids are separated from their parents and siblings and both have to face the struggles of survival in an unfriendly and hostile environment.<br /><br />I loved the hunger games for it's detailed description of not only the characters but the world itself. The characters are not overdeveloped but relatable enough to care about them. And the environment has a dismal feeling about it that I last felt when reading \\"Lord of the rings\\" and Forod's time crossing Mordor.<br /><br />If you like mild SiFi, love well developed environments for the characters and like to be kept on the edge of your seat I can really recommend this book (trilogy).<br /><br />Have a good (reading) time<br />René

Probably something obvious I am missing, I am sure I will figure it out next time I play it.<br /><br />Nice representation of the Original Prince of Persia that I played on my C64 so many years ago.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|I read this book because our high school principal requested our PTA to donate 80 hard cover editions of this title for use in English, health and Special Education classes.  The book deals with teen suicide, bullying with special attention to how girls are bullied via their sexual reputation, date rape and teen drinking.  The narrative is told from two perspectives: the girl who committed suicide via audio tapes that she left behind and from the perspective of a fellow student Clay who is trying to make sense of it all.<br /><br />The book is a quick read and I think teens will relate to it because it is told from the perspective of two of the teens involved.  The sexual encounters are not graphic but the reader understands what takes place.  I encourage parents to read it as well so that you can discuss with your teen.<br /><br />I am happy that our principal wants our kids to read the book and that it is our city's choice for Huntington Beach Reads for 2013.<br /><br />Recently in our community, a well-regarded high school student passed away from a drug overdose.  I think it is time for us as parents and community members to get our heads out of the sand and address these topics of bullying, teen depression, teen suicide, drug and alcohol abuse.  Reading this book and discussing it with other parents, our children, school administrators law enforcement is an excellent start.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Works Great it does more than a paid for application it does what it says it should do! I really don't trust the paid for applications when you buy one it does not do what it says iy will do I will go with the free ones more like Battery HD it tells you what charge level it's at and you can set it! It approximates how long you have on the charge level you have in your battery ie web browsing 11 hours and 38 minutes!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I am not a big musical fan, but I was hooked a few minutes into the movie. I even showed the movie to my kids 6 and 8 and they loved it. Excellent movie recommend to all who love a great love story.

B00943SQCI|3.0|I remember getting home from school and watching at least part of the soap opera, Dark Shadows, as a kid. I always thought it was kind of campy and if I remember correctly it was live and you could frequently see the mistakes made by the actors or the crew. This movie starring Johnny Depp was a fun movie to watch. I think Depp did a very good job with this character and the laughs came pretty easy the first two thirds of the movie. But then, towards the end, it seemed it wanted to become a scary/serious movie. That is why it has a rating from me of three stars. If it would have stayed on track I think the movie night have been better. But once it strayed from comedy, I kind of became disappointed. All in all it was a good/fun movie and I can recommend it as something to watch.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Good simulation, but the touch contols are hit and miss. I often draw lines longer than I wanted. A few more tutorial levels would help as every bridge game treats material properties different. Overall, fun enough if you like bridges.

B009UQCD0K|2.0|I edited a old review because Amazon changed from allowing a review for every episode (which I loved) to only allowing one review per season.<br /><br />----------<br />So let the hate begin, as for some reason people feel the need to insult folks they don't agree with in the comments section. Allow me give my own insults to them ahead of time: \\"Poopyheads, ha ha. You can't make me change my review!\\"<br />----------<br /><br />First and foremost, a third grade class can write better female characters than the writers on TWD. Heck, sexist Japanese anime female characters are written better than females on TWD. The only reason the Michonne character is written ok is because she says very little. Yeah, we see her a lot, but NOT MUCH DIALOG. The finale was the most dialog Michonne had all season. Sorry to say, but Andrea's ending finale speech was p*ss poor. It made her character look like a dimwit backward child living in fairyland.<br /><br />Andrea: \\"Oh, I just wanted all of us to get along. I thought by having sex with Muhammad we would have peace in the Middle East. And yeah, I just gonna talk and talk and talk instead of getting out of harms way. Why? Well, because I'm written that way.\\"<br /><br />Secondly, why would Rick suddenly do a 180 degree change regarding welcoming strangers to the group. Too bad for the poor guy with the orange backpack in the episode \\"Clear.\\" Again, the writers did not adequately explain this. And, do these additional people mean more \\"Days of our Zombie Lives\\" drama that destroyed Season Two.<br /><br />Third, okay I get it. The actor that plays the Governor needs the work/money, so we have to see him again in Season 4 reinvented as -- who knows. Well that great for the actor, but it BLOWS CHUCKS for the fans who needed a real finale. Then there is Beth, and I can only wonder who she is sleeping with (a director, a writer?!) cause other than babysitter, she serves no purpose. Get her a job on GLEE, since you are so fond of giving her singing cameos. You should have kept Meryl and killed off Beth.<br /><br />To my own surprise, I actually could relate to Carl's reasoning for killing the kid. It was the best dialog the entire episode. I hated the fact that I agreed with his logic and reasoning 100%. Which I guess means Rick will regret some of the possible traitors he's now taken into the fold.<br /><br />Season Three came in like a lion and ended like a baby kitten. The editors can also share the blame, as editing can make all the different, as any reality show actor can tell you.inging cameos.

B009UQCD0K|5.0|This is another great episode in what is looking to become the show's best season yet.  As Rick is faced with the tough decision of how to deal with a living prisoner who is clearly going to be a danger to the group, his moral opposition to killing the living has all but disappeared.  A decision that took him days of deliberation in Season 2 was made in a matter of seconds in this episode.  It becomes evident that the hard life of the post apocalypse has transformed him into a man willing to stop at nothing to protect his group.  As time wears on, a sense of \\"Shane-ness\\" seems to be developing within him that leaves this viewer wondering whether the strong and sensible leader will continue to maintain his composure.
B007P7UF06|4.0|A splendid and delightful musical film. The music from Camelot is so fantastic!<br />\\"what do the simple folk do\\" is fun and ironic and \\"if ever I would leave you\\"<br />is the ultimate romantic song. And of course \\"Camelot\\" performed by Richard Harris<br />is simply terrific.....enjoy this marvelous film...Glor!
0316228532|5.0|It's truly a masterpiece. I've seen a lot of negativity over the book, but when you judge it as a book, it succeeds in the most epic way. I usually hate books that lack some sort of plot. I like the action and the beginning to start as early as possible. And for me, it did in this book. No, there were not explosions and it lacked magic wands, but it had dynamic characters. I could not put the book down, and I would highly recommend the book to anyone who is willing to give it a shot and has a heart. I cried at the end, and I spent the last hundred pages wishing it was longer. Already, I didn't want to leave the deep and thoughtful characters Rowling brilliantly created. I imagine it wasn't easy for her to write a book like this, but there is no doubt in my mind that she pulled it off with elegant prose and such a light touch moving the plot, that it's like it's unfolding without her, and she's typing as quickly as she can to keep up. Wonderful.

B009KHBDUU|4.0|Johnny Depp's transformation was phenomenal.  It was very nastalgic for me. For those of us that remember the TV series. I enjoyed it.
B009B51K9U|3.0|So...I don't really consider myself prudish.  I'm a father of two, and am very aware of what my kids watch and listen to.  Having said that, our household is not exactly a \\"Rated G,\\" curse-word-free affair.  My older child loves Green Day, and I bought the non-edited version of this album for his/her birthday.  By the 3rd of 4th song (\\"Kill the DJ\\") I had to switch it off.  Nearly EVERY line in this repetitive song has some version of the F-word.  Now, again...I love me some Rolling Stones, John Lennon, Beastie Boys, and many other artists who have liberally peppered their songs with \\"Mature\\" language.  And I, too, enjoy Green Day, particularly \\"American Idiot,\\" which, to be fair, has its share of cursing as well.<br /><br />But this (\\"Uno\\"), to me, was ridiculous.  I can't remember another time when I actually had to switch a song off so my kids wouldn't be bombarded with F-words.  And I have NEVER been a fan of, or purchased, an Edited Version of ANY album...until now.<br /><br />Also, the songs themselves are nowhere near the level of creativity of \\"Idiot\\" or \\"21st Century Breakdown.\\"  And that's fair; not every album has to be a classic.  I just wish I hadn't had to buy this album twice so my kids could listen to mediocre songs being bleeped.

B0013O123Q|1.0|This movie tried too hard! The story line was all over the place. I love these actors in other movies but in this the entire movie is a mishmash of all kinds of confused fillers. As the others stated, Rape scene is extremely disturbing but in the overall plot of the movie, there was no reason for a 10 minute rape scene anyway! Can't recommend the movie, it was boring and tried to hard to mold itself in the new extreme french bandwagon.

B003YCI1O8|4.0|As mid October rolls around, brisk winds sweep through the crisp autumn air, jack o'lanterns decorate steps and porches, the scent of wood smoke radiates from wood stoves, and the leaves are in their peak season of color. October is a magnificent month, and in celebration of its annual visit, I've decided to review a few great flicks for the Halloween season. The titles that I've chosen to review are \\"alternative\\" Halloween movies... not the classics that generally spring to mind, but fun movies with elements of the supernatural. Just good, lighthearted stuff here... nothing gory or scary (at least not too much)!<br /><br />One such flick is \\"Tremors\\"- a hilarious monster movie that will make you laugh more often than it makes you flinch. The acting of Kevin Bacon and assorted redneck characters is delightfully cheesy, and the writing of the script toes the line between comedy and tension brilliantly. Although you'll be laughing, you'll also feel true anxiety as you desperately will the characters along to the next piece of \\"safe ground\\", where they'll be protected from the subterranean beasties. A great \\"alternative\\" Halloween movie, if you want something more fun than all the senseless slashers.

Here we get to see Matthew McConaughey go buck wild in his most testosterone-fueled role to date, as he leads an implausible (yet delightfully entertaining) battle against none other than a bunch of irritable, flying reptiles. What's extra fun is that we also get to see Christian Bale in a unique sci-fi role before he became a household name for his legendary turn as Batman. All told, this is a fun, well directed monster movie with great special effects and fantastic monsters. A great pick for an \\"alternative\\" Halloween movie during those crisp October nights!

B002BU0DPE|5.0|The Turtle Beach Earforce px21 in my opinion so far is a good headset and do not feel cheap like other reviews are saying I bought the last set of these from Wal-Mart. The sound quality is Great since you can listen to your games through this headset in great stereo surround! I do notice one thing wrong with amazons pictured product it is not the product I have my headset is black and red and the one in their picture is blue? So I think maybe some of the people that bought these years ago maybe had problems, but I have not yet and I love them so far. They were 79.99 at Wal-Mart and if you're really unsure about them purchase Wal-Marts warrenty I recommend trying them out if you're a hardcore gamer. I will post back in a few months if I have any problems but they really DO NOT feel cheaply made and are comfortable on your head!

B008XNZMOU|4.0|Judging by the album's excruciating first single, \\"We Are Never Getting Back Together\\", I almost resisted my temptation to buy Swift's latest release.  The album is a mish-mosh of infectious pop tunes and familiar, reflective heartbroken ballads we've come to expect from the bombshell.  Still, Swift packed some freshness with this album that may have given her previous sound a little tune-up.<br /><br />All too familiar, the pleasant \\"Begin Again\\", \\"I Almost Do\\", are the ear candy that emit the natural charm of Swift.  \\"Stay Stay Stay\\" and \\"Red\\" are adorable, and can't keep us from smiling and singing along.  Some less junk food tracks, like \\"Holy Ground\\" and \\"The Last Time\\" (featuring Gary Lightbody of Snow Patrol), show Swift's step away from a cliché country sound.  Still the cheeky \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and \\"We Are Never Getting Back Together\\" don't hold the honesty or the heaviness of \\"Dear John\\" from her last release, \\"Speak Now\\".  The album is somewhat dark, or at least reflective, with a good many of the tracks having depressing undertones disguised by a pop backbeat-- like the song \\"Treacherous\\".<br /><br />This album holds a stark contrast between Swift's first, self-titled album, which consisted of a plethora of untapped, pre-teen diary pages.  Some may call it artistic development, some may call it selling out, but Swift's shift in artistic style is clear in \\"Red\\".  Swift has eased into a comfortable zone, ditched the country façade and seems happy about it.  4 stars!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really like this story. My daughter and I are reading it together and we like all of the characters. She reads the books and I read from the Kindle.

I would highly recommend this app for any Android device.
B005S9ELQ2|5.0|This is easily the best American made, major studio backed film since \\"The Dark Knight\\". Actually, it's the best<br />movie I've seen from any country backed by any studio in many, many years.<br /><br />The film is exciting without being graphically violent, at least not compared to most<br />historical/war dramas.<br /><br />Director Ben Affleck does an excellent job of providing comic releif early on, and<br />paying homage to the magic of Hollywood throughout, without leading the viewer to<br />feel as if the seriousness of the situation is being watered down.<br /><br />The cast is great, too. Ben Affleck does a fine job (although his best work is<br />behind the camera) but the best performances are given by John Goodman, Alan Arkin<br />and Bryan Cranston, all of whom (if life were fair) would receive Academy Award<br />nominations for Best Supporting Actor.
B0085Z3B2Q|1.0|Bad corporate type leader keeps trees from growing so he can sell his bottled air. Bad money hungry businessman has cut all the trees down to make more money. Really? Plus the music is really cheesy. Wasn't a fun movie to watch at all the 3d animation was cool.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Avengers is one of my favorite movies ever and it is just as enjoyable on Blu-ray as it was in theaters.  The packaging and its contents is pretty standard with a Blu-ray and DVD but does come with the ability for a 2nd screen application however there is no Android application which is frustrating and the PC web browser method would not sync with the movie so I was not able to use that functionality.  In the end I think this is a movie worth owning which is why I ordered the Phase One bundle and Amazon was nice enough to offer a free copy of the 2D Blu-ray as compensation for the delays with Phase One.  I watched it twice in the first two days I owned it and I will be watching it again soon.

B008I34ZG6|5.0|There is much to like about this album.<br /><br />- It's by the Fowler/Duke/Thompson/etc edition of the Mothers, apparently the most popular of them among Zappa fans.<br /><br />- Frank had been woodshedding on the guitar, and it shows.<br /><br />- It's fun, the arrangements are as tight as a gnat's wotsit and it contains (in my opinion) Frank's greatest guitar solo, the nutty workout in \\"Zomby Woof.\\"<br /><br />- Tina Turner and the Ikettes sing on it.  The story goes that Ike Turner forbade Frank to credit them on the elpee notes because he didn't want people to think that they'd sing for anyone but him.  I wonder if he was also miffed that Frank got them to sound more joyfully naughty on the recordings than Ike ever did.<br /><br />- It was this era that the great Weird Al Yankovic spoofed with his masterful FZ tribute, \\"Genius In France.\\"  For that reason alone, you need to buy this artifact.<br /><br />Many reviewers felt that Frank Zappa was selling out with these recordings.  They're certainly more \\"commercial\\" than much of his previous stuff, but it's not vapid pop fluff.  Gone were the Serious Orchestral Woodwind passages of Uncle Meat, We're Only In It For The Money, Waka/Jawaka and Lumpy Gravy.  This is an album of sprightly mid-70s art/jazz-rock with mucky lyric and a sense of playfulness.  I personally love it, and it goes with Roxy & Elsewhere, the underrated Bongo Fury and Apostrophe'.  If you like them, you'll love this.

B008NABUU8|1.0|We own several devices and this game doesn't work on them. It lags big time, the touch screens are unresponsive. None of them are a Kindle, although I find it hysterical that Amazon lists a FAOTD for a game that isn't setup to work on their biggest selling device.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read books from all genres, and a truly good sci-fi is such a great change from the glut of murder mysteries that dominate the bestseller lists.  The one has all the hallmarks of a great story: drama, mystery, compelling characters.  And there's even some murder thrown in for good measure.  I've not yet finished this \\"omnibus,\\" but I am truly invested in the story and sneak away with my kindle as often as I can to sink into the world of the Silo.  Definitely recommended.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|This is a cute little hex based turn based strategy. You have your three factions - the insectoid Khralians (Zerg), the machine-like Titans (Protoss), and your standard human Sapiens (Terrans).    The gameplay is reminiscent of the Advance Wars series. Bases, aquatic terrain where your sea-faring unit can thrive, that sort of thing. Overall, standard fare but aesthetically pleasing and balanced well enough.    Not really much in the way of story. If you get this, get it for the wargame aspect or if it comes up as a FAOTD get it then.    Old Review: I had installed it on my Androidified Nook Tablet,  and it worked perfectly.  Had to reformat. Will not reinstall due to being incompatible. Messaged the developers and no response. One star until fixed.
B00112GVFO|5.0|Sure, the story may be far fetched and typical, the effects exaggerated. But it does a good job at entertaining. Not all movies have to be super smart. Sahara is made to be a fun action movie and it does just what it's supposed to do. Sometimes we all need some good old fashion adventure. And I've enjoyed myself watching it.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game. It is always there and it helps pass waiting time ie appts, picking up children at school, and break times. Can't wait until you get pirate dozer. My grandchildren love playing that game. I got hooked on coin dozer this past summer while watching the children in the pool. This game need no instruction just a little patience.
1401324649|4.0|The Hundred Year Old Man is a quirky, funny and unusual novel which not only provided some light entertainment, but also brought back memories of history lessons at school all those years ago - maybe I should have paid more attention then! Had our teacher presented the dry facts of major political events in the same fashion Jonas Jonasson manages to do by re-writing the history books with the help of his very unusual hero Allan, we would certainly have shown more interest.<br /><br />There were many moments when I laughed out loud during reading this novel. I could vividly picture Allan climbing out of his window on the morning of his 100th birthday and escaping the nursing home - I bet that many hundred year olds biding their time in such a facility have entertained thoughts of doing the same! But Allan is no ordinary hundred year old (if such a thing exists - all the hundred year olds I have met have been extra-ordinary and amazing people). He is also blessed with a mischievous spirit, a wicked sense of humour, an addiction to vodka and 9 lives. Blissfully ignorant as far as politics are concerned, he is blessed with wonderful common sense and the ability to take each person at face value, which lands him in the most bizarre situations with the most unusual characters. Jonasson's imagination has no limits where his protagonist is concerned - as the novel progresses and Allan's past is revealed, he makes an appearance and plays a leading role in some of the most fundamental political events in last century's history. With his colourful (and explosive) background it is no wonder that the hundred-year-old Allan manages to get into trouble as soon as he has left the nursing home behind.<br /><br />I have read several reviews which compared this novel to Forrest Gump. Indeed, Allan's involvement in certain key historical events brings back memories of the movie, but that is where the similarity ended for me. There is nothing sentimental or deep in this quirky tale of adventure and mischief, except that perhaps we should take a closer look at our senior citizens instead of labelling them as simply \\"old\\". Allan may be advanced in years, but he could give most of us a run for our money, and his rich personal background makes most other lives pale in comparison. I loved Allan's outlook in life - whatever is meant to happen will happen. Even in the face of his own death (several times) he is not worried or stressed.<br /><br />Jonasson's novel made a delightful change from the seriousness of life - this tale is light-hearted and fun, finds the bright side of most situations and doesn't take itself too seriously. By defying the boundaries of truth as we know it, Jonasson has created a light, enjoyable and funny story which can be enjoyed by all ages and both genders alike. My husband is currently reading it, and I'm sure he will get as many chuckles out of it as I did - if maybe at different things. I loved Jonasson's writing style - with his black sense of humour, no-nonsense language and keen observations, his statements hit exactly the right spot. Make sure to have a glass of icy cold vodka ready when you read this book - to toast the hero of the story, who would surely appreciate the sentiment.dventure and mischief, except that perhaps we should take a closer look at our senior citizens instead of labelling them as simply \\"old\\".

Right now I wouldn't pay $2 for it and if I did, I'd be disappointed.<br /><br />Too aggravating, uninstalled.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It goes without saying that this is a very different world from that of Harry Potter.  I would never have known it was by the same author.  But it is still very well written, and very shrewd in observation of adolescent thinking and relations of adolescents and adults.  The world is that of urban poverty, crime, and class politics - \\"hard boiled\\" it would have been called in the US 1940's.  Harry fans be warned!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Great game, but too dependent on In App Purchases to buy more Glu Credits, which are required to buy most items.
034580404X|5.0|A great set of books with an awesome love story. There may be a lot of sex, but the story line is something I have never seen before.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Entertaining read.  Classic \\"girl hopes to change boy\\" story, and *SPOILER ALERT* she does.  It doesn't work this way in real life, unfortunately.  But perhaps that is why books like this continue to be written, purchased, and read.  We never seem to give up hope (or the fantasy) that the boy will change for the girl.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft for xbox 360 and we just got 1.8.1 and its nothing compared to the kinddle version if u want to play with me my name is XxferrariboyxX
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put it down. Could not believe the range of emotions I felt for Eva and Gideon. Can't wait for Book 3!
B00005N6KG|5.0|hello,<br />  after using countless sets of headphones/earbuds, this one is by far the most comfortable and lightweight.  they sit behind your head on your neck or collar.  the sound is really good and since they do not fall out, it is great consistent sound.  of course, your music and activity may vary, but these are very comfortable and have quality sound.  remember, they are not $100 ear buds or the b - - - sound, but for what i use them for, it is very solid quality.  great amazon delivery and service.
B00936A0ZW|5.0|Wow...I love this album. This is an album that I am going to play from start to finish a lot! Nice phrasing and sweet warm sound to the album mix. I like the Zappa feel on some of the tracks. Buy this album and support the work that this phenomenal musician is producing. Nice job Paul.....keep it up. You pumped some new life into my music library.
B00973CGXK|1.0|I love all the other Killers albums, including most of their Christmas songs. This album is incredibly disappointing. Very disappointing. Sadly and unfortunately disappointing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is easy to play & it is a great deal of fun.  At the same time, it is challenging & often difficult to win.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I went into this with raised expectations somewhat, based on a few reviews I had read. Visual effects were amazing (great troll!), but the fact that Kristen Stewart seems to lack the ability to smile made this already dark story a bit overly dark. Would have been nice to have a bit more contrast between good and evil. Kept my attention, but probably wouldn't be one I'd watch again.
B003VWW23M|5.0|Hints of early Genesis and Kansas - but still completely original.  Making use of lengthy instrumental runs, complex vocal harmonization, and repeated themes, Blomljud is just a tremendous album.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I was watching it on Dish until they pulled AMC off their lineup. I complained to Dish and the gave me a credit to watch the season through amazon on demand. By far the best show on tv. Can't miss a single episode.
B008XG1X18|5.0|.....and now I can PIN where ever I go!!!  Now if I could stop pinning and do the projects, life would be grand!!
B008GJV056|4.0|Will Farrell at some of his Zaniest best. This movie is hilarious, weird, and awesome all at once. One of those movies that is just the right amount of wrong.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|For a fiction read it had a lot of truths in it especially the unknowns never discussed by couples in real life.
B009O8IMUY|4.0|Its not a \\"raunchy\\" show. Zoey is absolutely appropriate and crusadingly unscathed by her devil-may-care male roommates. Its adorable and refreshing, but that's just my opinion.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|This book is really insightful and hits the nail right on the head in terms of the title, why nations fail.  The recurring theme that institutions and politics matter rings true and is something more policy makers should be cognizant of particularly in small island states.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|I Love Minifigures, this is the best way to get Thor without buying larger sets, now if i could get the Big Lego Hulk ....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Well, this is so overrated maybe the most overrated book of all times.I said to myself well it is on the best selling books for a very long time it can not be bad well it is more than bad. just don't buy it don't waste your time and money on it
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This has always been my favorite Sci-Fi space movie.  I had it on VHS, and DVD, but a few years back when this 50th Anniversary Edition came out I didn't have the $25 dollars extra to buy it.  So, when Amazon had this advertised online, I was thrilled!  This is a great movie with excellent actors, with gorgeous sets, and COLOR!  The special features with a making of, and the history of Robbie the Robot are just what I wanted.  This is a story based on Shakespeare's \\"Tempest\\" play, and Warner Brothers studios didn't cut any corners on this movie. Buy this one!  You won't regret it! (BTW, my son wants me to say that you should buy it for ANNE FRANCIS!)
B005WMADYE|5.0|Redline is the one racing anime that I've completely enjoyed. It goes at a good pace, it keeps you interested, and it provides a variety of interesting characters. The animation in the movie is perfect. Well worth the price.
B000QCUB8I|5.0|I ordered this cd looking for good electronic music and it delivered. The album really draws you in and gives a very powerful feeling. The beginning and end of the cd are the best, but the middle songs can be a bit weak.
B007RI56NY|5.0|These songs are great-I love Train. It has a nice blend of upbeat and sweet songs. Definitely well-worth the purchase!
B002FE5XVK|4.0|It was a fantastic show however it was not the full concert. I had the original VHS tape and there were many more songs on it. I am glad i bought it but you might want to wait till they release the copy with all the songs on it.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|It's a great product. Works as expected and arrived in time.<br />As people says \\"The good thing always come in a small container\\"<br />Before use it I recommend to read the recomendations from the product website because you can use too much o too less of it on your devices.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|loved the movie, Downey as \\"Tony Stark\\" is great. Don't know why it took 4 hours to download. That's a first. Needed a little more HULK !
B008K5T5AI|5.0|I am not sure whether or not this serves as a good entry point to the Culture, having read every one it is hard to tell.  Iain M. Banks never lets the reader down.  I very much enjoyed this novel.  The several points-of-view, the well drawn characters, the Minds, the immediacy of Sublimation, the non-humanoid aliens are all very different conflicts that tie in perfectly.  If you're a fan of the Culture, this is a must.  If you've never read a Culture novel, I would start at the beginning, get Consider Phlebas.  It'll put you on a journey you won't regret.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game, challenging, not too short. Could use a bit more instructions but didnt take long to figure it out.
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Classic spoof of the horror fantasy genre. Senond in the series beginning with Evil Dead.<br />I wore out my old VHS tape watching it.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I may be the wrong demographic, but I'm in my 50's, don't listen to hip hop or rap or whatever this is.  But I love his music.  Great stuff!!!
B008966SLM|4.0|As always, a very good surprise. I bought this album without even listening to samples, and I love it. I have at least another 5 CDs by Robert Cray and he is always great.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|the 2nd book in the series started off just were the 1st one ended. I really enjoyed how the author  kept the story going with no lapse in time. throughout the book i enjoyed how the couple were not perfect.what i did not like was the fact you learn what happened to Giddeon but not in to much detail. i would like to know more about him. but overall the book is great and i am counting down the days until the next one comes out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A friend told me about Free Flow so I gave it a try and I loved it!!! I had never heard of the game before but, it has kept me entertained from the moment I started.  I like the different levels.
B007BL708G|5.0|Great Show!  The cast is great! I am rewatching the series right now because I enjoyed it so much.  I hope season 2 starts soon!
B009439HEY|5.0|There are no words for how happy this album makes me. To hear these songs played properly, with a 21st century mix, and the guitar parts standing out as they should, is a gift for every true Genesis fan. Grab your headphones, a comfy chair, and slip away for 2+ hours of shear bliss.
B009329ZF2|1.0|I like action movies, but this was almost unbearable. Terribly written, cheesily acted, an almost complete waste of time, don't waste your money!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Imaginative and enduring! great read for most any age. Is violent but not overly, keeps you interested from the start.
B0038P59A0|3.0|When I think of Sherlock Holmes, I have fond memories of the BBC series. This is not very much like that. Basically Sherlock knows Kung Fu, and every ten minutes there is an explosion. The conversations are difficult to follow because of the sound editing. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed Ironman. But with Sherlock Holmes I expect more deep thinking and intellectual discourse; less fighting and explosions. But that is modern movies, I guess. It was fairly entertaining, and even though I couldn't follow the conversations(likely missing out on some clever lines) it was pretty easy to follow the story line.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The only thing that I would change is to get more coins to unlock different games. I used to have this game and when I found it here I was so happy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Their love for each other is genuine and this book takes them in the right direction.  It was hard to see him hurt eva but bitter sweet after the news of Gideon's secret.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|Watch it if you love Denzel. Watch it if you love sci-fi. Watch it if you love to see good triumph over evil. The vistas are dirty and dusty. Even the colors are black and white. For me, it's been elevated to cult status. I thought the movie would lose its luster after one viewing. After all, the whole movie leads up to a reasonably good twist. On the second viewing, you start to look for clues to the twist; and they are there throughout. In the portfolio of sci-fi epics, The Book of Eli is right in the middle; not the best/worst. It's certainly worth the few dollars if you've never seen it before.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Jane Austen is a master storyteller. After seeing the movie with Gwenth Paltror  many times, I loved reading the entire story.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|i am on book 3, and absolutely hooked from the start.  i read book one, then watched the hbo series which i thought was great as well.  characters very well cast. i don't think i've read as many pages in such a short amount of time as in these wonderful stories.  the characters are described so well and all so interesting! the story itself is the most wonderful science fiction, i've always loved this period in time,castles, knights, queens and kings and even dragons, which at first i thought may have  gone a bit too far, but i was wrong.  i can't say enough about how entertaining this book is, i just can't put it down.  i saw season one on blue ray, season two hasn't come out yet, so after reading, i watched in on some internet movie chanel. not great qualilty, but not bad.  can't wait to finish book three and watch that series.  guess i dont need to say anymore, except, i love it!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Casual Vacancy is another of J.K. Rowling's achievements of fine writing.  The story is typically British and can be depressing as it follows the real life scenarios and secrets of people in small town life, however its depictions of the extents people will go through to get what they want are \\"spot on\\".  The ending is not happy, but realistic, predictable, but not a \\"formula\\" read.  If you are looking for a read that has a message - this is it.
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|When I got the book, I was excited to read it, but from the first couple of pages I was already angered. I did not want to read from the viewpoint of Annabeth and I think Rick Riordan has really lost his game. This book is bad don't read it. He wants to combine the Heroes of Olympus and the Kane Chronicles so if you want to read the next book you have to read the Kane Chronicles
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading 50 shades didn't think I would find a series that would compare. I enjoyed reading both books and can't wait for the third one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Another great read from Sylvia Day.  Can't wait for the next book!  Am enthralled with Gideon and Eva...they are too hot!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app for creative individuals. I am a photographer and filmmaker. I use this Evernote on my phone, kindle and computer. Anytime I am inspired I can write down my ideas or snap a photo and it's always accessible from any one of my devices. I love it!
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This particular item that I ordered was confirmed by LifeProof company as a counterfeit!<br />The product chipped when dropped, notified LifeProof to get a replacement, only to find out that it is a counterfeit product according to the reference number on the box it came in.<br /><br />Amazon was sent a copy of the email that LifePoof sent to me confirming the counterfeit.
B00684J49U|4.0|I used to be a Grey's addict. From season 4 on, season 5 at the latest, I kept watching because I liked the characters too much to quit just yet. Season 7 came and went quickly with feelings of embarrassment, because of the impression that the show had almost completely lost what used to make it unique and the actors unsuccessfully giving all they had, only to deliver pale copies of the amazing people they used to play incarnate. I felt I was done with Grey's for good.<br /><br />Now, over here in Europe, we are watching american shows almost on schedule with their broadcasting overseas. So I happened to catch Grey's' season 8 now and then, and felt that there was something going on there that might make it worth having a go at it.<br />I'm only at episode 6... but I keep marvelling at the writers really having gotten their 'Mojo' back!<br />I haven't seen such smart and snappy dialogues or riveting plots for a long time in Grey. I keep thinking and even saying out loud \\"Wow. Where have they been all this time?\\"<br /><br />I honestly had no expectation for Grey's to ever regain pace, much less to reinvent itself. Being the hardcore fan of seasons 1 to 3 that I am - not to mention that, obviously, there have been great moments in the following seasons - I feel grateful to witness such surge of creativity and huge draft of fresh air in season 8.<br />I now do warmly recommend it to anyone who looks for drama, comedy, quality acting and entertainment. (I still would encourage anyone who's new to Grey's to start from the beginning, as the evolution of the characters is one of the show's stronger assets!)
B008BSPQ3E|1.0|How did the label even bother to assemble this boxset WITHOUT the magnificent remixes of \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"In your eyes\\"?!?!?!?!<br />I'm terribly dissapointed.<br />5 stars (of course) for the original album, but zero stars for this expensive release.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A well written story with characters that you quickly grow to care about. This book is set in a fascinating world that you'll soon become engrossed in. This book is hard to put down. I stayed up far too late to finish the final book. The first book is available for free. I purchased this omnibus edition about 10 seconds after finishing the first book.
B008NABUU8|4.0|Great engineering game for kids and adults.  Me and the kids are fighting over who gets to crash the trucks next.
1416987118|5.0|Nice update on an old (modern) classic.<br />Nice graphics and imagery.  Softness to the color and pictures. Not too busy.  Pictures go well with dialogue on each page. Fairly good pace for my 4-year old granddaughter.<br />Quick service as usual from Amazon.
B0089BSOPA|1.0|To anyone considering buying this DVD, please do yourself a favor and don't get it! This so-called sequel stinks and it can't hold a candle to the original (of which I'm a great fan and could \\"sing its praises\\" until doomsday). Put simply, it should never have been made and John Carpenter's heart was never really into making a sequel to his inspired 1978 film. Just read film critic Roger Ebert's reviews of Halloween and Halloween 2 for a proper assessment of these two movies. As he says, \\"It's a little sad to witness a fall from greatness, and that is what we get with Halloween 2.\\" Probably the only thing worthwhile about the DVD is the audio commentaries.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|My book of the year. I didn´t gave much credit for it before start tor read, but it´s a very good book. go for it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game its so much fun in has so much to do in it and takes awhile to win!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Simple stories of redemption and bonding, mothers and daughters, don't often get a lot of attention.  No.  No grand love affair, No Prince to \\"Save the Day\\" needed and No formula fairy tales to be found.  It was moving and wonderful.  I took my girls and we would have seen it a dozen more times in the theatres if our wallets would let us... I loved Merida's spirit but I fell in love with her Mother and the family in this story.  The humor was spot on and the pace was thrilling.  A Must Have!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Book was good on content, not sure still what all the fuss is for, just my regular reading. nothing out lan dish for all this hype. good characters and your average story like for this type of genre
B005MMY5RK|5.0|Obviously, this movie is a classic and an essential for anyone interested in film. The streaming worked well and the entire process was easy to enjoy and smooth. Watch this film if you care about film history.
B0091REZMW|4.0|ITS A COOL GAME SO FAR.  I AM JUST REALLY GETTIN INTO. I GOT TO PLAY A LITTLE MORE OFTEN THAN I DO.
B002V092B0|5.0|My Husband had a stroke about 3 weeks ago and found that the insight into the functions of the brain incredible.<br />A most helpful guide to help any one who has had a stroke.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I enjoy this movie. The only it said for 2 days but I only had it for 1 day. Eve
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is the best alarm app you can have with all the different features.It wakes me up every morning to my favorite song I love this app
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book contains everything needed to go from a novice who knows nothing about Kindle publishing to one who has published a Kindle book. It did it for me. The fact that it was free was an absolute unbelievable bonus. Look at what it helped me do.  [[ASIN:B009SZOAL8 In Hope of Mars]]
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I have watched and own Degeneration, and Damnation is a perfect follow-up. It keeps the original Resident Evil feel to it, unlike the live action movies and RE6. A definite must for RE fans.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This movie has some great action and effects. The story line is interesting and it has a great cast. The performances are good, but it just seemed like there was something missing from this movie. But all in all it's a good movie worth watching.
B007PVHANM|5.0|As much as Marley is about his music, the documentary answers a lot of questions about who he was and what he believed.  He is a fascinating person and this gives you an appreciation for his effort.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I'm a guy. Now I've loved her music ever since i heard \\"white horse\\", \\"tim mcgraw\\" etc. and ive listened to and have fearless and speak now. and i absolutely love those two albums and enjoy listening to almost every song which is rare for albums. and i can tell you i know the lyrics and can sing along to almost any song. songs like \\"tell me why\\", \\"hey stephen\\", \\"jump then fall\\" you name it. so after getting the album i spent a couple hours listening to the songs and i love it! i love \\"i knew you were trouble\\", \\"red\\", \\"state of grace\\" \\"begin again\\" great songs! absolutely love the album and her as well. she is just simply amazing
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|I was really looking forward to watching this movie only to end up being disappointed.  This movie had a lot of hype and the previews looked really good.  The problem is the previews are about as good as it gets and the ending blew as did the action on the planet that was the supposed origin of humankind.  It was a poor repeat of an \\"Alien\\" series movie.  Rent it; don't buy it!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is great if you get the full version and like match 3 games. The demo only gives you a taste and then once you upgrade you have to start back over from the beginning.  either way, its a really fun game!!
B0015AARJI|1.0|This controller never quite worked right.  I didn't actually know that until I started playing an FPS game after the return date window had passed.  Playing an FPS with this controller is absolutely useless (and frustrating).  I had the sensitivity turned down incredibly low yet any time I tried playing BF3, yet I couldn't aim and shoot anyone as it would be either too fast or too slow.  After 4 months of use, the controller no longer turns on unless it's plugged in and the sensitivity is still all over the place.  I called Sony and they stated that the model number of controller being sold on this site is not in their database and there's really nothing they can do.  They said there should be a warranty period but good luck with that.  You are much better off buying one from the store or from Craigslist as this controller won't last long for the price, nor will the battery.
B0043UGKAM|5.0|My father turned me on to this show during a recent trip to Seattle.  Apparently both he and my mother had watched this and thought that I would enjoy it.  I was hesitant but he insisted that I start it while they were there.  So, we sat down for a episode.  I was immediately hooked...I'm not sure if it was the stylistic manner in which the series is shot and edited that I enjoyed or if it was the intensely bloody scenes, sexual overtones and knock-out hot sex scenes or the stellar acting (Check All of Above).  Either way, this show grips you from episode one through to the climax of the series and I highly recommend it for those with open minds that are looking for a guilty pleasure.  Spartacus Season one delivers and I tore through it with an addiction for more like a crack addict!<br /><br />I've caught myself talking about this damned hot romp with cashiers, coworkers and friends.<br /><br />I challenge you not to find an attraction to the lead actor (Spartacus) while watching this series.  The news of Andy Whitfields death shortly after season one aired truly had an impact on me.  This series is worth your time for both men and woman.  It's just simply HOT!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I find this game to be a really fun &quot;pass time&quot; game. Just wish I could find more like it. Only trouble I've had is adding friends.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Although it's not essential, seeing Taken 1 prior to Taken 2 is worth the effort. I'd rate both films highly and right up there with the Bourne Triology.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Oliver and Company is a 2009 re-release of the 1989 Disney animated classic based on Charles Dickens' timeless classic Oliver Twist. In this film, Oliver(Joey Lawrence, Blossom)is an orphaned cat living in New York City when he is befriended by a group of lovable but shifty dogs led by The Dodger(Billy Joel in his Disney animated debut). But when Oliver is threatened by a ruthless millionaire named Sykes(Robert Loggia), it is up to the Dodger and his crew to save Oliver and bring him to a new home. The voice cast includes Bette Midler, Cheech Marin, the late Dom DeLuise and Sheryl Lee Ralph was at its best, and the music by Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Ruth Pointer and Huey Lewis was great to listen to. The special features includes a behind-the-scenes look of the film, two Disney shorts including Pluto and Sneak Peeks of Disney favourites include The Princess and the Frog, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure and Space Buddies. Oliver and Company is one of the best modern Disney films everyone will enjoy.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I'm not sure what the others were complaining about, but this was a good game. I am now impatiently anticipating the sequel! Pretty good storyline,  interesting characters,  the mini games could be a little more challenging.  All in all fun game.
B004EWFV9K|3.0|This has to be the most bleak, unrelentingly depressing book in the whole Wallander series. Our hero is confronting aging, health problems, and fear of death. The case he's working on is a tale of deceit and betrayal and its resolution is a disaster. One has to wonder about the state of mind of the author. It is, of course, a must-read for Wallander fans and it will resonate with readers who have aged with the character.
1401322786|4.0|Yeah, buy it. This is one of those books that's left me thinking as its ideas weaved their way into my life.
B007XELMO4|4.0|I used this product on an all day hike. The positive was that I felt very secure the camera would not fall off. Another positive was the easy access to the camera. The only problem I found was that one had better keep the allen wrench handy. With the constant movement, especially if you are involved with elevation type of hiking the screw had a tendency to loosen which made the camera swivel at times.Other than that I am pleased with the product.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|Welcome back to 'Pumpkin Land' where Billy Corgan is King and we are all his devoted subjects.  I love this album. My recommendation is buy this album and turn UP the volume!  Every track is like its own musical genre ranging from progressive rock to folk.  My favorite tracks are Quasar, Panopticon, Oceania, and The Chimera. ALL of the tracks are expertly produced and leave the listener wanting to hear more.<br />---------------------------<br />Love the way<br />Love the way and learn<br />Try the way<br />Cast off your indecision<br />Face to face we breathe<br />Try the way<br />Cast off your indecision<br />Face to face we breathe<br />---------------------------<br /><br />A devoted fan/Pumpkin Head
B001ZG4J00|5.0|I absolutely love this music.  It is folk mixed with rock and really speaks to the time it was recorded.  I am upset that I took so long to discover this gem.  Thanks to 60 minutes for bringing this great artist to me.  Anyone who has a passion for 60's and 70's music will absolutely love this CD.  I only wish there was more of his albums around but as far as I know, this and Cold fact are all there is..
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i thought angry birds was addictive but this game is way addicting. this game is the next step from that game. i would highly reccomend this game to angry birds fan. i would reccomend getting this game very good

1577314808|5.0|Amazing book, living in the moment is a great practice , the act of living ego-less has changed my life for the better .
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game. I play on my kindle fire. the only problem I have is putting it down!  Hours of fun
B003WJQ74E|5.0|What a unique story that follows through!!!! Wonderful read, you really feel a lot of emotions while reading this book.
B00795P4EG|2.0|great idea ....IF you could use it....closes on my kindle fire every ten seconds...if it wont stay open it does me no good...app works fine on my Android phone.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and challenging. As the game goes on your skill must increase on order to react to the faster pace.
B007STBUHI|5.0|This item arrived in a timely manner and was as described.  Can't wait to watch this with the older grandchildren.  We were appalled this summer when we learned they had not seen it.
B009UQC7NS|4.0|A few slightly clunky moments that I won't get into, but overall, just like the first ep of this season, great acting, great intensity, great drama.  I don't see any fat in these first two eps, unlike season two which had a bit of filler (no more than many other shows though, I'd argue).  Dynamics continue to shift and there are surprises around every turn.
B001DCN178|5.0|A very complete product, is really amazing what you can do with UMA25S. It works with every music software an that's just what i was searching
B008NABUU8|3.0|my only real complaint is lag loading a level. it takes a hot minute to get started but once its going its pretty enjoyable. all in all, for the $0.99 I paid it was worth it. I wouldn't go over $1.99 tho,  not at least until it speeds up a bit more on loading
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this series! In my opinion it was written better than the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy. I can't wait until book 3 comes out in December!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Highly addictive...can't get enough!!! I love this mind challenging puzzle. Great way to relax, play during down times! Being a battery hog is the only negative.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this is a free version but it includes a lot. you have the option to buy more sounds if you choose. this version includes plenty.. like rainfall campfire ocean..the usual plus more. I personally enjoy this app and use it often.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I actually took the phone off the hook, locked all the doors and posted on Facebook that I was not to be disturbed the day this book came out and was delivered to my Kindle! I devoured this book in one day and now want more like an addict!<br />The second book in the crossfire series does not let down. So much so that waiting for the next book is pure torture! This series is so much better that 50 Shades to me because Eva is such a strong character. I can admire her because she does not have to put up with anything and proves it often. I don't like spoilers, so I won't say more. This series is so addictive that Mrs. Day's fans will be stalking her waiting for more on Gideon and Eva!
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a very enjoyable game I like it.  it wasn't too hard but it wasn't easy which was the reason why I liked it.

0307474259|5.0|Worthy of your time and thought.  I have had great sucess with male patients from my clinic reading and working with this text and in small groups. Several changed their live styles more that a year ago and following the advise of the book have droped and kept 20-30 and 50 pounds off.  This book is not for those without and open mind or who believe that the AMA and the Goverment are the final word on nutrition.  However if you are interested in the a simple and fair explaination of weight gain and loss and are willing to change your life style (not go on a diet) this may be a great text for your careful and  thoughtful read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the second best game on kindle fire ever. From PC to Kindle. (First is Modern Combat 3) I just luuuuv this game.
B003TXSF5C|3.0|I am very humbled by this man.  He has done so much with so little.  His theories are interesting and brain stretching.  I am bothered though, by his failure to acknowledge his M-theory as theory.  Some physicists do not believe that the M-theory is fact but rather is an ultimately unprovable scientific theory bordering on a religious belief.  It would be nice if Dr. Hawking would have presented it honestly as controversial-with some credible detractors.  I did very much enjoy the text.  It is recommended even for the non-physicist like myself.
B0029LHWL8|1.0|‎\\"My suffering has left me sad and gloomy,\\" and already I'm rooting for the tiger to eat you! How did anybody every find this book engaging! Twilight is more upbeat and has more action! And its manlier! Pass!

B008FSCNTK|2.0|I LISTENED TO THIS ALBUM ONCE, AFTER ARRIVED FROM PRE ORDERED,<br />MAN I COULD NOT FINISH ONE SONG, I HATE THIS STYLE OF MUSIC, I RATHER KEEP LISTENING HER OLD ALBUMS, I DONT THINK THIS ONE WILL FIND AN SPACE ON ME....<br />GOOD LUCK, I AM GLAD THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS OPINION, I AM NOT SURPRISE ABOUT REVIEWS AND RATINGS HERE I WILL GIVE 2 STARS FOR THE COVER PHOTO...
B009SCRERI|5.0|We love the Tinker Bell movies and this one did not disappoint.  It was a wonderful story filled with adventure and fun.  My 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter really enjoyed!!
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I first learned about TDCC when I heard \\"what you know.\\"  A very catchy, fun, energetic song.  I felt that the album as a whole was rather weak though honestly.  I cannot go through the entire Tourist History album without wanting to skip every other song or two in a row.  Don't get me wrong, it has some great songs, I just don't like it as a whole and I've listened to it several times.  This new album though, has a wonderful flow to it and I feel is a great improvement.  I can listen to almost every song on this album and be put in a perfect trance of sound.  I won't go into a review of how I feel on each song individually, I'm sure others have done that, but you should really give this album a chance.  It is different then the last one but again, I feel it's a great improvement over the last one.  I like the direction they are going and hope they improve even more on the next album to come.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I preordered this item with my amazon prime account. If you order more than six items from amazon per year it is completely worth it! Anyway it was wonderfully refreshing to watch a movie that was a blockbuster high budget film without the constant cursing or nudity. It's hard to find movies we can watch together.
B0045EA1P6|4.0|Fun. is an awesome band, and their album \\"Aim and Ignite\\" is infinitely better than \\"Some Nights\\". This album is full of songs that are upbeat and catchy without needing to repeat just one line over and over again. With this much of a discount, it was well worth the money. The music itself gets 5 stars. However, it was a little annoying downloading the music onto the Amazon player and then needing to switch them over onto my iTunes.<br /><br />Overall: definitely worth it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I know its 7$ but I think that's a really good price and this is a awesome game.
B009KHCRVO|4.0|Tounge in chesk look at the political climete of the second decade of the century with the always popoular Nazi Enemy. After all, that's about the only gruop you can still treat badly and get away with in this modern, oh so PC, world. Very funny satire and visual quotations of many other movies in the vein of Kung Fu Hustle. Out Steam Punks Sucker Punch, I especially love the Star Wars themed Nazi helmets, made me laugh out loud.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|awesome app  . . . it will tell how much time you have left for playing games for watching videos and everything else under the sun!

B0087JTAKW|5.0|This short book will make you think, as Mitch Albom's books do. How do I think about time? Do I think about time? When did Man begin to think about time and why? Our book club read this and the discussion was lively as usual. Highly recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book!  It's a page turner. Beautifully crafted text. Alliterative elegance! I really enjoyed this science fiction title. Similar theme to the City of Ember. Can't wait for more!
1423140591|5.0|I enjoy these books as much as my kids, great way to learn about Greek/Roman mythology with a fun spin. I recommend for all ages.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|If I could give this movie 3.5 stars I think that would be a little better.<br />I did find this movie entertaining, but I think it could have been better.<br />Charlize Theron steals the show, hands down.  I hate Kristen Stewart as Snow.<br />This movie wouod have been much better with a different actress in that role.<br />Her acting sucks, and she always seems sad.  She's just a depressing person in my opinion.<br />The dwarves are awesome!!!  They totally add the comic relief that Kristen Stewart kills. And you have a Norse god in the mix too!!  How can you not like Chris Helmsworth?  He's a bad a$$ pure and simple.  If you're a guy and you don't want to be him then you are lying!<br />I did like the storyline, and thought the pacing was good.<br />Overall this is a movie I'd watch once.  Probably not more than that though.<br />If you're bored and there's nothing else then maybe give this a shot.<br />Hope this helps someone.
1423140605|5.0|Another great installment in the series with good character progression and plot keeps you wanting to find out what's next

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I could not put this book down! Today is the print release day and I already received my Amazon shipping notification  I am hooked on the journey of Eva and Gideon. Heads up :p This is definitely an erotic romance. It's very steamy. There's lots of sex and it's very descriptive in the word choices and terms. That being said, it's also a very powerful novel of love and the relationship struggles of two immensely damaged people who are drawn to each other and see a better reflection of who they can be because of each others love . *sigh* It's very beautiful... If you have NOT read Bared To You , don't read this one yet!<br /><br />If you like erotic romance with a lot of angst, drama, steam, pain, heart, steam, passion, humor, steam and love, then pick up Sylvia Day's Crossfire books. There were parts where I want to shake the hero and heroine... or hug them. I am wrapped up in their messy lives and cheering them on as they fight their way through the land mines that block their way.<br /><br />Eva and Gideon's relationship roller coaster continues in this second novel in the Crossfire series. Their baggage is still being unpacked and issues continue to pop up because of the abuse they have suffered. On the outside Gideon appears very strong but he reveals his insecurities to Eva and his fears that he is not worthy of love. Eva struggles with similar emotions and both of them are new to real romantic relationships so they have to address each others jealousies of past partners. They are very possessive of one another. I think that's because they have really laid themselves bare and revealed so much of their wounded, scarred core. Eva and Gideon value the freedom of being themselves with each other and dropping their masks.<br /><br />\\"`And I knew you say me, too. Saw what I am... what I have inside me. You saw right through me.... No one's ever seen me before, Eva. You're the only one\\"<br /><br />My throat tightened painfully. In so many ways, Gideon was a hard man, yet he could be so sweet to me. Almost childishly so, which I loved because it was pure and uncontrolled.\\"<br /><br /> They both fear the loss of that love and honesty, that the other will wake up and see them as unworthy and dirty and walk away. They are working through their issues in the best way they know how. They are going to a therapist too. It does not make you weak to go to therapy,  in fact, it takes strength to acknowledge that need.  I appreciated Sylvia Day for bringing this element into the story.  They recognize they're damaged and need help and it's portrayed in a respectful manner.<br /><br />I love Eva! She's a survivor. She's been through hell and back. She has a lot of hot buttons and issues that rear their sharp claws and she has to decide what she wants or if she is going to keep running away. One particular act born of her insecurities and jeolosy made me want hug her and to sit her down and have a serious conversation with her! &lt;g> Yes, I think of this fictional character as a friend (not that I'd want to know that much about a real friends sex life! lol) Sylvia has made me care about Eva and want her happiness.<br /><br />\\"I had to stop running. Gideon and I were both going to have to stand and fight for this, for us...\\"<br /><br />Gideon has triggers too. They are learning to deal with their emotional trauma and make allowances for when the other screws up and love each other scars and all. Their connection, at first, is the chemistry between them. It burns off the freakin' page! So much heat... But it has developed into a hunger for the heart and love of someone who sees them completely, knows their past, but accepts them for who they are now. Gideon has control issues (for very valid reasons) he also has a distrust of the word love. In his experience love was something that could be forgotten, turned away from or abused. The word had lost it's value to him and is not a strong enough word for the passion he feels for Eva.<br /><br />\\"I'll kill for you,\\" he whispered, \\"give up everything I own for you... But I won't give you up.\\"<br /><br />This story is a gut wrenching ride. And yes, there's HOT, descriptive, jungle sex. It did feel like there was more relationship building in this noveland a smidge less sex. The love scenes, in my opinion, do build your understanding of Eva and Gideon's character and how they express so much of themselves through the physical.<br /><br />\\"He could say with his body what he couldn't say with words, and my lust for him was how I proved my faith in us, something he needed to feel connected to me.\\"<br /><br />They have to learn to open up emotionally in a non-physical way as well and communicate their emotions through more than sex. I finished this book feeling like the entire story was about them rebuilding trust and learning to have faith.<br /><br />Here are a few more of my favorite lines... that are safe to post :p<br /><br />♦ \\"I was in love with that tender, deeply emotional man. And I resented the facade and his attempts to hide himself from me. Turning his head, he caught me staring. I saw a glimpse of my beloved Gideon in his wild bule gaze, which briefly exposed a helpless yearning...\\"<br /><br />♦\\"And maybe, if I'm really lucky, you'll feel better tomorrow and like me again.\\"<br /><br />♦Ah, God. My heart ached in my chest. \\"I like you now, Gideon.<br /><br />\\"His kisses were gifts. He kissed with everything he had, with power and passion and hunger and love. He held nothing back, giving everything, exposing everything.\\"<br /><br />Sylvia Day has written a hot, powerful, heart wrenching story of two wounded people who see each other for what they are and learn to trust and love. I am eagerly waiting for the 3rd book.

B004NS710C|4.0|Denzel Washington is excellent as usual.  This is an exciting story.  It keeps you involved on several levels.  There is the human interest side of it with the family situations faced by both lead characters.  Then there is constant danger to those on the train as well as thousands of others if the unstoppable isn't stopped.  Even if you have narcolepsy you will not go to sleep!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to navigate this bible app with choices on the Bible Version<br />(King James, NIV, etc.) Many (but not all) of the versions can be<br />listened to which helps with pronunciation of words and the context.<br />You can highlight words or entire verses then save by \\"bookmarking.\\"<br />Another help that is useful is choosing a plan,  The version I have<br />is the 31 day plan which gives you the option of being reminded each<br />day and your choice of the time.  This area is also very easy to<br />navigate. There is so much more that I could say: reminders to your<br />email if you get behind, a calendar that you can keep track of what<br />you have read, and probably many other aspects I have yet to discover.
B002NC8JEC|5.0|I bought the album - MANY years ago now - as an early Christmas present for my late sister (then roomie) and her late husband (then fianc&eacute;).  We played it repeatedly as we decked our meager halls with hand-crafted [read, home-made] decorations -- and well into the New Year, because it was such an upbeat, feel-good album. Somehow I ended up with it once the two of them set up housekeeping together, and I must admit I didn't try very hard to give it back.<br /><br />Fast forward to today - who does \\"records\\" anymore when iTunes makes CDs and MP3s so easy and space-efficient?<br /><br />My collection of Christmas Music - and I am THE Christmas Elf, so it is extensive and all encompassing - has morphed from records to cassette tapes to CDs to MP3s.  Along the way, a few old favorites went missing from the collection - THIS one among them.  I can live without some of the others, but I jumped on this one the minute I found it.  It is now safely imported into iTunes and I'm thrilled it will return to rotation in Christmas Season 2012 (which starts Nov. 1, if not sooner!).  The CD will be archived in its jewel case forevermore.<br /><br />Whether you are a Christmas NUT (as I am), a Christmas Music collector, or a Michael Jackson fan, this would make a GREAT addition to your collection - a memory of a sweeter, more innocent time, in their lives and in ours.  You probably won't play it terribly often (nor will I, anymore) but, if you are at ALL like me, you WILL include it every Christmas, whether as background for decking your halls or cleaning them, simply because it will make you feel good to hear it while you work.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure you will find the money well spent - especially when you hear a VERY young Michael's voice belting out some Mall standards you swore you never wanted to hear again.  It will bring a smile to your face.<br /><br />Madelyn Griffith-Haynie, CMC, SCAC, MCC<br />-ADD Coaching Field co-founder-<br />(blogging at ADDandSoMuchMore & ADDerWorld - dot com!)<br />\\"It takes a village to transform a world!\\"rld - dot com!)<br />\\"It takes a village to transform a world!\\"

030758836X|2.0|I'd rate it a 2.5 honestly, if you could award half points.  I started off enjoying the book, but the ending was one of those that leaves you wondering and I felt like I'd wasted my time.  I found the characters to be all annoying, and the author really set a sadistic tone on our society.  It will be a page turner if you're like me and need to know how the mystery will end, but it most likely will not satisfy you.  I don't know, the killer/psychopath in this novel was not \\"crazy\\" enough for me, their actions were but their thoughts... it wasn't quite enough.  I'd like to think someone that insane is a little more out of touch with the average Joe. Maybe that's why I didn't like it, found it more so disturbing, instead of thrilling. And, (SPOILER ALERT): it's never satisfying when the killer gets away with murder.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|The Avengers was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time was worth the money I paid for the DVD will be watching it over and over again hope they have another one just as good if not better. This movie is 10 stars plus.
0316228532|4.0|As a member of the Harry Potter Generation, I am the perfect age to read JK Rowling. I was 9 when HP1 came out and now I'm 21 reading the Casual Vacancy. I think people need to remember that this is her 1st adult novel. It's a change and challenge for her. Much like HP1 started slow and finished strong I felt like this book was not easy to get into but I was riveted by the end. I fully expect JK Rowling to pen more adult novels and for her skills to flourish with each new book, just as they did with the HP Series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|It's a must read ! I enjoyed the book very much as I do all of her books. It's unfortunate that we have to wait until march for the next book.
B007TK77QE|3.0|Had never read JKR work before so didn't have any preconceptions.  Loved her abillity to give succinct visual picture of characters.  Not a book that you 'can't put down' but a worthwhile read particularly for the female reader.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Found out about this show by accident .. Was cooking a holiday dinner and had tv on for company as I prepared meal  there was a marathon on  and bang I was hooked ! Good character development as well as good writing here for all to enjoy .
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This is the closest to a perfect movie I have come to in a long time.  Imagination, music, great characters.  Just perfect.  The imperfections in the acting remind me of the tale of the persian carpet.  Each persian carpet has a n incorrect knot built into it, because perfection is only possible in the hand of god.  The story is filled with forgiveness and extraordinary power.  Characters who can feel pain and forgive.  Even the evil queen is filled with sorrow, longing and confusion; lonely and pathetic.  She is addicted to beauty for the sake of nothing other than to feed her addiction.  The evil in this story reminds of the satan as seen through the eyes of dervishes....Satan was so in love with god that he refused to bow before man....evil in this story is a human construct, very much understandable, if out of control.  And Snow white, well she is sublime....\\"you cannot have my heart\\". understanding and forgiving.  resolute. \\" who will be my brother\\"  and \\"NO YOU CANNOT have my heart\\" and she sheds a tear knowing that she is denying a pathetic creature a desperate need.  The music brings you to tears.  The seen with the white hart is seared in my memory for ever.  This is a perfect movie.  Perfect.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This book opened my eyes to the world & reality that quadraplegics inhabit, in a really readable and accessible way.  Both the main characters were sympathetic and the back up characters were slightly stereotyped but still engaging. But it was the story of the relationship between the 2 main characters.  Ending good too, very believable.  Author dealt with a very emotive subject in a sensitive but down to earth manner.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I thought it was a very well written book.  It was incredibly sad with a brilliant humorous thread running throughout the story.  And a wonderful love story. A great book for anyone grappling with serious illness and the \\"hereafter.\\"
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Frankly, I seem to gotten lost between this book and Book two. The Hunger Games is a supposed to be a continuing narrative, but it seems to have become disjointed somewhere.
0316228532|1.0|A huge HP fan, I was expecting great things.  Instead, I was vastly disappointed!  First, as she is introducing us to her cast of characters in the first few pages, I found myself thinking that none of these people seemed likeable or even interesting.  Most seemed to lead sad, pathetic lives.  Then, in 2 pages (p.13-14) she dropped the F-bomb 4 times, used s... twice and included other vulgar language.  I was shocked to say the least.  I decided to read on, hoping things would get better.  Instead, by page 21 we are treated to a teenage boy having an erection on the school bus as he watches his \\"dream girl,\\" which resulted in his needing to go home and masturbate for 30 minutes!  At this point, I stopped reading the book and returned it!  While I understand that this type of language and vulgarity is, unfortunately, prevalent in our society, I find it offensive and do not wish to hear or read it.  I am surprised that Rowling, with her writing skills and excellent command of the English language, could not find other words to describe these people and scenes.  Did she feel she needed to include obscenity and vulgarity in order to entice \\"adults\\" to read her book?  If so, what does that say about her perception of her target group?  Does she think that adults can't/won't read a book without it?  If so, she certainly didn't learn anything about the readers of the HP series!  I sincerely hope that she will revert to the writing style used in the HP series for future books and not insult us by thinking that she needs to lower her standards with obscenity and vulgarity.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Syncs on my Windows laptop, Windows netbook, Android phone, and Kindle Fire.  Excellent user interface.<br />The only issue I have experienced is on the Kindle Fire - can't seem to move tasks up ore down (a very minor inconvenience).

B009CPJHY4|3.0|Some of the character development seemed odd to me. However, I'm a Judi Dench fan & her role, at least,seemed plausible most of the time. The scenes of India were interesting, too. Saves buying a ticket if you're curious....

B006LSZECO|5.0|I am almost finished with this book and it has been excellent.  One of my good friends just read it and she keeps asking where I am.  I've put it on my husband's kindle and know he will love it too.  Just a great twisted story.

B008C1O8CA|5.0|This is like listening to a mix tape of tons of Green Day songs to me! It contains elements from their entire catalog! The nostalgia that we all have for the \\"old\\" Green Day really shines through in this! Not a bad song in my opinion, howver I would not call it my favorite Green Day album. Definitley another great one though. I am very excited to see what &iexcl;Dos! and &iexcl;Tre! hold!!!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I like the character Harry Bosch,he is what a cop (detective) used to be like !!!<br /><br />Follow the rules and don't suck up to the brass,if they deserve respect give it,if not ignore them and stay out of the way!!!<br /><br />Harry is the personification of a real  \\"officer of the law\\"not a suck ---........<br /><br />I enjoy getting and reading the series on my Kindle..
B00679T1EO|5.0|We were hooked on the first episode.  Brilliant writing.  Brilliant acting.  Sharp dialog.  Fabulous costumes.  I earnestly look forward to each and evey episode.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This is a great collection of old music produced in the old style but with modern instrumentation.  I like seeing Diana expand her style.
B005HEWO6W|4.0|The crew is several weeks into the journey home and they are already running into problems. The warp drive is down for repairs and they are having energy shortages. Janeway is walking the ship just to see people and trying to make the crew relax and take the issues in stride. Neelix is cooking food from the hydroponics garden and the food is strange to many of the crew.  The captain wants real coffee as Neelix tries to serve her what looks like chocolate pudding that he is calling a coffee replacement.  Neelix tells the captain that she shouldn't use the replicator and save energy. No one tells a Starfleet captain what to do!<br /><br />The bridge crew sees a small nebula on the long range sensors. They decide to go there as the ship's sensors pick up omnicron particles that they need to collect for the antimatter converters. More energy means that Janeway gets real coffee....<br /><br />This is a good episode as the crew finds a new galactic life form that was heretofore never discovered or believed to exist.  The crew also begins to bond together as a team and interacts with each other in a much better way.  The old hatred of the Maquis and the Federation crew members is a thing of the past.<br /><br />I liked this episode as Janeway seems to relax and begins to not be a stiff and formal and the crew members begin to show friendship towards each other.  I recommend this episode to you.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King, the master of horror really delivers in this tale of a murderous clown.  I have been scared of clowns for years and this film cements my fear forever.  Every clown I see from now on will potentially be \\"Pennywise\\".  Parents, take it from someone forced to go to circuses, keep your kids away from clowns.  They are scary, and think about it, do you want your kids hanging around carnies away?  Anywho...<br /><br />This tv mini-series is based off the top-selling book of the same name.  This is classic horror, just as scary now as it was in 1990.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***Tech/Specs***<br /><br />187 minute feature film/mini-series on a double sided DVD<br /><br />Widescreen presentation<br /><br />Feature length audio commentary by Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid, John Ritter, Richard Thomas and Director Tommy Lee Wallace<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***Cast***<br /><br />Harry Anderson<br />Dennis Christopher<br />Richard Masur<br />Annette O'Toole<br />Tim Reid<br />John Ritter<br />and Richard Thomas<br /><br />and of course \\"Penny-Wise The Clown\\" is played by the great Tim Curry, famous from the 'Rocky Horror...' film<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***Final Thoughts***<br /><br />This tv miniseries shows you that 200 million dollar budgets are NOT neccesary to make a good movie.  Just a group of dedicated actors, a great director and fantastic source material.<br /><br />My only gripe is that this comes on a dreaded double sided DVD.  I HATE double sided DVD's, I used to work in a video rental store and they were our worst nightmares.  They scratch so easily and if your like me you always put the disc in wrong side down.  Anyway handle the disc carefully and you should be okay...<br /><br />Great movie, scary as hell, watch with the lights on and make sure to avoid all clowns afterward.make sure to avoid all clowns afterward.
B005HEVPEY|4.0|The ship is having energy problems and the crew needs to find sources of energy for the long trip home.  Neelix gives the captain directions to a planetoid rumored to have rich dilithium deposits that the Voyager needs for power. Torres will create a dilithium processor on the ship to convert it after they mine the ore.  While looking for the deposits, Neelix is attacked and left severely injured. Chakotay finds him in severe shock and dying and they teleport him directly to sick bay.<br /><br />They discover that his lungs are missing and they have literally been teleported out of his body.....<br /><br />This episode is the first with the introduction of an advanced alien race infected with a disease called the Phage.  It is a horrible malady that leads to catastrophic organ failure and death.  The aliens have been fighting it for thousands of years and it is a losing battle.  This is a pretty good episode and the actors are beginning to find their proper acting style for their characters and the episodes are getting better.  Faced with 75 years to travel home the crew begins to work better together and friendships and mutual self-respect begins to take form.<br /><br />This is a good episode and I enjoyed it.  If you are a Star Trek fan I think you will like it also.  I recommend it to you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app for pintrest is fantastic! It works great on my kindle fire. I love the way everything on it is layed out and how simple it is to see the pins and especially repine things! I would highly recommend this app.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Love this game! It plays great on kindle fire. My 7 yr. old thinks he is a great inventer because you have to build things for the pigs to drive. Very simple but entertaining game. If you love angry birds you will enjoy this game!
B009UQC7NS|5.0|I have been looking forward to the 3rd season to start the the first episode of season the was worth the wait good work writers.
B00846REIS|4.0|Reminds you of Fifty Shades but written much better! Pulls you in and you can't put it down. Although the characters have crazy issues.
B008NABUU8|3.0|Has orientation glitches and a few other issues on the Kindle Fire HD but its fun if you're willing to overlook them.
B008NABUU8|5.0|How convenient that this came out on the Amazon appstore for free the day my engineering statics class introduces trusses! I applied the basics of what I know so far and I can say the physics are very realistic. This is a must have for engineers and I love the high difficulty. I can sense there would be frustration towards a younger audience since there was no startup tutorial or building tips, but this is still one of the most educational games out there and I'd imagine the puzzle minded would take great pleasure in learning how to build a stable bridge.<br /><br />Game tip: triangles are stronger than squares.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a great read, it kept your interested till the very end.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved it! This book was just as captivating as the first. I cannot wait for the next book! -SL
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I read the hunger games book and loved it. The movie to me didn't think the movie lived up to the book either. Then i foun the second book, didn't to much care for it either. Then the last book of the series was a let down. It was fast pace she spent half the time crul up in a ball. She was like a robot, people was controlling her. She really didn't do anything. The loved triangle is non exsistent it look like she could care less. Then everybody died then those who didn't die left. if it wasn't for Peeta coming back she would of been an old cat lady. In the end i still like the first book.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie.  I had already seen \\"The Grey\\" before I purchased it.  I thought it was an awesome movie so I bought it.  The movie came in perfect condition and everything worked perfectly.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We can't wait for Season 5 to come out, we have all of them to date.  We are really pleased with the product, special sale price and shipping, we will use Amazon again.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have been doing out-of-body experience for long time now and some of the thoughts or writings in this book has very similar aspects as when I am in the state of OBE. As it confirms more to me that these experiences that I am having are truly happening. This book does not only tell you about NDE but can help people who are trouble confirming OBE.<br /><br />Good book must read for all those who are interested in the afterlife.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member. In my eyes,it is well worth the price. I hope that those who enjoy the show, even if they have seen every episode, would read this.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are the best books I have ever read!! I read all three in less than a week and that's an accomplishment for me lol.
0783226063|5.0|This product was exactly what I was looking for (for my husband). We'd had a VHS of the film, but no VCR anymore, and it's one of his favorite films.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|A eulogy. Forget Vinyl! There was radio. Then The walkman; then the iPod but you had to pay for the music. This is freedom: not restrained by local musical taste. All the music all the time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are fun and challenging but some are just a bit ridiculous.  Also the points earned are not enough.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is an awsome movie. I loved every minute of it, and my child loved it too. We watched the whole movie and never left the couch. LOL. I recommend this movie as well as all the other Ice Age movies. Guaranteed your child....and you will love it.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has great graphics, suspense, mystery, and tons more!  It has just the right amount of hidden object games and a great story to go with it.
B008NABUU8|1.0|I love the point of the game, but the app has too many bugs and force stops and you loose all progress. Also needs a &quot;hint&quot; or &quot;tip&quot; feature for harder levels!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you're a reacher fan I don't think you'll be disappointed.  As opposed to the potential upcoming movie :(<br /><br />worth the purchase or kindle download
B008U7ZPHS|3.0|I've read all the books of this series, and either I am getting too old or the story is getting too immature for me. Slightly disappointed, but if you've read the rest of the series, you're sure to read this too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game. it is quick &amp; easy. there are different variations to choose from &amp; you can ignore the timer if you feel like it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Nice fun program my daughter and son both enjoy playing the game. I would recommend this game to any one with young kids
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I have played the games sure, but just enough to get through the campaign.  This is a must see if you're a fan of sci fi.  Because it's darn good sci fi no matter what it's connected to.<br /><br />Nuff said.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|This was a WONDERFUL book. Action packed yet with the love for Rakel and Oleg very present. I have enjoyed reading all of the Harry Hole series.(and other Jo Nesbo books, too, though Harry is by far my favorite).  This one particularly kept my attention.....wanting to go on, yet not wanting to finish it. The bond between Rakel and Oleg and Harry is undeniably great...one that lived beyond the ending of this book.  I love Harry and everything he stands for......though he may have some crazy ways of doing things. If you haven't read one of his books yet, try the first in the series.....you won't be sorry.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My kids love this movie and so do we.  The book was great, but now with the songs they sing them and \\"act out\\" The Lorax by pretending to save the trees.  They want to plant a lot of trees now, which is great since we have the acreage to do it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, excellent reading kept my interest, i definitely recommend reading this. Actually i read book 2 first, and i wish I would have read this one first, needless to say I cant wait for the 3rd book.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I really enjoyed the second book in Ken Follett's Century Trilogy.  It covered a lot of time and territory, so it naturally doesn't go into as much detail as some might like in various places, but I liked it and am looking forward to the last book in the series.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I purchased this to reread the library book I read years ago. I re-visited the excitement I felt then that I still feel now whenever I see a new Lee Child novel is available.
B0050XFYNA|4.0|Some people may be turned off by this sibling romance but it was very thoughtful and well executed. It was a joy to see something this beautiful brought to life.
B00112GVFO|2.0|The book is much better.  Mathew is glib  and the movie fails to capture the essence of the book.<br />It just doesn't work very well.
B0037NVM2C|3.0|Watching T2 in 2012, you have to remember that this movie was one of the first big blockbuster sci-fi action flicks.  Special effects have come a long way, but in its day, T2 had CGI years ahead of its time.  So far ahead that this movie leans into that fact and skimps a bit on story.  The evolution of Sarah Connor from bungling waitress to pit bull is the interesting core of the story, and the warning to not become what you hate is powerfully delivered.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Arnie's career goals (young John tells the Terminator not to kill anyone) water down the believability of his Terminator character, and the horrid performance by the child star who plays John Connor are painful to behold.  Still, there's enough there to make it interesting with the regular length version, with lots of explosions, gunfire and liquid metal morphing. The Director's Cut goes a bit too long, but all completists and sci-fi fans should at least watch this once.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series. The book flows perfectly through the series and has many exciting moment. I am an adult and enjoy it. Great work.
B0051VH1EG|5.0|This booked helped me learn about the care and maintenance of my wavy hair and I finally have consistent 'good hair' days.<br /><br />The DVD that comes with it demonstrates the techniques described in the book.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|I love the movie so much. This DVD locks up on previews so much. Here is the thing about that...I WOULD RATHER DIE THAN BUY THE DVD REGULAR VERSION AGAIN. I WOULD RATHER DIE, GO TO HELL AND BURN FOR ALL ETERNITY THAN BE EXPOSED TO YOUR PREVIEWS ONE MORE TIME. I DONT CARE ABOUT FRANKENWEENIE. I HAVE SEEN YOUR CRAPPY \\"PREVIEW\\" OF INTERVIEWS WITH THE CAST AND I WANT TO PEEL MY EYES BY THE NANOMETER TO THE CORE AND FEEL EVERY LAYER IN PREFERENCE. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU DID THIS WHEN I PRE-ORDERED THIS FILM THREE MONTHS IN ADVANCE. MAY ZEUS CAST YOU INTO AN ETERNAL PIT OF SUFFERING AND DAMNATION TO ROT AND BURN UNTIL EXISTENCE HAS PASSED BY YOU INNUMERABLE TIMES. Love, me. :-)
B002BU0DPE|1.0|after 7 or 8 months the right headphone doesn't work. for 80 dollars for when i bought it this is terrible.
B009UQCD0K|4.0|At the behest of a commenter below, I've decided to update my review and focus more on the actual events of the show.  After watching Season 2, I was skeptical about the direction that the show would take in its 3rd season.  For lack of a better way to put it, the majority of Season 2 was, um, well... a little slow.  Thus far, Season 3 has given us a return to the action that I found so engaging in the 1st season.  I'm certainly looking forward to continued developments within the prison.  I'll leave it at that, as I'd rather not provide any spoilers for anyone who hasn't yet watched the episode.  If you haven't seen it, watch it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad but not a fan of some of the games. makes it difficult to earn points when you don't want to play some of the games.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|This movie has a great cast. It's like a modern day Mad Max movie with a twist at the end.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This is a good movie showing how the wonderful crew of the Enterprise came in to being. Showing the sometimes funny interactions the grew with time and learning to trust each other.
1476712042|5.0|I thought Beautiful Disaster refreshing and romantic.  I couldn't put it down.  I read it in a weekend and was sad when I was finished.  I am more into thrillers, but I like to switch it up with a romance novel here and there, and this was the perfect read.  Very sad I'm done with it, but very happy I read it.  It is a must read!
B008NABUU8|1.0|you dont even get enough. $for level 2<br />and that's. why its a load of @#$* and this is<br />not the first game that's @#$*ey no one should<br />ever buy this game again
B005IQZB14|4.0|Clearly Cheryl is an excellent writer, and the book 'reads well'. I highgly recommend the book, despite the fact that her naïve and ignorant approach to hiking can be a bit annoying. Also, she's sometimes a bit off-trail for long periods of time when she's thinking back in time.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|I guess I expected a bit more from this case, but it is functional and does protect the Kindle Fire HD well. In The buttons on top of the unit are easy to get to while in the cover, but the strap holding the top-left corner tends to get in the way of the audio jack. No big deal as you just push it aside and plug in, but just be aware of it..
0316228532|1.0|What a disappointment!  The only reason I finished this book was because I kept thinking it would get better, considering the author - it didn't.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This season did not disappoint me! I love this series!! The intertwined lives of the staff and residents keeps you interested. I also loved the beginning 10 minute history lesson about the castle itself. If you liked the first season, you will not be disappointed!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|*This book was purchased by me for my own reading enjoyment. Review also appears at SeductiveMusings.blogspot.com<br /><br />As eagerly as I was anticipating this book after my intense enjoyment of Bared to You, I was also wondering what Sylvia Day could possible do to provide a satisfying follow-up. Would it show real plot development and character growth, or would it just be more of the same \\"push me - pull you\\" dance between Gideon and Eva, interspersed with incredible sex scenes?<br /><br />I'm happy to report that Reflected in You has everything I'd hoped to find in a sequel. It has more of the same intense emotional and sexual angst that made Bared to You such a satisfying read, so you don't have to worry on that account. But there is also real emotional growth by both characters, however slight it may seem in some places, and it made me all the more anxious to read the next book in the series to find out what on earth could possibly happen next.<br /><br />The story picks up the next morning from the last night at the end of Bared to You, which threw me at first because it had been so many months past in real time since I'd read the previous book. Gideon is still dark and dangerous and moody as hell, and Eva is still trying to move on from a traumatic past without letting Gideon take over every aspect of her current life. As the story progresses, it's clear that Eva's past won't stay buried, and as various aspects of it reappear to threaten their future, both she and Gideon react in ways that may or may not be the best choices to help them stay together.<br /><br />Gideon still can't seem to trust Eva with his secrets. Eva still can't seem to trust Gideon with her happiness. Any rational person would say they are too dysfunctional to stay together. But by the time I reached the end of this second Crossfire book, I had a much better appreciation of their motivations and reasoning, I also had more confidence that they could survive as a couple if they just kept working hard to trust each other and not to betray that trust. Now I just have to wait until May 2013 (!) to find out if I'm right when Entwined in You is released for publication.working hard to trust each other and not to betray that trust.

Perfect balance between romance, drama, comedy and action!<br />I had to (really) restric myself to reed only 6 chapters per day so I wouldn't finish to fast...<br />Can't wain for the next one!

B003TSEEDY|5.0|IT WAS JUST SO FANTASTICALLY AMAZING IN EVERY WHICH WAY AND WHEN IT WAS OVER I COULDN'T CONTAIN THE JOY I HAD FROM READING IT. ALTHOUGH SOME PARTS MAY BE A LITTLE TO GRAPHIC FOR YOUNGER (EMPHASIS ON THE YOUNGER ........... LIKE 10-12) AUDIENCES I AS A 14 YEAR OLD HAVING ALREADY LEARNED BIOLOGY AND ALL THE REST WASN'T PHASED BY ANY OF THE SCENES PLAYED OUT IN THE BOOK.

B008JFUTUY|5.0|Further to all the previews above, the story of the making of the documentary is a moving tale within itself. Malik's dogged perseverance in the production of his film to the point of being penniless until his finding of a financier entitles him to a huge amount of admiration and credit too. Without that resilience, the Sugarman could have been lost to us.
B009FRG8IW|5.0|SHM seriously ended with a bang here.  This mix is awesome (includes Greyhound, Antidote, Calling, etc.).  There are only a couple tracks in this entire album that weren't worth 5 stars to me.  Definitely a good album for parties, working out, or just getting pumped up.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|There's a pattern going on in 2012. First, a smash single is released, and then its accompanying album is released, and it sadly does not live up to the expectation that one single promised the album to be. That could not be any more true for Taylor Swift's fourth album \\"Red\\". \\"We are never ever getting back together\\" was chosen as the lead single, and it was quite a smart move on Taylor's part, because its warped guitars, thumping bass, and spoken vocals made \\"Red\\" seem like it was going to be the most fun and unpredictable Taylor Swift album yet. But such is not the case. In fact, this album does not come even close to the fun, addictive pop that was \\"Getting back together\\". And while no one could have predicted dub-step influences on a Swift album, everyone could have easily known that there would be many songs about love and break-up that act more as filler than actual, substantial songs. And unfortunately, there are quite a few songs like that here.<br /><br />Before we touch on the music, let's look at the album cover. It's simple enough, Taylor's eyes hide under a shadow to bring out her red lipstick. When you compare this cover to her previous albums, her debut with a simple straight-forward headshot, a picture of Taylor turning her head to the side and he hair flying about, and a full shot of Taylor swinging a dress around making it twirl and flourish. All three of those covers were iconic and exciting the listener for what was waiting for them on the disc. That principle does not work for \\"Red\\". Just like its simple cover, its simple songs will not resonate years beyond their release, and Taylor really did not deliver the exciting album she was hyping it up to be.<br /><br />Back to the music, she starts out the album with \\"State of Grace\\", which flows easily into \\"Red\\". And then she glides through the saccahrine \\"Treacherous\\" and then completely changes her tune with \\"I knew you were trouble\\", the latter of which completely destroys Taylor's pigeon-holedstatus as a country singer. The rest of \\"Red\\" mainly follows this same pattern, a slightly catchy and bland song, an invigorating not-country-at-all tune, a whiney ballad, and then her usual country-fied pop. True, the question of whether or not Swift can still call herself a country singer goes unanswered here, since she still manages to keep her country roots in most of \\"Red\\". And another thing Swift keeps consistent is the slowing down each and every album that passes by. \\"Speak Now\\" provided a chunk of songs that were far too long and stiff to keep anyone's interest, and \\"Red\\" basically offers more of the same. Then again, what celebrities did she attack this time for breaking her heart? This is the first Swift album to not provide any distinct clues as to who she might be addressing, but in the process of taking away that obviousness, Taylor also stripped away much of her appeal. Her fans fell in love with the bold and sassy starlet that was not afraid to \\"Speak Now\\", who was \\"Fearless\\" and let us knew who \\"Taylor Swift\\" was.<br /><br />\\"Red\\" is a cold, calculated production that flies by effortlessly. While it is certain that \\"Red\\" will sell millions around the globe and its singles will all reach mainstream success (four songs off the album have already charted within the top 10), it is not the best Taylor Swift could have done. \\"We are never ever getting back together\\" is what makes this album, along with \\"Red\\", \\"Starlight\\", \\"22\\", and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\". The rest of the songs are either ok or stiff, never hitting hard with their hooks or production. \\"Red\\" flies by easily and it breezes through all sixteen of its offerings. It's more versatile than her previous albums, but there's no denying it: Taylor can do better than this.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|My wife really enjoyed the movie so we bought it.  The extended version is a little longer and better.  I am very happy with this movie.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I really enjoy this calculator.  It is much faster and easier to use than a general calculator. The reason I got this was to help my son with algebra...for some reason I thought it would perform equations.  That is probably the only thing I would change about this product...the ability to perform more advanced math. Otherwise, this has replaced my \\"button\\" calculator.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The whole family loves it! We first purchase the follow-up disk with the three shorts based on the movie.  Enjoyed it so much we had to get the full movie.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Unfortunatley, I didn't become aware of the existence of Showtime's \\"Homeland\\" until the Emmy Awards were handed out last month. But, upon seeing all the awards that the new show had earned, I decided to see what all the buzz was about. After purchasing Season 1 of \\"Homeland\\" the Monday following the Emmy's, I found myself spellbound as I watched seven consecutive episodes of Season 1. I found the show captivating. I turned Homeland onto my wife the following day and she caught up w/ me. We watched the remaining 5 episodes together. All in 4 days.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this show--every single episode! Not since the Andy Griffith Show have I enjoyed a cast of characters so much! The characters, their interactions, and the brilliant storylines are delightfully quirky and fun! I love these nerds. I want them to live next door to me. I want them to be my friends. I want to go to the pet store and buy a nerd of my very own.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great site. Get a lot of good ideas from it. Only thing is sometimes its hard to find friend unless they're on Facebook.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A game that'll keep you entertained for hours. It has stunning visuals as well easy to control gameplay. Fun story, intriguing puzzles, and now all portable. World of Goo is a personal favorite, and one of the best for a tablet.<br /><br />As far as the price goes, it's still cheaper than what I remember it being on other devices.  $5.00 is nothing for a game like this, I would definitely recommend this to any of my friends.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|It was an album that I had to listen to twice to appreciate fully but I love it!!!<br /><br />It is Fiona Apple so there are a few things that you should already know going in, like she's a little bitter, but in a good way!!!! This is a fine fourth album!!!

B0000549B2|5.0|Spike Lee's \\"Mo Better Blues\\" starring Denzel Washington and Westley Snipes has always been one of my favorite movies. The acting, music, and New York vibe is classic. The dvd arrived quickly and packaged well. Great buying experience!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I don't know if I can express how disappointed I am in this book.  I was really looking forward to what JK Rowling could do with an adult novel.  But this is not worth the time it takes to read it.  Her gratuitous use of profanity and crude situations, thoughts, etc.  is horrendous.  Teenage boys couldn't write something this bad.  Less than twenty pages in, she had dropped enough F-bombs (and other extremely crude language) to make a sailor blush.  and add to that, the is just plain boring.  I couldn't keep track of what was going on we'll enough to stay interested in the story.  I'm not finishing this book; I have better things to do with my time--like trimming my toenails or picking cat hairs off the sofa.
B009UR2QMO|5.0|\\"Once Upon A Time\\" is a brilliant TV show.  The writing, acting and direction is always excellent and the casting is of the highest quality.  This particular episode, \\"The Crocodile,\\" is probably the best hour of network TV I've ever seen.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle is, as always, amazing; but he has raised the bar again morphing from tenderness to anger to sadness to rage, all in one episode.  Colin O'Donoghue was very strong in his first appearance as Killian Jones/Captain Hook.  I expect great things from this very adversarial relationship.<br /><br />Highly recommended, my whole family watches \\"Once Upon A Time\\" faithfully.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Though I haven't been able to finish the book, I already love it. Rick's writing always pulls me in within the first few chapters. I'm highly upset I haven't had the time to read more of it. I'm hopeing more books will come out soon.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You version-<br /><br />Very easy to use, numerous translations at your fingertips. The best download ever!<br />I encourage everyone to try it!
014241722X|5.0|John Grisham simply has a knack for producing entertaining books that all levels can enjoy.  I got this for my fourteen year old son to read, because the books he was getting from weren't keeping him entertained.  I decided to look it over a little before I gave it to him so I could quiz him and make sure he was getting everything out of it.  I ended up reading the whole thing and really enjoyed it.  I'm sure my son will too.  I can't wait to read the other two books in this series and hope that there will be more to come.  I'd also like add that some of the people who do book reviews on here need to learn what they are.  I don't want to read everything about the book.  It spoils it.  They just go too far and that's not they way it should be done.  That is all.

B004J4WLPU|4.0|This book really held my interest.  I don't typically read murder mysteries, but this was recommended to me and I am glad I read it.  The devotion of the older \\"sister\\" in this book was heartwarming, although sad.  I really liked the writing style, too
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Can't say enough about this book.  Incredible!  Pete tells us about The Who's history but also his own personal story from rags to riches.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This is a very entertaining trilogy, for ages 9-90.  It kept me interested, I couldn't wait for movie to come out, but found when it did, book was better.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft. I am a HUGE fan. what I want on my kindle is a portal to the nether. I know people with the xbox360, and they have a portal to the nether. I want to explore the nether.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I thought it would be just another bad bejeweled clone, but its really entertaining! I enjoy the little story, the different types of tiles that give some challenge, and I even enjoy the music.
B001ZG4J00|4.0|Like many, I suppose, I purchased this music after hearing the story on 60 Minutes. The music is a genuine pleasure. Lovely melodies, interesting lyrics. The styles seem very dated to me--the music has a late 60s/early 70s feel to it, but since I like the music of that period, that was fine with with me. Perhaps if Rodriguez continues to enjoy a revival something can be done to update the sound a bit.
B001RP22G2|5.0|when i was recommended to listen to MASTODON, first i got their Blood Mountain album, and i dug it! even though i don't know much about metal, i love the arrangements on their fuzzy-distortioned but melodic guitar riffs accompanied whit the up-tempos of the hard but rhythmic beating drums and deep bass.<br /><br />Once i had done this, next thing i would do was getting this new Mastodon's album: CRACK THE SKYE...it is great!!!  the vocals arrangement is even more elaborated and neat, letting you ecstatic whit Brent Hinds shrilling voice combined whit Troy Sander's high-pitched singing...altogether whit such great rhythmic blasting drums, killer bass and a progressive and amazing guitars symphony that enters through your ears to get to your very core and makes you shudder.<br /><br />this is one of my favorite albums of all time!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game!  Lots of levels - some not so easy to get 3 stars (best time).  I play this on my Kindle Fire.  A few of the layouts are a little small for my eyes, but the majority are fine.  I figure the ones that are kind of small give my eye muscles a good workout!  :)
B00004TB7C|5.0|when i was just a 13 year old kid, i was introduced to rock music in general, through some punk-rock records and cds that i borrowed from a friend of mine... but this one very special day, he borrowed me the album TEN by some guys named PEARL JAM....and then i was introduced to my favourite (and in my opinion one of the best) band of all time!!! eddie's angst-full rough and impassioned singing style got me instantly, and the superb music filling that voice made me their recruit for a lifetime.<br /><br />Throughout the years i have been following Pearl Jam and i can say all their records have their 'thing', but as any other thing in this world, time does make you grow and gives you some experience that makes you mutate into something that is still you...but advanced or revolutioned or even more mature and wise...PEARL JAM'S BINAURAL album i would say is the moment in which eddie and the guys reached their grow up phase, which distinguishes the state-what-we-think kind of operationality period of their early years, from these new phase in which they become a more conscience-enlighten-through-reflection-and empathy guides.<br /><br />Nontheless BINAURAL still a very rock-ish kick ass album, with great guitar riffs and solos as only the binomial Gossard-McCready can play and such outstanding bass filling that only mr. Ament knows how to do. In this record they add the new drummer Matt Cameron (best known from playing previously in Soundgarden), and which replaces the great Jack Irons. In synopsis, Pearl Jam in this Binaural album still play the magic that they -and only they - can do.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very unique book. I loved how it was written. It was a page turner and suspenseful. Overall I thought it was a fantastic book. I want to read her other books.
B003YK42M0|3.0|this album i only give it 3 stars out of 5, i like it but isn't the best effort the Kings of Leon could have achieve. Well, comparing it to their first 3 albums, it is kind of difficult to overcome those 3 giants, i would say that it doesn't beat its predecesor Only by the Night. If you are a KOL fan you will like it for sure. Very good rock ballads and catchy rock tunes, specially the songs 'Back Down South' and 'No Money' (which is my favourite in this album).
0525952926|1.0|I am a fan of Ken Follett and eagerly awaited Volume 2.  I loved the first book but I am not sure who wrote this one.  I am not a prude but one more sex scene about Tongues up each other's mouth's  really  after a while this got old.  Jumping around from Character sometimes mudded the story line.  Also I can't believe one character gets the Russian invaders to rape her not an overly endowed 12 year old.  They raped any female.  Don't waste your money
B0014DCTCY|5.0|i started listening to the black keys back on 2007 when i knew they were opening Pearl Jam's european tour that year. I thought: 'well, if PJ is choosing this band, maybe they're good'.... but my first impression when i first hear the Black Keys was: 'oh my God, they're great'... in that time they had just released Magic Potion, and i got shocked and awed when listening to 'Your Touch' and 'Just got to be' from that album, the blues-rock kick ass riffs and the melodyc-bluesy tunes that Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney performed were impressive!!<br /><br />I instantly searched for any other albums they had released, and of course i wasn't dissapointed, the other 3 albums that preceeded were as good as Magic Potion. At that time they already got me hooked and i couldn't wait to listen to the follow-up album, so when the ATTACK AND RELEASE album was here, man i was fascinated not only because of the fact that even though they had become more popular, they didn't go mainstream, and for that, they kept doing tunes in they're such charachteristic style and also added a little bit more production on this release, combining keyboards and other instruments to fill up those awsome tunes of theirs, and it fit just right!!<br /><br />If you already had listened to the Black Keys before and you've liked them, you know what i mean, and if you are new to the Black Keys and you are really fond of searching for new music and pretty good original bands, this album will not let you down.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a must read for teachers, students and adults! This is one of those rare books that captures your attention and then your heart. The author uses various first person points of view to remind us to be kind and respectful of every person and their experience. It is heart-wrenching and heart-warming portrayal of both school and family. Wonder is a book that I will recommend - a book that I will read many times - a book I will share with my students.
B004OXCL5Q|1.0|Have ordered several movies from Amazon - never knew when I ordered this Blu-ray that there were Region codes.  Bought as a birthday gift.  Will return this.
B008BIZ06M|5.0|I've been a big fan of The Offspring for a long time. While some albums stray from some of the \\"roots\\" I would say this album is a good balance. \\"The Future is Now\\", \\"Secrets From The Underground\\", and \\"Dividing By Zero\\" have the sound of some of their older music, while of course \\"Dirty Magic\\" is a great remake of a song from Ignition. On the other end of the spectrum are songs such as \\"Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)\\" and \\"OC Guns\\" which have a sound much more reminiscent of \\"Pretty Fly\\" and some of those other songs.<br /><br />While I personally don't love every song, I think in general the album is very good and there aren't any songs that I absolutely can't listen to due to not liking the sound. I personally feel that \\"The Future is Now\\" is one of the better songs they've put out over the past decade.
0525953728|4.0|Interesting book, quick read. A look inside the world of Navy SEALS from a member of the team that killed Osama Bin Ladin.  Lots of details are glossed over in order not to release classified information, but a reader gets a sense of the training and operational tempo, and a blow-by-blow account of the Bin Ladin raid.  The weak point is the author's periodic insistence that he is not political, usually followed by cringe-inducing comments about his Commander-in-Chief.  The young author is a terrific soldier, brave and capable, but he should never ever forget that war is a national policy that is properly regulated by elected officials and informed public debate. His snarky comments about his President diminished the book.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Nothing more to say here. This is one classic movie that every man must see at least once in his lifetime.

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I think Lee Child was more focused on the end of the book than the meat in the middle. The book was filled with so much extraneous detail that I found myself skipping through pages.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Non stop fun even though Disney took over marvel theres no compromise on the subtle comic book violence.popcorn and fun big screen fun.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|It was a challenge to introduce all these heroes, some not initially excited about being there, some with no super powers besides their own killing skills.  I only have two major gripes: first that a huge aircraft carrier could float on 4 fans, much less 3.  Second, that this alien race and blue cube with untapped magic powers are given about 3 minutes explanation when they needed 10.  The whole fun of \\"Green Lantern\\" was the backstory.  We already know stuff will get shot and smashed.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is a film you have to respect. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is staggeringly sharp and phenomenal and you'll love to hate or vice-versa his character. Daniel Plainview is a man without mercy, a driven and cut-throat entrepreneur who knows what it takes to get ahead. A cynic and all around dark character, Daniel Plainview's maddeningly demanding role is filled perfectly by the gritty acting stylings of Daniel Day-Lewis. Set in the harsh period of the early 1900's, There Will Be Blood captures the ugly reality of oiling, religious fanaticism, and a slew of other period-related issues. The landscape shots paint a beautiful picture of the American West, and one can feel very engrossed with the time and feel of the film. Minor characters are even prolific in their roles, providing terrific portrayals of the common folk of that time. One may find the soundtrack grating however, this was the only negative aspect of the movie in my opinion. Scenes that are emotional or quite slow are given fast overlapping rhythms at times, to the point of becoming almost annoying and taking away from the scope of the scene. Love this film, hate this film, There Will Be Blood is unlike any movie of it's kind. It shows the truth and dirty history of oiling (or business in general) of the early 1900's and excels at captivating the horrifically dark lives of everyone close to Daniel Plainview. Give it a chance, I mean, how often do you see Daniel Day-Lewis in movies anyway?!
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|...then this sound track will not disappoint. Rest assured. I'm in a tad hurry but wanted to convey at the very least that it is worth the purchase. It is a mix of late 20th century and up to present music with some mash ups as well.<br /><br />The Bellas' final was amazing, as was that of the Treblemakers, just not as much so.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a great album.  It is similar to their previous album and sounds amazing.  It is great biking music.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Mesmerizing! That is how Suzanne Collins gets you sucked into this dystopian world of Panem. Her writing is intoxicating and pulls you into Katniss' life as if you are her. Wow, this installment was amazing, shocking and a great follow up to the Hunger Games. Though I can see the formula of book 1 installed here, she did a great job making it different, just gut wrenching to think a world like this even can exist. The surprises kept coming. I did get frustrated with Katniss' indecision regarding Peeta and Gale, though it is starting to show where her heart lies. I can't wait to read book #3.
0375851569|5.0|The books I recieved were perfect! My son loves them and couldn't be happier with them. They will be handed down to my daughter when she gets older to read. I highly recommend them to others. :)

0307592731|3.0|Propelled by the pain of a recent divorce, the grief of losing a loving mom, and the abandonment of  two fathers, 26-year-old Strayed takes the \\"road less travelled\\" on the 1100 mile path from the Californian Mojave Desert to the border of Oregon and Washington. Hoping to find insight into her problems, or at least personal focus by going from a geographical Point A to Point B, the author submits herself to a grueling, almost masochistic-like pilgrimage. But despite constant complaining about chronic feet pain and suffering blisters and contusions throughout her body, food and drink cravings (Snapple will probably offer her a contract), supply packages not showing up, and dangerous men and animals, Strayed does not veer from her goal.<br /><br />  Beginning with her childhood and the death of her mom, and then moving to her hike with flashbacks to poignant scenes from her life, Strayed skillfully weaves an engaging, gritty memoir over 15 years after the events. The highlights of the book are the colorful people she meets, the random kindnesses she experiences along the way, and the personal growth she achieves in knowing that if she can accomplish this she can surmount anything, and go forward in her life. Unfortunately, however, the book seems purposely laced with sensual descriptions meant to tantalize (for example, she keeps us informed about her condoms, potential paramours, and when she is not wearing underwear) and a detailed loveless, sex scene with a guy she picks up at a bar.<br /><br />  Readers, however, expecting a traditional Christian conversion story like A Walk Across America by Peter Jenkins, because of the words \\"Lost\\" and \\"Found\\" in the title, will be sadly disappointed. The only acknowledgment of God comes when she uses his name with an expletive after her mom dies. The \\"Lost\\" apparently refers to her inability to shake her inconsolable grief, her drug use, her directionless life, and her difficulty committing to a monogamous relationship. The \\"Found\\" in the story seems to mean finding the inner strength and courage to do something very challenging, her purpose in life as a writer, and her stability with a husband and family.  Although the story is rewarding in the sense that a tormented, articulate, young woman finds success as a wife, mother, and author, there is no indication that she ever becomes reconciled with her heavenly Father, or even grapples with this possibility.<br /><br /> In short, her story shows her eventual triumphs in both body and soul on her trek, but leaves the \\"spirit\\" journey largely unexplored.<br />\\"You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.\\"<br />(Jeremiah 29:13)

0395389496|5.0|I recently purchased the Polar Express book and DVD.  This book was a favorite to my now grown son.  I<br />purchased this book for my grandchildren.  They are 3 and 2yrs old.  I must say my 3 year old was able<br />to sit and watch the whole video as well as the book.  Now she knows to listen for the bell.  My 2 yr<br />old sat through most of the book and part of the movie.  The movie is excellent.  This is a true classic.

Marvelous writing about everyday life in Australia and how people get addicted to religious life. And also how women devote themselves to make life so easy as possible for their children....
B00846F1YW|3.0|this game is fun but can be a little frustrating. I don' t want to share every play on facebook or twitter, however. That is dumb.

B006LSZECO|1.0|weird, psychotic, boring blather. ick. disgusting examples of human dysfunction and emotional detatchment are neither entertaining nor thought-provoking. i‘d rather sit in a waiting room for three hours next to someone who smells of rancid cottage cheese.
B008B4KVS8|5.0|When I pre-ordered this from Amazon, the FedEx delivery went sadly awry. The product was dropped off at my home but apparently purloined by person or persons unknown. I took the matter to Amazon and lucked into an excellent conscientious customer-service rep who called, on a *Saturday* to double-check on the shipment status. Still nothing. So guess what happened next? A replacement copy was at my door by early Monday afternoon. No hassle, no questions. Now THAT's what I call customer service!<br /><br />As for the Blu-Ray disc itself, while it has no special features that were not on the standard DVD, I feel vindicated in upgrading from the standard-definition disc. Whether or not Warner Home Video (the cream of the mass-market crop) did entirely new scans or not, the clarity and presence of the image are palpably superior to the standard-definition one, which in itself was nothing at which to sneeze. There is some cloudiness in the underwater footage, although it remains superior to all other submarine model work in films because director John Sturges used an independently moving camera to track the sub's passage through the ice. Hollywood's preference for a locked-down camera when shooting model work rarely yields results this convincing. Even on flat screen, the immediacy of foreground figures in Sturges' compositions, especially in the command center of the submarine, translates to Blu-Ray with an impressive illusion of Cinerama wraparound. The movie itself is as engrossing as ever -- downright nostalgic for those of us who find the Manichean dualities of the Cold War reassuring in comparison to the infinitely more treacherous world of today.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Very good movie download option very nice. this was the first time I used that option from Amazon. I only had one hick-up with the download.<br />All and all I would concider using this format. again. Price should be lower to compete and cloae out the redbox business plan. even lowering the download cost by a dollar would stop my family feom using redbox.<br />$1.36. per night at Redbox with driving to the box and back again to return. Compare that to $3.99. for 48 hours with no drive. If they lowered new movies to $2.99 for 48 hours would win hands down.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I originally downloaded this for my kids but find myself &quot;playing on it more than they do! Some games are challenging, but that makes it more interesting. One thing that I'm not happy about is not being able to play the game a few days because of not having wifi to update. One star deducted because of that.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|It is a great action movie. You need to watch it if you like action and suspense. This one is better than the second one.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I must admit, I'm an \\"old school\\" Rush fan... meaning, primarily, that I listen to their body of working from 1981 and before (with the exception of the wonderful \\"Early Distant Warning\\"-1984). Yep, I'm that geek who thinks Caress of Steel is actually better than 2112 (but not by much), and while I still attend every Rush concert I can (in hopes of hearing Cygnux X-1 in it's entirety), I get bored stiffless by what I consider to be tuneless, uninspired drivel tunes Rush has offered us the greater part of 30 years (sorry Die-Hards!!!).<br /><br />Until now.<br /><br />Wow! I can't say how very, very exciting, emotional, shocking, fantastically-retro and wonderously release-of-endorphins-inspiring this new Rush album is to me. The music is inspired, head-haunting (in the best way possible) by means only Rush can give - smart, almost mathematical, literate and, most importantly (and particularly with Clockwork Angels) absolute Rock n' Roll!! I'm a music buff in my own modest right (try Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\"... please!!!), and it's been a while since I listen to a new album exclusively in my car, headphones, and home, over and over again. Clockwork Angels is that album. (Just listening to \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" as I write makes me think I'm listening to a track off of \\"Fly By Night\\".... fantastic!!!!).<br /><br />While I won't go into the song-by-song review many more thoughtful reviewers will offer, I provide this reason: every song on this album is excellent. I mean that. I can't say that about ANY Rush album (sorry again, DH's!!) (Well, perhaps Fly By Night... but you get what I'm saying. This is a classic album).<br /><br />In closing, I got the album simply because I researched the setlist of this tour and the band covers nearly every song on the record. I needed to know these song (natch!) before seeing them live, so I purchased it and settled down to get to know them. But so much more, I now love them. This album has joined into the soundtrack of my own life. This is the best album of the year.  This is rock and roll. This is Rush... at their best, so do yourself a favor and indulge in this pleasure. Peace, love, and equality. ~M
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Three words to describe this book...love,love,love!!!! I could not put this book down, I read it in one night. For me, the perfect book brings out all the emotions and this book did. One minute you are happy, then sad, angry, worried, etc. I think the second book was even better than the first one Bared To You and am anxious for the next. I can see why all the women talking about this book fell in love with Gideon, WOW!!! Great job Sylvia!!!
B009P13RQY|5.0|From lyrics drowning in the wine of mythology to the thunder gods revelatory riffs, these texas boys just keep making classic records.  If your looking for rock that pulses through your veins and lyrics that paint the temporal and ethereal give these guys a shot.

B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I loved this story! So good to see the interaction between the 7. You really see the contrast in characters now that they are all side by side. Can't wait till the next one comes out.
B0081BU42O|3.0|If it were any other author, this would have been fantastic, but Banks has set the bar so high in the past that you really have to evaluate the Culture books relative to one another.  This one let me down a bit.<br /><br />1) It's a little formulaic.  There's an unexplained event, a few lowly bios get involved, the Minds do clever things, other civilizations pop in to impede proceedings, and the story is more about the character's reactions to the event than the event itself.  If that doesn't seem formulaic, go and read Excession, then resume...<br />2) In Surface Detail, we get a secular exploration of Hell.  The Hydrogen Sonata could therefore have been a pretty obvious secular meditation on Heaven (or some analog thereof), and yet the Sublime remains unexplored.  He might argue that this is deliberate, or indeed essential, but I found it unsatisfying and lazy.  After peppering earlier books with references to the Sublime, this was his chance to widen (or whatever the orthogonal equivalent to 'wide' is) the Culture universe, and he didn't.  As a writer, what a tour de force it would have been to render the ineffable Enfolded realm effable.  I can't help but feel that this was a challenge he didn't rise to.<br />3) The best bits in the Culture books are always the bits that involve the Minds.  Who wouldn't enjoy riding on the shoulder of an entity of power, intelligence, and subtlety so profoundly beyond our own?  Whether it's the conversations between Minds or fight scenes involving ships or avatars, the sheer exuberant creativity of the writing is viscerally pleasurable.  If it's the kind of metaphysical navel-gazing that Minds like to indulge in, that's beautifully thought through as well.  In The Hydrogen Sonata, it was just that little bit.... soft.<br />4) Actually, in writing this review, I've finally plucked out what it is that bothers me about this book.  It's too soft.  Banks is at his best when his writing has an edge.  The Culture books in particular, describing such a cosseting and utopian society as they do, need that edge even more.  Use of Weapons, Excession, and Surface Detail all had a recognition of the gritty reality that substrates the fluffy pillow that the props up the average Culture citizen.  Here's an example, in Excession, one of the Culture's warships was named the Frank Exchange of Views.  What a brilliantly euphemistic/ominous name!  The ship names in The Hydrogen Sonata are too bland (with the possible exception of the Empiricist - I quite like that one).  So, yeah, this book needed more Gravitas.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're a fan of the Culture, you'll buy it.  It's not bad, in fact it's still much better than your average sci-fi novel, but it's not as great as it could have been.  If you're unfamiliar with the Culture, start somewhere else.
B0089BSM70|5.0|This two disc  Collector's set of Halloween II(Blu-Ray +DVD) starts off exactly where Halloween (1978) left off, when Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) shoots Michael Myers six times and Myers falls out of the window to the grass below, but when Loomis looks down, he sees nothing more than an imprint of Myers' body in the grass. Michael is gone.<br /><br />This release from Shout! Factory is just superb, the major clean up job on the tranfer they that accomplished is breath-taking. Fine details that were not seen before are now front and center and flesh tones are pleasing. The audio quality is great as well.<br /><br />The extras included are a DVD of the Television cut, with added scenes not seen in the Theatrical cut of the film (the blu- ray). There are audio commentaries, Horror's Hallowed Grounds- which takes the viewer on a tour of some of the filming locations, and a making of doc, deleted scenes, alternate ending, still gallery and trailer.<br /><br />Also included is some very cool retro style artwork newly commisioned for this release. The paper sleeve can also be taken out and flipped around, showing the original Theatrical poster art. Shout! Factory is to be commended for their efforts on this one!
B007TK77QE|2.0|With such a big build-up, perhaps it was inevitable that JK's first \\"adult\\" book would not live up to expectations, but the whole book reminded me of a \\"middle class EastEnders\\"! What an unrelenting story - not a smile or happy face to be seen and no appealing characters at all.  There were times I had to read out loud to understand the colloquial dialogue and you certainly do not want to be squeamish about bad language, a lot of which seemed to me to be gratuitous once characters are established.  I heard JK herself has said she 'doesn't care what people think' which is a pity - she needs to listen to their comments perhaps before setting out on her next book as 'fame and fortune' are notoriously fickle!

B007V65R54|5.0|Nate Silver has broken the code on what is wrong with many aspects of society today. Today's politicians, media pundits and even many experts make bad predictions about future events because they can't detect the causality signal from the proximate noise. Knowing how to use causality, heuristics and probability to forecast the liklihood of future events is the key to solving many of our current and future problems. Mankind has survived thus far because of our ability to predict and plan for likely events or outcomes, our forethought. The Signal and the Noise is that rare and valuable find which will improve our ability to solve current and future problems via better forecasting, prediction and forethought. Thanks Nate!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I really liked the The Hunger Games movie, it is a new kind of action movie with a new story and different kind of characters. It deals with important emotions: hunger, fear, love, violence, death and survival. I thought the director did a good job, the cast was great, and the actors did very good. It is a movie worth watching.[[ASIN:B008Z9YLV2 The Hunger Games]]

B005K0HDGE|5.0|It is easy (and perhaps common) to underestimate Stephen King.  After all, his work is the essence of popular culture -- he isn't trying to make a \\"literary\\" statement, or to create books that are self-consciouly \\"art.\\"  Yet, he does exactly that, and 11/22/63 is a remarkable achievement even for a man who at his best is a modern, gothic version of Charles Dickens (of course, at his worst he is pretty forgettable, but he has enough solid performances to justify the praise).  11/22/63 is purportedly about time travel, and about efforts to change the course of history by preventing the assassination of John Kennedy, but it is actually about America, and about the way that America lived during the post-war era just before it changed into the America we know today.  There are moments where King is a bit too proud of the details, and his research, but most of the time the cascade of insight is amazing.  And he manages to make us care as much or more about the cahracters as we do about the crazy plot.  A ton of fun, but also memorable and moving, this is a book that everyone should read.
B002SR2PKG|3.0|I originally read this book in my early 20's. At the time, it was the scariest book I'd ever read. I was sweaty palmed and loving it. I decided to re-read it recently, and now the \\"scary\\" bits seem ready-made for cheesy horror movie special effects. However, I do still admire King's ability to create full-blown characters that are easy to care about.<br /><br />Note: I bought the Kindle version this time and found some formatting problems that were occasionally distracting. Just thought you should know.

0143123173|5.0|First in the Walt Longmire mystery series set in Durant, Wyoming and revolving around Walt, the sheriff, and those he considers friends.<br /><br />My Take<br />A very nice introduction to this series with this story. Johnson creates a range of characters you just love with enough suspense to keep you wondering as he writes, pushing you to think in one direction. Only to twist it back.<br /><br />Johnson also does a good job of filling us in on the backstory, weaving it into the storyline where it's appropriate. I do enjoy Walt and Henry's relationship. They're comfortable with their ethnic backgrounds and have flipped the Lone Ranger on his back. Their friendship is casual, honest, and deep. They know each other, their strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Henry has a deeply spiritual side to him, he's caring, he's intelligent. And he does like to have his fun! I do love the way he answered the phone early on in the book: \\"It is another beautiful evening here at the Red Pony bar and continual soir&eacute;e, how can I help you?\\"<br /><br />I like Walt's character as well for his balance. He recognizes talent and he uses the skills of his people well. He's open enough to realize where he's lacking and where Vic is a definite asset---heck, he wants her to replace him as sheriff when he retires.<br /><br />Johnson has a great sense of humor. Dry, realistic. \\"...in my experience, most things from Cheyenne whined.\\" Then there's the comment about women and trees in Powder River.<br /><br />I don't understand why George keeps trying to escape. I'm also a bit confused as to who it was there at the end. Henry is the most likely one, but that last line...mmm-hmmm, it has me wondering.<br /><br />I have definitely got to read me some more Craig Johnson!<br /><br />The Story<br />It's been four years since Martha died, and Henry thinks it's time that Walt re-embraced life. Fix that damned cabin so the bathroom has a door. Get some furniture. Date Vonnie.<br /><br />Then there's that first killing. Well, it mighta been an accident. Leavin' aside that he's one of those who got off too light on Melissa's rape. Then there's another murder. Another boy.<br /><br />One of the clues points out a small group of people capable of such a feat: Roger Russell, the retired electrician; Mike Rubin is a gunsmith; Carroll Cooper (along with Roger) is a reenactment enthusiast; Dwight Johnston was on the NRA National Shooting Team back in the day; Phil La Vante may be seventy-two, but he can still shoot; Stanley Fogel is a dentist; Artie Small Song; Omar himself; Walt; and, Henry Standing Bear. It's a testament to Walt that he's willing to consider his friends as possible suspects. As badly as he wants to ignore it.<br /><br />It's the worry and search for the third boy that finds Walt and Henry in a life-or-death situation. One that requires the aid of ghostly guides.<br /><br />The Characters<br />Sheriff Walt Longmire got through college and then got drafted into the military. Vietnam. Where he learned all about law enforcement. Cady is his little girl. Not so little anymore. She has a law practice in Philadelphia although Walt still can't see his little baby with her own secretary. Martha is the wife for whom he was building a log cabin. The one who died with the hope in her heart.<br /><br />Henry Standing Bear runs a bar, the Red Pony, just outside town; it's part of a community effort. He's also Melissa's uncle. He and Walt have been friends since grade school and he is a Special Forces and political activity veteran. Dena Many Camps is his current lady friend.<br /><br />Vic is a real find for Walt. She's highly skilled at investigative work and has got some mouth on her! Her husband Glen got transferred out to Wyoming and Vic had to quit her police job back in Pennsylvania to follow him. And she got bored.<br /><br />Jim Ferguson is the head of Search and Rescue and sorta thinkin' of runnin' for sheriff. Turk, a.k.a., Brian Connally, is former Sheriff Connally's nephew and is ill-suited to police work. I did enjoy Johnson's assessment of how Turk's car with all its bumperstickers described Turk to a T. Lucian Connally is/was a legend in the area and he organized it so that Walt would take over as sheriff. Seems that Lucian just might be back. Ruby is their dispatcher and secretary. T.J. Sherwin is the director of the Division of Criminal Investigation in Cheyenne.<br /><br />Melissa Little Bird is a product of her mother's overindulgence in I-90 cocktails. Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. And no excuse for four older teens--Cody Pritchard, Jacob and George Esper, and Bryan Keller--to brutally gang rape her. Mr. and Mrs. Jim Keller seem to have a difference of opinion on their son Bryan's conviction. Lonnie Little Bird is Melissa's disabled dad. He owns an original Sharps rifle. Not as nice as Omar's, but...<br /><br />Vonnie Hayes is old school Wyoming. She made it big as an artist back east and returned to Durant to help her mother. Omar Rhoades is a hunting outfitter with a huge ranch and a bigger reputation. A man with style whom Vic hates for some reason. Dorothy runs the Busy Bee caf&eacute;. Jules Belden's current career is as an alcoholic; back in the day, he'd been a hardworking cowboy and a good carpenter. Ernie Brown is the reporter and editor of the Courant. Vern Selby is the judge who presided over the boys' trial. What he was thinking, I'd sure like to know!<br /><br />The Cover<br />The cover is chilling in blues and whites with its lonely road leading into the deep, dark forest. I did like the touch of the feather pointing to * A NOVEL *!

B0070Y46UY|4.0|Ever since this book came out I have been told it is a much read. Although a little slow to start, the story of Pi Patel draws you in and leaves you wanting more. A wonderful story about a courageous human being. Now I am wondering how this story will be translated onto the big screen, to be determined.....
0316228532|2.0|Others have written enough already for you to know that this book isn't enjoyable.  I'll still throw in my two cents and add that I find the characters to be largely petty, boring, and devoid of worth.  I'm sure this is intentional on J.K.'s part, but just because she does a fantastic job of depicting a town full of a-holes doesn't mean I want to read about them.<br /><br />One more thing, to the reviwer who said the author clearly understands people....  You need to find new people to associate with.

B008G8SFGO|3.0|To listen to Gene and Paul this album was the second coming of Destroyer. Sadly that isn't the case. Hell or Hallelujah is a decent tune and Eat Your Heart out is the best Simmons tune since Unholy. However the highlights are few and far between.<br />1. Hell or Hallelujah is a good footstomper and should go over well live.<br />2. Wall of Sound has moments but the chorus is weak.<br />3. Freak isn't a bad tune. This is a song that shows that they could still benefit from an outside producer. The spoken word, \\"I pledge alligiance\\" part stands out in jarring contrast to the rest of the tune. Can't help but feel that an outside producer would have left it on the editing room floor.<br />4. Back to the Stone Age is simply a stinker.<br />5. Shout Mercy is a promising tune but the \\"ooh ooh\\" ups its cheese factor ten fold.<br />6. Long Way Down, meh.<br />7. Eat Your Heart out is one of the strongest songs on the album.Of all the songs on the album this comes closest to capturing the vibe of KISS greatest songs. It has a solid groove and a fun sing along chorus.<br />8. The Devil is Me is stinker # 2.<br />9. Outta This World is a total plundering of Ace's legacy. Tommy may be wearing the make up but he is NOT the Space Ace. I think KISS would benefit greatly if they would let Tommy be himself.<br />10. All for the Love of Rock & Roll. \\"I was vaccinated with a Victrola needle, and I'm hooked on rock & roll.\\" Too reminiscent of Peter's solo album tune Hooked on Rock & Roll.<br />11. Take Me Down Below. Not a bad tune, but not a particularly good one either.<br />12. Last Chance closes out the album with a fairly strong number.<br /><br />This album is like every KISS album since Alive II, some gems surrounded with some clunkers. At least they're are making some new music and aren't content being a total nostalgia act.
0525952926|5.0|Another book from Ken Follett that is impossible to put down and which makes you sad when it comes to an end - the world's best author for sure!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This product comes with 1 DVD and 1 Blu-Ray disc. There are a decent amounts of extras including a gag reel, extended scenes, and featurettes - nice additions. We watched the Blu-Ray movie and it was just as good as in the theater. This movie is just great and has some hilarious catchlines and high rewatchability (for us).

B008FSCNTK|2.0|Some decent songs here, but nothing to brag about. She has done much better in the past, but lately doesn't seem to really grab you with her performances.  The other thing that is an absolute nightmare with this effort is the recording itself - no dynamic range.  The recording volume is maxed out so that turning it up even a little muffles the sound.  If you're not aware of what dynamic range really is I suggest you google it to see what I mean. It is very interesting to read because the recording industry has been doing this for years and years and don't get the idea that the music must breath.  Loud is not better.  My 2 star rating is for the content only. If I rated it for sound quality it would be a minus number.

We get screwed in England my friends. Well, not anymore- amazon.com is the way forward, no more .co.uk for my movie purchases.

B0083SBJXS|5.0|I bought this from amazon.com for delivery to the UK because Disney shafted us on the special features over here. This edition is multi region so played without a problem on my region B player. It also worked out cheaper after conversion from $ to £ than it would've done to buy it in the UK anyway- including shipping! It arrived in a reasonable time, but I was refunded because it was 2 days later than expected. Just brilliant service, cheap and helpful, and the product itself is a load of great features and a thoroughly entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. I didn't stretch to the 4 disc because I don't care for 3D but if you do it's a bit of a bargain really. Well done amazon.com, now lets get to work on fixing Disney's UK distribution and European market prices.<br /><br />So you might have to wait a bit longer to get it from amazon.com rather than .co.uk, but you get a better price and a better version of the product (the Whedon commentary is a must have).

B0034G4P8A|5.0|A real throwback to the ambitious- if somewhat flawed- fantasy adventures of the eighties, like Hawk the Slayer, Krull, Willow, which all tried to blend science fiction with fantasy adventure. Thor does this splendidly, and the only complaint would be that it's a tad brief. Arch villain Loki is a revelation; a complex character whose own painful discoveries leave you almost willing him to victory. With previous franchises, I've gotten bored of revisiting the same old villains (Luthor in Superman, Magneto in X-Men- at least until Fassbender's rejuvenation of the character in First Class) but with Loki, I want to see more of him. I want to see his story resolved, not just become a bad guy of the week type scenario. Iron Man might make the money, but Thor/Loki is the emotional core of the Marvel Cinematic Universe; a story that is instantly more intriguing than whatever bigger bad these franchises try to throw at our heroes.<br /><br />Also, the bluray is apparently NTSC but plays on my UK bought Sony player. It was also half the price of the UK version of Thor. Importing is the way forward, people! Unless you're in America, of course,
B009PEKRY6|4.0|Many of you are familiar with Bridgit Mendler on Disney Channel from her guest spots on Wizards of Waverly Place as Juliet to her own series Good Luck Charlie as Teddy.

Ready or not, here comes Bridgit Mendler.
0307744434|5.0|Often I notice books that catch my attention, either because of its title or more frequently, the cover. I do not necessarily buy them immediately, preferring to let it linger for a while. I buy books when they \\"call\\" me. For the Night Circus, it captured my attention on both accounts, but deferred my purchase. But everytime I dropped by the bookstore I felt it calling me. So after two months, I finally caved in. And I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />The book focuses on two young magicians, Celia and Marco, and how their love story is directly intertwined with the Circus itself. Since childhood, each has been trained in magic and illusion until such time when the battle formally begins. And the battle itself is magical, for there is no other way to describe it. Each trick, each illusion is a love letter, as one character aptly puts it. They fall hopelessly in love until they learn the truth about the game--what it is exactly and where winning also means losing. And what follows is a tale where love can and will do anything, even make the impossible possible.<br /><br />I am not really an avid reader of love stories, but I do appreciate love stories when it is incorporated with mystery (the genre I prefer) and in this case, magic. Reading this book reminded me of the movies \\"The Prestige\\" and \\"The Illusionist\\", both I have truly enjoyed. With Morgenstern's description of the Circus, I felt I was there among the pilgrims with red scarves. It's not just an entertaining read; it is also a reminder of basic human tenets without being preachy--that each action has consequences; that each relationship affects everyone else; and that each life is a story waiting to be told.<br /><br />Be prepared to be enthralled. Welcome to the Circus!
B00196YNWU|5.0|This movie is hilarious and the quality is good too. The movie is a good movie for the entire family to watch. It's funny, sad, and heart warming.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|My family and I love this movie. It not only contains lots of action, but good humor as well. You don't even have to be a real super hero fan(although my son and husband are)to enjoy this movie. It has a great story line and I can't wait to see a sequel. The characters all play off each other well and work well together. Justice prevails!
B009439E7O|5.0|I have to say, when I previewed the songs, they weren't all too crazy sounding, but just going out today and buying this album is definitely worth the trouble. Word of caution, there is no lyrics in the album booklet. It's just the artwork and thank you/production notes from the band and crew who worked on the album. Anyways, continuing on, this is actually the band's shortest album to date, but it's far from being weak. These ten songs are powerful in their own ways. The vibe of the album is strange at times. From the opening track \\"The Depression\\" to songs like \\"Time Won't Save You,\\" it's rather difficult at times to figure out which direction the band is veering to. Regardless of what they're trying to strive for, each song pulsates with a drowning crescendo of tribal rhythms, chugging hard rock patterns, and Latin guitar pieces, all backed up by Cristian's growling metal-core vocals to clean singing. Is this thirty eight (38) minute album worth the purchase? It depends on the person or fan I guess. Fans of the old Ill Nino will more than likely gear towards the nu-metal sound, despising the metal-core influences thrown into the recent albums (Enigma and Dead New World had some progressive elements blended into the mix). For the fans that don't care about what direction the band is going in so long as they're making music, then I would recommend this album. A personal note. Ill Nino might be known, but they're not over popular by any means. Purchasing any of their works, merchandise, or even going to see a concert of them playing live can make all the difference to them.<br /><br />1. The Depression. The first song off the album. The song has potential to become a single and possibly a music video (they have the lyrics video posted up on youtube). It starts off with weird duck quacking noises in the background, along with some street ambiance before exploding with force. Cristian drives the song forward pretty well, only to have it slow down by the chorus and have it pick up again during the bridge and outro parts. 9/10<br /><br />2. Only The Unloved. It starts off quiet like some of their songs, then it slams open with with Dave band marching with the snare, following up with Danny's taps on the percussion pieces and grinding with the guitars. Cristian saves the song from being a total loss by deep singing on the chorus parts. 8/10<br /><br />3. La Epidemia. Metal-core with subtle touches of Latin flare tossed in. Not a big fan of it, but sometimes, it clicks in. 7/10<br /><br />4. Eva. It starts out eerily, but then it transforms into a solid hard rock piece with the verses, and drowns in the alternative metal emotions during the chorus'. The song the falls asleep slowly. 7/10<br /><br />5. Demi-God. The intro is pretty annoying at first (it sounds like wailing throughout the song), but the progression of the song is worth plowing through it. The verse and chorus are both mildly heavy. 6/10<br /><br />6. Death Wants More. This song is pretty enjoyable. It's sort of reminiscent of \\"All I ask for\\" on their third album \\"One Nation Underground.\\" The chorus has a bouncy alternative rock rhythm similar to \\"Mr Bright Side\\" by the killers. The bridge is beautiful with the solo, but it's cut short by the continuing outro of the song. 8/10<br /><br />7. Escape. This song has an epic wall/mosh bounce to it. The verses dynamically go from quiet whispers to screamo growls. The chorus has this rapid fire 'staple kick' in the gut pummeling, creating a machine gun effect. Cristian's vocals don't really soar too bright in this song, but the bridge has a sense of escapism and fear within set. And then the song ends with random whisperings and a random groan from Cristian. 7/10<br /><br />8. Time Won't Save You. Probably the most melodic song on the album. It's similar to \\"Ritual\\" from \\"Dead New World,\\" in a sense that the song chugs during the verses and flows cleanly during the chorus section. The ending part has Cristian shoving out hissad emotions and ripping a hole within the song before it ends. 9/10<br /><br />9. Forgive Me Father. A personal song about the singer's father (or his parents). Cristian sings perfectly on this song. His melodies backed up by the searing rift of the lead guitar and being propelled forward by the rhythm guitar. The song through out has some pretty subtle percussion parts. All in all, a very melodic and emotional song. 9/10<br /><br />10. Invisible People. The beginning starts off somewhat silly, but then it goes into a machine gun vibe in the chorus, covered by Cristian's voice of urgency. The verses are okay for the most part, but the chorus is where the fun is located at. The ending is similar to the way the album starts off with the first song, but instead of coming in, it slowly fades out. It's pretty rough and straightforward for the most part. 8/10.<br /><br />Final words: The album will either leave you feeling ripped off, or wanting more. In my honest opinion, it was worth the money to enjoy/experience this sweet ride. Heavy, tribal, melodic, cold, blazing, and a bunch of other words to describe this album. Have fun.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|********Some Plot Details Follow********<br /><br /> \\"The Night Circus\\" is a great novel by Erin Morgenstern.  Anyone who enjoys mystery and fantasy would love this book.  Those who enjoy travel and new, out of the ordinary experiences could happily read \\"The Night Circus.\\"  The line defining good and evil is vague, if not absent.  There is a clear protagonist and antagonist, but they are not presented as moral opposites.  The descriptions are dreamy and somewhat mysterious.  Throughout the book, a story is told from a third-person standpoint, but as the story moves along, you explore the circus in second-person.<br /> \\"The Night Circus\\" is about a strange circus, named Le Cirque des Rêves (The Circus of Dreams), that travels only at night, and appears and disappears without notice to the town it travels through.  It is filled with strange delights and wonders that are far greater than anything the patrons have experienced before.  The circus is colored in only black and white, with a cauldron at the center that has pure white flames.  The circus gathers a group of followers who become known as The Rêveurs.  However, the circus is a stage for something much greater.<br /> Hector Bowen, father of Celia Bowen and master illusionist, presents a challenge to Alexander, The Man in the Grey Suit.  It is referred to as \\"The Game\\" throughout the book, and is a contest of skills between two real magicians.  The opponents are Celia Bowen, Hector's student, and Marco Alisdair, student of Alexander.  The circus is the venue for the game, a shared canvas for the magicians to paint their creations onto.  They continue to make exhibits and pour more of their skills into the circus as they duel.<br /> The circus itself was started by Chandresh Christophe Lefèvre.  He wanted to \\"push the boundaries,\\" of entertainment.  He started with a midnight dinner with trusted friends to which he told his idea.  They met at these midnight dinners for months, planning the circus, and opened it the night of October 13, 1886.  This was the night that the Murray twins were born at the circus.  The circus then quickly evolved into the canvas for Celia and Marco.<br /> Bailey discovers the circus when he is six, and first visits it at ten.  He falls in love with the circus years after it began, and when he is faced with a hard choice in his life, the circus offers him a third option.<br /> Celia Bowen is the daughter and student of Hector Bowen or Prospero the Enchanter.  She is the protagonist of \\"The Night Circus\\" and the first of two opponents entered into the game.  She is hired as the illusionist for Le Cirque des Rêves.  However, her magic is real.<br /> Marco Alisdair is the student of Alexander, The Man in the Grey Suit.  He is the second opponent in the game and the assistant to Chandresh.  Marco also become involved in a relationship with Isobel Martin when she stumbles upon his notebook of magic.<br /> Bailey is a boy who stumbles upon the circus 10 years after it opened and sees what changes took place after the game.  He meets Poppet when he sneaks in during the daytime, and he goes back to the circus when it reappears, looking for her.<br /> Isobel Martin met Marco when she stumbled upon his notebook and read it.  She falls in love with him and becomes the fortune teller for the circus, actually being capable to read tarot cards.<br /> Chandresh Christophe Lefèvre is the founder of the circus and the host of the midnight dinners.  He was a theatrical producer until he started the night circus.<br /> Mr. Barris is an engineer and architect, and was of the first people to work on the circus.  He helps both Marco and Celia with their exhibits as he builds them, and they enchant them.<br /> The Murray twins, Poppet and Widget, were born opening night of the circus, and have unique abilities.  Poppet befriends Bailey the day that he sneaks into the circus.  Widget can read the past off of people, which makes him an excellent storyteller, and Poppet can see into the future.  The Murray twins prove to be a very intricate part of the circus.<br /> The Murray twins, along with Isobel are used to foreshadow events in the story.  Isobel does this with card reading, Poppet sees into the future, and one of Widget's stories alludes to how the end of the book plays out.<br /> A major theme of \\"The Night Circus\\" is that good and evil are not easily definable.  Throughout the book the antagonist shifts from Marco to the Hector or Alexander.  It is mentioned in the book by Alexander that, \\"Is not the dragon the hero of his own story?  Is not the wolf simply acting as a wolf should act?\\" (Morgenstern 377).  He also says, \\"Good and evil are a great deal more complex than a princess and a dragon,\\" (377).  Good and evil are human creations, morality is an illusion that keeps us in check.  Our moral can both hinder and help us, it all depends upon the point of view.<br /> \\"The Night Circus\\" is a five out of five star book in my opinion.  It describes the circus in great detail, yet leaves certain parts up to you to decide.  It has an intriguing story line, and gives you parts of different stories, out of order, to show how they line up.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read fiction.

B0089BSM70|3.0|Um, what happened to the subtitles for this movie. Although this is the best sequel of all times, studio should have found a way to cut deleted scenes into theatrical version. Still, I was grateful for tv version, which I liked better than the theatrical version because of the extra scenes!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is awesome and it looks great in 3d too. I was very surprise at the price tho but very worth it! I only paid like $19.98 for this set with 3d. Anyway it is a must see movie and can't wait to they come out with another 1.
6305212112|5.0|I often hear folks declaring this movie a \\"chick flick\\". Well, I'm all man and I think this is a great movie for everyone. There should be more movies like this one, full of interesting characters that make us fall in love with them. A storyline that keeps you watching from the very first scene to the grand finale. The interest never lets up and when I put this movie in the player, I make sure I have 2 hours to not be interupted because this movie holds all my attention until it ends. The scenery of the old South is magnificent and worth seeing just for that reason alone.<br />Make sure to get the dvd that includes the \\"making of\\" as one it features. It's really interesting to see and hear about all the behind the scenes stuff.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|I thought by the description that this was a romance novel. WELL, I found out not too much later what a trashy novel it is.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I got this Omnibus on sale so I decided to give it a try, as I love a series. It started off a little slow, but once it got going I couldn't put it down. I thought the characters were well developed, and the storyline very original. As soon as I had finished it, I looked at Hugh Howey's other books, and bought Half Way Home- which I almost enjoyed more ( although I wish it had been longer- I hate it when a good story has to come to an end! )I highly recommend that book too, and I have just purchased two of his other books as well.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Fans of the Culture will not be disappointed .<br />It's book has good action, but also som philosophy- how does it feel to b living for then thousand years? What is the purpose of life?
B006LSZECO|3.0|I got about half-way through this book and was ready to stop reading.  The story seemed to be about a man who killed his wife.  The storyline was getting pretty boring with the man denying the crime while his twin sister supported him.  Finally there was an unexpected turn in the story! Yea!  Unfortunately, the entire story disintegrated at the end.  Overall, I was disappointed in this book.
B0081YBD8A|5.0|I happened on this by accident while on Netflix, watched it loved it.  I have never seen the L Word so I cannot compare as well as now that I have watched Lip Service I will not see the other.  I don't think anything can compare as European's are more open about nudity and to be realistic one has to get to the sole of the series.  I found this perhaps two months ago and have watched it over and over and over again without being tired.  No I am not a lesbian, but saw little difference between these lesbians and a love relationship between a man and a woman.  There are real life stories here about the lives of all these people, and that is what I enjoy most the realness of it.  I like the troubled Frankie best of the cast members, she has real life issues. Tess is my second favourite just trying to juggle life as a lesbian looking for real love and being an actress.  This is a show that I would and have recommended to my family and friends who have an open mind to life in general.  Just simple brilliant series.
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I think this show has been overlooked by many, but that doesn't mean that this show is worth overlooking. Especially season 2, the story line was just a lot more intricate and the action sequences were all-the-more intense. Don't let the network fool you, Nikita and Supernatural are gems that should be appreciated (and fans are needed for the new season). Just get the DVD, watch it, catch up on HULU and then network and buy season 3 next year.<br />Oh yeah, and if you looking for a plot. The story is based on Nikita being an ex-member of a black-ops group that had slowly stepped away from their patriotic goals and duties to doing acts to benefit the individuals who headed the program. They recruit by taking young criminals that had nothing. Nikita was one. In short, she recognized the corruption and made it her goal to keep this corrupt semi-government organization for killing more, and dealing more damage to the nation. Over time some people start to open their eyes to what is actually happening (most fully believe that their actions are sanctioned and that they are the truest of patriots). Anyway, the reason why few other intervene is because the head of \\"Division\\" (the black ops group) has accumulated so much power through information and through the assets he has accumulated (killers/assassins/spys and whatnot) that he can't be outright challenged, and Nikita knows this and therefore has to do what ever she can to take the power away by making division missions fail. That is lump sum season one, minus some major component and about 60% of the information you need to know. I just left out some major characters and their relation to Nikita. you can find out.

B004S2W1MQ|5.0|After finally finding a way to be together at the end of Wizard's First Rule, Richard and Kahlan are separated by sinister forces beyond their comprehension. Each must undergo a perilous journey: Richard through the Wilds and beyond the great barrier into the Old World, a vast land beyond the three introduced in the first book; and Kahlan northward to Aydindril, through the harsh winter climate of the Midlands with a Mud-People escort, to seek the help of First Wizard Zeddicus Z'ul Zorander.<br /><br />While Richard's is the more essential for advancing the plot of the series as a whole, this is really Kahlan's story. We finally get to see the Mother Confessor in action, as she confronts vast armies against impossible odds, and scheming politicians at home. Her journey and fate are breathtaking and moving.<br /><br />If you liked the first book in this excellent series, you will love the second.  Four and a half stars.

Never before has a book been so over rated. Silly dialogue and written as though a a teenager wrote the story. Nothing about this book is sexy or steamy. The characters are so immature and childish. Some chapters are nothing but stupid emails messages going back and forth between 2 people, again, just dumb. Bad writing, awful characters and again over rated. If I could give this 0 stars I would.

B007EZJKS2|3.0|Seems it is the only way you can 'kindle' this book these days.<br /><br />I'd have preferred the original format-especialy since I have the low-end kindle (thats all I need)<br />which makes surfing around graphic layouts quite tedious. And sometimes the dialogue balloons were just too small or out of reach so zooming and navigating again was a *chore*.<br /><br />And the interview with the author (appendix) was clearly not designed with my kindle in mind; a rediculously small font-I almost needed a magnifying glass in *addition* to zooming 200% (the max!).
B002WPVNOS|5.0|I have been compiling songs that make me feel energetic enough to go on 5 mile hikes each day. I heard Good Life on the radio on realized I did not have the song. Relying on Amazon.com as I often do I checked out the Album.<br /><br />Now, I am not new to One Republic; I have heard several songs and like the group. They remind me a little bit of the Fray whom I consider myself a fan of. I listened to the samples and decided to go ahead and download the entire album. That was a few weeks ago and I am SO pleased that I did! I seriously haven't stopped listening since I made the purchase. I don't even listen to my \\"walk-it-out\\" mix anymore; I go for these long walks/hikes listening to nothing but this album.<br /><br />From start to finish it is Amazing! I love the instrumentals that close out some of the songs, the anthems on others I pant along to. I love the somber and melancholy styles of \\"Fear\\" The energy I get from the title track and \\"made for you\\" and \\"Marching on\\".<br /><br />Initially I thought I would buy the album and like it then transfer Good Life to the mix I walk to and be done with it but I was SO wrong. This is a great album and I am proud to be an official fan of the group. I wish them all the success in the world. I truly appreciate the art put forth on this album and thank them (and Amazon) for introducing me to it.
B009AMAKJU|5.0|Every now and then, you come across a film where everything was done just right. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those films.  Directed by Stephen Chbosky, who wrote the screenplay as well as the popular young-adult novel of the same name from which it was adapted, The Perks of Being a Wallflower seems to hit every note just right, capturing all of the tumult and the extreme highs and lows of adolescence as experienced by a group of friends in high school in Pittsburgh back in the 1980's.<br /><br />The film begins with 14-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) writing a letter to an anonymous \\"Dear Friend\\" about his nervousness about starting his first year in high school.  He writes because he doesn't feel he can talk to his parents or his siblings about his anxieties, nor does he seem to have any real friends he can confide in, for reasons that are initially only hinted at in the internal narrative of his letters.<br /><br />Charlie's anxieties prove to be well-founded as he finds himself isolated in his first few days at school, dodging upperclass jocks looking to harass new freshmen, torn between just wanting to be left alone and yet not wanting to feel alone.  The only friend he makes his first day turns out to be his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who notices Charlie writing down correct answers to questions he asks of the class but not holding up his hand to be called on.  Sensing Charlie's reluctance to be noticed, Anderson reaches out to him, \\"You know they say if you make one friend on your first day you'll do good.\\"  To which Charlie glumly responds \\"If my English teacher is the only friend I make today, that'll be sorta depressing.\\"<br /><br />In spite of his tendency to withdraw from everyone, Charlie finds himself unexpectedly drawn into the orbit of an ultra-extroverted and over-the-top flamboyant senior named Patrick (Ezra Miller), who happens to be the only senior in his freshman shop class as well as a major source of annoyance to the shop teacher, Mr. Callahan (Tom Savini - yes, for those who recognize the name, it's that Tom Savini).  At the school's first football game, Charlie spots Patrick up in the bleachers and ventures up, hoping Patrick will invite him to sit with him, which Patrick cheerfully does.  They are soon joined by another senior, a quirky but friendly girl named Sam (Emma Watson), to whom Patrick introduces Charlie and with whom Charlie is immediately encrushed.  After the game, Patrick and Sam invite Charlie along to grab something to eat.  The two seem so close to each other that Charlie mistakes them for being boyfriend and girlfriend.  They laughingly correct him and tell him that they're actually step-siblings who found that they just get along really well-together, always liking the same music and always having each other's backs.<br /><br />Gradually, Charlie is befriended by Patrick and Sam.  At the homecoming dance, to which Charlie goes alone, he ends up dancing with Patrick and Sam, who then drag Charlie along with them to a party where he meets the rest of their circle:  Bob (Adam Hagenbuch), an amiable stoner; Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman), who's bossy and opinionated; and Alice (Erin Wilhelmi), a proto-goth who's into film.  At the party, Charlie unknowingly has his first hash-brownie, which causes him to loosen up to the point of sharing his observations on what he thinks of high school so far, which both amuses and impresses the others.  He also later divulges privately to Sam that he hasn't been close to anyone since his best friend committed suicide the year before. Learning this, Patrick and Sam decide on the spot to bring Charlie into their circle of friends, with Patrick making it official by quipping \\"Welcome to the island of misfit toys.\\"<br /><br />As Charlie gets to know Patrick and Sam and their circle, he leans that all of them have their own set of individual issues they have to cope with.  Patrick is fairly openly gay, but his boyfriend Brad (Johnny Simmons), one of the school's star football players, is very much in the closet and so they have to pretend to not really know each other in school.  Sam, whom Charlie only sees as beautiful, smart and talented, has low self-esteem and always settles for guys, like her current boyfriend Craig (Reese Thompson), who always treat her badly.  A problem shared by Charlie's sister, Candace (Nina Dobrev), whom Charlie sees being abused by her boyfriend.  At one point, when Sam asks Charlie \\"Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?\\" he repeats what his English teacher told him when he asked him the same question:  \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\"  But when Charlie says it to Sam, he is finally beginning to understand what it means.<br /><br />Chbosky does a fine job of touching on moments that almost everyone can relate to from their own high school experience.  The intensity - and fragility - of adolescent relationships.  The way you can sometimes find yourself in a relationship with someone you don't want to be involved with but don't know how to get out of, even as the person you really want to be with is in a relationship with someone else.  And how formative moments can suddenly come in the most unexpected circumstances.  Like when Patrick and Sam are driving Charlie home after the party and Sam, hearing a song on the radio that she immediately likes, demands that Patrick take the tunnel, where she cranks up the volume and then stands up in the back of the pickup and sways like she's dancing to the music as the tunnel lights flash by overhead.  The image is simple and yet entrancing, and we, with Charlie, find ourselves falling in love with her.<br /><br />Other moments are also well captured.  Like when Charlie unexpectedly gets drafted to be the substitute Rocky in the group's live-cast act at the midnight showing of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and suddenly finds himself nearly naked in gold lame hot pants in a theater full of people, doing the \\"Toucha-Toucha-Touch Me!\\" number with Sam's bodiced-and-boaed Janet.  Another moment occurs at a party where Charlie his friends are playing truth-or-dare, when Charlie takes a dare and in an unwitting but truly honest moment commits an enormous faux pas, leaving him suddenly shunned by the entire group just as he was beginning to feel like he wasn't alone.  And yet another moment reunites Charlie with the group when he comes to Patrick's rescue during a fight in the cafeteria with a ferocity that takes everyone aback - a moment that for all its heroic nature also hints at Charlie's deeper problems. Problems that ultimately come to a crisis point when graduation comes and Charlie has to watch as his senior friends leave and he finds himself alone once again.  It is to Chbosky's enormous credit that he avoids the usual Hollywood teen-movie approach and treats these situations much as they really are - complicated, with no easy answers, and with wisdom often coming painfully and with a cost.<br /><br />The young cast are all excellent in their roles, with standout performances by Lerman, Miller and Watson.  Logan Lerman's Charlie is a complex mix, perceptive and yet naïve, a loner who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too.  He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.  Ezra Miller's Patrick is charmingly rendered, a character who uses his flamboyance to mask his frustrations and sometimes despair at the unfairness of life, only letting a very few, like Sam and eventually Charlie, inside his protective front.  And Emma Watson's Sam is a bravura turn as a girl who comes to life among her friends but whose self-esteem withers when it comes to believing she has anything like a future waiting for her or that she can do betterin her choices of boyfriends.  All three are acting veterans - Lerman (Percy Jackson & the Olympians), Miller (We Need to Talk about Kevin), and Watson (the Harry Potter films) - but I think The Perks of Being a Wallflower will be a break-out film for all of them. Particularly for Emma Watson, who proves once and for all that she can be a lot more than just Hermione Granger.<br /><br />But if the actors are extraordinary in their performances, credit must also be given to the heartfelt dialogue Chbosky's novel and screenplay provides them to work with.  All are given wonderfully individual voices, but Charlie, as the would-be writer and ever observant `wallflower' among them, is the one ultimately speaks for all of them with an achingly earnest lyrical poetry, as he does at the end when once again he's with Patrick and Sam, driving through the tunnel and listening to the song they'd heard earlier, except that it is now Charlie who is standing in the back and swaying with the lights passing overhead:<br /><br />\\"I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. We'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now these moments are not stories. This is happening, I am here and I am looking at her. And she is so beautiful. I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive, and you stand up and see the lights on the buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you're listening to that song and that drive with the people you love most in this world.

B005NKGEP2|4.0|Being an expat myself, I bought this book thinking I would be reading about other expat experiences abroad.  However, while i was able to identify with the day to day experiences of moving country, getting the children settled in schools, etc. it turned into a really good spy/thriller book that I couldn't put down.  The denouement was somewhat complex, so had to concentrate during this part, and really enjoyed the twists and turns.  Highly recommend it.

B004LROMWU|2.0|With a premise like this, Falling Skies should have been a real winner. There should have been lots of tension, action, and philosophy. Instead, we have lots and lots and lots of quiet conversation, down time, and what is presumably meant as character development, but which just comes across as filler, meaningless chat, and stock characters. If the planet were really devastated by aliens and people were hunted by advanced machines, the remaining people would be desperate, frightened, and frazzled. But the characters here are relaxed, chatty, and might as well be on vacation. Other than the very infrequent moments when they are actively encountering the aliens, there is no sense at all that any aliens exist. And how is it that these advanced, interstellar travelers can't see a group of 300 people traveling together on foot? The production values are cheap and easy, and while the digital work on the aliens is at least acceptable, there is far too little of it. TV budgets are not movie budgets, of course, but look at what Spielberg can do with sounds and the implied presence of hostile aliens in a movie like War of the Worlds. Lack of money doesn't have to mean lack of effectiveness. This show should be much, much better than it is.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like most people, I love reading product reviews, but never contribute to them.  Why?  Because we're AMERICAN! And we have a right to be lazy! It's in the Constitution or on a cereal box... or something like that. Whatever.<br /><br />However, I was compelled to write this review because Hugh Howey is a great human who also happens to be a great author.  There is not a huge overlap in that Venn diagram  The guy works tirelessly, he is in constant contact with his readers and he is providing a model for future authors to be independently discovered.  Now, none of that would really matter if he wrote terrible books - but luckily for you and I, he doesn't!<br /><br />Howey could charge three times as much as he does for this book and it would still be the best value you'll ever get. Read this book, check out the man's site and then enjoy the rest of your life. I love you.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|I don't think any film has ever moved or inspired me so deeply.<br /><br />A refreshing look at the perilous duties our military men and the stallions that serve with them face on a daily basis!<br />Nice to see an honest, unbiased documentary. Clearly we need to bolster our cavalry, properly equip it, and provide the ever-so-necessary ships so that we can get our boys and their faithful steeds to the fight.<br /><br />Huzzah!

B00913P6G0|1.0|Here's why I don't like this album:<br /><br />[Forgettable production]: The only beats I kind of liked were \\"Poetic Justice\\" and the second part of \\"M.a.a.d City\\". The rest of the album's production is very bland and mediocre.<br /><br />[Brings nothing new to hiphop]: Kendrick is basically a poor mans Andre 3000/Devin the Dude and this album's whole concept is a dumbed down version of Illmatic. I want to hear some innovative new stories and concepts. It's 2012, how many times are we going to hear about the ghetto (especially Compton) and girls?<br /><br />[Kendrick's Voice]: He sounds like a robotic frog with too much spit in his mouth...And that lisp, though...That lisp. ARE YOU SERIOUS?? WHO TOLD YOU YOU COULD BE A RAPPER WITH THAT VOICE?? How can you all tolerate it? It makes me want to pull my eye brows out...<br /><br />--------------<br />I can understand why people like this. 90% of the mainstream rappers out now are a lot worse, hiphop is in a bad place. But simply being better then most of the other rappers DOES NOT MAKE IT GOOD. I could drop an album right now and make better music then 2Chainz, anyone could! I hear people calling this and the J Cole album \\"classics\\" and it just drives me crazy. Are your standards for good hiphop sooo low that you're willing to accept anything that's not Wayne or 2Chainz?? If this had dropped 15 year ago people would be saying IT SUCKED, nuff said.<br /><br />Iumak gives this album a 1.5/10

B001P9KR8U|5.0|I had seen this movie before purchasing it.  I bought it because I liked it so much, that I wanted to see it over & over again. It is a great underdog story, with a very unlikely hero, who you can't help but root for. It's a glimpse into a life that most of us can't imagine. There is action, drama & an incedible love story. I love this movie, right down to the Bollywood song & dance scene. It's a must see!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Conclusive ending with plenty of surprises.   A fast read.  Couldn‘t read the first two without knowing how it all ends.

B009GEEMLY|5.0|when i saw the preview in the movies i could not wait to see the film! And it did not disappoint. The theater was packed and it is the best movie that i have seen in quite a while. The characters were great; Black Widow was a real surprise,she kick butt! Hulk was a scene stealer Thor, Captain, America great and dude major eye candy smile! The Iron Man is out of control and hilarious! Every character including Samuel Jackson and the Hawk gave amazing performances. Oscar worthy.<br /><br />I have rented from Amazon and continue to enjoy it.

B001IF252C|5.0|I've heard a lot of issues with getting the new Achieva Shimian QH270 monitors working with some laptop GPU video out.<br /><br />Specifically the newer MacBook Pro models<br /><br />I'm using an early 2011 i7, 15'' MBP with Thunderbolt @ AMD Radeon 6750M GPU.<br /><br />I went through 2 previous DVI adapters which froze the laptop every time I plugged my new monitor in.  Frustrating!  Then I read somewhere that you need the USB powered adapter to support DVI Dual-Link and such a high resolution.<br /><br />So glad to say it works GREAT.  I know there are other non-Apple models for $60-$70, but I'm glad to have Apple quality.  And it works, doesn't overheat, no flickering.<br /><br />All good on this end.<br /><br />Ben
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it more than the first.  Took my breath away, so intense!!  Can't wait to see where book 3 will led them!!!
B008EL4YX6|1.0|I loved this game when I had the purchased version. Then the developer made it 'free' by adding the most intrusive ads I have ever experienced - ever. This game relies on making on-the-fly decisions while a ball is in flight, but then an ad appears covering the entire screen forcing you to close the ad to continue the game. Of course the ball is still in flight after you close the ad and screws up the game. This is one of the best thought out and programmed games out there, PLEASE make a paid version!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a \\"whodunnit\\" without the cliche ending which I was satisfied with. Too many books have the same story just different players, this was very refreshing.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|All my life I've been a smaller guy...hardly any muscle.  Active but never very strong.  I've tried to change this several times and with all the voodoo junk online it's impossible to figure it out what's good and what isnt.  Getting a personal trainer is tough with the amount of money it takes and how often you have to go.  Michael helps you around all of that...actually...he helps you realize you don't need it.  No fancy diet...no p90x...just simple lift...diet...rest...repeat.  His plans to get healthy and ripped are very easy to understand and follow.  He also actually explains what you're eating and why.  This book is a must have for anyone that isn't seeing anymore gains lately or like me..is just getting started.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is the absolute best kindle fire game I have.<br /><br />It is an adventure and hidden object game. There are great graphics!  The hidden object scenes can be 'pinched' to enlarge.  There is just the right amount of difficulty.<br /><br />You have unlimited hints, and hints recharge quickly. I played the casual mode.<br /><br />The story is great.  It is riveting and has a lot of suspense.<br /><br />The game ends with \\"to be continued\\".  I hope the next one comes out soon.<br /><br />A note - there is NONE of the facebook or twitter garbage screens that keep repeating  that some games have.  And none of the \\"please review\\" screens that also keep popping up in some games.  Those are super annoying.<br /><br />The game flows well and the story and screens match.  It is a very long game.<br /><br />I love it.  I've played it twice so far. I needed to refer to the big fish walkthru for this game twice.  It was very helpful.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I decided not to write a formal review of this one. I really liked it a lot and was glad to be back in Gideon Cross' head and bed. However, I felt a bit let down for some reason. I think my expectations were just too high. That said, I will certainly be reading the next book.

B008YZXYY2|4.0|House of Gold & Bones Part 1 is the fourth album by American rock band Stone Sour and is the first part of a double concept album. It will be released on October 22, 2012 in the UK and then on October 23, 2012 in the United States; it is also the first album without bass player Shawn Economaki, who left the band in 2012, but Rachel Bolan (of Skid Row fame) plays bass on this album.  Stone<br /><br />Sour as of 2012, are:<br /><br />Corey Taylor: vocals, piano (on 'The Travelers, Part 2') and writer (for the House of Gold and Bones short story)<br /> Jim Root: Guitar<br /> Josh Rand: Guitar<br /> Ray Mayorga: Drums, Sythesizer (on 'Gone Sovereign', 'Absolute Zero', 'Taciturn' and 'Influence of a Drowsy God').<br /><br />Following on from 2011's Audio Secrecy I waiting to see if Stone Sour would return to their roots as seen in their eponymous debut album, or whether they would continue on in the same vein as seen in sad album. House of Gold & Bones: Part 1 is the first part of a double concept album with part 2 to be released in 2013 and the release date is yet unknown.<br /><br />Concept albums are such a strange thing for me, and even harder listening to it without the story in front of me which is contained in the album's booklet - a separate booklet without the lyrics. I have listened to a lot of concept albums throughout the years and have always found that they could swing either way, that it being good or being bad. Stone Sour's new album, the first of two, is really a tale of two stories in many regards; it's both heavy yet soft and contains some great musicianship on the album. It begins with 'Gone Sovereign' which is absolute firestorm of an opening track, as it slowly builds up with the intricate guitar work and the explodes through the speakers -- and has an amazing solo in the middle of the song. Next is 'Absolute Zero' is another heavy track and follows on from the previous track.<br /><br />When I first listened to this album, and several listens afterbefore I \\"got it\\", I was really excited for it -- but soon felt disappointed -- and that's why I explain above about concept albums. However after repeated listens I actually saw why it starts off this way.  'A Rumour of Skin' keeps the momentum going with intricate drum work by Ray on the toms, using a variety of techniques and keeping the foot the floor. It keeps the momentum going more heaviness and some really amazing vocals from Corey, as both Jim and Josh provide some excellent guitar work on this song, as Rachel provides some really thunderous bass lines on this song.<br /><br />The song ends and through the speakers floats the sound of acoustic guitar and I can sense the album moving to a different place, the next track is The Travelers Part 1 which is, in fact, the shortest song on the album which clocks in at just about 2 and a half minutes. It's a really nice song that breaks away from the heaviness but Corey's voice shines through here with the acoustic guitar and strings giving accompaniment in the background. It ends and the palmed notes of the guitar of the next song, 'Tired', sing out nicely from the speakers.<br /><br />'Tired' is perhaps my favourite song from the album above all others as I've gone back to it countless times and repeated it just one more, then another and then another; I just love how this song comes together and I especially love the chorus. It's got, also, a really awesome middle section. 'RU486' is perhaps a song that most sounds like Corey of old and is really just a 'balls-to-wall' song, with it's loud and screaming vocals and just in your face attitude. This is a definite contender for a live rendition or perhaps their next video? It could be.<br /><br />'My Name is Allen', the 7th track on the album, is perhaps a little off-putting and is where perhaps you need the story to help you understand - in other words, buy the physical copy! Allen, simply put from what I can gather from reading the story earlier, is a ghost (of sorts) who tells the character to find the House of Gold and Bones - trying to tell you without giving much away.  'Taciturn' is another acoustic track as Corey's vocal layer the track as well piano work and synthesisers by Ray, and the more softer tracks help to break the album up and give it diversity. Halfway through everything enters and the song becomes a real gem of the album, showing perhaps how much Stone Sour have grown up throughout the years when looking back to their debut album.<br /><br />'Influence of a Drowsy God' begins with some piano work by Corey and drums of Ray, with the odd guitar line floating above here and there as the song builds to its climax, with some really poignant vocals from Corey as the guitars enter and there to give depth to the music. 'The Travelers, Pt 2' is more up-tempo than it's predecessor part 1, and it carries on from where part 1 left off. It has more backing than just a guitar and vocals, and has more depth to the music. It saying that, it's just a little bit longer than it's predecessor also by about 10 or so seconds, but it's not much. I somehow feel the second album will make everything seem sense. The last track, 'Last of the Real' seems where Stone Sour want to end on a bang, and knowing it will sometime before part 2 is out, and leave you wanting more which is exactly what I get each time I listen to this album.<br /><br />It starts off with some tasty licks from the bass as Ray pounds on his toms in 4/4 time (from what I can tell), but soon the song kicks in with sudden surprise! Again, Corey's vocals are awesome here, you can feel his tonsils in your face but at the same time he has a very sing-a-long vocal; this song is brilliant and it's just past the 3-minute mark by a second (it lasts 3:01) - as it ends Corey screams out \\"You can't stop me now!\\" and I suppose this is most triumphant album.<br /><br />Overall, House of Gold & Bones: Part 1 is an amazing album from start to finish with variety thrown in there togive the listener a break from the heaviness, but to also show maturity and diversity. With Part 2 coming next year sometime and a tour to follow soon after its release, which I'm sure is going on now at the time of writing, I think perhaps will see (and hear) a lot of more of Stone Sour in the future and I have no doubt that I will be looking forward to part 2 as well. The ultimate clincher for this album is the physical copy with fold-out artwork, a booklet with the story and a picture of the band. Variety, depth and strength are three key words for this album: It has variety (heavy, soft, loud and quiet); it has depth - there are not just the five members but also a string section and more members mucking in to play different instruments than their chosen ones (Ray, for example) and Strength: Stone Sour have preserved through losing their guitarist and ultimately no doubt questioning their future. In short, an amazing album that will, no doubt, make much more sense when part 2 does eventually come out!<br /><br />Rating: 4 / 5.

B008HK3XOU|4.0|Very happy with this product.  Fits the Kindle Fire HD perfectly and think the quality is good for the money.  I bought the red one and it's really nice looking.  Only improvement would be a loop inside for a stylus.  It will close with the stylus inside, but a loop would keep it from rolling out when you open it.  Minor point as most covers do not have a loop for the stylus.

B00846REIS|4.0|I was recommended this book after reading 50 Shades of Grey and it's not all like it. This book was good but I felt it didn't really get really good till well into the 15th & up chapters. Some of the sexual descriptions were too cheesy. Like soft porn but still good & the characters were very bland and not very developed. I gave it 4 stars because aside all its faults I still seemed drawn to it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed all 3 books. The story rreally did not start until book two but then really got suspenseful in book three. I would read anything else that this author cares to write.

B008NABUU8|4.0|Links is superior to this one.  This app takes long times to load even between pages, and the boards don't follow the finger and finger covers the board join, even takes a long time to exit. Not unstable, good permissions<br /><br />UPDATE: The Dev updated the software- my increase to four stars reflects on my Samsung Galaxy SII, the load times are acceptable now and the screen seems more responsive to the touch. Much better after the update.
B005EGXTL2|1.0|I was very disappointed with this trilogy which quickly evaporated to a weak storyline,  and I got the impression that the author was clutching at straws in determining how to exact an appropriate ending for Katniss Everdeen.  Mostly predictable throughout the book and lacked a lot of new material, effectively continuing on from 'catching fire'.

B0096PAA6E|3.0|Having listened to Gary Clark Jr.'s EPs extensively and getting a chance to see him live this year at Lollapalooza, my expectations for this album were almost impossibly high. He is the first guitarist in a long time who can do things with the guitar that truly blow me away, and his Lolla performance gave me the kind of chills I expected after hearing his EPs and understanding what he was capable of.<br /><br />So it comes as no great surprise that his first major studio-album has left somewhat of a sour taste in my mouth after a few start-to-finish listens. The album starts with blaring horns more reminiscent of a Bruce Springsteen album than someone who has the chance to be this generation's Hendrix. And those horns would serve as an unfortunate omen to the rest of the album - an incredibly overproduced, glaringly obvious attempt to appeal to the masses.<br /><br />In some ways I can't blame Gary or his producers for putting out something like this. In this age of piracy and pop garbage it's becoming increasingly harder for \\"real\\" musicians to make a living. And there are certainly moments on the album that succeed in exhibiting Gary's unbelievable talents (Particularly: When My Train Pulls In, Glitter Ain't Gold, Numb, Third Stone From the Sun, You Saved Me and of course Bright Lights, though I prefer the rawer EP version to this album's version). But mixed within these gems are some songs that I'm not even convinced Gary Clark Jr. himself likes - particularly The Life (which was listenable on the EP version, borderline-embarrassing on this album) and the title track (am I listening to R. Kelly?). Then there's Please Come Home which, in the EP version, has an absolutely spine-tingling solo (starting at 1:35 in for those who want to hear it in its pure form) that has trouble distinguishing itself in the LP version because of the melodies his producers have looped over it.<br /><br />All in all, there are tracks on this album very much worth listening to. Anyone who has never heard Gary Clark Jr. before will probably be very impressed by the skills that his producers have managed to display on certain tracks. But for Gary purists like myself, this is just another album falling victim to the heavy hand of producers and pop-radio influence. If you like anything you hear on this album, SEE HIM LIVE! He truly is a legend-in-the-making, and his skills can only be fully appreciated while watching his hands navigate the fretboard with the precision of a brain surgeon, creating magical sounds that soothe the soul. My hope is that he will revert back to this ability in future albums, rather than allowing his producers to strive for mass appeal.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I didn't think this was Lee Child's finest hour. I've been a Reacher fan for a long time but on this one I found the plot line a tad thin particularly the way he was taken to the compound - as if - it was beginning to feel a bit science fiction-ish like an episode of \\"The Prisoner\\" and the whole Wadiah thing seemed to lack a segue. Yeah the plot really needed thickening in the second half of the book. I also found his broken nose refusing to miraculously heal uncomfortable after a while - if you are a reader that really throws themselves into a story your get to feel their pain and in this case my breathing was a struggle!<br /><br />Still - imagine how difficult it would be to come up with new Jack Reacher plots! I've often thought that really Jack should just say to himself one day \\"I think I'm going to Australia\\", come over here and find me and settle down with a woman who loves him (me) and be happy ever after. I will take good care of you Jack, you 6'5' hunk of gorgeousness. Promise.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn was riveting.  Found myself being drawn into the psychology of the intimate drama that was unfolding in each chapter.  Was continually startled by the evolution of each character and I think I was hoping for a clear path and was taken aback how the ending evolved.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|The lastest in the Harry Hole series does not disappoint.  I look forward to these books and devour them faster than they can write them.  Harry is ever the unpredictable, sober-drunk! I love it.  Terrific charater study.
B00913DPW2|3.0|i cant clip the moonflower it dosent work any advice did it happen to you i tryed everything but it wouldn't work
B007THA4FI|1.0|Reading this book was the most disappointing experience I've had in a long time.  I was expecting something that showed more imagination in plot and character development, and I would have liked at least one character I could like in some way. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  What a depressing book!  I can think of no reason to recommend this book to other readers, unless they are just curious about the author's ability to write an interesting novel for adults.  I'm sure that the author has the ability to do so, but I didn't feel it was demonstrated in this first attempt.  Please try again!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loves the books, I will be sorry to be done reading the triology of 50 Shades. Wish there were more to the series
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|this game doesn't give you enough coins to keep playing and it needs more prizesz &bull;&bull;&bull; I played it for one week then deleted it........... not good!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I loved this book. It was very well written and kept me completely into it until the end. I thought he tied everything together perfectly.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved the characters and the easy read. Would definitely recommend the series.  Looking forward to the next book i bought.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|6 inch blade. Good choke and great blade. Grips are awesome and the carbon steel is easy to sharpen and great to abuse. For $32 its the best value knife I bought. Seriously, Ive done a bunch of research and this knife is always in the top 5 survival/hunting knives. If you have the money, get the Fallkniven F1, other than that, this knife will provide more than enough for all your needs. IMO, this is the best knife you can buy for under $200. All the other carbon blades are the same specs or very similar. Save your money. You dont have to buy name brand (NIKE). This is a serious blade. Ive abused this blade and it hasnt given up yet. If you doubt me, google it. You wont be sorry for $32.
B0086700CM|1.0|It would not download correctly. I downloaded it three times.But it still did not run. So I deleted it from my fire.
B006MPKE9O|5.0|Well written, couldn't put this book down.<br />The story takes some interesting twists and keeps you guessing until the end, I highly recommend this book!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Whats not to like about Ken Follett's books. Loved this story..from the miners to the Russian peasents. I thank my lucky stars that i was not alive and living in Russia or England during this time. Good story but some of the talking sessions got kind of boring. I have read every one of his books and will read the second of this triliogy. I recommend this book...but if you like WW II,  spies and women in the service read his book titled Jackdaws too.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was every bit the page turner as Bared to You. Sylvia Day is a fabulous writer, and I can not wait for Entwined with you.
B008NABUU8|5.0|this is a great app for me to use after a long day at school. its a good game when I am uptight and stressed.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I found book two interesting although it was more subdued than book one it kept my attention. Enjoyed the new characters introduced in book two and the ending was a surprise as well. All in all a very good read.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|Icons are small and hard to see.  It's okay, but not that challenging.  It could be better if there was less background and larger tiles.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|Jumping back and forth between the group in the car and the law enforcement people, neither doing anything, was really boring. I got thru 4 chapters, then removed it from my Kindle
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a well constructed, well acted with some of the finest dialogue I have heard in many years.
B008XG1X18|5.0|SO many great ideas and the perfect place to keep them all!  Love it!  I found a neat idea to use a pin/broach attached to the back of a large cardigan to make it fit better & am complimented on it all the time!  Recipes, crafts, workouts, design ideas, quotes, DIY,- this site has it all!
B00992CF6W|5.0|please give this 5 stars because this game is awsome. please put this game as a free game because i really want to play this and my mom wont pay for this app so please put this as a free app. :)
B009CPJHY4|2.0|The movie was a good movie, however the previews led me to believe that there would be more comedy in the movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|simple and fun on my galaxy s3. wish I had more dozer dollars or an in games way to trade prizes for them or something.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game! Drawing pictures for your friends to guess and vise versa makes you use brains and creativity. The game gets much more fun when you are able to purchase more colors with the coins you earn from playing.
0345803493|5.0|The story continues and I realize that I have found a new favorite author. It was difficult to find a place to stop reading (something always happens at the end of a chapter that makes me move on through the next chapter). There are interesting characters and the storyline is unpredictable and exciting. I find myself laughing out loud at parts and the steamy love scenes make me wish I had a fella like this guy. I highly recommend this trilogy and am glad I bought the set. (I can't imagine how hard it would have been waiting for the next book to arrive.)
B009KHBDUU|3.0|Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter - always a good combination, and one that sets expectations.  The film had the expected visual feel, and  an acceptable story line.  Not the best work - but worth the price at home.  I'd have been disappointed if I'd paid full theatre price for the family to see it.
0345803507|5.0|I have fallen in love with the characters Ana and Christian, and would love to read another set that would continue their story. I guess I'll have to settle for re-reading the books. I am anxious to read whatever Ms. James decides to pen next. What a thrilling ending to book 3! This is a story that I will cherish in my mind for years to come. Those who have written the bad reviews...well, I can only assume they are jealous authors whose books didn't make the grade...
B008EEB4TA|5.0|The whole album is great but my favorite song is Fear and Loathing.  It has a great mixture of being pop music that is also introspective.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is really fun! No lie. Not too hard, not too easy, its just right. I enjoy playing this game and I strongly reccomend our purchasing this application. Fallen Tree, you really did it this time. Get this app, you wont regret it. I usually don't like paid games, but this one is worth it 100%.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|great game. very challenging for all ages. I like how you can set the difficult level. my son like it too but he likes a little higher level. I am just learning so I take a easier level.
B006O3MU96|4.0|A Christmas special? Nuh-uh. You can change ut to Christmas themes on the regular one. You don't have to waste a dollar on this. And the regular version has mire themes too. Like Halloween, Under The Sea, Easter, and more. And guess what? It's the same price. Now I'm sure this game is just as fun and cool as the regular, but don't waste your money on this. Get the regular version, and get more out of what you paid for.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|As the mother of a 16-year-old teen, I felt fortunate that my daughter recommended I read this book after she finished it.  I loved it as both a shared experience with my daughter, but also the chance to discuss difficult life challenges and sorrows with her. We are both serious Nerd-Fighters and fans of John Green books!!  We recommend them ALL.<br /><br />John Green is an amazing writer who really understands how difficult growing from a kid into a teen and finally toward adulthood can be today for our young people.<br /><br />I recommend this to every parent of a teen to share with their teen!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I just loved the complete set of the Gilmore Girls!  It comes with an episode guide and a reference booklet of the Gilmore Girls quirky witty quotes.  The complete set comes in a very nice vinyl carrying case.  If you love the Gilmore Girls, you will love the complete set.
B000YMHOUS|5.0|I already saw this movie but I wanted see it again because is very original and beautiful. Perfect for every age and to think about how much the \\"perfection\\" can be imperfect.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|The basic story is of a supposedly young female vampire named Abby who meets and befriends a young boy named Owen.<br />The way the characters related to each other was done in a fashion that anyone could relate to.<br />There were a couple of twists revealed during the course of the story but they were supportive and not shocking.<br /><br />This one will definitely be watched several times.<br />Owen reminds me of myself from childhood to adulthood.<br />Just wish vampires were real and I could have one as a friend.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|There's a lot to see,  must see at least twice to catch everything in it,  moves fast and keeps your brain on a rollercoaster,
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love this product so much that I can not wait to watch on a day when iam not working and there is nothing to watch on tv
B005LAIHAE|4.0|OK, having seen this movie I know first hand that this movie is not as bad as it is made out to be by ALL the reviewers here on Amazon. I won't go over the plot and the actors, as they have been dug deeply into in the previous reviews. Instead, I shall tell you it like it truly is.<br /><br />The movie, 'Cold Light Of Day' is a good, decent action movie. You get pulled in and it never lets you go. Why? Well, you just don't know who to trust and what is around any given corner. Sure Henry C. is made out to be a \\"super spy\\" instead of the stockbroker he seemingly is, but that's OK, as it truly doesn't deter you from watching the movie. My guess is this movie was made a couple of years ago before his upcoming blockbuster 'Superman - Man Of Steel' comes to our screens. Sometimes these kind of direct-to-DVD movies sit on shelves for ages until one of the leads becomes famous. (Take, for instance, 'Cabin In The Woods' with Chris Hemsworth, filmed in 2009 and released this year due to 'Thor'!)<br /><br />Anyway, I digress. But I do agree that Bruce W. is wasted in the role of the father living on a boat with his wife, Caroline G. They have moved around, as a family for years, but now have all the kids around the table (on said boat) for the first time in a while. Rafi G. as Henry C's younger brother is wasted film fodder, much the same as his GF, the lovely Emma H. More than a hint of 'Bourne' runs thru Henry C. but unlike that other action character, this one \\"feels\\" real in his mistakes, wrong turns, pain.<br /><br />Verónica E. as Henry C.'s \\"love interest turned sister\\" is both beautiful and full of action angst herself. Mind you, when being chased by Sigourney W. thru the streets, and coming off their moped rather badly, they both get up - and she, wearing a short skirt throughout, hasn't a scratch on her delicate thigh in the slightest! And, they both get back up and on the broken bike and roar off!<br /><br />Joseph M. as the main bad guy is a treat to watch, but gets predictable very quickly. I mean, Henry C. has three (3) clear cut chances to kill him or at least badly wound him to stop him trying to kill them, but never takes the shot. Instead he tries to chat his way out of things! For me though, Roschdy Z. as the bad guy/good guy is brilliant! His voice, with that vibe of Morgan Freeman running through it, makes the last third of the movie his own.<br /><br />Anyway, running at 93 minutes, filmed in Spain (so great scenery), and staring some big names that yes, I agree, were doing \\"paycheck movies,\\" 'Cold Light Of Day' is definitely not to be taken seriously - but then again, are 'Bourne' and 'Taken' and all those others?!<br /><br />Russell A. Trunk
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely loved this series.  i read all three books in 3 weeks!  Enjoy!  Don‘t let embarrassment or shame keep you from reading this series.  Its a love story where bad boy turned good and good girl turned bad.
0345803485|4.0|So far I've managed to read the first two books and I must say it was totally unexpected! I've bought the books in may and postponed reading them ever since!!<br />It's a good read,a page turner indeed,it keeps your curiosity wide awake!!<br />Shame for the bad reviews,I'm guessing people are not quite used to this kind of storyline.I like the fact that has a big of everything in it!! and let's face it,appart from all the harsh erotic practices,we all want a man like Christian Grey in our lives!! I like his desire of protecting a woman,his constant unpredictability!!<br />Looking forward to starting the third one!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|great app! I am very happy with how it works. the twenty George min is annoying. im happy blah blah
B005LLSNNE|5.0|This show is the best thing on t.v right now two thumbs up, Amazon makes it all fast and easy to pick and watch what you want when you want!
B008NABUU8|2.0|this game has so much potential to be amazing. the graphics are great but the game freezes up constantly.  majority of the time you have to hard reset the kindle and shut down just to fix it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I liked this book. The typo errors were a little irrating but the story line was good. I'd reccomend it to others to read.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|If you like a good well written book to read, then this book is for you.<br />Set loosely in an early historical era, with a touch of fantasy, knights, wars, and  battles over kingship, this book will keep you reading to the end.<br />I'm already reading the second book in this series :[[ASIN:B000FC1HBY A Clash of Kings: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Two]]
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This has been a great read, it has been a great way to continue the series. There have been some twists didn't even think to see and great story lines from previous books in series. Can't wait for next installment.
0375836675|5.0|\\"I'm not the messenger at all.<br />I'm the message.\\"<br />Markus Zusak, I am the Messenger<br /><br /> I, with my limited vocabulary and minimal writing experience cannot begin to describe how good this book is, but I will do my best. Ed Kennedy, the main character is so well described and we really get to look into this character as if we were a trusted confidant, or God, with his story. Ed is an underage cab driver, in love with his best friend Audrey and is down on his luck. That all changes when he stops a bank robbery, the media is on him and his mother (who he doesn't have a great relationship with to begin with) starts to brag about him. With all the good coming out of this act of bravado, he starts to receive playing cards in his mail, particularly the aces of a deck of cards. The cards tell him where to go but not what to do.  This is where the story really begins.<br />I think that I am the Messenger is the best book I have ever read, it has a plot that is exciting and thrilling. It has a love story with some action, a drama with comedy, and a story of \\"just another stupid human\\" becoming so much more than he expected. The characters are so entertaining and fresh that you wish you knew them yourself and will keep you wondering what will come after on the next page. Audrey and Ed's love story will melt your heart and his story with Marv and Ritchie may just break it.<br /><br />\\"We only sit there now. Audrey and me. And discomfort. Squeezed in, between us. She soon says. \\"You're my best friend, Ed.\\" \\"I know.\\" You can kill a man with those words. No gun. No bullets. Just words and a girl.\\"<br />Markus Zusak, I am the Messenger<br /><br />Ed's struggle to help the people that are shown to him throughout the book is truly sad at some points. For instance when Ed must stop a Man from raping his own wife every night, or when he must bring two brothers together by letting himself be the object of their rage. Or when he has to help his own mother. The book is thesort of thing that makes you relook at people in the world. Where you might see a criminal, someone else might see an angel. It made me realize that anyone can go past his or her so called potential.<br />\\"Sometimes people are beautiful.<br />Not in looks.<br />Not in what they say.<br />Just in what they are.\\"<br />Markus Zusak, I am the Messenger
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Pretty neat. Takes up a chunk of time to play. Great graphics. Wears the battery down but what do you expect?
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well written and descriptive, but I thought the book was lacking in depth, much like the relationship of the characters.   <br />Very little is revealed in the first book, which leaves you wanting more....precisely the point.
B005KA188S|5.0|It came in great shape and had special features that we always enjoy after seeing the movie itself.  It's always a plus to have a regular DVD along with the bluray.  My Dad's place doesn't have a bluray player, but we can still watch it there.
B006PFC2S2|5.0|Family favorite with memorable tunes. Go home to Bonnie Jeanne always makes me smile. The Heather on the Hill is sweet. It's one my wife and daughter and I can watch on the sofa with a fire in the fireplace and a blanket between us. Nice.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I really love this game, lots silly achievements and lots of things to do! Truely an excellent waste of time :)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|It is kind of a mix between Harry Potter and Twighlight, but not as good as either of them.  Once again anoher book about teenagers.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can not wait for the next book!! Love this series! I could not put it down, I was done with one in less than twenty four hours.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After reading The Hunger Games & Catching Fire I had to read Mockingjay the final book of the three part trilogy. The book was good but a little hokey in spots. There are a few surprises near the end of the book that drive home the cost of revolution and the price of freedom.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|what more can be said, its a great cd, all you haters, you were so wrong. Anyone who gave this 1 star is NOT a fan. Kiss, there doing it for the love of rock n roll. AND WE LOVE YOU FOR IT. ROCK ON.An up date, kiss is still on tour, and one of the few greatest rock band. I am gonna see them in july for the 5 th time. Rock and Roll never forgets the best. YOU WANTED THE BEST, YOU GOT IT ..........KISS.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Really a good movie, wish I could be so creative when my time comes. A must see with your girl
B008TMA1LY|4.0|My cousin is 7 and loves playing the game. Even at the fast pace as you go up in levels she never gives up. The only thing I dislike is to upgrade you have to have hearts which you don't get very often unless you want to spend real money which is not gonna happen.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Lots of fun levels to find hidden objects. Give it a try and I'm sure you will like it too!
B0013F1D02|5.0|amazing fairy tale, with good actors and a better ending then the book version. gotta see it! leaves you feeling happy you saw the movie.
0316228532|1.0|I really disliked this book. Maybe I disliked it because I was accustomed to JK's writing style that conveyed a myriad of emotions within one's self. This book was, well, made me feel yucky...a downer. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friends or family.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Edge of your seat whole book. Great read. I recommend this book to anyone. Nice to know the truth about how Osama was taken out.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|This the first \\"Enigmatis\\" game I have ever played,tried the free version and enjoyed it very much. There is an actual storyline not just words to move the HO along. The game play is easy and flows very well. If there is a sequel I will buy that one also.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I think this game is ok because its just one of those. games that you can play when there nothing to do or. a game that the younger kids can play for fun.Thisis just what I think but I would give coin dozed a 3 out of 5 because it is just to sample.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Imaginative and insightful, Prometheus offers up the best of sci-fi adventure. Scott gives the audience plenty of eye candy and action while also giving the brain something to chew on. Can't wait for more!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This story raises a lot of question about our domestic security.  How safe are we from terror and disruption?  It also stimulates questions about balancing freedoms versus security.  As usual, Jack Reacher takes us through the logic along with introducing seemingly useless trivia which indeed ties back to the plot.<br /><br />Hard to put down.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Book of the year for me. So insightful and compassionate about the human condition whilst being a page turning unputdownable story at the same time. This is a novel that will stay with you for a long time after reading, and might just make you a better person.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|This is a very sweet love story and optimistic dystopic tale. It is perfect for adults and kids. With an added treat for lovers of Hello Dolly!
B008J34466|5.0|It's Pink!  Love it!  There's a great diversity in the songs and a growing maturity to the sound of Pink's voice.  I look forward to more to come from this great artist.
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I think Avengers was the best movie that came out this year, at least among the movies I've seen so far (the Hobbit has not come out yet).  I would gladly give this PRODUCT a 5 star review based on the movie, but the digital movie my family rented through Amazon had terrible audio quality.  My TV was turned up to 100%, when other digital media even from Amazon instant video is much louder.  I hate the fact that I had to turn off everything in my house to hear the movie, and still missed the major things said.  It would be so nice if the Amazon instant videos at least came with closed captioning available if the audio is not going to be loud...  Other than my complaints on the digital product, I loved the movie!
B005QI4TP8|4.0|While I enjoy this album because of the uniqueness to the groups sound, many of the songs sound the same.  Not as much variety in this album as the last one, but still enjoyable.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|No complaints on ordering or shipping.  The DVD arrived on time and nicely packaged.  The disc was not damaged nor was the case.  The quality of the movie is great.
0399157565|4.0|I have collected everything I could written by Patricia Cornwell.<br /> At one time I was a pathology technician for a forensic pathologist,<br /> so I am comfortable with those details in all of her writings.<br />This effort lacks descriptive detail that would carry my interest<br />between episodes. A bit boring.
B004HWR406|4.0|Good movie.  I enjoy movies based on true stories.  Watched it instantly on Amazon and it was good quality - no problems.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Thought the book was really good.  At the end of the book you learn all that Gideon has hidden from Eva and know that he truly loves her.
B003DZX3SA|4.0|This movie was my all-time favorite as a little girl.  Can't find these DVDs in the store all the time, so I purchased it off Amazon.  Arrvied on time and in good quality.  Good deal for 2-disc set.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|A nice way to kill a few minutes.  I just wish the coins replentished a buy faster.  Still,  it's great.
0312323867|4.0|Read all of Emily Giffin's books, but wanted to own a copy for myself.  Ordered this book along with 2 of her other books and all of them arrived in great quality.  Enjoy!
B008NABUU8|4.0|Playing this on Kindle Fire HD. Good quality game, good graphics. It does seem to have an issue telling which way is up on my kindle, It can get annoying to be playing, then the screen flips. To fix this issue I have to hold the tablet almost flat.
B00275EHJG|4.0|Saw the movie in the theaters and knew I had to own it.  Found a good deal on Amazon and snatched it up.  Great movie.  The quality of the DVD is perfect.  My package arrived quickly and was nicely packaged.  The DVD didn't have any damage.
B005FFW46S|3.0|This book is not Terry Pratchett's worse, but neither is it his best. The book has a fair amount of action mixed with Commander Vimes's views on life in the country, his role as both a cop and a landowner, and his duties as a father. At times the philosophy threatens to drowned the book, but it is still a good read.
B009CPES4I|5.0|This film was full of fine actors who we have all come to love over the years.  The sweet stories and high (sometimes dark) comedy make this movie a must see for true film-lovers!  Human stories that entertain and resonate for all of us.  Enjoy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is fantastic. I always know exactly how much battery is left, and what my Fire can do with the remaining power. A simple and easy to use app with lots of useful information.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie a lot. But, I just came back from the store without buying anything...it appears that there are more extras on the DVD(especially deleted scenes on the Blu Ray than the DVD). If so, I am not happy. Can anyone speak to this point. I assune I am the first one to notice it because the film was just released today.<br /><br />I am a big fan of the film, which I saw twice...once in the Castro Theater in SF.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Heartfelt, profound singing, where artist becomes a messenger of the soul, these tracks open you to a transcendental truly human experience.  Thank you Mr. cash.
1402270275|5.0|I sometimes have a hard time finding new authors that write well and let me lose myself in an interesting and great story, but this book did that for me.  Even though there was not a lot of sreampunk in this story, it was a terrific read and the characters had great depth and were very engaging.  No Mary Sue in this one.  Great writing that flowed nicely with none of the stilted dialog you sometimes find. I honestly had a hard time putting it down and found myself up at four am trying to squeeze in one more chapter before going to bed.  I'm now anxiously awaiting the next story from this author.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|I bought this because the radio on my truck came with an ipod plug, and i wanted to play songs over my phone. Sadly, it didn't work, which was a huge hit considering the price of this thing! I really cannot rate this badly, as i was attempting to use it for a purpose it wasn't designed for. All well!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is the best free game. bonus coins, regeneration, i have a hard time putting it down. kindle fire was the best purchase i've ever made!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! It does a very good job keeping you interested by adding the hard goals to complete. I think it is WAY better than Dragonvale; As your dragons grow they remain cute, but in Dragonvale they look gross (except on very rare occasions). This game has given me hours of pleasure, and will continue to do so for years to come!
B00902MCVY|5.0|This album was everything I expected it to be. The entire album while a bit short is a masterpiece. It is a must own. If I say anymore I am afraid I will ruin it for you! Buy this album, at $10.00 it's a steal!!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Excellent writing.  I found the characters interesting and real.  The only thing that bothered me was that she did not put more emphasis on boyfriend who really did make a poor decision not to tell anyone.  That is inexcusable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This trilogy wont let you go to bed! It definitely keeps you wanting more I can't wait for a forth book!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Not as good as book 1 took too long for the points to be made I was very disappointed...hope next book make up for this one..
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have this app for my kindle fire and I absolutely love it!! it does not drain my battery  at all so I do not know what the other people are talking about. Also love the math problem solving portion. I can sleep through any alarm except this one.
0345803507|4.0|It was very interesting.  Couldn't wait to read the book to find out more about Mr. Grey and what made him the way he was.
B009UR2QMO|5.0|I was so excited to hear that this show was getting Hook and man I was not disappointed! He portrays Hook in a different fashion than I was expecting, not to mention he is HOT!!! Can't wait to see more episodes with him!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Game starts off slow but after collecting prizes you start to make progress. But be warned game is very addicting! I have trouble putting it down.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Not quite as good as the second one but still a dang good read. Great use of mythology throughout. You will more than likely learn something.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|getting worse - trying to be flynn<br />reacher has become \\"unbelievable\\"<br />the early stuff was good reading, but this does not read good nor does it even begin to be believable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Oh, deliciously twisted and demented...it begs for an equally disturbing sequel.  With alternating perspectives offered in each chapter, Gone Girl is thoroughly engrossing.
B0088749CW|4.0|The Tall Man is not a Horror film but a thought provoking Drama/Mystery that is well written ,acted and executed.<br />It morphs from one Disguised genre to another with shocking revelation and ease.I found myself so engrossed in the film and it really left an impact on me,I can't say a lot about the plot as not to give too much away but I will say that if you are looking for a Horror film this isn't what you want but if you want an intelligent film that leaves you somewhat conflicted watch it.<br />It will have you thinking about it long after the end credits roll.I think the bad reviews are from people that expected and wanted to see a Horror flick and I can understand that as I love Horror as well but was not at all disappointed when the Tide turned.<br />Jessica Biel and Samantha Ferris are stand outs in their roles and the rest of the cast is impressive as well
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I liked the way it kept me wanting to read more. if you like a thriller with a little sifi mlxed in you should try this book
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a book series I read when I was in 8th grade. Not wanting to do the math let's just say that I was happy to hand this series to my now 6th grader. It's has lovable characters that are twisted up in a high paced sci-fi plot that leaves you guessing until the very end. My son was thrilled to know it was not a stand alone series and more than ready for book two. I read everything from Stephen King to Ayn Rand to Diana Galbaldon and everything in between so I know a good book when I find it. Remember this is set at the same reading level as say...Harry Potter so don't expect it to keep you busy for long.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Another Reacher book to hold you spellbound.  Do not start it if you have other things that demand your attention because you cannot put this book down.  Be prepared to stay up until the wee hours of the morning in order to finish it.
B005KELQEU|1.0|Bought a Belkin cover for my first Kindle and have been happy with it.  This one was bought as a gift with the new paperwhite kindle and is very poor quality.

B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller is excellent, order was earlier than they promise, I've had for a year now and still is in excellent conditions.

B004ADH1RI|5.0|The full pop up commentary is better then the movie itself for those of us who were kids and have seen it a hundred times(like every weekend on WPIX in the late 80's!). The bluray quality is good, the extras are a bit pointless, but the commentary is completely hilarious!
B0027MJU00|4.0|Dark Places was indeed very dark...... lots of characters to keep track of, but VERY good.  If you liked Gone Girl, this is a good read to piggy back on it!

B008YZXYY2|5.0|Stone Sour has evolved on this album. Corey Taylor is unique, he is a mastermind. Corey's vocals are amazing. I love this album. They keep getting better with each release. I don't think I'll ever get tired of Corey Taylor, I love everything that he has done. This is defiantly different from their last album. It has a mix of everything you could ever want slow, and hard. Vocal wise this is Corey's best album. They are pushing beyond the limits on this album. This album is very creative. Corey's voice is so magical, wonderful, beautiful, and special. I've been listening to him since I was 13, and when I finally got to meet him, it was the best thing ever. I looked up to him through out my teenage years, and I still do. Stone Sour, and Slipknot are my favorite two mainstream bands. He is a great person. He is real. Stone Sour are passionate musicians. I still feel like they are underrated, even though they have had all this success. I really connect with the song Taciturn, it's an emotional song. Corey's voice can be soft, heavy, and brutal. In my opinion this is the best rock, and metal mainstream album that has came out this year. They show all of their musical sides on this album. This is defiantly a music lovers album. Corey is getting older, and still rocking harder. He keeps getting better as the years goes by. This is a must have album this year.

B007SGM084|5.0|The Trilogy was great, I can wait for a movie to come from it. The first book was a so, I really can't think of a word.  I couldn't wait to read the other two to see why he was the way he was. What a great read.
0316228532|2.0|My title pretty much sums it up. I am a grumpy reader, I dont often find books I really very much like. Prior to reading this one, I read some King books that I barely enjoyed and some random library books I had never heard of which were mostly just about better than not reading anything at all. Unfortunatley Casual Vacancy fits right in with these.<br /><br />I was actually hoping that this one would stand out in quality and that my purchase of it was to be a sure hit. I am very disappointed that it didnt live up to any kind of expectations. Rowling is lucky that in the purley technical sense she is a good writer because at least I could live with it. With a lot of other books, I just give up completely, so I guess it wasn't a total waste.<br /><br />It isn't one that I couldn't put down, though, either. The plot chugs along. It is peppered with raw sex and some violence, which make it seem a little forced, especially during the first third. You can actually see her going \\"I can write about sex now. This is not for kids. Let's add some genitals here, here and here.\\" If the sex and the grime had dropped in natrually into the plot, I wouldn't have minded it so much but it just felt so \\"inserted\\". Pun intended.<br /><br />Why does the whole book feel like a preview to the actual novel? The characters and the story are just sketched. As if there was a lot more to come, somehow.<br /><br />Meh.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love the options. setting the same alarm for multiple day of the week. multiple alarms. choosing the type of sound or the song for each alarm. and the alarm starts of soft and then gets louder is nice.

0425263916|5.0|This reader has been an antsy girl just waiting to get her hands on the newest addition to the beautiful disaster that is Eva and Gideon's relationship. If you read my review for the previous book, you'll know how much I adore this loving, sexy train wreck.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when I started reading Reflected in You. I just knew that after Bared to You that I hadn't had enough of this troubled couple or the drama that circled them like vultures looking for food. Obviously there were questions and issues that had yet to be addressed which easily set up this second installment for more angst and pain.<br /><br />The author did an amazing job of answering some of those burning questions from the previous book while creating more and weaving an even more intimate tale of love, lust and pain.<br /><br />This book picks up right were we left off with Bared to You. Eva and Gideon are still trying to wade through their somewhat unhealthy relationship which consists of sex, love, addiction, obsession, and a huge dash of possession. Typically the latter three are never healthy in any manner, but it's the only way this couple knows how to be. They go to couple counseling to try to work around those potentially deadly traits. The book begins with a focus on their issues together, apart and as a whole. Both wanting trust from the other yet between his secrets, both old and new, and her jealousy it would be hard for any couple to overcome such things. But one thing that never falters is their deep love for one another. Their devotion is show in this quote:<br /><br />` \\"It's what you see in me, angel,\\" he said quietly, his features softening. \\"That you can know what I have in me and still want me as much as I want you. I go to sleep every night afraid I'll wake up and you'll be gone. Or that I scared you away . . . that I dreamed you--\\" \\"No. Gideon.\\" Jesus. He broke my heart every day. Shattered me.'<br /><br />Overall, Ms. Day did a fabulous job with the characters portraying the vast range of emotions people experience, not only in an intense sexually charged relationship, but when the participants of said relationship are haunted by pasts filled with pain, trauma and betrayal. I didn't feel as Eva's extreme reactions were unwarranted for the situation, and I didn't feel as though Gideon was demanding too much when he did. In all honesty, I think in a few scenes most people would have been more severe than these characters were.<br /><br />Still, I could not put this book down, and may have neglected a few things in order to lose myself in this tale. The pain was real, the sex was scorching and the love was as deep as an ocean. This book felt like such a puzzle until everything started to fall into place at the very end. If you're like me, you'll find yourself marking your calender for December 31st, when Entwined with You is released because you'll be hungry to see if Eva and Gideon find their happily ever after.<br /><br />Originally posted at Long and Short Erotic Reviewsacters portraying the vast range of emotions people experience, not only in an intense sexually charged relationship, but when the participants of said relationship are haunted by pasts filled with pain, trauma and betrayal.

B005LAJ16I|5.0|HOMELAND is beyond phenomenal. This is a superbly written series with an amazingly talented cast. I had heard so much about this show and was hooked after the first episode. I spent several nights watching as many episodes as I could. I couldn't get enough of Carrie Mathison (Claire Danes) and  Nicholas Brody (Damian Lewis)and Brody's family.<br />What a fascinating story to tell and I appreciated that the show follows one story rather than a new story each week. Finally a drama where we can go into depth and detail on characters. HOMELAND is seriously addictive.<br />Danes has found her perfect role in Carrie Mathison - the psychologically troubled yet dedicated CIA agent. She takes her job seriously but psychological problems are always lurking. From a contact in Iraq, she learns that an American POW has been \\"turned\\". He is now on the side of the extremists.<br />Out of the blue, a missing and assumed lost soldier Sgt Nicholas Brody is rescued in a daring mission. He has been held for 8 years and now he is returning to his wife Jessica (played buy the stunningly beautiful Morena Baccarin and two kids. His son barely remembers him while his \\"little girl\\" is a troubled teenager.<br />There is a story in itself of a family trying to rebuild itself after the father has been missing for 8 years years. What on earth would that be like? HOMELAND explores that on some level but I think they did miss the boat on exploring it even further and deeper. The Brody family has to rebuild itself.<br />Mathison suspects that Brody is the POW who has been \\"turned\\" but she has no hard evidence. Enter her superior and mentor Saul Berenson (Mandy Patinkin)as the only person she trusts with her suspicions. Amazing that she does not tell her boss or coworkers what her contact in Iraq told her. She goes on a one woman mission to prove Brody is now a terrorist bent on major destruction. HOMELAND plays this suspicion very well. We're never quite sure what Brody's intentions are and clearly, anyone held in miserable conditions for 8 years is going to have \\"issues.\\" This also brings up another point. It seems that Brody is debriefed before he arrives home and is never offered counseling or help. I would suspect that both he and his family would need some extensive counseling but it seems like Brody returns home and that is that.<br />It took me awhile to warm up to Mandy Pantinkin's character Saul Berenson. Berenson doesn't often say much but it is his expressions that tell stories. At first, Berenson seemed like an unnecessary throw-away character but his importance grows and Mathison falls apart mentally.<br />There are several twists and turns in HOMELAND. The writers keep the audience guessing and not everything is what it seems. The show does seem to follow stereotypes as far as Arabs are concerned. Obviously, HOMELAND is employing There are several Arab and Arab-American actors, but most are terrorists or wannabes. Although a couple struggle with their consciences, we don't see many normal everyday people trying to make a peaceful life in the US.<br />One thing we learn quickly in HOMELAND is that if an agent (Mathison in this case) promises protection in exchange for information that will stop a terrorist again, be sure to run and run far. One thing will surely happen when a person agrees to cooperate.<br />Overall, HOMELAND is an amazing show. The story and twists keep the view captivated. Danes and Lewis are at the top of their game as actors. Season 2 leaves us wanting more. Nothing is resolved so the story continues.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Using more than usual erotic and sex scenes makes it boring at parts. The story goes ahead with good speed though. But nothing special about it in general.
0767802519|5.0|This movie is very entertaining & full of action! I've watched it several times & it never gets old. Great Friday night movie with buttery popcorn, not for kids
B005LAIH54|5.0|Both movies Clash/Wrath of the Titans were good, but for my personal taste, I like Clash just a smidge better. The creatures were better - as I'm more familiar with them from the original movie. I also liked the fact that Perseus was inexpereinced and slightly immature versus being a more grown up, responsible adult. It just made for a more interesting story. In Wrath, I like the involvement of the other gods a little more (Ares and Poseidon) and I was disappointed to see them go. Still a good movie.
B008KEQMDC|3.0|The movie was kind of corny but I laughed at some scenes. Chris Rock was funny in his role & I liked Jennifer Lopez's character. This movie tried a lil too hard but it wasn't awful, just extremely predictable

B0055S348W|2.0|Was a wonderful printer app for a while. Then lost its &quot;print rendering&quot; ability for DOCs only: previewed and printed them as blank pages. but still printed PDFs, JPEGs and XLS.  Now has lost rendering for PDFs and XLS, too; it only previews and prints JPEG pictures. A great loss; I've never been able to make any other remote printer apps work on my Kindle Fire.  I emailed Printer Share tech support but they've never responded. (I wonder if this is part of the Google vs. Amazon war; I note that Printer Share works with Google Play (none of those Google apps work with Kindle Fire). Inability to print on paper greatly decreases the value of my Fire, sadly...

B008KGWWL6|5.0|The long and short of this review: Just go out and buy this box set. They picked some fantastic recordings for almost everything, the texts are included (something I HATE to see missing in these mega sets), and it really is about as complete as it gets.<br /><br />I never realized how small Ravel's output was -- 8 hours of listening a day, and you can hear the entire corpus over a lazy weekend (like I did).  I recommend this approach; I appreciate his genius so much more for it.  It really surprised me how outstanding every single work he wrote is.  One might expect the afternoon to drag on as some of the lesser works pass by, but there is hardly a dud.  I typically hate chansons and melodies (CD 6 and 7), but Ravel keeps it tuneful and dramatic at all the right points.  Having the texts with excellent translations certainly helps.<br /><br />I am most familiar with Ravel's orchestral and piano works, so I view this set as having two heroes: Charles Dutoit and Jean-Yves Thibaudet. Where their names show up, it is nothing but perfection and bliss.  When it's not, things are still ok, but you wonder why Decca chose to stray from these champions.<br /><br />I think most people are most familiar with his orchestral works (CD 8 - 11), and the Dutoit recordings are just stellar -- transparent textures but weighty at the climaxes. I used to dread Daphnis et Chloe, but this recording gave me chills. There's a CD with Abbado conducting the Piano Concertos and it's good (CD 10 -- Valses nobles et sentimentales, Menuet antique, and Le Tombeau de Couperin round out the disc), but the performances across the board just aren't as crisp as Dutoit's.  For example, the pacing in the Valses in particular is off almost from the get go.  I very strongly recommend you investigate the Dutoit-Thibaudet recordings of the Piano Concertos on the London label, they are the gold standard in my book.<br /><br />The solo piano works (CD 1 and 2) are oustanding for the most part, but it's a little weird that they picked Thibaudet for the first disc of solo works, and then a mix for the next disc and the 4-hand stuff (CD 3).  Aimard's performance of Miroirs is crazy good, but I find Argerich's piano version of the Valses nobles et sentimentales to be too dry.  Some of the 4-hand recordings are from the 1970s, and you can hear the recording hiss as they pivot between those ADD performances from the 1970s and the more DDD modern ones, which I find very distracting.<br /><br />The two discs of chamber works (CD 4 and 5) are treasures.  The String Quartet is famous and the Melos Quartet does great things with it.  I was much less familiar with the rest of his output, but two particular gem that delighted me were the second Violin Sonata with its blues-influenced middle movement and perpetual mobile finale, and the Introduction and Allegro with a cascading harp that oozes French sophistication.  I go between being sad that so much of Ravel's chamber music is overlooked and being thrilled to coming across it for the first time.<br /><br />The one-act operas are both conducted Maazel (CD 12 and 13).  I'm not very familiar with either of them so I can't say if they're good or great, but the music in both have that Ravel-sparkle to them.  I am surprised they don't show up more often on stage.  The cantatas on the last disc (CD 14) are (to me, at least) just curiosities.  It reminds me of Massenet, which isn't a good thing.<br /><br />These minor criticisms shouldn't dissuade you in the least to get this set.  I have no idea how a complete Ravel set has never been issued before, but with a set this uniformly excellent across the board, it was definitely worth the wait.e weird that they picked Thibaudet for the first disc of solo works, and then a mix for the next disc and the 4-hand stuff (CD 3).

0316228532|2.0|I waited all year for Casual Vacancy.  I had high expectations after reading the best series of books ever \\"Harry Potter\\".  When I ordered it I \\"knew\\" I would love it.  As I started to read it I \\"hoped\\" I would love it.  Halfway through I knew I was continuing on with the knowledge that this is J.K. Rowling, it has to be great.  Right?  Ahh...Wrong.  I feel utterly let down by this effort.  While I appreciate the layers of writing and the characters - - I just don't care about them.  I can't say I hated it, but would I read it again knowing what I know now?  I wouldn't.  What a bummer...

B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is awesome!! recommended for future photographers and people who just like posting photos. Great to see who suits ur style.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great app!  Great game!  Lots of fun and stays challenging because it gets harder as you go.  I really enjoy this game.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|This band was so different from all the other rock bands.  Very futuristic and amazing.  Well worth the purchase.  This album is a timeless classic.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I love to play this game in arcades and was hoping the app would be similar.  It is, however, they only let you play for a short while before they want you to pay real money to buy more tokens.  I had no idea it was going to be like this.  I still play it, but was disappointed.
B0052UYJDC|2.0|This book, while somewhat interesting, didn't have as much substance as I was hoping for. The author is funny, but a little forced. I just didn't find her ideas very original.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|If you are a fan of the Underworld series as I am you will love this movie. Also if you are a fan and you don't own this movie yet you should get it!!! It is not my favorite of the series but it is definitely up there!
B0042ESTQW|4.0|The Garmin Silicon Case is just exactly as advertised. It is light and yet keeps the Garmin protected. Still easy to charge and hook to your computer. Love it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is the best... Were to begin? First this game has amasing  graphics, great armer, advenchure, and action. I LOVE this game!!!!! If you like action/advenchure, GET THIS APP!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from an author that I had never heard of. What a pleasent surprise. I got to the end and was only dissapounted that I was already done with the book. I'm glad that I have it on my phone so I can be sure to recall his name when I am book shopping again.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I really enjoy the game but lately when I exit and come back to play my purchases aren't saved. I've had to buy some stuff 3 or 4 times, very frustrating.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I struggled through the first book but thought I'd finish the trilogy so have now finished book two.  I find the book  to be repetitive and not well written.  It definitely isn't a page turner; in fact I find myself flipping through pages just to get to what the conclusion is and I never read a book in that fashion.  It's okay but not worth the hype it's getting.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|Tom Hardy presents a killer performance of England's most expensive criminal and every scene is spectacular! Plenty of bonus features including a sneak peek at P-Nut's training routine for Mr. Hardy. This movie was worth every penny!
B008NABUU8|1.0|Haven't played or even downloaded this one. Luckily I was paying attention because it is listed in the free section but is pay app.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Let me just start by saying, if I could have rated this a 0 out of 5 stars I would. Do not buy your Lifeproof case from this company, they are selling fakes. No wonder so many people have had troubles with this case. If you have ordered one call the Lifeproof customer service line and tell them the serial numbers on the inside of the case. They will be able to tell you if it is a fake or not. I repeat, DO NOT buy a case from this company. The true Lifeproof cases are wonderful. I have the real one now, after having to return the one I bought here, and have dropped my IPhone out of my car numerous times onto the concrete and it is still in one piece not a scratch!! Lifeproof is a wonderful company, also if you go online you can sign up for a 360 (+5) day warranty for no charge. Again, Lifeproof makes wonderful cases, but this company is selling fakes! Do not be fooled and buy one from here they are FAKE!!!
B000000H6D|5.0|Back in 1994, that's the version I bought.  I was marveled by all the tracks and especially by the pictures in the digipack. It took me a while to find out there was a booklet shoved in the digipack, because it was not very visible or apparent as in other digipacks.  I no longer have that CD and I bought the standard version later. In my opinion, the original version is somewhat inferior. Without the cemetery angels and the much more shocking picture at the front (which is not the front cover showing here -- that one's only in the booklet) and with some introductions I could live without instead of the beautiful \\"Suspended in dusk\\".  Maybe the new \\"top shelf\\" edition might be better suited for die-hard fans, but this is the ideal version for me.  I've just bought this one now.  My only complaint:  in the re-issue, the booklet is loose in the digipack and there's no place to tuck it in safely.  I suppose this was made so that the booklet is finally more apparent and everybody will see it the moment they open the CD, but I'd rather they came up with a booklet stapled within the digipack as a book instead.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Sylvia day is a great writer... Easy to read and very enjoyable! Can't wait for the third installment in December!! Better than 50 shades of grey :)
B000002B7S|5.0|A very well mastered version with all the pictures from the original LP and all the tracks from both versions of the original LP.  No changes made in the sound, except maybe the slightly better sound quality if compared to the 1980s edition.  In my opinion, all other versions of this album should be replaced with this one.
B00845MRKE|3.0|Today I received my order for \\"Blade Runner 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition (4-Disc Blu-ray / DVD +UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack) (2012)\\" [the US $49.99 version].  But the art book was missing; has anyone else experienced this issue?  The online Product Description ends by saying:<br /><br />\\"Additionally, the gift set features an all new  concept spinner car for your collection, action Lenticular and a 72 page art production book with never-before-seen Ridley sketches, poster art and photos from the set\\"<br /><br />UPDATE - OCTOBER 27, 2012<br /><br />Amazon has sent me a replacement and the book as inside.  It's a small book, no bigger than the Blu-ray case, but a book just the same.  Amazon Customer Service \\"took care of it\\" - thanks!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love love love pinterest so when I found the app for my fire I was more than stoked.....for a little while. it takes a while to load...or 90% of the time it wont load at all. and twice it has compleatly frozen my fire. not worth the hassal. still love this app though I have it on my phone and it worked great!
B0045NDVFE|5.0|Every song on this album is good. I don't like much country and this isn't true country but it's closer to that than anything else. Anyway she has an amazing voice and it's just a pleasure to listen to. I hope their next outing is as good because I will certainly get it. It's also refreshing to hear their Christianity come through in music that is more secular in some of the lyrics in some of the songs.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|HoG&B is better than Audio Secrecy (which had some great songs; but was overall too pop-oriented... at least for me) _ Vocally, it's kinda like \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" (minus the growl-heavy Slipknot tracks of course); or for a Band-to-Band comparison: more akin to the debut/Self-Title, as the tracks are more heavy overall, albeit considerably more intricate & finely tuned/crafted (musically and vocally). _ I've been diggin' this album for almost a week now (got it early) and I'm still not tired of it. _<br /><br />My two 'complaints' (if the 1st can be called that) is that the album is being broken into 2... leaving only 11 tracks for this, Part 1 (or 12, if you get the Japanese edition)... and we're all used to getting 15-18 tracks, per album (via Deluxe Editions, etc.)... Granted, a rather selfish 'complaint' -- I guess they've spoiled us a bit in that area; but nevertheless, Awesome as it is, I'm left wanting more.  (LOL, luckily we won't have to wait long for Pt.2) __<br />My 2nd complaint is one I'm very sick of seeing: \\"Japanese Bonus Tracks\\" which are exclusive to the Japan CD. UGH! -- Why are the U.S. Fans, of U.S. Bands, CONSTANTLY SCREWED by these Record Companies!? (And they wonder why piracy is rampant!?) Why is the Japanese Market soooo much more important to them!? What makes them think Japanese 'rockers' will buy the album ONLY if there's an \\"exclusive bonus track\\"??... And why on earth can't WE get the damn thing, without having to shell out $30 to $50!? ___ I'd also LOVE to know why the Bands allow this nonsense to happen as well, as the blame for that isn't solely on the Label. I've heard only a preview/section of the \\"Gallows Humor\\" bonus track -- Sounds Good -- But I'm not spending $30 to $50 just to get one damn song! ___ Like \\"Disturbed\\", most Stone Sour bonus tracks (b-sides/outtakes) are better than other band's album-tracks; and so I'm left to wonder if there's still 15-18 songs written/recorded for each \\"Part\\" and a \\"super deluxe edition\\" willbe released after Part 2; or if all we get this time is each Part's 11 or 12 (22-24 total); and how many will be songs split in two, as is the case with \\"The Travelers\\" (making it only 10 songs, really). __<br /><br />Anyway!, LOL... The songs are awesome -- Far better & harder IMO than Audio Secrecy (which was overburdened with lost-love songs, which are best in moderation)... Definitely *buy* this album! -- And if you can afford it, I would buy the Japan Edition, as it's the only place I've found \\"Gallows Humor\\" (and I've searched the usual \\"Exclusive Bonus (&/or Pre-Order) Track\\" suspects, like Best Buy, iTunes, etc... Seems again, every Non-Japanese fan gets screwed... and no one seems to care but me(?).
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was great. I had to force myself to stop reading sometimes. I finished it in 3 days. I'm glad I decided to purchase the trilogy on Amazon.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|When I watched this movie I thought it had great potential. The whole idea is great. The execution is terrible. It's very slow moving. There's no action and it's not scary either. One thing that bugged me is how long it took for the characters to do one simple task. I understand that people move slow in zero gravity. But the plot of this movie isn't subject to gravity. So why the heck did it move so slow too. When they finally encountered the aliens I got excited. But was soon let down. Please don't waste hard earned money or valuable time on this movie.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Take the famous kick-ass men from action movies, mix it with nice humor, make it better than the first movie and you'll get Expendables 2.  As much as I enjoyed it, I did not love it, but I am looking forward for the third installment! It will be a real shame if they end movies right here. Hope in third movie they will also have as much humor as in this part! Overall it is a very good, kick-ass action movie!
B000EOTAM6|5.0|Aeon is part of a resistance group trying to make the corruption of the ruling class public knowledge. Humanity lives in a fortress, kept safe from the world that has been overtaken by darkness. Aeon believes they are being kept there unnecessarily and for the benefit of chairman Goodchild.<br /><br />This movie has lots of cool characters and great special effects. There's not another movie quite like it. The action keeps you on the edge of your seat. I can't see anyone not liking this film.
B008476HBM|5.0|My fav movie of all time (the one with Colin Firth, of course); now I'm reading the book on my Kindle.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|A young English dockworker named Jude goes to America to find his estranged father. There he meets and falls in love with a rich girl named Lucy. They join the anti war movement and meet many people and see many interesting places.<br /><br />This is a fantastic musical. All the Beatles songs we love are redone wonderfully. Not only is the music in this great; the actors and backgrounds are fantastic too. This is one of the best musicals I've ever seen. I hope you enjoy it too.
B008NABUU8|5.0|This game is fun and also fascinating I think you should get it.BY THE WAY SHAME ON YOU WHO DOSENT LIKE IT!FYI DONT COMPLENT ME WHO DOSENT LIKE IT!
B001LRJH0U|4.0|This is a pretty good remake. I like the actors except for Renee Zellweger. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are great though. This movie has a great atmosphere and some pretty cool action scenes. It's not Tombstone or The Unforgiven, but it's still worth a watch.
0525953728|5.0|Was a military wife so this was very interesting to me. Could not put it down. Received it on friday had it finished on monday.
0525478817|5.0|I'm not going to write a book report.  I just don't have the time.  I will say however I really did enjoy the hell out of this book.  The characters, Hazel and Augustus, embody the greatest parts young life.  I found myself rooting for them even when their situation was hopeless.  Kinda like being a Miami Dolphins fan.  This book was real and raw... and sad but hopeful.  Read it.  It's $15 and a day out of your life well spent.
B005P06AAO|5.0|I like this movie alot. When I saw it on MTV I just had to get it so that I could understand the whole movie. Ever since I love it, I have to atleast watch a little bit of the movie every couple of days
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can't wait for the 3rd book to come out.  Sylvia Day rocks and I can't wait to see where she takes Giddeon and Eva next!
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I never thought id hear myself say that but honestly i have had enough...  other than that The storyline was amazing and very interesting...especially because you got a deeper Look at all The characters especially Christian
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Great movie, I would rent it again. It was just like watching it in theaters all over again. :) <3
B007THA4FI|2.0|I thought the book was dark.  I read more than half of it and decided that I was done with it.  I just could not get into it.  It was centered around the death of one man from a brain aneurism and the people that surrounded him.  Boring for me. I was looking for more from J.K. Rowling, author of Harry Potter.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|This film is so bad, so bad, it made me dumb. Really.<br /><br />I was tested by a group of highly trained scientists (full disclosure, these scientists were not looking for \\"unobtanium\\") before watching this thing and then tested afterwards.<br /><br />My IQ dropped 47 points.<br /><br />I was rendered dumb by James Cameron.<br /><br />My driver's license has since been revoked. The library took my card back. I'm not allowed to lift more than 10 pounds without another adult nearby. I am allowed to neither send nor receive postal deliveries. I have lost the right to vote. I am no longer allowed to cross the street by myself (little old ladies help *me* now). I cannot be seen at any community event without a paid staffer or another adult. I also have a full time live in nurse to help me with my daily activities. I'm not allowed to type more than 140 characters at a time, so I have been banned from the internet except for twitter (I'm sneaking this review in between my nurse's shift change).<br /><br />This is what my life is now because of this thing called \\"Avatar\\" and the legion of fans that haven't stopped talking about it to this day. This is what Hollywood, James Cameron and the American Idol generation have done to me.<br /><br />Spoon-fed exposition, lack of originality, blatant and flagrant plagiarism and utter asininity are now the trademarks of Hollywoodland.<br /><br />The worst part of all this is that...I'm sorry...I have to go, the nurse caught me typing.
B003SHYVO8|5.0|What could be a better dance movie series than the step up franchise.  I don't know it and i don't know if i want to!
B007THA4FI|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect,  but I was not surprised by the plotting and writing style, for Rowling has proved her talent. This is NOT for kids or even teens, as the language and events were raunchy at times. But the story is a modern day morality tale about how we see the community around us, and how one person can make a huge difference in the lives of those who otherwise would fail, and how their loss can send a community into a tailspin,  ending in great loss, and in this case, great tragedy. We have to ask ourselves \\"Are we the solution to the problem, or are we the problem?\\"<br />I 'm glad I stuck with this story that at first offended me, but in the end opened my eyes. I wonder how many of the types depicted will recognize themselves? Probably not many...and that's the problem<br />Thanks, Jo.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This movie is a Classaic. If you love sports it does not get nay better then this. Baseball is for all the ages.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|At browsing my Tuesday music releases, I think I found a gem! This album is amazing from start to finish and one of the few where I really enjoy every song...I need to move to the UK because it seems that's where are the great bands are :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app ever.I really reccomend this app help with math and prices.Get it and you will absolutely love it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|...written in a way for teens/young adults to comprehend.  I really enjoyed this series, and think it is unfortunate it has been compared with other young adult series that have become movies (i.e. Twilight).  Don't get me wrong, I love the Twilight series, too, but this series is really nothing like it.  It has a very strong message, and while extreme, it might help young adults start to understand how power can be ugly.  To fully understand the movie, I definitely recommend reading the books first, as the movie omits a lot of important details.  A definite good read - highly recommended.
B003B5M0PO|3.0|It is a simple, emotional account from the horses point of view. Suitable for young adults.<br />Slightly reminiscent of Black Beauty.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|After watching a marathon of season 2, I wanted to see the shows first season. I went looking on amazon to buy a DVD set and was surprised to find it offered as a video download! The price was unbelievably low and I loved the idea if not having a DVD collection that I would probably only watch once. I purchased it and downloaded all 13 episodes onto my Kindle Fire. It is fantastic and so inexpensive!!!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|The Shawshank Redemption tops many \\"favorite movie\\" lists, and for good reason.  It's impossible not to become deeply involved and moved by the friendship that develops among the inmates, particularly Andy and Red.  The movie is entertaining, touching, and always a treat to watch.  The product came quickly and well packaged, for an excellent price.  It's a great addition to any DVD library.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Is there really anything bad that has to do with SOA? This CD was great! Has great windows rolled down and volume turned up songs!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I heard so many positive comments on this series. Those comments were not overstated. This is an excellent series. I can't wait to get started on season 2. I'm always intrigued by complex characterization. Carrie and Brody have put me to the test. What an exciting exercise in figuring out where they are headed and why.
B0089BSM70|5.0|All I have to say is AMAZING this blu ray is nice to the special features the art work and the picture is just epic I love what screm factory did with the collectors edition blurays.
0307277887|5.0|We love the shows! Every Sunday is a treat between Dexter and The Waking Dead! The Dexter books are awesome! Alot diffrent than the show after the first book. I highly recommend reading them if you're a fan of the show. Amizon is a great site to purchase them from. The used ones are the best! I usually get me and my other half 3 to 4 books for around 12$.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Perhaps Reacher is growing mellow or just maturing a bit as he bides his time. But rather than react in his usual explosive style, he takes the time to evaluate his \\"situation\\" and exhibits unqualified self-restraint. Though on the surface, the driving episodes may appear ponderous and tedious, they capture perfectly the monotony and boredom of driving across the flat lands of the great plains and properly lull you into a sense of asking 'when will this end?'. It is then that Child pulls us into the winding twisted roads of his imagination and characters and awakens the Jack Reacher we have come to expect.<br />The reader will need the same patience Reacher has to appreciate this slow ticking time bomb.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My kids love this.  It is similar to Where's my water? Once we won Where's my water? we were ready to do it again with the new challenges Where's my Perry? gives.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|The main character in this book lived a life filled with so many interesting adventures that it is only appropriate that he has one more big adventure on the occasion of his 100th birthday.  The character is selfish and self serving, but somehow likable.  A read that keeps one anxious to see what happens next.
B00846REIS|1.0|I was expecting at least some differences from the Fifty Shades Series.  Really didn't get many. I'm surprised this was published, as it is clearly written soley for the purpose of capitalizing on the success of Fifty Shades.  It's basically the same story line, same kinky sex.  There are more disturbing backgrounds on the two main characters, but that only bothered me more due to the subject matter involved.  Couldn't even finish it because I got bored.  Very annoying.  This author should really come up with her own ideas instead of ripping off someone elses. That being said, I suppose if all you're after is the kinky sex, this book is probably for you. I have no interest in reading the second one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked the first book , but, loved this one.<br />Im hoping for just one more.  Im in love with Gideon!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|I finished this book oh a train ride moving from New Orleans after staying there a year.  I think living in the city made the book come alive for me.  I didn't like the style of writing and I had a hard time picturing the characters, but it was such an enjoyable and important read.  I don't know how to explain the importance of it other than to say it's on a personal level.  I plan on rereading it another 1 or 2 times so I can find a better way of expressing myself about this book.
B009UQCGTS|5.0|most producers with this show would have taken the standard route and turned this into a melodrama over which of the two lawyers gets our main character. in this much smarter show, that has been taken off the table to pursue more and more interesting stories, in this episode we continue to see how a law firm struggles under a bankruptcy overhaul with nathan lane as trustee . this has truly comic moments such as when lawyers are forced to share offices. we also see all characters struggle with peter's mother Jackie without realizing that there is something seriously wrong with her. she is having hallucinations, seeing bugs where are none.  also her thought processes are getting jammed. she has always been so out of step with the present day world that they think it is just this same old problem with her.  then there is this week's court case which involves super inventive moves by opposing counsel which alicia and diane struggle to parry in court.  very, very smart law show and it shows that ridley scott, the famous and esteemed film director, is at the helm as producer.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved them all, but this on is my favorite!  Anna is perfect for Christain. Not everyone is hopelessly screed up.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I love this game and all of the Angry Birds versions. They challenge my Senior brain and give me something to yell at besides my husband ;-).
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game kept me glued to my Kindle Fire for, literally, hours! Can't wait to get the next intallment, Enigmatis ll.  I hope it's just as good!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Awesome books   you should definitely read the lost hero and the son of neptune as well. please read this book!!!!!!!
B009329ZF2|5.0|My family absolutely loves this movie!  Our favorite part has to do with the chicken burrito (although there are a lot of other good parts, too).  Those who have watched this movie will know what I mean.  Since we got it, we have watched it at least 5 times.  We love to watch it and then back it up to see certain parts.  Of course, then we forget to push stop and end up watching it to the end (again!), but we don't really mind.  I think one of the best parts about this film is the lack of cuss words in it.  They get close one or two times but they never finish it.  Basically, a \\"feel good,\\" action movie with a nice-paced plot and a good ending.  Great for kids!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|well its the greatest mistake ever the most pwnage app ever!!(not realy best app lol but best battery app tp tell the truth)
B000W93CHC|4.0|Ken Follett's novels about medieval Kingsbridge are a wonderfully rich tapestry of life in the era. They explore the hardships and struggles of the average person dealing with whims and misuse of power by those more privileged.  It's a fascinating and painless way to learn about customs and way of life in not always so Merry Old England.  However, I do find Follett's way of everything being a non-relenting series of obstacles for his characters a little off-putting. A similar issue with Pillars of the Earth. I would like occasionally for SOMETHING to work out for people without having to go through hoops to achieve it.  Even the most minor event always seems to turn into a soul crushing problem.  Things always work out satisfactorily in the end, but it's a long, desperate struggle. 1100 pages worth. Still, Follett is a very talented author, and I always look forward to his next book. Just give your characters a break now and then so I don't end up gnashing my teeth and groaning \\"not again!\\" when yet another character gets hope continually smashed.
1455502758|3.0|Bit of a pricy memoir on dying when it can be read in less than 2 hour by a non speed reader.  Bought since recommended by three review sources, better to wait for a used or reduced sales copy, no rush.
B0063GORYU|5.0|at first it looked to complicated. to play but the more I do the easier it is to play I very much enjoyed it thank you .
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series was highly recommended to me by my cousin. I bought Seasons 1 and 2 and watched them in just a few days. Both were outstanding. Acting was superb, costumes were on point, and story line was riveting. I highly recommend this to everyone and am looking forward to the next season.
B00913P6G0|5.0|First let me say that i LOVED Section 80.  Since that album i went back listened to all Kendrick's old stuff.  Since then I got into Ab-Soul and just been waiting for Kendrick to drop this album.<br /><br />Now since then J. Cole dropped. Drake second album dropped, Lupe dropped 2 albums (both average to me), I got into Danny Brown and Gangrene and others.  I liked all those albums, well I sorta liked Drake's album, but it wasn't as good as his first one. But anyway, I found music that I liked and it held me over but there was always something missing.  Nothing really stood out to me and got me hyped every time i put it on.  But when I went back to Section 80, it was always fresh to me.<br /><br />Then Women Weed & Weather dropped. I was instantly hyped.  Then Swimming pools and, though i loved the song, I wasn't sure what direction Kendrick's album would go.<br /><br />Now that the album is here, my copy is in the mail and i just couldn't wait to hear it so i checked for it on Spotify.  3 listens later and I'm still unable to put into words how much i love this album.<br /><br />Good Kid: MAAD City is an album in the truest since of the word.  It follows a theme and each song fits perfectly.  The production... oh man.. the production on this is just so perfect that I gives me goose bumps.  Then Kendrick's flow is so damn flawless.  And the material he provides and all that he is talking about is so deep but not over the head or too abstract.  This is what I think modern  hip hop should sound like.  This is original but thorough.  It has focus but doesn't sacrifice quality for the sake of following a theme.<br /><br />I ordered the deluxe edition that has 4 extra songs that i think are well worth the extra few bucks.  This is the material i would hope to get from Kendrick.  But Dr. Dre executively producing this I think was the last element needed to give it that classic quality.<br /><br />I could go and give a breakdown of each song but i would suggest you give it a listen for yourself.  One thing I will say is the song \\"MAAD CITY\\" with MC. Eiht has that old school meets new school Compton sound that I haven't heard in a LOOOOOOONNG time.<br /><br />This album is definitely going down as a classic for me.  From the skits, to the beats, to the lyrics to the theme.  Everything is perfect here.  Bravo Kendrick. I can't wait to see you tear it up in a concert bro. You made it.a listen for yourself.  One thing I will say is the song \\"MAAD CITY\\" with MC. Eiht has that old school meets new school Compton sound that I haven't heard in a LOOOOOOONNG time.<br /><br />This album is definitely going down as a classic for me.

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, a prominent neurosurgeon at Harvard University, has written a fascinating book about his near-death experience.  At the age of 54, he contracted a severe form of E. Coli meningitis, which aggressively attacked his cortex, or the portion of the brain that supplies conscious, rational thought.  He slipped into a coma, but instead of experiencing nothing, like in deep sleep, Dr. Alexander describes a journey to heaven.<br /><br />His experience began in a place of fluffy clouds.  Then he visualized beings soaring through the sky, beings that he describes as `higher forms.'  These beings made a joyful sound: one that he could feel, even more than hear.  He was then joined by millions of butterflies and a woman.  This woman gave him the following three messages: You are loved and cherished; You have nothing to fear; and There is nothing you can do wrong.  Her words are comforting and reassuring.<br /><br />What sets this book apart is the fact that Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon with great knowledge of what makes up consciousness.  The parts of his brain that would create experiences like he underwent (such as in a dream state) were not functional at the time he experienced them.  He is also a man of science and a skeptic, who changed his views completely after experiencing this.  This transformation is interesting and notable.  His descriptions of heaven are vivid, uplifting, and fascinating.<br /><br />If you enjoy this book, there are two books from physicians which I would highly recommend.  [[ASIN:1451649762 In Stitches]] by Dr. Anthony Youn is a lighter but highly entertaining coming-of-age story about one young man's struggles with parents, romance, medicine, God, and finding your place in the world.  It's especially recommended for people who struggle with who they are and why they're here. Dr. Youn's book is fun, uplifting, and an absolute joy to read.<br /><br />Dr. Francis Collins' [[ASIN:1416542744 The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief]] is an easy-to-read book about integrating Christian beliefs with modern science.  Collins, the head of the Human Genome Project, describes how belief in God and the Bible doesn't have to be in conflict with science and its findings.  As a physician, I've struggled with these conflicts ever since my college biology courses.  His book helped me immensely.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had to make a rule that I can't look at Pinterest before work because time flies when I'm looking through all the pins!! Love everything on here! There is something for everyone: for laughs, the home, recipes, crafts,  weddings, fashion, gifts and everything in between. Great entertainment and lots of awesome ideas!!!
B00961ZGQC|5.0|Good song played well, nice beat and good for dancing. Good song to work out to.<br />Makes me want to dance around the house when i hear this song.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|While I knew that this would not be an epic film, I was hoping to see a little romance between Snow White and the huntsman.  Why cast two charismatic actors in those roles if we can't even get one passionate kiss out of them or some verbal exchange of their feelings for each other.<br /><br />This one is not even worth the rental price unless you are a big Charlize Theron fan and even then.
1455519006|4.0|This is the first book I've read of Baldacci.  I was very pleased with his writing style and how he brought the characters to life. It was one of those that you just couldn't put down. Now I'm going back to Amazon to purchase more of his books.
B00498TQV8|2.0|This movie was critically acclaimed when it was released - and I agree with the critics somewhere between 90 and 95% of the time.  Unfortunately, my opinion is on the \\"5-10%\\" side of the fence for this mumble festival.  I honestly haven't seen a critically-cheered movie this tepid since the late 90's when \\"Michael\\" came out (remember John Travolta as a modern \\"devil may care\\" angel who comes to earth to help out a group of traveling nobodies?  Oh...the horror...the horror...).<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the cinematography is very good.  As a person who grew up in upstate NY (yes, rednecks DO live all 50 states), I found the beautiful scenes of the outdoors, contrasted by the dark, trailer-trash lifestyle of the characters to be quite realistic.  This gives the movie a 2nd-star for me.<br /><br />However, that's where the good stuff ends.<br /><br />BIG PROBLEM #1:  The movie is slow.<br />Very slow.  Slow as molasses in January.  Slower than that elderly couple in the passing lane - doing 48 with the turn blinker left on for the past 22 miles.  Yes, a good tale takes time to spin - as a fan of Martin Scorsese's epics, I understand this and appreciate a well plotted story-line.  But this?  This is like watching for shooting stars on an overcast night: you're staring at the same background with little noticeable change.<br /><br />BIG PROBLEM #2:  The mumbling.<br />I get it - the main character is meek, but strong.  In order to get the meek part across, the director has her speaking so low that she is practically unintelligible.  The same goes for the vast majority of conversations throughout the movie - making it difficult to understand what the heck is going on.  If the director wants to be \\"authentic\\" with barely understandable dialogue, why not make it a silent film with subtitles?<br /><br />Conclusion - the movie is plodding, the character interplay is incoherent, and so my overall rating is 2 bones out of 5.  Only a true sadist would want to sit through this boredom jubilee.ugh this boredom jubilee.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Now you know that any movie with Judy Dench is going to be good. No disappointment on that count because she was terrific. The other actors were equally as good. It is a fun movie about retirees..and makes one wish that one could have had the courage and fun to move to an exotic country like India.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is nowhere near your typical Stephen king book but I loved it just the same . I generally don't read any science fiction, so I was unsure whether i would like this book, it was awesome! Maybe the best book that I have read this year. Great job by legendary author.
0062127241|5.0|A lifelong Townshend fan, I simply loved Pete's surprising and earnest titanic feat of showing us what I suspect is just a glimpse of himself - after all he wrote \\"Don't pretend that you know me, 'cause I don't even know myself\\" once. In a quite endearing statement, he refers to himself as \\"a mouse, offstage\\", prone to panic attacks, overcomplicating everything in his private and public life. No wonder he suffered various bouts of substance abuse, exhaustion, and depression! All the while, he comes across as forever chasing The Simple Note, (Pure and Easy) in us all - his perennial and well-documented obsession with the Lifehouse project, which will never end up as he intended it to be.<br />His wit is scorching, yet he is not as self-effacing as I would have thought or at times came across through his lyrics. His feelings towards the characters in his life are as complex as can be; he delves in personal and professional relationships with passion, naivet&eacute; and abandon, yet can be unforgiving and harsh to some.<br />I am left with the impression an amazingly creative, vibrant, multi-tasking mind - his genius is somehow managing to filter everything and churning the universal, explosive, at the same time raw and gentle flow of multimedia art that enthralled us for decades.
0545265355|5.0|just buy it its cheaper then other book stores and this is a need to have series for any book reader of any age get it now!!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Okay, I do not always do well with the bestselling books, but friend insisted that I should read this one, because she loved it so much and I caved in.<br /><br />I do admit that it took me a *very* long time to finish chapter one, I did not enjoy the story, the writing felt superb but boring, but I figured let me try again and again. So after few times I finished it and oh my goodness I loved what followed.<br /><br />I do not get the criticism that the stories are connected by superficial connections like \\"birthmarks\\" only. Of course I cannot get into the writer's mind and know for sure whether he meant these stories to be one collection when he wrote them, BUT what I do see is plenty of unifying themes to tie this work together as one - exploration of different kinds of slavery of body and soul, corporative power, playing with the tropes of genre fiction in the literary manner. I thought the work does read as one story even if what we have is several stories.<br /><br />Really loved how the writing changes from one story to another, truly the work of the master IMO.<br /><br />That connects me to the only niggle I have - I really struggled with the writing in the centerpiece story. I am an ESL reader and phonetically described accent just gets to be hard to read for me.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I haven't had a lot of time to play with this one, but what I have done was awesome!  It has some neat effects and borders.
0399132635|5.0|One of the best fiction books ever written, certainly Dean Koontz's best.  If I had the connections I'd have Kevin Costner, Matt Damon, or Clint Eastwood direct to make a movie with this book's story line; that good . . . . .  Has the Borne Indenity capability but in the furry direction - if you know what I mean regarding these two dogs.  Excellent story line.

B006YXTRHY|1.0|I am a big fan of the Twilight series and tore through them while on summer vacation a few years ago.  I looked forward to Breaking Dawn but found the hype to be much more than the film itself.  I think it was a big mistake to turn the final installation in the series into two separate films (obviously just to increase revenue).  I found the ending of Part I to be an odd and disappointing place to cut away.  The author knew what she was doing when she wrote the books and it was a travesty what the filmakers did to destroy it in this way.  I was left very disappointed by this film.  I should have waited for the second part to come out and then watched them both consecutively and perhaps then I wold have been more satisfied.  Don't waste your time.
B0030B624E|4.0|This is such great movie that I can watch over and over again. Took it on a flight to the west coast after downloading it to my kindle fire and so glad I did.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|I really enjoyed this game for several levels. I have never played a game like this before and it was really great UNTIL I got stuck and cannot find any help to get through it. I have scoured the internet and cannot find any hints to get past Carthage Round 7. I am just going to give up and delete the game.<br />If you like to actually finish a game, this one isn't for you.
0316228532|1.0|After reading only a few pages, I decided this book was not worth my time, because (disappointingly) the author somehow found it impossible to form sentences that did not contain vulgarities and expletives.  She's such a talented writer that I had though she could form thoughts without crudities.  She must have a low opinion of the sensibilities of her readers to fall into such a trap.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's  fun game and I really enjoy it. it reminds me of the old carnival game that they use to have.
B001I9WK14|5.0|This is a great film for any U2 fan.  It is like having a front row seat to the Joushua Tree tour, and getting to hang out with the band as they travel. The passion and excitement that Bono puts into his singing is infectious. I especially love getting a closer look at The Edge, Larry Mullens Jr and Adam Clayton.  If you love U2, you should buy this movie.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Easy to use to find files or documents. The UI is very clean and easy to navigate. Highly recommend for all users.
B008NABUU8|4.0|With basicly no building knowledge, you can have fun creating bridges. The app is a little twitchy. and has long load times,but works well so far on my Fire. Makes you at least think a lot. I do like the Color changes when you try the bridge. It shows you the weak stress points and can help in completing the task
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I can assure all Dylan fans that this album is one of the best.  If anthems are the type of Dylan songs you like,  this has some of the best ever.  Tempest is unbelievable.

1476715904|5.0|Slammed is by far one of the best books I've ever read. I don't do the whole review thing and this book warrants a review. I think Colleen Hoover is a genius and this book is so unique and beautifully written it captivates you from the very beginning. I keep making people I know read if, I just bought my mom the book too. I loved it so much I want to share it with as many people possible.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I couldn't put it down although it's a lot about SM. I finished the grey, wasn't satisfied with the ending. and I can't wait to read the darker.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this as the free app of the day on Kindle. Really fun and addictive. Typical jewel style game but great graphics and a cool storyline. Would be fun without it but it's a nice addition. I've completed it but playing again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story. Wasn't especially pleased with how it ended. Left it too open. Hopefully there's more to come. I'll be on the lookout.
B007C94QRK|5.0|For those of us who grew up in the 70's and early 80's, the Muppets were a mainstay. It was sad to see the franchise decline. So when I heard that there was an effort to revive the Muppets, I was looking forward to seeing the results. I was not disappointed. The movie was well-written, well acted, and entertained my wife and I (mid-40's), our 13-year old, and our 8 y.o.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Wonderful use of time - the change from year to year is extremely well done.  Not finished - but have recommended to several friends. I read it on my Kindle at the gym - makes the hour on the eliptical go by in seconds!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus as originally intended was supposed to be a prequel to Alien, but \\"took on a life of its own\\" according to its \\"makers.\\" In saying that, it loses its way almost immediately. Prometheus is a confusing, uneven film with a plot that might make sense, but is beset by characters that make even less sense. An example, the Captain and lead scientist Elizabeth have encountered unbelievable hardships, terror and death, but in the very next scene they're chatting as if nothing has happened. The actions of the android are even more puzzling. Why does he `spike' someone's drink, knowing full well the possible repercussions?  Is it just because of his affinity for his favorite film's main character? Obviously the Three Laws of Robotics don't exist in this Universe. The film eventually devolves into silliness with medical systems that have no knowledge of female anatomy, to self surgery and then into guessing games as to why the aliens seeded our planet and why they're not so happy about it now. Yet, those questions might easily be put to rest if rather than referring to the name of the vessel Prometheus actually refers to the god who brought fire to earth. If so, then the storyline might make a little more sense, but the characters are still damaged.

1451695195|1.0|\\"I saw a bright light. All was love, harmony and happiness.\\" are common themes with those who talk about out of body experiences. A few near death experiences may be of Jesus, but there is a trick being played by the Devil on many.<br /><br />The Devil's favorite Halloween trick is to dress up like the good God. The Devil dresses up like love, light and kindness.<br /><br />And no wonder, for Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light, the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 11:14.<br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander in his book, Proof of Heaven, writes of his experience while being brain dead, \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly and forever. You have nothing to fear. And there is nothing you can do wrong.\\"<br /><br />Really? Do nothing wrong? Nothing? Nothing to fear? Nothing?<br /><br />Jesus came and preached that all are doomed to hell unless they repent. Near death experiences that do not reflect this Jesus declared, No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish as well!  (Luke 13:3)<br /><br />Few, Jesus said, find the narrow gate and fewer still want to walk the difficult road to life but understand clearly that the ever popular experiences, bright lights and all is fine, may not be of Jesus. In fact, such are not of Jesus unless they reflect a narrow gate and a difficult road.<br /><br />How narrow is the gate and difficult the road that leads to life, and few find it.  (Matthew 7:14)<br /><br />I am afraid the good doctor has been taken in by one of the oldest tricks of Satan.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think this is the best book of the trilogy!! It's so exciting I can't wait to finish this installment.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldnt wait to have this 2nd part book so I could read about Gideon's past and just the way they need each other.... i was hopping that they would have more than what they had and that she would stop being so insecure.  It is a must read for sure, I dont want to give away too much details about the book, just that it held my interest and I couldn't put it down!!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|I told all my friends about it and rented the movie right afterward. Hated to put the book down to go to work and read it voraciously at lunch (no pun intended)! Movie doesn't do the book justice...my husband and co-worker saw movie without reading book and both said that they would have been lost without my narration. Book is awesome...so read it first, then watch movie as a follow-up. If you like this book, you will like Defending Jacob.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|It finally arrived!!! I was waiting for this since I saw it on the theaters on 3D!!! It makes the theatrical version look like in black and white. It's a must have.

B008S0IJAM|5.0|Aimee has charmed us in the past, but \\"Charmed\\" is above and beyond her previous accomplishments. Deep lyrics and great vocals.  Her most revealing and down-to-earth release that pulls no punches.  What a relief to have a female vocalist who does not have to sing about \\"love\\" , but instead, dives into the uniqueness, absurdity, and bewilderment of the human psyche and the \\"other\\" side of relationships and day-to-day life.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed this film. I thought the crew performed admirably, in particlular Michael Fassbender. For me, this film pitted Faith against solo reason , the Turin machine against man, the Search for Truth against nihilism, 'nothing, nothing....., annihilation, Death', and perhaps the mad scientists creating their Frankensteins, the bioweapons, who they in turn destroy. There seemed to be many subplots, themes. Who or what is the Prometheus, Zeus overcoming his father Cronus, the Kings who do not wish to relinquish their power, the created who loose their need for their creators, and the creators fearing the growing power of the created so that when they awaken and achieve their freedom it is time to cripple them. The Cycles of Life turn. The only apparent connection between this film and Alien is the bioweapon and the race of beings that created them, and perhaps the same purpose for those bioweapons, the destruction or enslavement of the human race on earth. I absolutely enjoyed the specail effects (I saw the film in 3D which dramatically boosted the experience), and found our Titan progenitors interesting. I believe this thread demands at least one sequel: the search for Truth, something that Transcends the Cycles of Life and Death, the Desire to Know, continues.....

B009FOBMBI|4.0|Transit of Venus is different than past releases by Three Days Grace as it incorporates much of an electronic sound and lighter sounding songs. Overall, it was implemented well and is much better than their previous release, Life Starts Now, but not as good as One-X or their debut.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|The action hero genre has long resisted a strong female lead. Although Angelina Jolie is the current reigning queen, her sexiness is as much a driving force as her martial prowess. Steven Soderbergh clearly thought he could do better with Gina Carano, a real life mixed martial arts champion. Is she up to the challenge?<br /><br />Yes and no. One the one hand, Soderbergh has created a character that's not very hard for her to play. Mallory Kane (Carano) is a Jason Bourne-style cipher, with a ruthless reputation. When she is tapped for a mission as a government contractor, there are layers upon layers of intrigue that swirl around her, with Kane as the most valuable piece in the game. That doesn't really ever reflect on Carano's face though, which seems to be frozen in a bemused smirk.<br /><br />The story is told in media res as she meets a man in a diner who isn't who she hoped. Soderbergh carefully stages each one of her fight scenes, and it's fascinating to see Carano in action. She literally crawls up her opponents, using a woman's physical advantages - powerful legs - to counterbalance opponents who are out of her weight class. After fleeing the scene with the assistance of an innocent bystander, she tells him -- and the audience - her tale.<br /><br />And it's a doozy. A Chinese dissident/professor/journalist has been kidnapped and it's up to Carano's team to get him back. Or is it? Is she working for the good guys or the bad guys? This being a Soderbergh film, it's likely there are no good guys here.<br /><br />Soderbergh has fun with his, casting Carano in a variety of scenes where she brutally beats men to death. See Kane kill a man in a diner...in a cocktail dress...and on a beautiful beach as the sun sets!<br /><br />Carano plays Kane as uncomfortable in social settings. \\"I don't do the dress thing\\" she quips. But she has to, because that's a staple of the modern spy genre and Carano is beautiful enough to pull it off. The scene of course ends with more bare-knuckled brawling in an evening dress, which unfortunately still feeds into the observer effect common to these kinds of films.<br /><br />Still, Carano lends a toughness and believability to a character archetype that has long been fetishized. You can see it in her combat style, in her eyes, and most importantly in her hands. Her paws are big and meaty, not the dainty fingers of an actress who lives a life of luxury off set. Kane looks like she can punch you in the face, and that's exactly how it should be.<br /><br />\\"Haywire\\" tries to be deeper than it is while shoring up its lead's lack of acting talent with a character who's just as bland as she is. That doesn't change the fact that this is still a step forward for the female action hero. Carano may not be all that eloquent, but neither is Schwarzenegger or Stallone.re-knuckled brawling in an evening dress, which unfortunately still feeds into the observer effect common to these kinds of films.<br /><br />Still, Carano lends a toughness and believability to a character archetype that has long been fetishized.

B00902MCVY|2.0|Sorry, but this did not live up to expectations at all. It's been however many years now, and Wintersun's original album was 1000 times better. Instead of just releasing their album, they release half of it, which gives us just 5 songs. Two of them are instrumental intros. I can't remember any intro song on a metal album I've actually cared for other then Az' by Arkona.<br /><br />I do like Sons of Winter and Stars, especially the last 5 minutes. Land of Snow and Sorrow is alright if you're in the mood for a slow song, but I'd rather just listen to Death and the Healing. Not a fan of Time (the final song). I will say that the CD flows very well from song to song if you care about that sort of thing.<br /><br />The original album has so many awesome songs I love: Winter Madness, Battle Against Time, Death and the Healing, Starchild, and Sadness and Hate. Plus a few other good songs. This one has an awesome 5 minutes (which amounts to just over a third of a song). They should have just released Sons of Winter and Stars as a single.<br /><br />2.5/5 stars. Normally I'd round up to 3, but considering all the excuses and delays Jari gave all these years, and all the silly \\"trailers\\" the past few months giving us about three seconds of new music and 30 seconds of music from the original album, I'm gonna round down here. For what it's worth, I've heard he pushed all the \\"good\\" songs to Time II, due out 2013 (or 2019?). So maybe that one will be great and get a 5/5.<br /><br />I'll still see them live in December, but I'm more looking forward to them playing their old music, not so much their new songs. Plus Eluveitie headlining will be awesome.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like the game although its a little. difficult when you get quests for friends and no one accepts your request.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read First Shift and wanted more. Very well written and difficult to put down as it is hard to predict  what the characters will do. You both understand their world and are as surprised by the connections in it as they are. The eduring horror of apocalyptic fiction only a step away from our lives does not have an easy answer. No miracle Eden but a slim chance of life and  an uncertain, unstabe future. Are people too Machiavellian to survive?<br /><br />An author  to  watch for. A series to follow. And having it on Kindle will not stop me from wanting this in longer term format.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|this does NOT charge you kindle fire. it will charge your phone but that's it. I would send it back but it's not worth the money
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have tried other games like this and they end too quickly or are too easy.  I like the fact that this game has different levels so I can keep going.  I got my mom playing too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The Mockingjay was not what I had expected....it contained a little more violence than I anticipated.  I did enjoy learning more about the characters and the introduction of the new characters.  I don't know that I would let my daughter read this one....not yet anyway.
B005FMZVLQ|2.0|Bought this watch along with several other Invicta watches.  They are all good looking and get noticed, however if they malfunction they ARE NOT COVERED unless it is the movement.  I had  a crown come off the watch and it was less than 6 months old and was worn maybe  6 times.<br />I contacted the company who told me to provide proof pof purchase, send $ 28.00 to cover  S&H and they would repair it.  They had it three months and sent me an email to send more money as the crown is not covered just the movement.  What a scam and rip off  . Too bad  I like the product but will never buy again.  $48.00 dollars to repair a $ 99.00 watch
B002RI9HUM|4.0|I thought I would read another not unpleasant chicklit copy. I was surprised to find interesting the introspection into an over cuckoo's nest world, depicting in a mocking like style all the serious problems that overly stressed people are facing today. Definitely not a putdownable.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book!  It has the passion of 50 shades, but a totally different twist. I highly recommend this book to all!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|While I was getting a little frustrated with the story about half way through the book, in the end I loved the story and the book and I can't wait for part 3!!!
B00102FELM|5.0|great dvd by the scorpions with special guests uli jon roth, michael schenker, and herman rarebell. the setlist is superb and the performances are an allout sonic assault, highly recommended for all fans of classic hardrock!
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This movie is a prequel to Alien, one of my all-time favorite sci-fi flicks, which is also one of the best horror movies ever made. This flick was not as good as the original Alien. Noomi Rapace filled the invincible-chick role played by Sigourney Weaver in the original movie. She was good in the part, but much of the movie was predictable for anyone who's seen the original--such as the android that became a talking head after being decapitated.  The plot--aliens put humans on Earth and then decided to destroy them--seemed a little weak.  Since this movie falls short of the original, I'll rate it okay, but could have been better.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I was so disappointed with this. I played several times but just could not like it. A big let down.  Maybe there will be another game that is more interesting.
B000024TFY|5.0|This is classic Priest at it's best. Take a musical journey from the streets of London in Jack the Ripper to your death in Epitaph. Rob is at his vocal best with this album. A must have album for Priest and metal fans. Of all the albums, this is one of my favorite ones. I will probably have to buy another one to keep in my truck.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Good difficult game, keeps you entertained for a long time.  Can't complain when it's free either!!  Ads do not take up much if any time or space.
B002ONV5E6|5.0|I love a good thriller that exercises your mind and entertains as well.  The stunts were amazing, often chair gripping.  Matt Damon, has alway been an entertaining actor. one of the best, and that goes for this movie too.  Please do more of these movies, and don't pass the batton on to another actor.  Very well done and thank you.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|This is another of the few books I keep to read over and over. It is fun and the caracters are likeable. I only wish Sophie Kinsella had made this a series.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|works great. would be late without it. recommend to snooze button pushers. download this app and never be late again.
1401201911|5.0|I dont like SUperman, but I LOVED this book! I Think I've read this story twice. I never read stories twice. awesome trade to own!
B0091REZMW|4.0|I would like easier or more clear ways to get jewels to banish the phenomena and open more rooms. Very entertaining game though.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is so needed.  I use it to unwind and to fall asleep.  Of all the apps that have white noice- this is the best one out there.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is my 2nd Seiko automatic and my 3rd automatic watch overall, but probably my favorite. This is a great casual wear watch with the canvas strap, and I love the matte watch casing with clear back. If you don't like the canvas strap, you can always get a leather strap to class it up a bit, but I prefer the durability of canvas strap for my everyday wear.
B00845PRDS|5.0|THIS WAS A WELL ACTED AND ACCURATE PICTURE OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN FIGHTING MEN AND WOMEN. IT MADE MY BLLOD BOIL TO ACTUALLY SEE THEM IN HARMS WAY AND THE BRAVEREY SHOWN.
B003XX2PPO|1.0|Comenzó su carrera cuando las figuras infantiles se introducian en la escena musical de los 80´s y con un falcete a lo Elvis logró notoriedad. Al principio de los 90´s se decia que salvó a los boleros cuando en realidad los boleros lo salvaron a él. Su version de Amor, Amor, Amor fue duramente criticada por Julio Iglesias con justa razón ya que un contexto pop a la canción no le sentaba para nada bien. Quizas hasta un remix o dance version con algún DJ del momento pero un contexto pop era lo más desatinado posible. Su limitada capacidad de reinvención lo ha metido en varios aprietos, este album parece indicar que debe volver a los boleros o perecer. Este debe ser el fin de la infantomascota musical y el nacimiento de un artista de talla que parece estar en él pero que aun no ha encontrado.
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Should have waited for it to be a dollar rental. To much of a fan of the original series to enjoy this take off.
B005COO1X6|3.0|It's a fine story for a teenager.  I liked it but don't mind me, I love everything Stephen King writes. I found useful the possibility of reading a sample.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|i like this app alot and i use it all the time on my algerbra homework i wish it had a fraction option though and if there is i have missed it but in all i like this app alot
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely amazing and interesting on so many levels. i cant wait to pick up book number two and three !
B009LK6JS2|5.0|I enjoy airplane simulation games, and this one is cool. i thought $1.99 really? but it was worth it. i enjoy it. there are 3 different aircraft. u can land it on a land strip, or a navy ship thing. u can controll it realistically. the crashing graphics suck, but the control of the plane is nice and easy, just go to settings and put SIMULATOR not NORMAL. if u are an aviation fanatic, NOT a person who wants to do dog fights in this game, its simple, landing and flying, it has different options as well.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I've been a fan of Green Day since Dookie. This album kinda goes back to where they started and I'm liking it a lot! Fun music with good lyrics and catchy tunes that make you sing along. Not such a serious album like the last. I'm enjoying listening to this!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book leaves you hanging, wanting more.  Well written.  Katniss reaps the reward of her decision in this book.  I hope there will be more to the story.
0786958731|4.0|I think this is the third game of this type and so far the best I have played.  While difficult, it is not near impossible like the Castles of Ravenloft.
B008B0QH5S|4.0|Good, the more you listen to it.  I miss some of the techno sound that is not present so much in the new one.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|A note for christians. This book is not really about a \\"Christian heaven\\". There is no mention of Jesus or any biblical figures in this book. No mention of salvation, redemption, sin or judgement either.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT **<br /><br />Dr. Alexander refers to God (\\"The Core\\") by the sanskrit/hinduist god-name \\"Om\\". This \\"Om\\" is both pitch black and light at the same time according to his experience (although the Bible says \\"God is light; in him there is no darkness at all\\"). He also talks about vast number of multiple universes with various states of development. As it is explained to him by \\"Om\\", evil is an important and neccesary part of existence, as it generates progress in the universe (but no need to worry, the ultimate goal is love). The main message of his journey is that \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever\\" and \\"There is nothing you can do wrong\\".<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT ENDS **<br /><br />All this obviously contradicts the biblical record which talks about the rebellion of Satan as the source of evil, the fall of man, the need for redemption and reconciliaton with God the Father through the blood of his son, Jesus Christ and the really high stakes we face - the potential of ethernal perdition or salvation.<br /><br />I'm not saying that Dr. Alexander is not honest, or his experience is not a real spiritual experience (who am I to say that), but in my understanding his experience is fundamentally incompatible with the message of the Bible, while at the same time fits nicely into a New Age worldview. Ultimately, the reader has to choose what to believe. The Scriptues have clear instructions to help christians to identify the source of spiritual experiences or revelations like this.
B004XVN1T4|2.0|Liked the book but it was a typical Ken Follett style.  Fast paced but not much depth.  Good read but felt like it could have been more.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I always expect J.K. Rowling to write imaginative stories filled with unique characters set in a fascinating environment. None of these expectations were met in \\"The Casual Vacancy.\\" Forget that this is not a Harry Potter book. John Updike wrote about reality (or the effects of intrusions on reality) for decades. Yet, even in his most suburban novels, the characters were unique, the environment was suffused with a kind of underlying tension, and the stories were emotional adventures. This is never the case with this new book. The most touching character is Krystal, the welfare-class teenager who contends with a stupefied mother, a filthy environment, and a little brother who is infected from negligence. The other characters, (including the off-page Barry Fairweather who [spoiler] dies in the introduction) are mostly noticeable for their being annoying and narcissistic. The entire plot revolves around Fairweather's apparent charisma which is spoken about but never illustrated. We have to take the word of characters who routinely lie and misrepresent for purposes so petty and insignificant that we wonder what in God's name convinced the great Ms. Rowling that this was an interesting tale to tell.<br />Yes, there is a great attention to detail. Often too much. When James Joyce wrote the thoughts of ordinary people, they were thoughts that all of us could relate to. When Ms. Rowling does it, in excruciating detail, it is almost vacuous. I found myself skipping whole screens of \\"inner thought\\" on my kindle. Sometimes, I skimmed over so much material that I felt that I was speed reading. However I have to give Ms. Rowling credit for one thing: she does know her characters. Each character is consistent and completely (perhaps too completely) drawn. So, for that, I give her two stars.<br />Hopefully, she will now get back to the world of fantasy, where, magically, she can speak to us on matters to which we can all relate.
B00008BLB8|1.0|This is too routine and fabricated for the real Grand Funk Railroad.  By this time the band had lost its edge - and how many itmes do we need to hear the drum solo in .T.N.U.C?  Get \\"Live\\" instead - when the music still mattered.  It all died when they recoreded \\"The Locomotion\\" - are you kidding me??  What a joke!
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I should have read the reviews...then I would have known that this video is NOT the real version but a cartoon.  BUYER BEWARE!!!  Amazon, you need to start giving refunds for this bait and switch routine.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|After devouring Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars series more than once I was immediately drawn to the subject. This was nothing like I expected... but was a great find nevertheless. I could not put it down. The wonderful wit combined with a plethora of interesting science and a nicely balanced pace was intoxicating and sort of an educational roller coaster ride. The 'journal' style delivery worked well and added an interesting element of bringing the reader in close and personal. The free wheeling personality of the main character and his descriptions was at times both hilarious and dramatic. I'm sure plenty will frown on the style as being a little cartoon-ish and the language a little raw but for me it overcame any such criticism by being a darned good read. I do hope to read more from this author.
B00846REIS|5.0|I found myself getting bored with the love making scenes in Fifty Shades.... this author did a much better job!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love these two characters have cried twice,ready for book three,I am guessing I will read that in two days also.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved this book, it was very suspensfull.  Even though I did not like the ending I would still highly recommend it.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|I just want to give credit where it is due.  This was a great episode of The Walking Dead and I can't wait for the next one. :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started this before I started my insanity journey and this was perfect. It will make you sweat! I love how she incorporates weights!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Pretty nice processor doing extremely well almost everything you throw at him. Box cooler does the job on stock settings, but CPU truly shines when overclocked.<br />So put a decent cooling and go for new speeds!
1554072840|3.0|This book is fun,  but if you are looking for a book to magically potty train your kid, I am afraid this was not the reality for us or anyone we know.  Patience and persistence is key, reading a book did not seem to help.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I watched the first Twilight and it was so terrible, I couldn't bring myself to watch the next movies. But, you know, I wanted some \\"closure.\\" I couldn't find the sex scene for the life of me on YouTube or anywhere else, which is stupid, because you know that s*** would be one of the top-watched vids on the internet, more than cats or something. And, when I finally bought the d*** thing just to see those two anemic lovers finally get what they've been making constipated faces about for the entire series (remember, I didn't see the next one) THEY DIDN'T SHOW ANYTHING. Figures.<br /><br />But then I fast-forwarded to the end, and seeing her all sick and preggers was kind of funny. So, three stars.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Game is fun. Different then other games of its ilk! I like the collections twist it puts in. Sets it apart from other hidden objects games.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I enjoyed this book a great deal. With humor and wit, the author wove an entertaining and engrossing story. Implausible but fun.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app was working very well on my Kindle Fire HD ever since i loaded it in September, that is up until a few days ago. I cant see any older status updates after about 10 entries or so on my newsfeed and only abiut 6 of those load properly. The rest load only text, no pics or profile thumbnail and it wont allow me to &quot;like&quot; statuses on my newsfeed.So annoying. Please fix this!
B008NABUU8|5.0|I really enjoy these types of games and this one is by far the best i have played. samsung galaxy 10.1.
B008K4JDLA|5.0|I usually follow Chris Anderson through Wired magazine, where he has been introducing the vision and visionnaires that are creating the new paradigms of the internet of things. The book is just amazing. I guess like many readers I tend to read four or five books at the same time until I find one that I just can't put down, this one is Makers. It's clear, compelling and reads like a novel. Anyone interested broadly in how technologies made simple will change the industrial world or looking individually for inspiration and resources to become part of the Makers entrepreneur's movement will find this is the book to read.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Love the sound. Good rock tunes, good guitar riffs, good beats. Very enjoyable album. Love the compression on the vocals. Every song is worth something, no album fillers. I like the Black Keys sound a lot. Its very recognizable but not predictable.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Good app. Does exactly what i need and updates are solid and useful.  Allows me to easily share files with all network connected computers in my home.
B007CKNX28|4.0|A lot different from his white stripes stuff. Very good though. Very eclectic, some harder rock tunes, folky type stuff, lotta piano driven songs which i liked. Good accompanying musicians. Not his best work but still very enjoyable.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I have not read,many Mitch Albom books but I've enjoyed the few I have including this one. This was a good and quick read. Makea you think about how time rules every aspect of our lives. I was not overly impressed with the characters and feel there could have been a little more depth to the plot.
0312117337|5.0|I've used several tarot decks, but this one has to be my favorite! Osho's commentaries are very useful for meditations as well as interpretations.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I bought this book for my Kindle.  I tried to like it but it just didn't hold my interest. I finished it because I can't let a book half read. Let me tell you it took a long time and each time I picked it up I had to review who was who and how they related to each other. Needless to say, I will not be reading any future installments of this series.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is a great movie, saw it at the theater and could not wait to get it on DVD.  This is my go to movie when I had a bad day.
0307200477|2.0|I purchased this book for my 16 month old.  Having read many of the reviews here referencing the malfunction of the plastic comb, I opted to go with the more expensive \\"deluxe\\" version, assuming that it would, indeed, be deluxe and of superior quality.  I was pretty bummed when I opened the book to find that it is still bound with a plastic comb.  I would think a binding similar to a spiral bound notebook would be a better suit yet still provide the same style they are going for.<br /><br />I read the book to the baby, turning the pages gingerly.  He LOVED the story.  My 2 older children got home from school, saw the book, and wanted to read to their little brother.  I warned them to be careful & they were, however, the book just fell apart in my autistic 7 year old's hands.  A regular functioning child might understand that it's not their fault, but not my child.  He was extremely upset and now the book falls apart every time we read it. The baby is crazy about it, so we'll try to figure something out to use as an alternative binder.<br /><br />If you're looking to purchase this book for yourself or as a gift, try to find one without the plastic comb binder :(  What a disappointment.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|The book was a quick read and easy to follow. It seemed a bit like we have followed this map before.
B00913P6G0|5.0|I personally like this better than section 80. I think he showed a lot of improvement and growth as an artist with this album. Great concept too. Every song is placed where it needs to be in order to tell the story from start to finish. Dope beats, great hooks (some not so great), and of course, dope lyrics. Kendrick really shines when it comes to storytelling. I also like the effects he does to his voice to sound almost alien and give more atmosphere to the tracks that already have spacey beats. I also like the features, although I would have liked to have seen Ab-Soul instead of Drake, but that doesn't really take anything away from the big picture of the album. Most artists usually get everyone they possibly can on their debut album or any album in general, but Kendrick chose to just showcase his own talent, and I really think that will help make this album stand the test of time. Not to mention most rappers are up and ready to do whatever they have to do with their debut to sell records, even if it means selling out. Kendrick obviously had a lot of creative control on this album, which is what his fans wanted to see. We'll see how this album ages with time, but compared to the majority of rap albums that have come out the last few years, I think it's safe to say that this album is a classic.
B001U6YI92|5.0|This movie is a badass classic featuring the man himself, Clint Eastwood.  Love this movie and would recommend it to anyone
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Love this game but the last update changed all pool balls to black on my Dell Streak 7. Can not play the game any more.
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Feedly's new design for Android and Kindle Fire devices is excellent; I especially like how it works more like Feedly's web browser version.  I have several hundred Google Reader feeds organized in about twenty folders, and Feedly is one of the best apps I've found for keeping up with my reading.<br /><br />When I first installed Feedly on my Kindle Fire HD, I would get the \\"bind failure\\" message others have mentioned when trying to log in the first time I ran it. However, I discovered that if you go to the feed menu (press the three horizontal bars in the upper left corner) then select \\"Guest Login\\" - you can log in with your Google credentials and it shows all your Reader folders and feeds immediately.  After that, synchs between Feedly and Reader work just fine. (Don't forget if you are using Google's two-step verification, you will need to generate an application-specific password for use with Feedly.)<br /><br />I would rate the app five stars for functionality and a great user interface, but knock off a star for the confusing log in and for the three weeks I was without My Feedly until I found a way to log in by accident!
B005LAIHZE|1.0|I really like the book, it was a good alternate history . And was a great spoof of all the Lincoln books flooding the stores these days.<br /><br />  As for the movie, a poor script and the producers,trying to adhere to the strict PC code of Hollywood, caused a disjointed editing. All these factors doomed this movie to the pitiful, was of time and money that it is. Save your money see it on Cable
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is awesome. it is very addicting. I have nothing bad to say about this game.  I love the way you get investor points if you complete some goals. But the energy thing I don't like
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|this game is fun but most of the time it does not want to load for some reason. I kind of hate this game,  what the? make it work!<br /><br />-
B005HG4C4C|5.0|I thought I'd just make a list of albums in order I like them to give yo uan idea where I think this falls in the grand scheme of things. Other people have given more detailed reviews, much more detailed than I ever could:<br /><br />Images and Words<br />Awake<br />Scenes from a Memory<br />Six Degrees of Inner Turbulance<br />Dramatic Turn of Events<br />Black Clouds and Silver Linings<br />When Dream and Day Unite<br />Falling into Infinity<br />Octavarium<br />Train of Thought<br /><br />Systemic Chaos? (I missed this album, so no idea)<br /><br />So, the important questions. Why wasn't it ranked higher? I didn't think any of the songs were as good as on Images and Words or Awake, nor did I feel there was a good of a story as on Six Degree or Scenes from a Memory. I The main weakness was the singer. Every time he screamed (or is it really loud singing? I can't tell) I cringed a bit, and sometimes felt like skipping the track.<br /><br />Why not lower? There were some good songs, and I thought musically the band was trying new things, though maybe not as aggressively as I'd like. A lot of interesting tones from the synth. Several of the songs, especially near the end, weren't typical cookie cutter Dream Theater songs which was nice.<br /><br />I have to admit to barely noticing the drums on this or any other Dream Theater album, so the replacement of the drummer barely affected me. I mostly listen to the melody and harmonies.
B008NABUU8|4.0|It's a fun game, but I would like to see the option to improve the early bridges with the new materials.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've always wanted to write a book on this very subject but I do not have the talent of Stephen King, so I couldn't pull it off. Thanks to King, this story was written and written well. Although King got a few details wrong - like confusing Mercedes Ave. in Ft. Worth with Mercedes St. in suburban Benbrook, TX - he really did a fabulous job of research. I always thought the country would have been much better off if Kennedy had not died, but King makes a good effort in portraying a much darker world that would have been the result. Great ending too.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Seasons is great because of the amount of levels is updating regularly and creatively with new birds and new themes. I unistall n reinstall Rio &amp; version one to create some challenge but these guys continually find new ways to keep seasons growing and I hope they keep going because keeping MY attention is is quite an achievement. So I say well done brilliant brains behind the birds. Cheers!
B0050BPIB0|5.0|Gorgeous voice and simply intoxicating. I came upon this album by accident, and how fortunate I am that I did. Pablo has the voice of an angel. What an amazing artist!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I liked the heart of the book.  It is not about the sex, it is about love.  I did not enjoy the swearing that much.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Excelente llego a tiempo y fue lo esperado entre el material y la entrega del mismo. Recomiendo la serie es muy buena.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I am about half-way through this book. I must admit that I bought it purely because I love Harry Potter and was interested to see what else J.K. Rowling had up her sleeve. I am a ravenous reader, if I love a book it's too hard to put down and I end up finishing it in a day or two. I've been reading this for a few weeks. Here are some things it's not: gripping, exciting, intriguing. It is: complicated (there are a lot of characters and they are so similar that they are hard to keep track off), meandering (many vignettes), wandering...<br /><br />I'm going to keep plugging along, but mostly because I feel that I've failed if I stop halfway through a book. Ms. Rowling's voice is fresh and readable, but the reader gets lost in the characters. I did not go in expecting Harry Potter, but I expected a little more.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I bought her first couple of albums and I love them; she was fresh.  But since \\"The Look of Love\\",  the quality of her music has gone down  with each new release.  And now, it is more about her sexuality and  this is has really gone into the gutter in my opinion.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|They did a good job bringing the characters together in the movie.  Great action scenes with awesome special affects.  The movie goes beyond all the action to give a good story and character development.  They did a great job tying in the individual movies to bring the characters together in the Avengers.  This is one of the best pictures of the year.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|Excellent story of an immigrant who came to America and became a HUGE SUCCESS!  The book is worth reading to get a look at the bodybuilding and political world.
B008BGNMZU|3.0|Lackluster: I played the album once and then set it aside.  I suppose I expected a more dynamic and exciting performance, but they have been around for a long time and we all get old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I played mincraft then blockstory mincraft wins by a landslide!!!blockstory does have dragons and guns but mincraft has a pordal to the nether!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site. It has everything. From crafts to food for the entire family. I use it all the time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I must begin by saying that I had doubts about this book. Having foolishly watched the movie first, my expectations were low. How incredibly wrong can one person be! Not only are the characters remarkable, they are also real. You can relate to them from the get go.<br />I found myself unable to put this book down from start to finish and truly cannot wait to read books two and three.<br />I highly recommend this book to everyone.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was very disappointing to me! It did not live up to all the hype. It was slow to grab my attention. I read three books by Richard Jeanty after i purchased this book and bgan reading it. Chapter 11 finally grabbe my attention but it did not keep it for long. I am able to read abook in a day or two depending on my schedule however, I am notable to do so with this book. I am debting whether or not to purchase the remaining books.

B0084AXZK0|4.0|This free classic version for my Kindle was very good!  It's the first Oscar Wilde tale I have read and I found it to be reader-friendly, engrossing and surprising at the end.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book provides more credible support for the author's claims about our wheat-based diet than any other such book we've read.  It is well worth reading, if only to begin understanding the connections between changes in our diet and the increases in certain types of disease.  We cannot speak about the recipes in the book, because we haven't tried any of them yet.  If they're as good as the first part of the book, they should be excellent.[[ASIN:B00571F26Y Wheat Belly: Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight, and Find Your Path Back To Health]]
