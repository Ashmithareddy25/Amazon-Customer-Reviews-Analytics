1422161978|5.0|Like others who strive to make a difference, I've been a huge fan of Joe Pine's since the release of Mass Customization and got the First Edition of the Experience Economy as SOON as it was out. When I saw that there was an updated edition, I pre-ordered. Having just finished reading the updated version and given it with the highest praise to one of my friends who is an economist, I find myself on Amazon to order all the remaining copies in their inventory (at least for today!).     This book is a bible! It really IS BETTER (and I can't believe that it could be) the second time, and has so much to offer those who are stuck in the Services Economy. It will always be on my shelf for easy reference and I will make sure that others have the opportunity to see what they do differently (and to change what they do).    Every client and sponsor of my experiences is going to receive a copy of this book as a gift. Congratulations to the co-authors, to the businesses who blazed the trail and to all who have been putting on experiences!
B000784WMW|5.0|Jane Eyre has been my favorite book since childhood. I remember watching This version of Jane Eyre, which in my opinion is  still THE best, sure it isn't as flashy as some of the newer versions, which are good also, but this one is the truest versions to me. I love Timothy Dalton as the brooding Mr. Rochester, he was born to be Rochester, and his performance is spot on. Some reviews don't favor Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre in this version, but I think she was perfectly cast too.You can see their relationship slowly develop before your eyes.    Curl up with your favorite tea or coffee and allow yourself to be transported back to another time, where despite adversity true love, finds a way.    This one is set up in episode form which I love, episodes 1-7 on one side and 8-11 on the other.    Arrived super fast, packaged great. Great price, I hadn't seen this movie offered, and It's never on tv, which is where I originally watched it. I love the fact that Amazon offers, these types of movies. Thank you Amazon

B00005JKZV|4.0|Bought this movie as a gift, they loved it, they especially loved the extras, which included the original theatrical trailers, and tv spots,and Gollum's song music video . The price was just unbeatable, fast shipping.

B00013AXEE|5.0|Great read, even for non writer professionals. A lot of the ideas on writing that King presents can be used in different professions. I also really enjoyed the first half of the book about his life.
B001O53BK6|4.0|I think this movie was great, not from the quality of acting and the writing, but by the genius ways they showed two different decades. The eighties are presented in an over the top, spirited set of individuals, which co mingles with a more cautious and controlled pop culture of the 90''s and 00's. Even the music reflects the common stereotype that each decade represented. This alone really is good enough to outweigh the cheesy writing (which only promotes the stereotypes,) method acting, fairy tale ending, and simplistic message.
B0054N73EY|4.0|I've seen these guys live 6 or 7 times over the years (last time in 2003).  My first Chili's record was \\"Freaky Styley\\" and I've been a fan boy for, geez, 26 years (!) or so.  Scary to realize, but Anthony is actually older than I am (by about 2 months).  So ... you could say I began adulthood rocking with these guys and - yup - the good times keep pumpin'.<br /><br />Unlike their last Opus - 'Stadium Arcadium' - which was dominated by Frusciante's creative, nimble guitar work and was a pastiche of musical ideas jumbled together, the new record seems to have been thoughtfully assembled like an old-school LP with each song arranged in a cohesive order.  Listened to this way, I have a sense that, without Frusciante, the Chilis went for a classic rock sound, more reliant on keyboards, catchy melodies and choruses, buttressed with Flea's gritty funk rhythm bottom and dense percussion.  \\"Goodbye Hooray\\" - track 9 - would have been a good closer but the great songs keep cranking, with Kiedis - accompanied by piano - urging young lovers to \\"keep on pumpin' in the streets of L.A.\\" on track 10 ('Happiness Loves Company' - a catchy be-bop feel-gooder).<br /><br />Surprisingly, Kiedis' lyrics are starting to actually make sense.  \\"Police Station\\" has a credible storyline (about a lost lover) - along with another one of those fantastic, soaring choruses.  It's the choruses - not the guitar solos - that are now stuck in my head.  I'm humming this stuff all day long.<br /><br />Other strong tracks (for me, so far) demanding download:<br /><br />'Monarchy of Roses' (very intense percussion with awesome vocals - backed with a beautiful harmony supplied by Josh the new guy);<br /><br />'Factory of Faith' (catchy lyrics with an unexpectedly AWESOME, instrumental rock pile 2/3 of the way through);<br /><br />'Annie Wants a Baby' (big guitar rocker with a hooky chorus);<br /><br />\\"Did I Let You Know\\" (lovely flamenco-styled guitar with a haunting chorus ... 'take me home' ... and an impressive, powerful yet nuanced vocal from Anthony);<br /><br />'Police Station' (probably their best anthem since 'Californication');<br /><br />'Even You Brutus?' (hilarious, tripped out funker about a guy who falls for a young hottie and gets stuck \\"with a mess of a better half\\");<br /><br />I've yet to glom onto 'Brendan's Death Song' - and a few of the other tracks - as favorites but it's only a matter of time.  I'm looking forward to enjoying these jams for years to come and vow not to miss their live show when the (uhh) boyz inevitably come to Orlando.<br /><br />This is great stuff.

B004WJREMW|5.0|McCartney deserves five stars for doing exactly what he set out to do.  He's having a blast with some new musical toys at home, and though most didn't know it at the time, he was ushering in New Wave, which must have left a lot of people scratching their heads.  One thing I love about McCartney is having to tell people at any given time that I'm listening to a CD, and they like it and want to know who it is, and I say, \\"Paul McCartney\\" -- it's just rewarding to see people have a new appreciation for him.  Because really, what's a Paul McCartney CD supposed to sound like?  The last one?  That's never been the case.  It wasn't the case with the Beatles, either, though I'm not saying he is equal to his old band on his own.  Paul McCartney is silly, serious, funny, melodic, weird, brave, and bold.  Just what someone like John Lennon would seek in a songwriting partner.  Do I love every song he ever did?  No, although I find merit in the vast majority.  But I happen to love every song on McCartney II.  It's his last great effort until *Flaming Pie*, arguably.  It was also the last work he did while Lennon was alive.  He had to know John would hear every thing he put out.  That wasn't to be the case for long.  I've often wondered if McCartney stopped caring as much after John was gone.  *Tug Of War* and *Flowers in the Dirt* had their moments.  But here Paul's got his groove on throughout.  He didn't get it back for a while after this in my opinion.  But here he is having fun, and I have fun every time I hear this one.
014241722X|3.0|This book is in the spirit of that American TV show where there is a young kid who's gone through medical school and is a doctor at age someteen.  Theodore boon is the legal equivalent.  He is hothouse in every subject, except for having an A- in chemistry, and he lives and breathes the local courtroom, even has his own clients and cases.    This has the same appeal as that MD show - its all a nice daydream and makes a good escapist story.    However.    I suspect it wouldn't be all that appealing to a real 13 year old reader - such a reader would have the (dis)advantage of knowing the language and the country, and the total un-thirteenness of Theo B would surely jar in a way that totally passes this thirty-niner by.    It also strikes me as not very different to Grisham's books for grown ups, just watered down somewhat. In fact, looking back to the first Grisham I ever read... a young kid... has witnessed something he shouldn't... and has to negotiate the legal system and stay safe... Sounds familar? That must be the inifinitely more readable and exciting (and just as escapist) \\"The Client\\". That is the book I'd recommend to a kid wanting to read Grisham.    Which also has the advantage of a decent ending... Many other reviewers have also noted the following:    SPOILER ALERT: All Theo B plotlines remain unresolved with the exception of those that concern Boa Constrictors or dogs END SPOILER ALERT Yuk!
0618918248|5.0|The title of my review is a quote from the physicist Victor Stenger.    I was raised Lutheran, rather nominally, and by the time I was 10 or 12 was a serious skeptic of the notion that any god exists.  My skepticism came from actually reading large chunks of the bible, which I found to be more fantastic and unreal than the fairy tales I heard as a child.  I knew that my grandfather had lived to the ripe old age of 82 in an age of modern medicine yet I was expected to believe that the \\"patriachs\\" had lived for hundreds of years in an Iron Age culture where medicine was essentially nonexistent?  By the time I was a teenager I knew that this had to be nonsense.    I digress.  For many years I sat on the agnostic fence leaning strongly in the direction of atheism.  Seeing Carl Sagan's \\"Cosmos\\" shoved me firmly into the atheist camp, though I kept quiet about it.  Sam Harris' brilliant \\"The End of Faith\\" gave me the courage to \\"come out\\" to a number of friends and it remains an excellent, thoroughgoing explanation of the philosophical foundations of atheism.    Dawkins however, being a practical man of science rather than philosophy, pleads (and frankly proves) the case for the non-existence of supernatural beings with such rigorous yet easy to understand logic and reason that it has become one of my all-time favorite books.  He answered every lingering agnostic doubt I ever harbored about the probability of the existence of a supernatural god with precision, discipline and a generous leavening of wit.      Dawkins is not merely smart, he is wise, and his generous, humane and humanistic wisdom veritably bursts from every page of this wonderful book.  His marshaling of verifiable fact, surgical debunking of the fallacies underlying the Abrahamic religions, and validation of the scientific method - as if it needed further validation as the only sound way to know anything worth knowing - are elegant, straightforward and readily accessible.  Dawking demolishes the notions that morality is based in religion and that belief is necessary for a satisfying life.  Most of all he shows that the wonders of the universe and the natural world, as they have evolved, are infinitely greater and more awe-inspiring than any book of man-made myths. He also writes marvelous English prose: deft, flowing, and eminently readable.    Reason is the culmination of what we know has evolved to date.  To abandon it is to abandon everything that makes us human and capable of improving our own condition and of learning more about the cosmos and world in which we live.  The abandonment of reason is the abandonment of hope.  Belief in Iron Age mythology never cured a disease, invented a useful new piece of technology, or inspired us to explore the stars.  Reason has done all of those things and more.      In sum, as Dawkins says, we are all atheists as to the innumerable gods that have been worshiped throughout human history.  Some of us just take it one god further.    Highest possible recommendation.
B0055S348W|4.0|20 page limit. then, either a $9/month subscription fee or $5 per 100 pages = ripoff.yep, that's a deal breaker. what's the logic behind that? just a way to make residual income on top of the 12 dollars they charge for the app? granted its free today but after u print 20 pages you're forced to start paying if u wish to get more use out if it. great app except for the greedy pricing scheme<br /><br />*Update*<br /><br />Point taken. I have revised my rating to 4 stars since I really do like this app but the pricing scheme still remains unnecessarily complex. What is the purpose of having a 20 page limit when printing from a computer using the software? Especially 9.95 a month? Seems excessive. I digress, my review here is for the android app and in that case, i repeat, it's a great app but not always consistent. Sometimes my print jobs are successful, sometimes they hang.

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This movie was so beautifully created I can barely find words to describe it. It certainly doesn't yield for an apathetic response - It is like nothing I've seen before. I'm a Wes Anderson, Charlie Kaufman, and David Lynch fan. Although this movie is directed nothing like their films I find the expression of inner struggle that draws me to their movies somehow similar. I've not seen Malick's other movies, but plan to check them out.    I've found either you are deeply moved by The Tree of Life or deeply bored with it. It does not speak to the Ego as much as to the Id and Superego in that it's not a movie to see for entertainment but for thought provocation and evocation of our spirit. The word that best sums up this movie for me is beautiful - Visually, Audibly, Emotionally, and Spiritually - beautiful.     Visually  The imagery was stunning, the directing evocative.     Audibly  The soundtrack is perfect - haunting, brilliant, and dark at just the right times.    Emotionally  I found myself deeply relating to the emotion of this film. The frustration of the father and the son. The love of the mother and middle son. The solidity of the youngest brother. The power of nature.     Spiritually  I have wrestled with the questions of life and God just as the hero. Nature vs Grace. Science vs Spirituality.     It spoke to something so deep inside me that I MUST see it again. I rarely purchase DVDs, but may just have to add this one to my library.
B0055S348W|1.0|downloaded the program and it found my printer really quick.  i was prompted to download drivers for the printer and i did.  everything seemed ok till you print and only thing that comes out is garbage. looks like they need to do some work on the drivers.
B0055S348W|5.0|I purchased this app months ago on the Amazon Market. It doesn't work on all printers, which is why they have the test app available, to make sure you can use it before purchasing it. I haven't had any issues with my printers. For me, it works on 4 different HP's, 2 brothers, 2 Canons and a Kodak
B0055S348W|5.0|I've only written one app review before this, and it was to complain. However, I'm so impressed with this one that it was worth the effort! Within a few minutes of installation, I had already printed and email. Immediately found my Brother wireless printer, and a document printed with no problems. I wish every app worked this well, and this easily. Don't hesitate to download if you might ever possibly need to print from your phone.
B004RE29WW|5.0|This is an amazing movie. It in my opinion truly keeps up with the pace of the original Alien and Aliens movies. People are always saying how horrible this movie is and I just dont get it this movie is amazing with an incredible story line of how ripley after escaping the Aliens from the last movie where she was on that planet and burned them all and escaped with newt and the male companion she abruptly lands on a prison planet after her flight is disturbed by yet another alien ruining the ship and killing newt and the guy who was with them. She has no choice after recovering but to stay with a whole crew of guys in the prison. After discovering that there is an alien in the prison that shes at on this planet she and the other prisoners that shes with are forced to flee and evacuate and find a way to kill this alien. But alas along the way she also discovers that she is pregnant with one of the alien babies and that its a queen. This is in my opinion right up there with the first two movies in story and acting. Its an amazing film very compelling it keeps you reeled in to the movie at all times leaving you wondering whats going to happen next. The only thing to complain about in this movie is the fake looking alien made from poor graphics the alien that runs around. Its very sad to have this wonderful third installment and have such a poorly created alien however there is scenes where the alien is mastered like the other films very brilliantly its just when the alien is running in the film is when they have such poor graphics for it. But this movie is great it keeps up the pace and thrill of the first two movies. I give it a 5 stars all around. Now about the actual blu ray it could have been done better. There are scenes which are done brilliantly but other parts which you could tell are grainy, also blurry and not sharp, crisp or clear. The blu ray could have been done alot better and I suggest if you watch the movie you watch the theatrical release. I love the ending on that a whole lot better than the special edition and the way the director changed it. The ending on that is really great. I give the blu ray of this a 4 stars.ing on that a whole lot better than the special edition and the way the director changed it. The ending on that is really great.

B004UID2LC|4.0|HTC thunderbolt. works, but needs updates from time to time to keep working. great free app. could be a little easier on the eyes. its just not a very pretty looking interface.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|There are so many 5 star reviews here that mine is hardly necessary, but I like this album so much I just have to chime in.  I love every track on this album, but several are outstanding.  \\"Rolling In the Deep\\" has that pounding baseline emphasizing Adele's soaring vocals.  I quickly got addicted to this song - it just pushed my betrayal buttons.  \\"Rumour Has It\\" does likewise - it's such a great, classic, bluesy R&B piece.  The sad note she hits in \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"Someone Like You\\" is truly beautiful.  I guess, in the end, what I love is how it genuinely touched my emotions in a way few complete albums still do.  Bravo Adele!      (PS:  Downloading saves plastic trees ;-D ).
B00328R21C|5.0|this set is great its just great but this set has alot of minifigures and the speeder is cool but,if you didnt get any minifigs in this would you buy it? the answer is no and you know it .this set it great for little kids because of minifigs and good for kids but some kids would want a little more to build but overall great set!!
B005KWL2IW|4.0|I've mostly given up on Anthrax, Sound of White Noise was classic and near perfect, but 442, Vol.8 and WHCFYA were a steady decline downward. After 442 it seemed like the band was just putting out records because they needed something to tour on, the heart and soul was gone and they didn't write about any subject matter worth caring about.<br /><br />This has all changed. I'm not a Joey vs John fan, I like both. I do think Joey sounds stressed, his voice is not what it was by any measure, but it certainly works here. I would say this is easily the best \\"joey\\" album Anthrax ever put out. If I would change anything it would be, one, the horribly dumb fake-news voice before Fight Until You Can't and the utter lack of dynamics in the mastering. The record is so compressed it's just a wall of noise and nothing ever pops. The guitars blur together, the bass disappears, the drums have no power and the vocals feel buried under it all. Just listen to it right after listening to Among the Living, you'll notice it.<br /><br />Worship Music is certainly a connection between Among and Sound, it sounds neither like old-school Joey, or John. It's heavy, it's melodic, it's got constant hooks and well-thought lyrics (if a bit silly at times.) It's got more heart than Metallica's last misstep, you genuinely feel this is a band really into the music their making, something Anthrax hasn't done in nearly 20 years.<br /><br />Now with the publicity from the Big 4 shows Anthrax will finally get it's due, and with this record anyone willing to give them a listen will not be disappointed.

B003PBB4ME|3.0|This item looks like it might help stabilize a camera, BUT what it does if you hold it by the handle is create a rotational motion where the camera slightly swings left and right. This type of motion is a lot harder to remove in post than linear motion that you would get if you just hand held the camera.<br /><br />Another problem is that the diameter of the handle only allows a DSLR without a battery grip attached. When I shoot video I want the grip on so that I have 2 batteries to use.<br /><br />If not evident from the photo, this item is made of black plastic making it very light, but also not very sturdy.<br /><br />In the end I ended up sawing off the handle and just using it for parts.

B0055S348W|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moT4XRUVODEZ8X]]Demo'ed on my Galaxy Tab 7<br />As you can see in the video, this works really well with Google Cloud Print. If you don't know how to use Google Cloud Print, just search for it and you'll find the instructions. Basically, it installs in the Chrome browser and then shares the printers that are installed on that computer with your google account as \\"cloud printers.\\"<br />(there are also printers you can buy that are \\"google cloud printers\\" that don't require a PC, but I don't have one...like this guy: [[ASIN:B005JZP2WC Kodak HERO 3.1 Wireless Color Printer with Scanner & Copier]])<br />I tested using this app to print to a few network and bluetooth printers here around the office and it worked fine (printed color photos, gmail messages, calendar agendas, PDF files), but GCP is the way to go if you ask me. Printing is much much faster via GCP, for one thing.<br />Next feature needed? the ability to print from the android Maps application (google maps)
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I just bought this at Best Buy for $79.99 plus tax and it came with an XL black Star Wars t-shirt!  The movies deserve to be watched in blu ray!  I've seen all the negative reviews on here!  I hate crybabies and whiners!  Nobody ever listens to those kind of people anyway!  Just take my advice and go out and buy it...or order it here!  Actually with the changes made to the films...doesn't it make this a collectors edition?
B0055S348W|4.0|Used on Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 Wifi, and works well.  Detected multiple printers on the network, and was able to print email and PDF (the latter, after downloading a 4MB rendering add-on (free)).  Did force-close while trying to print a document when navigating to a folder (and hence only 4 stars). Was able to access the file system and navigate to folders upon restart.  Not super-fast, but gets the job done.  I like it.

I can't say enough about this app and best yet, Amazon is picking up the tab today. a must have for any android user. A+
B003ZSJ212|1.0|My introduction into the Star Wars world was through the prequels.  I loved each of them and when I saw the original trilogy, I became a huge Star Wars fan.  I love both of the trilogies as they both tell two cohesive and engaging stories with compelling characters, crisp storytelling and thrilling action.  The original trilogy that I saw was the 2004 DVDs so I wasn't made aware of the changes until I looked it up on the internet.  I didn't mind them; they seemed trivial and didn't affect the storytelling in my opinion.  When they announced the Complete Set on Blu Ray, I excitedly pre-ordered it like millions of others.  Then the unthinkable happened.  George Lucas ruined the climactic scene of Return of The Jedi for NO GOOD REASON whatsoever.  I didn't mind the other changes; the blinking Ewoks, Obi-Wan's wuss scream, Jabba's new CGI door but this was unforgivable.  I sadly cancelled my order because I can't in good conscience pay for this.  Say what you will about the 2004 versions but none of them ruined important iconic moments or scenes.  I will still buy the Prequels on Blu Ray tomorrow but it still saddens me that I won't be seeing the Original trilogy in HD until Lucas pulls his head out of his ass and undoes the damage he has done.... who knows how long that will be.

B00009V7T2|5.0|This album is hands down the best of the 2000's.  If you don't mind some occasional Pink Floyd-synth trips you will love this record.  There are a couple of songs that will be early favorites at first, but in time you'll love the whole record.  Roulette Dares will always be a favorite for me.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I purchased this item on the day of release as I really wanted this item. I will say the product is strong and well made. Sadly that's where the story ends.<br /><br />It was easy to install and locks on to the Kinect. You will have to recalibrate the unit.<br /><br />The bigger problems with this item is you will lose the sensitive movement features with this product. In many cases it cannot see the floor and when it does it's really not that great. Standing at the same distance that DID work with the Kinect without this sensor worked a LOT better then it did with the zoom on the Kinect.<br /><br />I really wanted this product to work, but overall it's just not worth the money. You are NOT going to say the same game results with this item. Movement is jerky, slowed down, and really does not work well. It also seems to make the lense DARKER which REALLY IS NOT what Kinect needs? It has a hard time seeing you normally, and this just makes the image more dark.<br /><br />Overall don't bother with this item.. Not worth the money paid for this item..<br /><br />EPIC FAIL...

B0034G4P8A|5.0|As a man in my 50's, I grew up spending a great deal of time in the Marvel universe. I have taken issue with story line deviations, when the movie alters what I consider to be a key element of the comic storyline. The whole Doctor Doom representation in the Fantastic Four movie for example. Hard to understand why they didn't stick with the original plot premise when the outcome was a less than stellar product. In Thor, however, they managed to balance this with staying true to the original. The outcome is an immersive movie experience that brings the Marvel universe to life in a more contemporary fashion. This movie succeeds on many levels and appeals to people familiar with comic book or those who are not. My wife loved the movie, yet has probably never even read a comic book. From the casting to the costuming to the acting to the scenery to the special effects here is a movie that stands up to repeated viewings. A great deal of credit has to go to the Director as well. One of the reasons this movie works so well is because it doesn't get bogged down with lengthy explanations but provides the viewer with enough background to make the story plausible and fast moving. If you like super hero/science fiction/fantasy films this one does not dissapoint. Highly recommended.

B000001I0K|5.0|Somewhat of a concept album but not wholly, The Cramps 1981 \\"Psychadelic Jungle\\" seems rather sedate and light-hearted compared to their previous two albums in that it's not as rebellious sounding and the rockabilly flavor has been diluted (save for the mid-tempo grinder \\"Rockin' Bones\\").<br /><br />\\"Psycho Beach Party\\" may have been a better title with songs like \\"Goo Goo Muck\\" (\\"I'm a night headhunter looking for some head\\"); the rousing dance-numbers \\"The Crusher\\" \\"Jungle Hop\\" and \\"The Natives Are Restless\\".<br /><br />\\"Green Fuz\\" and \\"Voodoo Idol\\" are like grunge prototypes while The Cramps jet-black humour is still evident in numbers like the bluesy \\"Caveman\\", eerie \\"Don't Eat Stuff Off the Sidewalk\\" and trance-like \\"Under The Wires\\" in which Lux growls \\"What color panties are you wearing?\\" over and over until the song comes to a perfectly abrupt end with \\"If you think I'm sick...CLICK!\\" followed by his impression of a dial tone. \\"Beautiful Garden\\" features a guitar line Cyndi Lauper borrowed for \\"She Bop\\" a few years later.<br /><br />Lead vocalist Lux Interior eerily channels Jim Morrison on the hypnotic \\"Primitive\\" and creepy \\"Can't Find My Mind\\" and the album ends with a fun cover of Jim Lowe's 1956 #1 hit \\"The Green Door\\".<br /><br />A more laid-back album than \\"Songs The Lord Taught Us\\" but more varied. Five Stars.<br /><br />This CD has it coupled with the 1979 \\"Gravest Hits\\" album, which is the perfect introduction to The Cramps, featuring clever lyrics and over-the-top, ghoulish lead vocals from Lux Interior on the all-too-short '50s horror-movie spoof \\"Human Fly\\" (\\"Baby I don't care, I'm just a reborn maggot using germ warfare\\"). Their rockabilly influence was never more evident than on the slow and saucy \\"The Way I Walk\\" (with guitars so sharp they slice their way through the song) or the rousing \\"Domino\\".<br /><br />This EP would be perfect were it not for a cover of The Trashmen's 1964 oddity \\"Surfin' Bird\\". Let's face it, there's only so much one can do with a song like this, and while the band stays true to the original, it rambles with lots of noisy guitar feedback for the last few minutes and goes on endlessly and needlessly. The sorrowful \\"Lonesome Town\\" closes on a high note, however, with Lux snivelling his way through the self-pitiful lyrics.<br /><br />Still, for a debut album, The Cramps nail it from the opening note of \\"Gravest Hits\\" and definitely leave the listener wanting more. If you like this, you will definitely love the follow-up \\"Songs The Lord Taught Us\\", perhaps their best album ever.<br /><br />Partnered with \\"Psychadelic Jungle\\" this release is definitely one of the Cramps must-have CDs and dare I use this phrase to describe them, but their \\"feel-good\\" album.can do with a song like this, and while the band stays true to the original, it rambles with lots of noisy guitar feedback for the last few minutes and goes on endlessly and needlessly.

B00005ABX0|5.0|The Beach Boys catalog post-Pet Sounds does not get the appreciation it deserves, but they released several truly fantastic records after people stopped paying attention -- Sunflower, Love You, and yes...Wild Honey, which is my personal favorite in their whole catalog. From Carl Wilson's  blue-eyed soul title track opener all the way through to the quirky Mama Says, Wild Honey is a tight, focused, and effective album. Totally overlooked in its day, and even now as Capitol has tacked it on to the bizarre and dated Smiley Smile. But boy oh boy am I glad I stumbled upon it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Definitely the best mobile game i every played, much better than angry bird's by far and true to the original in graphics and characters to the PC version the only thing im hoping for is the zen garden patch please.
B000068PQ7|5.0|There is something really special about Gene Clark. It's hard to define, but there's a warmth and openness that runs through his entire canon -- from his earliest Byrds material to his final records. Listening to White Light, it always feels like I'm listening to music from one of my dearest friends. I love this album.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|I never read the comics so just watched this as a movie. I felt that it needed more explanations of the world, and more filling out of almost all of the characters. The acting was good but Natalie Portmans talents were wasted.I liked the art and art direction. The fights were well chorepgraphed. The script could have ,as i said, explained more about well, everything. Had it done so, i would have liked this much more...
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Seriously. I hated the 1994 changes. I hated the changes in the next version. The changes in this latest version are just unforgivable. Has Lucas gone senile?<br /><br />Stop tinkering with a film that has great historical significance! Please give us a straight up exact copy of the Academy Award winning original theatrical release in high-def on Blu-ray. I honestly don't care if it includes zero additional content. I just want a high-def transfer of the unaltered original film and I guarantee I'll buy it when you make it.<br /><br />Until we get a high-def transfer of the original, I refuse to buy another Star Wars product, be it book, movie, or whatever. I'm just sick to death of all the strange CGI additions, crazy added puppets, and horrible soundtrack hacks. Stop messing with perfection and give us what we want.
B0058ZPNOK|3.0|I am not sure why, but this movie just didn't work for me. Extremely well cast. Not sure where this movie stumbled. My daughter did not care for the young actor that played T.J. and thought the movie focused too much on him. It did not seem to flow smoothly and was a bit choppy in the editing.
0385342039|5.0|I hate stories about ghost and I dont really like to imagine life a century ago. This book has totally changed my opinions. I see in this book a completely different Sophie Kinsella from the Shopaholics series (I adore them as well, in a different way). The way the story is twisted, the way knots are unravelled are so exciting that I could not keep my eyes off it until finishing. It is funny but also heart-touching when it comes to family connections. After all, it is the spiritual person inside each aging body that matters. However people may say or deem about others, no-one's existence is without a true meaning. There is a little feeling of loss at the ending but even the loss feeling is warm and pleasant. I love the story!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Its so lame that George Lucas can't leave the original movies alone.  The NOOOOO and Obi's call are RIDICULOUS!    Starwars is pretty much dead to me.

B0000A5A0T|5.0|Saxophonist John Coltrane is recognised as one of the most important innovators in 20th century music and even has a Church named after him, where he is revered as a saint (check out `The Church of St. John Coltrane').<br /><br />`Blue Train' from 1957 was Trane's only Blue Note Records release under his own name as band-leader, an early work firmly in the `hard bop groove' but with a distinctive style all its own.<br /><br />The other five band members gathered around Trane on the album gel together perfectly and produce a sound in every way superb. When you consider Trane himself as band leader was only 31 and trumpeter Lee Morgan was only 19 - yet his distinctive playing even at this tender age is masterful and confident - the result is astounding.<br /><br />The music is `pre-modal' and should be accessible even to those whose knowledge of jazz doesn't really extend beyond 1930s/40s trad styles. Many pieces employ Trane's innovative chord substitution cycles which later came to be known as `Coltrane Changes': the supremely intelligent and musically-devoted Trane was already getting himself known as an experimenter and breaker of new ground.<br /><br />For those not well acquainted with the complex history of developments in 20th century jazz, `Blue Train' is very listenable and a good place to start exploring the work of John Coltrane. If you get to like this, try moving on to his recordings with Atlantic Records, notably `Giant Steps' and the seminal soprano-sax dominated `My Favorite Things' from 1961.<br /><br />Some controversy rages amongst fans as to which recording issue of `Blue Train' sounds best. Personally I like the 1997 CD release, but many feel the crisply re-mastered `Ultimate Blue Train' is the one to go for. Regardless, this is amongst Trane's best work and should be in the collection of anyone serious about music.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Beautiful Disaster is a book you dont need to read but have to read. Though I will say the main character can be a little to naive and weird about bets at times, overall its an entertaining read. I almost wanted it to be longer, the explosive and possesive relationship the couple have is addicting even though we know in real life we might be a little wide eyed if we ever witnessed an outbursts from out of the book in real life. This book does a great job of keeping you interested in the couple as well as putting in a few curve balls. It has so many high ratings for a good reason. LITTLE SPOILER... I did not enjoy the gambling twist and how the main character acted so odd and I guess life or death, shes a bad ass thing. It seemed a little forced and out of place and for what a big reveal it was supposed to be it was quite the dud. Anyways! Great book, you need it in your library.

161524350X|5.0|I bought this same books a while ago. I've always heard about this story in movies, TV and so one. When I came across this book I had to get it. They say never judge a book by its cover, but in this case I did. The look of the book echoes books of the eighteen hundreds. The silver shine on the edges of the pages plus its own bookmark just made me want it more.    The classic horror story of Dr. Henry Jekyll and Mr. Edward Hyde gave people around the world nightmares for over one hundred and twenty-five years as well as the writer himself.     This is one book like Dracula and Frankenstein you must have for your book collection. No collection is complete without it.    Trust me, you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
B000PMLFRA|2.0|Sorry I bought this...I was sure it was the original theatrical versions....but it is NOT. The promotion for this set is deceitful...not clear at all.

0307346617|5.0|First read this book as a recommendation from a friend who's an avid video gamer (namely Black Ops, à la zombies). Was very impressed with Max Brooks' style. Enjoyed the book so much that I bought a copy and gave it to a friend (also a video gamer) for his birthday. He's currently singing its praises. (: Can't go wrong with a war-theme book concerning the zombie apocalypse we're all waiting for, haha. Two thumbs up!

B005D9MUWY|4.0|These keyboards are growing up very quickly.<br /><br />When I first got my HTC Thunderbolt back in May 2011, I tried swype and swiftkey and was not impressed enough to switch away from the very nice HTC keyboard.  But by June, Swype fixed enough of its issues that I gladly switched to Swype and doubted I'd ever go back to typing.<br /><br />When SwiftKeyX was a free app, I gave it another try.... I am still using it today, over 1 month later (the free day was in July, but I did not actually try it until August).<br /><br />I am suprised how well it predicts what I probably want to say and also a bit annoyed that to get a different tense I have to type out nearly the whole word before it give me that option.<br /><br />Basically, how it works... before I hit even one letter, up pops 3 words.  I can either tap one of those words or tap the first letter of the word I want.  The moment I tap that letter, three different words pop up and again, assuming I am looking at the top row, which is just below the text input screen anyway, I can either choose one of those words or the next letter in my word.  I seldom have to type more than 3 letters in a word and 80% of the time less than 2 letters.  It changes my style of entering.  Before, I would just write whatever I wanted and fix it later if Swype got it wrong.  Now I am typing one letter at a time and pausing after each letter.  This method would be fantastic for hunt and peck typists, however for me it took a while to adjust as I am habitually a no-look typist who types very quickly.<br /><br />I wish the predictive words popped up every single time; however not every situation triggers them and sometimes I wish it would also remember and offer login names and passwords.  That seems simple enough.
0307346617|3.0|This is basically a collection of short stories. It is an imaginative narrative of a zombie war, but the stories are almost never scary or creepy.    I didn't hate it, but I can't say I recommend it.

0671004107|5.0|This is my first book I've read by Carl Sagan and it was a spectacular ride. It teases all your emotions. So,what would happen in society in all parts of the world IF contact was made?, this is as real as your going to get in my opinion. I saw the film years ago and was upset by the ending but this book covers and goes over what really happened on that trip through the galaxy, and of course the novel is always better. What I got most from this read was an actual education, I learned more science in this book than in school(do they still teach science in school?),I finally understand Pi. Most worthy of what I got out of this book since I'm an Atheist myself was the discussions between characters about the interwoven arguments between science and religion. As well as what an entire world would go through mentally if a alien being was known to us. Fear,happiness,questioning faith,and a feeling that us humans are very very small, and how a world can come together in such a crisis or should I say 'such a moment in our history'.     Sagan has a incredible style that is very well thought out and scientific, yet explains it to the reader in such an easy to understand way that like I said, is understood by the casual and hardcore reader. His character development is on point, with so many main characters its hard to fully understand their situations but Sagan had woven their origin perfectly and no character is felt as lackluster or incomplete. I had feelings for these people,loving and hating characters is a sign of great writing.    I urge everyone to give this a try for you will learn something of the human race, religion, science, philosophy,and world government, economics and the lessons we need to learn if such a scenario did happen for REAL, the coming together as a species for the benefit of the world. A must read and I'm still thinking about this story days after I finished.

B004LWZW42|5.0|This movie was well done.  It explains a lot of what was eluded to in the other X-Men movies, like the friendship between Prof X and Magneto.  I really loved watching the evolving of their personas and names.  I think anyone would love watching the movies in order of this one first, etc. but I really enjoyed watching in the production order.  I do think they could have done a little more with the Wolverine meeting and rejection though.  Kevin Bacon was a wonderful cast for Magneto, he did a really superb job.  Loved it!!!
B005COO1X6|1.0|Seems I may be in the minority here but, as intriguing as the story began--and it is classic Stephen King story-telling (good stuff)--and as effortlessly as it pulled me it, at the end, I was left wanting. In fact, I had to page back and forth a couple of times just to make sure my device wasn't losing pages.  I've become accustomed to Stephen King not giving me an explanation for what happened, and I am cool with that but seriously, this story just stopped.  So, while I shall look forward to the new quasi-time travel book this fall and the new Dark Tower installment next year and whatever else the master of horror throws our way, I have to give this one a thumbs down.
B0049VGSLG|5.0|What an album - I love it! First off, vocally, JD is a rock 'n' roll chameleon. Growly or smooth, it all sounds great. As far as influences, there's a lot of Little Richard and Jackie Wilson shining through. Oh yes, and the ghost of Bunker Hill's \\"Hide 'n' Go Seek\\" in the magnificent, stuttering \\"Wolf Teeth.\\"   My favorites are the scorchers: \\"Fire Bug,\\" \\"Wolf Teeth,\\" and \\"Scratching Circles.\\" I've also been replaying the intense, genre-stretching numbers: \\"Signs and Signifiers\\" and \\"A Gentle Awakening.\\"   And for the unexpected surprise, the lyrics! There's a nice poetic bent here that reminds me of Chuck Berry - setting an atmosphere, conjuring an image, simply playing with the sound. \\"Rollin' the rock in the salt candy shop.\\" Gold capped teeth, Chevrolets, bacon rinds, armadillos, crows ... they're all here.   Bottom line: JD sounds like he's giving it his all, which is more refreshing than it should be; the band is tight; the sound is clear. Thanks, guys, for leavin' a little magic.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I have heard so much about this CD that I figured it was time to check it out.  Just to be clear I'm far from 21 and pushing 58 and let me tell you this CD is simply amazing.  The CD in a weird way reminds me of Joni Mitchell's CD Blue.  Every song is about love lost, love gained and all of the emotion in between.  It really is by far one of the best CD's I've heard in years as far as touching your emotions.

B000QFW7UA|5.0|I'm not big on gimmicks with DVDs; I don't buy Limited Editions with bookends and other stuff I'll never use. They're never worth the extra cost. I didn't look hard at this Blu-ray release for that reason.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I got a huge box (beautiful & solidly made) with a mini magazine (that is actually interesting), a \\"Where are they now?\\" pamphlet, story boards (with corresponding photos from the movie, and a board game (I'll probably never even open), all for less than $20. Of course the day after I get it & watch it, Amazon posts for the pre-release of the disc-only version I would have bought (still happy with my purchase).<br /><br />The only thing that matters to me is the video & sound quality (not perfect, but some of the best for its age), but the rest will be a great bonus for collectors that love that kind of stuff. At least it stores everything in a box that looks good on my DVD shelf. It's a little over-sized, so it may not fit upright on shelves with little clearance over regular DVDs.<br /><br />If you like the Goonies, you should get this Blu-ray as it's never looked better. If you like all the collectibles, you'll hate missing out on this set.<br /><br />My favorite bonus on the disc is the Cindy Lauper music video. I love when the 'cliff-hanger' mentions MTV. For those too young to remember, the M used to mean 'Music' before it became ' Moronic-reality-shows'
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Bore me once, shame on you; bore me twice, I'm an idiot.  I refuse to (a) pay the exorbitant eBook price for \\"Dragons\\", (b) get sucker punched again by hundreds and hundreds of pages of blathering meandering exercises in how-long-can-I-stretch-out-nothing-whatsoever-happening, and (c) waste precious and non-refundable hours of my life stuck in a book written by an author who has utterly lost his passion for his own story AND any respect for his clamoring fans. He doesn't care about shortchanging his readers, I certainly don't care to fork over money to help him do so.
0307387178|2.0|I was interested in the story of the main charaction. This book was written a bit too much like a first year college term paper.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|We really enjoyed this true story which is definately suitable for the whole family. Absolutely amazing and inspiring life Bethany has lead and continues to live. The scenery and surfing scenes are stunning.  Helen Hunt and Denis Quaid bring heart felt roles to this movie and great to see Carrie Underwood. Highly recommend.
B0050PYNP8|4.0|The cast is so wonderful I don't even want to single out anybody.  They are all fantastic.  Bateman and Weaver are the only ones I was familiar with.  (Yeah, I've missed some good flicks in recent years.)  But I can't think of anyone that didn't shine in this.      The characters are written with a wonderful variety of quirks and motivations.  The writing is fun and clever and creates hilarious homages to the sci fi genre.  I love the humor they had with swearing throughout the film, but especially with the repressed character that suddenly decides she needs to learn how to swear.  This sweet film ends on an up note that will appeal to American audiences.  But it is not for children.    There are some reviews that say this is an anti-Christian film.  As a person of faith I say: baloney!  The type of \\"faith\\" this film mocks is a particularly narrow minded Christianity that thinks the Earth is 4,000 years old.    It was interesting that Paul at the end has a scene in which he emulates Christ in a particular way.  I think there are plenty of Christians that will notice that and be reminded that there is a gulf between what we talk about and how we act towards others.    On the other hand I don't want to give the impression this is a film with a deep message.  The standard \\"science vs. faith\\" dichotomy is a silly assumption in my opinion and the film seems to adopt it even though it doesn't carry that very far.  Picking a fundamentalist evangelical as a foil for a pro-science/anti-religion posture is too easy.  This is lazy, \\"pop\\" philosophy but the writers never intended to wade deep into these issues.  The film is meant to be light and not heavy.      This is a light comedy from Hollywood.  It is not a serious treatment of Christianity, atheism or any such topics.  Enjoy the ride for what it is.  Why moan about it not being something it never pretended to be?  Almost everyone will enjoy this one.  It's one I'm glad to have purchased.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Well I blew about a hundered bucks. Besides the things Lucas added (AGAIN), these blu rays really stink. I watched episodes three, four, five and six and they all have audio issues. That being there are several and I do mean several moments that the audio is muted, very annoying. If you have the DVDs just stick to them. There's not enough increased quality here to make it worth the annoyance. And you watch, ol' George will find ways to fix these and add more nonsense. But the bit when Vader throws the emperor off the platform is horrible. He never yelled &#34;No! NOOOOOO!&#34; before and I hate it.
B0055S348W|5.0|love that I can print pretty much anything from my phone over my wireless printer. i bought this app on the other market when I first bought my droid x. it had some issues printing email documents at first but was fixed with updates. not sure what version this is but imagine it should be fairly recent. the 13 bucks seems rather high, under nine is decent, free is great. I'm really surprised Amazon put this one up for a free app. usually it's some lame game where you match three stupid things that are the same color.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|From the beginning, Martin's style of writing hooked me. His ability to write an epic story is apparent from the first paragraph. The book is told from multiple points of view, always in third person limited. The name of each chapter, or section, is the character whose point of view we are reading.<br /><br />Martin does an amazing job with world building in the prologue and first few chapters. The reader is then introduced to a family of lords, which much of the book revolves around. The main plot involves the king asking a grand favor of Lord Eddard Stark, they are old friends and have not seen each other in years. Stark's decision to follow, or not, begins the story. The repercussions of each decision and how they lead to other plot elements is astounding. Much of the story then revolves around Stark's children, and their own personal stories. There are more characters introduced throughout, but their true role in the story is not known to the reader.<br /><br />The book has an abundance of political intrigues, mixed with some fantasy elements, new forged friendships, betrayal, and death. The depth of character development is stunning, and it is easy to find oneself being drawn into their individual stories.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones was written beautifully, with a great plot, and multiple sub-plots, but the it felt like a set up for the series, as if it were a prologue in and of itself. Though it was written as part of a series, I would have liked to see a bigger climax, something epic you could say.<br /><br />The only other negative was that the fantastic elements were rare. There are some in the beginning, sprinkled throughout the middle, then more at the end. As a fantasy, I assumed there would be more. As I stated before, it read like one long prologue, so I am hoping for more on the fantastic side throughout the rest of the series.<br /><br />Based on the lack of fantasy elements, and the not so epic ending, I was going to give it three of five stars. However, his beautiful writing style, and his ability to tell an epic story make it easy to give four of five stars.<br /><br />Get ready to dig in for a great read and be aware of the sub-plots.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|The zombie infection is more contagious than even the staunches fan might realize.  For the past several days, and this week in particular, I've done my part to spread the infection.  My friends, coworkers, and casual acquaintances were unable to protect themselves.  My anticipation in regards to the AMC premiere of The Walking Dead has rippled through my social circles.  This has almost been like a study on seeing how a zombie outbreak might overwhelm society.<br /><br />Credit AMC for a brilliant promotional campaign complete with screaming crawlers and even the occasional Emergence Alert screen. The way they kept the initial commercials short, showing larger glimpses as the premiere neared, was a lesson on how to pull off an excellent teaser.<br /><br />Now, I must confess that there has been a layering sense of concern.  After all, I was a huge fan of the Terry Goodkind fantasy epic The Sword of Truth.  The only thing the televised version of that series got right was the casting.  The program itself had no resemblance to the books other than the names of the central characters.  In the lead-up to the premiere of the Walking Dead I went into it almost like a jilted lover.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, I have recently been likened to a kid waiting for Christmas.  My non-zombie-loving friends (gasp! Does such a creature exist?) could not help but be caught up in my enthusiasm.  Before long they were pulling me up and asking me questions. Truth be told I have never been so grateful that AMC has built a loyal following with Madmen and Breaking Bad.  Their reputation for quality has already been established.<br /><br />A few even warmed up with the IFC showing of Dead Set.  That was sort of like giving steak to an infant, but the British mini-series actually converted a few and amped their anticipation for the Walking Dead.<br /><br />Most of you are familiar with the story and the characters.  If not, I recommend picking up the graphic novels.  (feel free to peruse the reviews of The Walking Dead 1-12 posted right here at BuyZombie.com.)  what I want to talk about is how this adaptation looked...felt...sounded...adhered.  Should the fans who've waited commit to this? Should those new to this amazing graphic novel series open their eyes to what will be the newest BIG THING in horror?<br /><br />The answer is most assuredly yes.<br /><br />Congratulations (and a huge thank you) goes to Frank Darabont for not only giving us a faithful adaptation--so far--but added a depth to the characters that further put flesh on the bones to a great story.  Not only did he do a superb job in adapting Robert Kirkman's story, you can actually see what he reproduced some of Charlie Adlard picture panels to perfection.<br /><br />Of course a lot has to be said about the cast.  Andrew Lincoln sheds his European accent for a very believable Rick Grimes from Georgia.  Jon Bernthal is so likeable that I feel sorry that he is cast as Shane Walsh, Rick's friend and partner.<br /><br />We can't talk about a zombie story without mentioning the visceral factor...the blood and gore.  I think that they (the SFX and production team) set the tone right away in the opening scene.  All I need to say is: a little nine- or ten-year-old girl with a teddy bear.  YIKES!<br /><br />Kudos to Darabont and AMC.  The Walking Dead is going to be a hit.  It is going to bring the entire zombie genre to the next level.  Set your DVR, or better yet invite your friends over on Sunday night (who cares if it is on at 10:00 pm.) and make this the event that it deserves to be.<br />The Walking Dead Part 2<br />Episode 2 of AMC's brand new mega-hit, The Walking Dead, had a lot of pressure riding on it.  The first episode was so well received that it had water-coolers buzzing and even a Monday morning mention from Atlanta based CNN.  As a zombie fan, I'm sure I wasn't the only one fielding questions last week by those that got a first taste of our passion.  (I use that word collectively, why else would you be cruising this site?)<br /><br />Tonight was the first time we got to see how Frank Darabont would' flesh out' the story a bit.  He gave us some familiar faces in strange places.  Readers of the series know that Rick was rescued by Glenn and Glenn alone (also there was no tank.)  Andria was introduced in Atlanta and is already displaying the badass female character we have come to love.  The biggest divergence is Merle Dixon's introduction.  I liked it because it made me hate Dixon right away instead of wondering about him.  Michael Rooker did a fantastic casting choice.<br /><br />Rick's rescue is much more of an event--taking up all of episode 2--and as a fan of the graphic novel, I think I'm okay with it. Getting a glimpse of some of the characters at the base camp as well as part of the group encountered in Atlanta gave me a better understanding of the characters and how they will be used in the series.  Obviously, if this went exactly by the book, it would burn through the material much too fast.<br /><br />One of the side effects of the series as it is currently unfolding is my increased dislike in the character of Lori.  Sara Wayne Callies is fantastic at making me dislike her for no real reason.  Meanwhile, Steven Yeun amps the likeability factor of Glenn exponentially with every scene.<br /><br />Here my complaint.  The zombie climbing the fence?  Not so much.  Also...are they fast or slow?  I can't tell.  Granted, they don't sprint a la 28 days later, but they do get moving in a hurry when they see something they like.  I half expected the zombie from episode one that got off the bus and later saw Rick on the tank to recognize them during the escape.  The series seemed to tread a fine line with its zombie continuity in episode two.<br /><br />Enough can still not be said about the effects being used in this made-for-tv series.  So far it's enjoyable to watch but I will be waiting to see if Darabont blinks when he has to off the first of his cast that people are getting to know and love.  Readers of the series are very familiar with the fact that Robert Kirkman has no qualms with taking out a character or two every so often.  We all know some of the casualties looming on the horizon.<br /><br />Overall the episode was satisfying.  I did get elbowed in the ribs once or twice and asked by my friends \\"can you really smear yourself with zombie guts and get away?\\"  In Kirkman's world the answer is yes and I remember how clever it was when I read it in episode one of the graphic novel.<br /><br />The Walking Dead Part 3<br />The worst part about writing these reviews for the hit AMC series, The Walking Dead, is that on the first showing I have to take notes and jot down ideas.  This keeps me from actually watching the program for the sheer enjoyment factor.  I have to save that for one of the replays.  But...enough of my meaningless complaints.<br /><br />So, we start getting a better look at some of the supporting cast in this episode.  We've met Glen and Andria,  and of course there is the very likeable (?) Shane, and Rick's family: wife Lori and son carl.  This is all about getting a taste of Dale, the adorable Amy, and the \\"charming\\" Daryl Dixon.  That first group of names are people that we the people already know and have our minds made up on.  And then there are the \\"strangers\\" (i.e. Daryl, T-Dog and some of the bodies running around in the background).  Like former fave LOST, these look like potential cannon fodder as well as bodies to fill out the scenery.<br /><br />With the rescue mission of the eldest Dixon brother being coupled with the original `gun run' from the graphic novel, we get our first glimpse of hero-complex that will come to define Rick Grimes.  What must be commented on and complimented on is how well all of this is being dovetailed and layered in the opening episodes.<br /><br />Each of the actors and actresses being used in this story are proving to mesh wonderfully.There is a lot being done with body language and facial expressions in the scenes and in the background.  Despite any of the credits that these people have piled up, the only familiar face for me was Shane (Jon Bernthal).<br /><br />So now everything is in place.  The normally tedious character introductions have been handled masterfully and are basically over as we hit the half way point in this six-episode season.  (We can only hope that the success of this series will bring a longer season WHEN it returns.)<br /><br />Of course, now is when the questions start to build for many of the fans who have read the series.  They're sitting right there on the tips of our tongues, and as we sit next to those unfamiliar to the story, we struggle to hold back and reveal nothing.  It is now that we must take that leap of faith and trust that Mr Darabont and company will keep to the structure of the story while continuing to add to the depth that makes this feel almost like we're getting bonus material in a re-release of volume one, Days Gone Bye.<br /><br />As of now, I am left with one raised eyebrow over a single line spoken by Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) \\"You were the one that told me that he died.\\" And despite what we know about the future story line as originally written, I cant be the only one who truly enjoyed Shane's beat-down of Ed.  Doesn't that earn him at least a few Redemption Points?<br />Episode three of AMC's The Walking Dead earns an Early Release for more and continued character development as well as a cast that does not have a single weak link.<br /><br />The Walking Dead episode 4<br /><br />Doubtless, you know by now, that AMC has renewed The Walking Dead for a second season.  I urge everyone to email them with praise and words of thanks.  Even better news, we'll get thirteen episodes instead of six.  Now...on to the show.<br /><br />Loss.  A very common theme in the zombie genre.  What didn't we say when we had the chance?  Why didn't we appreciate this or that until it was too late?  We now get some very real taste of that from many of the characters -both major and supporting--in the Walking Dead's fourth episode.  It ads some excellent depth, and ties us as viewers to the story in a way that the splatter fests that past themselves off as zombie fiction often fall short.<br /><br />However, this episode is the first to really raise some of those Legend of the Seeker flags.  The senior citizens...thugs with hearts of gold...brave granny.  All nice touches but Kirkman's story already has plenty of depth as well as material.  Ever since episode one, this story has edged farther and farther away from the original.  And this time, it felt like somebody grabbed the wheel and yanked it.  With only 2 episodes left, the Walking Dead seems to be walking a fine line where it risks loosing its core...the fans of the graphic novel.<br /><br />Of course, as soon as I started getting that sinking feeling...the campsite massacre happens.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the brutal and violent endings of Amy, Ed, and a bunch of faces in the crowd save the day.  As those characters bit the big one(forgive the expression) the ship was suddenly righted once more.  One hundred and forty seven seconds.  That is how long it took to put everything back on track.  All is tight in the Walking Dead world.<br /><br />Now that all of the serious stuff is out of my system, did Glenn have the best line in this episode or what.  After laying out a very well designed plan to retrieve the gun bag, Daryl asked \\"hey,  kid, what did you do before this?\\"  Glenn's answer was: \\"delivered pizza.  Why?\\"<br /><br />Daryl's insistence in rescuing Glenn, who he'd earlier referred to as a Chinaman when Glenn is in fact a Korean, offers up a subtle but yet deeper glimpse at a person who, up to this point, could easily be dismissed as a typical red neck racist.  It will be interesting to see how his role develops within the group.  Also, with the loss of Amy, I think it is safe for fans to assume that lives will not be spared in typical Hollywood fashion.  (also this event is a major catalyst for Andria -one of my favorite characters in the graphic novel--who begins to unfold as someone far more complex than we've seen so far.<br /><br />In an episode that began to scare me in a way that had nothing to do with the content, I am thrilled to see that the story line is back on track in the best hour of the series so far.<br /><br />Walking Dead Episode 5<br /><br />There have been some grumblings out there about AMC's newest hit, The Walking Dead.  Having read a multitude of interviews, I was already prepared for some story stretching and deviations from the original plot.  However, this doesn't seem to be the gripe.  Apparently if there isn't a disembowelment or a zombie getting its head blown off in every scene, some folks aren't happy.  Heaven forbid there be actual character depth and story content.  My guess is that these complaints are coming from the same people who mumble, \\"braaains!\\" when they think they are imitating a zombie.  Those same people completely miss the idea that if the first wave of zombies ate their victims brains, then there wouldn't be any new zombies.  Anyways, enough ranting...onto episode 5.<br /><br />This episode went a long way to leave an impression in regards to the individual characters in the story.  I believe that this sort of cinema is exactly what the zombie genre needs to be taken seriously.  Great stories can overcome the stereotype, and the walking dead is proof.  How many rehash versions of Romero's Dawn of the Dead do we need? In Episode 5, we now have very real people, full of flaws.  They're individuals that we can identify with, understand, or dislike.  How many of us have fantasized about the zombie apocalypse? What sort of super powers or McGiver like abilities do we bestow upon ourselves during these musing?  The beauty of what Darabont did here in pulling Kirkman's characters out of a two-dimensional medium and giving them 3 dimensional depth needs to be applauded in this episode.<br /><br />With one installment to go, we now have a group of people that aren't merely faces on the screen.  How many of you are still fans of Shane now?  I for one am absolutely NOT disappointed in season one.  (Other than it only being 6 episodes).  We now have proof that the zombie can be main-stream.  Even better, unlike vampires, there's no need to make things pretty.<br /><br />Fans of all things zombie should rejoice. We are no longer second rate citizens in the world of horror.  And, while some will doggedly resist this movement by cleaning to B grade standards and stereotypes and being more impressed by body count and blood splatter than by character and content we will embrace what can only be called an upgrade.<br /><br />As a final note, if somebody knows the composer responsible for the soundtrack of this show, I would love to know who it is.<br /><br />Walking Dead episode 6<br /><br />It is almost bittersweet. AMC's the Walking Dead has completed its sixth episode run. For the most part, it has won over the hearts of many, while also bringing fresh blood to the ranks of those who are now fan to the zombie genre.<br /><br />The fact that this episode spun away from the original storyline and embarked on a tangent unique to the television version, certainly had me curious as to the direction this finale would take.  There is a certain smug self-satisfaction to be had when watching the program with foreknowledge of what will occur.  Sitting next to someone who is commenting on what a `hottie' the character of Amy is while knowing she is destined for an unhappy ending is fun.  But like many fans of the graphic novel series, I had no idea what the hell was going to happen tonight.<br /><br />Loveable Shane is now the ultimate heel.  In a span of the first fifteen minutes.  But...we know what he saw at the hospital and he is still a tragic hero...untilhe tries to force himself on his partner and so-called best friend's wife.<br /><br />Next, we get one of the most in-depth explanations of the question we always ask, but never expect an answer to.  Once again we don't actually get a `why', but we do get a bit of a `what'; as in, \\"what is this?\\"  the demonstration on the giant monitor of Test Subject #19 gives us something.  For many (like myself) that whole segment was almost unnecessary.  For folks getting their first taste...I'm sure it was fascinating.<br /><br />As far as the CDC arc of this story, I guess if they weren't certain that the series would be picked up (AMC is still a business after all) there had to be a decision going into production on how to wrap up this series on such a short run.  Doing this leaves an opening to return to the original story.  It strayed before and as we saw in episode 4, Derabont and company can be back on track in a matter of seconds.<br /><br />What we got in the final segment was the bonding of Dale and Andria, the death of another `extra' character (Jacqui) and the deepening of the wedge between Rich and Shane.  We even got a whispered secret from the doomed doctor Jenner just before Rick and his people depart (my guess is that the blood test results on his pregnant wife).  There is a conclusion of sorts, and a pretty explosion, but of course we all know that there is plenty of story to tell.<br /><br />This series will be a hit for seasons to come.  (Which begs the question, how are they going to keep Carl young unless they've hired an actor that carries the Gary Coleman-Webster gene?)  It uses the zombies in small doses instead of relying on them as a crutch.  This is not a B thriller or a cheap series, it is a STORY.  I said it in my series of reviews about the Kirkman graphic novel series, and I will repeat it here:  the zombie genre has a new king.  All hail the King.us as viewers to the story in a way that the splatter fests that past themselves off as zombie fiction often fall short.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|So long as George Lucas refuses to release the original cuts of Star Wars, I will not watch it.  Lucas was once a visionary director, but has shown himself to be a talentless hack.  Rather than create something new, he punishes his once-loyal fans with clumsy, childish re-cuts.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The prequels were just bad so the only redeeming quality to this set *should* be the originals.  Unfortunately, these are *not* the originals we all know and love.  Is there any further doubt that Lucas has lost whatever talent he once had?  The CG is poor, the newly added audio is laughable and Vader saying, \\"noooo\\" all the time is just ridiculous.      Unbelievable that people defend Lucas for this garbage.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I have been using it with a 23\\" Samsung monitor for over a year, and I am very happy with it. It is extremely adjustable and sturdy. I tilt the monitor for web shopping, and for working on some large portrait type documents, and its great. I installed this mount as far as I could from the monitor, so it appears to be suspended over my desk which is nice, and  it frees a lot of space compared to the original monitor base. Once you tighten the screws at the right torque, it never requires more adjustments. The only thing I don't like is the cord clip system, because it doesn't keep cables in place, but that can be easily solved with small nylon ties. This mount is great for the money.

1594744769|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  I bought this for my 11-year old daughter and I to read together, and we both enjoyed it tremendously.  It is so different from anything we've read recently.  There's time-travel, history, love, dangerous creatures, and interesting family dynamics all woven into this story.  Not to mention some really fantastic \\"pictures\\" of the peculiar children in the book.  It's well written from the point of view of a teenage boy.  This book can easily be read by young adults (there's no sexual situations in this book, so younger advanced readers can read this as well) or also by grown ups- this book would appeal to many.  I highly recommend this book, and now I'm on the hunt for more books like this, and I can't wait until Ransom Riggs writes his next book.

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is deservedly a best seller. Taking a fresh look at the lives of ordinary German people during the Second World War, the narrative focuses around Liesel Meminger, a young girl who loses her mother and brother to the newly risen power of the Nazis. Too young at that point to understand why this happened, backward in her school studies, she nevertheless picks up a book during the burial of her brother - her first book theft. she journeys through her new life, and we see her grow and develop through the tender love of her foster father and the harsher love of her foster mother.     The characters in this book are what make it so great. Each character is sensitively drawn and able to surprise you. You will fall in love with these people. Broken and flawed people, yes - but people just like you and me.     But the most unusual character in the book is the narrator - death. Having death as a narrator will keep you wondering and fearful. That cannot be good, can it?     I am still a little dubious about the device of using death as a narrator, but it clearly allowed the author to deal sensitively with some big and disturbing issues.     All in all this is a tremendous book. Better, I think, than \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" which suffered a little from having a protagonist who was just a little too innocent and clueless to be entirely plausible. Liesel is someone who you can believe in and come to love through the story. The same can be said of the other people in this book. A highly recommended read.
0596009208|5.0|I love this book. I am a total noob at Java and I'm trying to move into the Android App Development field. You gotta know java first. Well this book is excellent. Not only do they accommodate for multiple learning styles, but the chapters and flow of the book builds upon each other chapter, with exercises at the end of each chapter to get your brain pumping. Plus you build a few awesome projects on the way (battleship!). I can't say enough awesome stuff about this book other than I'm buying the Head First Android Development when it comes out.<br /><br />If you're serious about learning Java, then buy this book and you will not be disappointed.

It is Newbery medal winner, a book that we know from the author's comments, was very well received - beyond anything she had experienced before, and thus I was expecting something exceptional. What I read was a story that had some flaws, and set me thinking, but was no more profound than Nicholas Fisk, Robert Westall (albeit himself a Carnegie medal winner) or other such authors. This was a very good book - just not exceptional.     Before I get picky, I would point out I would still like to recommend this book to older young adult readers.     But what did I not like? Well the world itself seems to lack explanation. We can understand perhaps why the world would seek to homogonise itself to reduce difference and relieve the suffering of difference and choice. But if we run with that premise, it is not clear why we would choose not to see colour. It is not really clear why we would choose to create the life we are shown. There is no hint, even, of some major event that caused people to react by turning themselves into automata. Personally I much preferred Orson Scott Card's \\"homecoming\\" series and also his \\"Worthing Saga\\", both of which explore this idea much more completely, and for my money, would be better and more thought provoking stories than this one.     But this is a childrens or young adult book, and space is limited, so we can excuse much of this perhaps. We also must excuse the lack of explanation of what is happening with memories. Why are memories never lost? what is the mechanism for the passing of memory? We don't know but just take it on trust that this is now how the world works.     Some people will not mind these gaps one bit, and for them this will be a five star book. For me though, I felt there were better renditions of the same story, although I still certainly enjoyed this one.
0307346617|4.0|But I have to say that Max Brooks did a fantastic job turning page after page of \\"interviews\\" into something that flowed just like a \\"regular\\" novel.  Well written, fun, occasionally funny and definitely dark subject matter.  Check it out!
0786838655|5.0|A brilliantly imagined series that will entertain readers, and indeed educate them somewhat. This was a grand adventure in which Percy Jackson discovers he is far from ordinary. In fact he is the son of a Greek god. Not just any god either - one of the big three! And with he discovery comes responsibility and adventure and much unfairness. Accused of a theft, he must use his wits, his talents and his friendships to battle through and prevent a catastrophe of epic proportions - a potential war of the gods.     This book is undoubtedly worth reading. It is a wonderful adventure, although at times I felt plot elements and explanations were contrived. It is a funny book too. Not as hilariously tongue in cheek as Harry Potter of Angie Sage's Magyk, but it certainly has something in common with these books.     This was not the greatest book I ever read but it was a good enjoyable read that kept me coming back for more, and I will certainly be buying the next in the series.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Dear mister Lucas. I am wondering if you would come to our home this Thanksgiving and butcher our turkeys, like you butchered this. What a disappointment, after waiting so long for the Blue Ray version. Just one question. Why ? Mr Lucas, please remember the old saying for future projects like this. If it aint broken, don't fix it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Sorry George, you have taken what was a masterpiece and ruined it.  We all knew the movies where not perfect, the effects where dated and the dialog cheesey at times.  But we that was all part of the charm and what made it special.  But even now you can't stop playing with a classic, I am going to save my money and not buy this travesty.  And to fish a quote from George himself    \\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.  I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.    The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.    A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.  People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.    These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.    In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.\\"    There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.    I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.  I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.    The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.    There are those who say American law is sufficient. That's an outrage! It's not sufficient! If it were sufficient, why would I be here? Why would John Houston have been so studiously ignored when he protested the colorization of \\"The Maltese Falcon?\\" Why are films cut up and butchered?    Attention should be paid to this question of our soul, and not simply to accounting procedures. Attention should be paid to the interest of those who are yet unborn, who should be able to see this generation as it saw itself, and the past generation as it saw itself.    I hope you have the courage to lead America in acknowledging the importance of American art to the human race, and accord the proper protection for the creators of that art--
1933952806|5.0|As a professional photographer I am always looking for those 'extra insights' into the world of light and Darrell Young provides a path for the reader to get the most out of their Nikon D7000.  His mastery of the context and vision of the subject matter leads the reader chapter by chapter into every aspect of the digital technology which is built into this camera.  Well written and illustrated I would highly recommend this book to anyone seeking mastery of their photographic skills.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|While slow to start, Ms Collins does a wonderful job vesting your interest into the main characters. The game itself, while brutal, provides the reader with enough action to make it exciting and thought provoking... and provides the characters with enough political angst to keep the sappiness of their interactions at bay.  Book two was equally exciting and compelling with the interesting twist to the 75th game...    While I found the thrid book to be a bit useless and dragging compared to the previous two... and sadly somewhat predictable, it was entertaining enough.  Overall a great fast read!
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I was really pleased with this version of Jane Eyre. I am very particular about books made into movies. I'm not a fan of directors putting their own spin on things. However, this version was very well done.Everything in the film from the acting to the settings to costumes down to the last detail, gave the very image that Bronte evokes in her book. While not every scene is true to Bronte's work, the film is seamless and believable. The cast was very well picked. The music was perfect. I enjoyed watching it very much and am looking forward to watching it again. I would definitely recommend it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's funny reading these bad reviews from people. Most claim they don't like episodes 1-3. So why did you buy this set? There are 3 versions. Episodes 1-3, Episodes 4-6, and this set that has them all. So if you're a prequel hater, why did you buy the set that has the prequels? I would not trust reviews of people who say they hate the prequels but bought this set, then gave it a bad review. They are most likely liars. As far as the added stuff, big deal. So Vader says no, big woop. No reason not to watch my favorite movie in spectacular HD with excellent sound. Everyone who bought this set knew in advance of the changes and bought it anyway. So stop bashing and go enjoy the movies.
0385528752|5.0|Switch grabbed my attention and held it throughout.  Unlike any other book on Change it is neither preachy nor penned like a learning manual.  It is jammed packed with powerful stories of remarkable people who achieved dramatic change with minimum authority.  This book is well structured and written and for both change practitioners and those who care about creating a better world.  The book contains practical and powerful change techniques.  Well researched and by far one of the best books on change I read to date.[[ASIN:0385528752 Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard]
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie in 3D - beautiful and colorful effects, nice actors play and nice plot.  I am glad I have this movie in my collection.
B0055S348W|5.0|The app was able to find my printer and download the drivers. It even downloaded a PDF viewer. Awesome little app.
B005IDABFI|5.0|This album is remastered and it is also one of the first ablums of Bob Segers collection to finally be downloadable. I am very greatful of Bob Seger to start releasing his albums in mp3 format. As for the review of this album, it is practically the same album with one extra song to it, which is a great addition. The sound quality hands down is just amazing with how old the album is. I am very glad Bob Seger is remastering his music because it was recorded some time ago and it needs attention. I highly recommend this album to any Bob Seger fan even if they have the orignal ablum.
B0058A119G|5.0|The 2cds Deluxe Edition is just Amazing,Barbra does everything great & these are all   wonderful songs written by this very clever couple.love it !!!!!!!!Jennifer.

034552554X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  Great story line and kept me wanting more.  I especially loved the mother daughter theme that was prominent through the novel.  It isn't always easy to have a perfect mother daughter relationship, but in the end it is sometimes just what you need.
B0055S348W|5.0|I was printing from my Droid Incredible in 30 seconds from download. This is one of the best free apps Amazon has offered. Don't wait, download today!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Why? Because it wasn't out. You took in officially news, personal bias, and internet b.s. and rated a product before it was out. Supposedly, it's something you \\"love\\", which I highly doubt. I've never been more ashamed of being a Star Wars fan, than when I have seen the behavior of some before the release of this set.     The movies are there, and there are changes. Get over it. It's first and foremost George's movie to tinker with. It's not like he has ordered all previous copies burnt. You have yours, I have mine. I think I speak for EVERYONE when I think the originals deserve to be blu-rayed, but that's another topic. The movies look, and sound great...and guess what? They're even better than before. The OT deleted scenes are fantastic, the PT is mostly animatics and they suck to be quite honest. The previous DVD deleted scenes are noticeably absent.    The Holiday Special is on this. Yeah. It's a cookie. A very weird, awkward cookie that I'm not even going to bother saying more on.    Honestly, blu-ray players aren't that expensive anymore, and either is this set. Buy it, love it, and be a grateful fan. A few hundred of you \\"boycotting\\" this set isn't going to make a difference seeing as these movies were mad for the masses, not just us hardcore fans.
B0055S348W|4.0|Seem well-written and polished, but one huge problem (for me, at least) : it won't let you change your Google account. I use both a personal Gmail / GDocs account and a business Google Apps account. If I could just type in the business account credentials somewhere instead of the app defaulting to the one registered on the phone, this would be perfect. I probably won't use this much (don't want to reset my phone just to print from Docs easily), but it still looks like a great app, if only for personal account use. would give 5 stars+ if a setting was added in the future! good job, devs, and good job AotD!

B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is a fantastic tower defence game that occupied my time for countless hours.  The graphics are superb and there are tons of very unique levels.  Just finally beat the 35 level campaign after a month of fairly consistent playing.  Lots of different types of zombies/mutants and towers/guns to take them down.  I highly recommend this game.
1596432594|5.0|Jim Ottaviani has introduced Richard Feynman to a general audience in an enjoyable and factual graphic novel. As with his other books, Jim succeeds in making both the scientist and the science interesting and approachable. His portrayal of Feynman is accurate and detailed, the story interesting and the use of the graphic novel format is used to extremely good effect. For anyone who learned to hate science because of the sterile manner in which it is taught in high schools and at the undergraduate level, read this book. It captures both the spirit of discovery and the life of a famous physicist. For those who are already familiar with Feynman, you will enjoy a telling of his life that shines a bright light on the scientist, the educator and the man.
B0054NQZ9S|3.0|In the movie \\"Boiler Room,\\" Ben Affleck plays a \\"senior\\" stockbroker who informs the newbies that, \\"I'm 27.   I'm a dinosaur.  Luckily, I'm very good at what I do.\\"  A decade later, he plays a thirty something who gets fired from his high powered salesman job and faces a bleak economy, along with colleagues Tommy Lee Jones and Chris Cooper.  Downsizing these days means moving in with your parents, having to dye your hair and quit smoking, and - the ultimate indignity, having your spouse start working more hours in order to make ends meet.  Luckily, for Affleck, he gets a job doing manual labor with his brother-in-law, played by Kevin Costner, who passes along a few Life Lessons, along with instructions on how to put up drywall.  Other movie characters aren't as fortunate.     In eighties' cinema, greed was good, or at least acceptable.  In the nineties, there were a spate of movies about yuppies getting blindsided by trauma and having to reevaluate their priorities.  In \\"Regarding Henry,\\" Harrison Ford plays a lawyer who becomes a better person by getting shot in the head and suffering brain damage.  He realizes that his colleagues are amoral sleazebags and takes his daughter out of boarding school.  It may have been good that Henry's daughter didn't want to attend in the first place because with Henry's newfound ethics, he probably wouldn't have a job much longer.  But the film didn't explore that.       Nowadays, even movie characters can't afford spontaneous job quitting.  This is a grim movie, with few answers to the current economic crisis.  The cast does a decent job, but you want to watch a film about downsizing liberally laced with black humor, try the remake of \\"Fun With Dick and Jane\\" with Jim Carrey and Alec Baldwin.
B002ZG98UA|1.0|I am a HUGE Resident Evil fan but these movies are getting worse and worse.  I cant believe someone produced this piece of garbage.  Half way through I was so bored.  The story is lame and hardly plausible even by zombie standards.  No cool weapons or fights, no sex, no fear.  Even if I was 13 I would think this movie sucked.  It deserves zero stars for this abortion of a movie.
030788743X|3.0|I'll paraphrase another review I read of this book - it's written in a style that will appeal to young adults, but is full of references only someone in their 30's or 40's will appreciate.  Consequently, one would assume the references would go over kid's heads and the underdeveloped prose style would bore or cheese out adults (I was a little cheesed out at times).  Somehow it seems this isn't the case given how many positive reviews the book has.  My mom reads young adult fiction, so maybe this just caters to a sub-demographic of adults who like books written for young adults.    It reads like a movie script.  The exposition caught my interest (I bought the book because I liked the first 3 chapters, offered for free) and develops the world somewhat, but after that - significant events seem to be resolved in a rush;  pivotal parts of the book sound like they're being paraphrased.  What should be exciting moments come and go without much consequence.    Reading this book felt like watching an action movie and I must admit I read the whole thing rather quickly because I wanted to see what happened next, but I can't help but feel like the author let me down a bit by hastily describing the latter half of the story.  I also feel a bit let down by a certain somebody who writes for a certain website, ahem*Mark Frauenfelder*boingboing.net*aslkdjf, oh, excuse me - wee bit of a cold, for claiming that this is the best science fiction book he's read in decade (which is why i picked it up in the first place).  Maybe he only reads 1 science fiction book a decade?? Or maybe the potent mix of a heavy dose of nostalgia with easy reading and a quick plot just happens to be the magic formula for some people.  Meh.  Read it as a TV substitute.
1904994679|1.0|When the GBWR was first published it was designed to help people settle wagers. It was well organized by topic and you could find something quickly. The versions the last couple of years have traded glitziness for utility. They are useless as a reference book. They do not even attempt to cover all the the GWRs. They are barely useful as a table top conversation piece. I shall not buy another edition again.
0446672653|5.0|I didnt read this book because i feel i am looking for a soul mate or want a soul mate.  I actually have had these feelings with another for many years and thought they were unique. Like when you look in someones eyes and feel like you know them sooooo well, this person is so familiar, and you love WHO they are, in the internal sense even though you \\"just met,\\" and when i read the first few pages through the internet of the intro of this book, i couldnt believe that the way the author described these soul mate feelings, was all of the feelings i have had before for this other person but thought noone could possibly imagine these feelings AT ALL. This book was very easy to read. I enjoyed the regression sessions, although, i thought it was going to be more interaction between the two subjects, where we can learn more about their current life in knowing eachother and how they feel about eachother and what they think about it, and then how their past lives played in these feelings that they DONT understand. It turned out that only maybe a page or two, total, was dedicated to their MEETING, FALLING IN LOVE, AND BEING TOGETHER FOREVER. Everything else in the book was basically all about their individual past lives, only maybe 2 of which they shared, and the rest of them, they spent alone, basically soul searching for the other throughout centuries.   BELOW I HAVE CATEGORIZED what i have learned from this book.     LIFE  Listen to your heart, to your own intuitive wisdom, when making important decisions, especially when deciding about a gift of destiny.  Destiny will deposit its gift, directly at your feet, but what you subsequently decide to do with that gift is up to you.  If you rely exclusively on the advice of others, you may make terrible mistakes.  Your heart knows what you need.  Other people have other agendas.   When your intuitions, your gut- feelings, your spiritual heart all know beyond any doubt, do not be swayed by the fear-based arguments of others.  Sometimes meaning well, and sometimes not, they might lead you far astray from your joy.   DREAMS  Dreams have many functions, they help to process and integrate the days events.  They provide clues, often in form of symbols and metaphors, that help solve the problems of everyday life--relationships, fears, work, emotions, illnesses, and much more. They can assist us in achieving our desires and goals, if not physically then at least in the form of wish fulfillment.  Dreams can be psychic or precognitive.  Often these particular dreams can predict the future.  Accuracy varies because the future appears to be a system of probabilities and inevitabilities.  Many people are shocked when their dream actually comes true, although this is experienced by many people. Sometimes you gain knowledge in  your dreams that can transform lives.               LOVE  The kingdom of God is within you. Dissolve your own anger and anxiety in love and forgiveness.  Love is the ultimate therapy.  Anger is foolish and eats at the soul.  Relationships are not measured in time but in lessons learned.   DEATH  Death is nothing more than walking through a door into another room.  We never lose our loved ones.  We keep coming back together and together again.  What a powerful reuniting energy love is.
B000067QMD|5.0|GO GREEN and store your breastmilk in your AVENT bottles.  Save time too!  I was using the milk bags, and other than what I freeze, I use the milk pumped at work from the previous day for the next day's milk at the daycare or at home with dad.  I was not being very eco friendly by using and wasting so many bags, not to mention the costs.  I didn't want to buy new bottles, and the bottles that came with my pump didn't fit in my bottle bag well.  These discs were exactly what I needed.  They are not available at BRU or at Target, the stores I frequent.  Thank you Amazon for carrying them!
1567184855|3.0|I read alot of books on souls, their journey's, reincarnation, and I guess i should have understood the fact that this book was not only meant to give you information but deliver the information to you, as stated, on the book, as \\"CASE STUDIES.\\" I found this book a little uninteresting and slightly difficult to follow because of the way it was written.  In each chapter it covered important information such as different TYPES of souls, and transition, being in harmony with your body and the feelings that come along if you arent. After life and why we come back and other people's journeys through regression. To me, this book didnt tell me anything really new, it sounds like any other book that talks about souls and gives you positive messages about God, and death, but the part that bothered me was that it read like a dialogue.  This is the 2nd book i have read like this, that reads like dialogue. The first one was many lives, many masters. I once again thought the book was OK, as everyone else seems to LOVVVVEE THAT BOOK, but it didnt do anything for me. Not only because of the dialogue format, but if you not only want to hear about their REGRESSION, but feel better and more comfortable with death, then that AND JOURNEY OF SOULS, arent the ones to read. Throughoutthe book, it would follow normal flow in paragraph form and tell you interesting facts, AND THEN, look like this \\"Dr.N: (what he said)\\" \\"S:\\" (S means Subject and what the subject said),down the whole page.  I feel like it breaks up the flow of the book for me.  I have to constantly stop and think, \\"wait, who was speaking again.\\" This book dragged for me. Infact, the only information that sounded like it would be interesting to read are the \\"TYPES OF SOULS.\\" (BEGINNER, IMTERMEDIATE, AND ADVANCED,\\" BUT even that was drowned out for me, because i had to constantly read a dialogue. I would get interested when the dialogue stopped and it would be like the information was flowing again, but then when the dialogue would start up again, i got bored. I never even made it to the chapter on Choosing a new body, but i was close. I had to force myself to read this book. I enjoyed \\"only Love is Real,by Brian Weiss,\\" much more. It incorprated all of the interesting facts about souls, and God's love, just like all the others, AND included case studies on 2 SUBJECTS and THEIR regression, but not in dialogue format, and how they came together, so it had a beginning, middle and bottom line. Nice flow and easier for me to follow. I dont really recommend this book, but if you are interested in something like it, i also read \\"Courageous souls, by Robert Schwartz,\\" which was a VERY inspiring book, about souls, and elevating your soul, and basically why we go through what we go through. The many reasons we all live to live.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I rarely write reviews. I got this movie thinking this is going to be your average chick flick. But I was wrong. Its both surprising and sweet. And watching it should remind everyone that you deserve to be happy. I'm sad for the ending. But it was big old dose of reality.

030788743X|5.0|The year is 2044 and the world as we know it as radically changed. With economic collapse, most people staying in their homes since that is where they go to school and work. Several years earlier, a geeky genius invented the OASIS, a simulated virtual reality. There are thousands of worlds in this simulation and with the addition of a special visor and gloves, the possibilities are endless. When the creator died, he left all of his billions to the winner of a special contest - a contest he created.<br /><br />That person must start with the riddle he gives at his will to begin the contest. From there, the contestant must unlock the quest, through several puzzles and gates. Five years have passed and no one has still achieved the first portion - achieving the copper key.<br /><br />The \\"sixers\\" are hired from a big corporation, IOA, working to look for this elusive \\"egg\\". IOA wants to win the billions and all of the power that will go with it. The 'grunters' are those that spend all of their waking moments learning all about the tycoon's life - needing any clue that they find, and trying to establish where that first key could be, ultimately leading to the egg.<br /><br />Wade Watts is a grunter who spends the majority of his days in the OASIS. He attends school online, and then works on his research to find that ultimate prize. He doesn't know what it really means to live in reality. Who would want to when the reality was so bad and you could live as whoever you want in the OASIS?<br /><br />Wade unlocks the first puzzle and his name is immediately on the scoreboard that has been empty for five years. He is immediately famous, but at what price does that fame come? Not long after going through the first gate, and working on the second, he is attacked in reality. Also, others are catching up with him on the scoreboard, and he finds himself falling in love with one of the players, Art3mis. She is determined to win just as much as he is, but it will be every man for himself when the challenge alights.<br /><br />There are so many pop-culture references, your head will either spin, or you will enjoy the trip down memory lane.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|This is hands down one of the most imminently listenable movies scores I've heard. It does have the feel of a score at many points, but the musicality and composition are so good that this never gets in the way of enjoying the score. It is emotionally moving in so many ways. Each song flows into the other, so I don't recommend just picking and choosing the songs. Pay the money to buy the whole thing. I first tried to buy just a few, but found myself frustrated because I wanted to know what was next when each song would \\"end\\". A lot of the songs are short, but because they move from one directly into the other in most cases, I don't even notice the length of some of them. I won't review every song, but here are my thoughts on many of them:    This is Berk starts out fairly slow, with the main theme softly playing, but it soon builds into a rousing song that perfectly captures the exciting beginning of the movie.     Dragon Battle is exactly what it sounds like. It's a great song that never strays too far into \\"movie score\\" territory, making it still enjoyable despite the lack of images.    Wounded is surreal, tense, and moving.     As other have noted, Forbidden Friendship is quite possibly the best track on the album. I can't get enough of this song. It builds and builds and then keeps building, and then when you feel like you'll burst it finally releases and soars.     This emotion is lead right into the next track, New Tail, which gives you somewhere to put all that anticipation and love that Forbidden Friendship built for you...     Which then leads directly to See You Tomorrow, which is fun, childlike joy, and puppy dog new love all wrapped up in a song.    Test Drive is possibly my second favorite song. Similar to New Tail, it uses more of the main theme and really pulls out the best of it, without overdoing it.     Romantic Flight is originally why I wanted to get this soundtrack.  I remember this piece from the movie, and it holds up just as well without themovie as I thought it would. It is romantic and powerful.     This song leads directly into Dragon's Den, and while it might seem like it would be a jarring contradiction it works really well. I have to give Powell credit for making a seamless transition between romance and danger. And even though it's another song that could only be found on a movie score, it also works just fine without the accompanying story.    Readying the Ships and Battling the Green Death also work without the film, but are clearly movie score songs. They are rousing, filled with danger, anticipation, and feelings of anxiousness.     Sticks and Stones is not a part of the score. I like the song, and it works with the score in a way that surprises me, but I'm not surprised that others have moved it out of the album on their iPod. I'm leaving it, but that's just because I really like the song, and I've got the soundtrack on repeat right now.    The Vikings Have Their Tea is amusing to me. It has a little bit of everything, but it plays up the daintiness of tea time at the beginning, which puts a hilarious image in my head.     tl;dr - There isn't one song on here that I skip over, which is unusual for me. There are songs that I keep going back to, though, more than the others. Overall, John Powell has perfectly fit all the emotion that this movie evokes into the soundtrack. He has matched the songs well to the movie, but made them listenable without having to watch the movie at the same time. This score is definitely going to be one of my all-time favorites.
B0055S348W|2.0|This program comes close to adding some useful functionality, but then fails.  You cant print to a standard tcp/ip port or smb share.  No enterprise IT group in their right mind is going to allow installation of a crappy 3rd party application on their print servers.  So, ultimately, it only works with Bluetooth and unlocked WiFi printers.  Not many of those to be found in most offices.  :(
0060558121|4.0|American Gods is a story of seemingly ordinary people that are actually gods in hiding. It's about the mundane and the fantastical. It's about modern, everyday life and how it defers mightily from the past, when the gods thrived on the belief and faith of the people.<br /><br />Now, there are even more gods than anyone knows what to do with. Some are from the past, but only shades of their former glory. The new gods are based around technology and modern sensibilities, which clashes with the simplicity of the gods that came before them. So, what must happen? A war of course.<br /><br />The only this book and the reason why, for me, it lost a single star is because of the ending. I won't spoil it, but it's conflicting. On one hand, it couldn't have ended any other way and on the other, it left me wanting something more. There was a slow build up, and to be sure parts of this book are definitely slow burns, to something that, in the end, was mildly underwhelming.<br /><br />Where this book shines is between the beginning chapters and the last few chapters. It's a journey, a road trip movie across the U.S. that isn't as filled with grand, god-like adventures as you might think. But still, wonderful characters populate the book and they get into some of the most interesting situations I've ever read. And the blending of mythology and modern-day storytelling is very well done. There's no doubt that Neil Gaiman is a highly talented writer and this may very well be his masterpiece.<br /><br />So, in short, the journey itself is a 5 out of 5, but as a whole, I had to take away one star simply because the ending was too sudden and, in some instances, unconvincing. But don't let that deter you, as it is one person's opinion. It's definitely a book that MUST be read, must be experienced, and regardless of how you feel about the ending, you'll be all the better for having read it.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was going to buy this Blu-Ray set until I found out about the further changes made to the movies. I'm thankful that these changes were made public before the Blu-Rays were released otherwise I would've spent a lot of money on something I really don't want.     My hope is that people refuse to buy this set or that it doesn't sell as well as Lucas thought it would so they understand that fans of the saga don't want this anymore. It's one thing to complain about it and something entirely different to stand up against him by not giving him anymore money.     Sure, some people will buy these blindly and not care about the changes, but if enough people don't buy it, then maybe it'll finally get through to him...    Then again... Maybe not.
0143112724|5.0|The Elements of Style is well written and well organized.  It is a truly valuable resource for anyone writing a paper, an article, a story, or a book.  This useful little book has no fluff, just information and examples that can help writers of any ability level.
B0001Z53F6|2.0|For the music, its great. A new take on a classic. If I had one complaint, it would be that Roger comes out of the surrounds too often when I want him to be in front, but that's not a big deal.    However, unless I am a clueless moron (possible), you can't pause or fast forward or rewind while listening. Somebody please correct me if there's a way to do it or its a problem with my remote or blu-ray player, but I could not pause, and I really wanted too.    I dock three stars for taking away my control.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Based on the reviews I've read, the Star Wars \\"fanatics\\" are less than thrilled with this collection. That recognized, I am NOT a fanatic, but merely a casual fan, and that said, this collection is simply AWESOME! Unreal video and audio fidelity. And going back to watch these in order is a great treat for lovers of superior storytelling. Don't be influenced by the less than stellar reviews. If you really don't care that much about the color of a lightsabre(!), then buy this today, crank up the volume, find a ccomfy spot on the couch and ENJOY!
B004YTGRMI|5.0|Mostly got this CD for the Demos. I have the original Life's Rich Pageant [import] from the 90s. I couldn't tell the difference between the remastered and that version. I also collected many import CDs/records from REM back in the day. Its nice to see that some of those songs made it back to an official CD release. The demos are of studio quality, alternate takes of the songs that made it on the original album. This is defintely worth to have for an REM fan, or any fan of 80s/90s alternate rock.
B005974CDU|5.0|My impression is that it is obvious the new \\"leader\\" of the band is Jordan Rudess, not only because the keyboards are the main voice in almost all songs, but also because you can see (hear) that all songs start with keyboards, and slowly ease into a more metal sound. There is no \\"punch-on-the-face\\" here from the get go. The songs are **VERY** complex from a musician's standpoint, and I see this as a positive thing. But I have to criticize the sound of the band in general, as it seems to have been thinned out a little bit, just because the drums don't have that heavy sound anymore. As a drummer and recording engineer I understand that are several factors that influence the drum sounds you get on tape, but I honestly believe that the snare drum has no depth, no meat, and it's placed all the way back there in the mix, sounding very acoustic / jazzy but with no crispness nor body. The kick drums sound really good, but that's about it. Mangini's cymbals are not up to the task, I believe the band would have had a fairly more aggressive sound with Paiste cymbals and perhaps Mangini just doesn't have the \\"punch\\" Portnoy has but believe me, Mangini is awesome and he knows what he's doing. I still give 5 stars because it's a complex album, extremely professional in its execution by the musicians. It would be a perfect album if the drums were more incorporated as part of the heaviness of the overall sound of the band.
B0013ISU0A|5.0|This album is OK. Haven't followed the band too much since their original drummer left. Got this CD, which includes a DVD/short movie. I like the single Supernatural Superserious.
0062060554|5.0|How scary it would be to wake up everyday not knowing who you are, where you are, or recognizing anyone around you!   This is Christine's life...the last memories are of a younger self and now she doesn't recognize the middle age face in the mirror.   Everyday, she has to trust Ben as he tells her who she in and what happened to her.    Before I Go To Sleep is a very intriguing psychological thriller.
B0018LMZOE|5.0|I've been a big fan of the fabulous Moody Blues since they reformed the band and brought in John Lodge and Justin Hayward all those many years ago. Their first six albums were 'concept albums'. Each song led into the next song. Each track contributed significantly to the concept; For example; \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\" or \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\". The whole album was meant to be played as one track (of course they understood that the album had to be flipped from side 1 to side 2, and they made allowances for that.). \\"Eyes of a Child (pt. 1)\\"/ \\"Floating\\"/ \\"Eyes of a Child pt. 2\\" for example really was not intended to be separated into three different tracks. Just listen to the album, and then listen to the obvious flaws on the compact disc. Anyone listening to the CDs without ever having listened to the original album(s) may come away thinking, \\"What a sloppy production!\\"     Of course I understand that these five guys were all individually 'a true genius', in that they all wrote songs that contributed to as Mike Pinder put it 'The Classic Seven' (the first seven lps). Though his last album with the group, \\"Octave\\" (#8) was no slouch either. I realize that for copyright purposes each track required some sort of separation from the previous, but with an album the technique would allow for a significant and important overlap but a CD does not allow for this. Still, they remain the greatest! Every track, a true gem! Why someone doesn't make an animated video for \\"Nice To Be Here\\", Ray Thomas's incredible tune from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\", I'll never know!

B003YFIUW8|5.0|The Room is written as a 5 year old boy named Jack. The only place he knows is an 11x11 room with a skylight for a window. He's Ma was abducted when she was 19 in college where this man name Old Nic took her and place her in the sound proof room.She had been there for 7 yrs.

0553386794|4.0|I picked up this book, flipped it open, and put it down some years ago, thinking it was not for me. I can only read fantasy and sci-fi that is masterfully written and mature. At first glance, I did not think this book made the grade. But out of curiosity I watched the first episode of the HBO special this year, and then had to read the book. Why? Because the richness and dark worldview was so intriguing. The women characters are as complex and morally questionable as the men, and generally smarter than the men. The maneuvering for honors, money, thrones, is so complex and interesting and not a whole lot different from the real world, except for that occasional hint of magic, zombies and the like.  This is a book for people who don't care if there are happy endings, who can tolerate moral ambiguity and who can handle reading about a society that is breathtakingly bloodthirsty but sadly not really all that different from our own. I loved the Stark family, was fascinated by the different cultures and the complex dynastic history woven into the story, and am a big fan of the Imp. I read this probably faster than I've ever read any 1000 page book except, I think, The Stand. However, this is book one of what are now five books that tell the story. I've read over 3500 pages, and am ready to read A Dance with Dragons, and I am not sure the story ends there. If I weren't a fast reader I probably would have pooped out by now. Unlike most Martin fans, I did not read the books as they all came out, but have read them all since April. I'm a bit weary.<br />Oh, this would get five stars if I didn't think the author needed someone to make him edit the book down.
B00122KW0I|5.0|Nine times out of ten as a film music collector, I latch onto the cheapest available edition, whether it's an $8 MP3 album or a $5 CD. But this being, in my opinion, the greatest film score from within my lifetime, I could never settle for less than \\"The Complete Recordings.\\" Howard Shore keeps his dashing, mesmerizing, epic, \\"Conan\\"-esque stylings while expanding the proceedings considerably from his previous two scores. He incorporates thematic material from both of the previous films-- Theoden's theme, the Shire theme, etc.-- fusing them together with eternities of new inspiration for a truly grand and unforgettable work. My favorite comes in the blossoming of a theme introduced briefly and quietly in \\"Fellowship of the Ring,\\" the heroic yet almost wistful horn-driven theme for the kingdom of Gondor and the \\"return of the king\\" in \\"The Lighting of the Beacons,\\" one of cinema's greatest scenes with one of its greatest cues to match. The sweep of the rushing strings at the beginning of the cue, joined by the proud grandeur of the low and high horns, building up to a thematic climax that simply inspires awe, and of course, it really conjures up the majestic, mobile mountain vistas shown during the scene. And, of course, Annie Lennox's \\"Into the West\\" is a genuine treasure. I absolutely loved Enya's \\"May It Be\\" from \\"Fellowship,\\" but I think \\"Into the West\\" will probably go down in Hollywood history as the most beautiful song ever written for a movie, deservedly so. I'm pretty young, so in my lifetime I haven't been able to see much on the big screen that inspired a whole lot of awe and emotional response. \\"Lord of the Rings\\" has, so far, been the only exception. And while I don't think Shore has ever otherwise scratched the surface of his demonstrated potential, this entire trilogy of scores stands out as one of the greatest and most monumental achievements in an art form that is simultaneously highly revered and too little recognized. And to say the finale doesn'tdisappoint is an almost criminal understatement.

0385534639|4.0|Two magicians, Celia and Marco, have been locked in competition since childhood.  Their venue is a mysterious circus that is open only at night.  Le Cirque des  Rêves is a magical world where enchantment and wonder can be found in every tent, seducing each visitor with unparalleled sights and sounds.  But first and foremost, the circus is a battlefield and a showcase for the talents of the two magicians, who create ever-greater spectacles limited only by their will and imagination.  As time goes by, Celia and Marco fall in love, but only one magician can win the contest.<br /><br />It's rare to find a book so rich in atmosphere.  Every description of Le Cirque makes it sound like the most wonderful, amazing, gothically-fabulous place in the world. The scent of popcorn in the air makes your mouth water; you can almost feel the cold of the glittering ice sculptures that never melt.  Because the book is written in the third person present, it really tries to draw you in and make you fee like you're experiencing the circus, watching every act and running your fingers over every surface.  And what a visual treat this circus would be!  I would give this book five stars for the wonderful, dream-like descriptions that made me imagine the circus so clearly.<br /><br />Trouble is, the characters aren't nearly as interesting.  The romance between Celia and Marco is developed over a great distance; Celia travels with the circus as a performer while Marco manages its paperwork in an office in London.  Since they rarely meet in person, their relationship - if you can even call it that! - hardly seems real.  Many of the side characters are interested, but we don't see much of them.  The plot is also fairly weak, and many of the questions I had about the circus and the magicians was never adequately explained.  For example, we're told that the circus is a 'unique' venue for the magicians' competition, but not why it's considered special.  Heck, little of the nature of the competition makes sense, and the final resolution of it was disappointing.<br /><br />If \\"The Night Circus\\" were a movie, I'm pretty sure Tim Burton would direct it, and it would be crazy-beautiful and slightly terrifying.  (I mean, can you imagine what he'd do with a black-and-white circus that pops up magically all around the world?)  It's such an enchanting idea.  And it's a very visual book.  I imagine it would appeal a great deal to fans of gothic fashion and steampunk pseudo-Victoriana.e, and the final resolution of it was disappointing.

0307948560|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and read it quickly because I couldn't put it down.  I can completely relate to the struggle women have with self fulfillment and the desire to care for their children at the same time.  I can also relate to the frustration that comes from trying to survive and excel within a male-oriented career system.  Without spoiling the story I would like to warn that this book is anti-male in many instances.  I don't hold that against the book because it was spot on with how many men are and what women go through as a result of being surrounded by men who are nothing better than pathetic,egotistical sperm donors.  That being said I think it is important as you read the book to keep in mind the caring, helpful, respectful men you know if you are blessed to know some, because this book can skew your vision of all men if you let it.  I am fortunate enough to have a husband who is awesome and totally supportive while still being manly so I know not all men are stupid jerks although many obviously are.  I like how this book unflinchingly faces key issues that so many women deal with and unlike some reviewers I do not feel that it fuels the working mom versus stay at home mom debate as much as it explores common viewpoints with honesty and humor.  I for one am convinced no women have it easy and I am in awe of all of us and the various important jobs we do both in the home and out.

B004WESFZW|4.0|Random review for The Adjustment Bureau & I have to say it's a pretty solid film released earlier this year directed by George Molfi he's been a producer mostly. Stars Matt Damon as David Norris, Emily Blunt as Elise, Anthony Mackie as Harry, John Slattery as Richardson & Terrance Smith as Thompson. Story starts off in 2006 a Congressman Congressman named David Norris is running for The Senate. Things come out about him when he was younger & it ultimately costs him The Election while he is preparing his ConcessionSpeech he meets a young lady named Elise. His speech is well received by his supporters & he goes off script even. About a month later David starts a new job & everybody is talking 2010 for another Senate  run. Then your introduced to a group known as The Adjustment Bureau. This guy named Harry is given a task to cause David to accidentally spill coffee on his shirt. Harry doesn't get to him in time. David he boards the bus & runs into Elise they start to talk & she gives him her number.  When he gets to the office he finds his Campaign Staff paused these S W     AT team looking guys he makes a run for it but he's caught & taken to some warehouse he learns about The Adjustment Bureau he wasn't suppose to see Elise he was suppose to spill coffee on his shirt go & change & miss the bus cause it's not ment to happen in the plan. He is told if you ever tell anybody about The Adjustment Bureau they will reset his mind meaning a lobotamy. You have Harry helping David on the side. So 3 years later David has been taking the same bus for 3 years hoping to see Elise again 1 day he sees her again & they reconnect. You find out that she is a ballet dancer. The Bureau tries to keep them away from each other. They mess with David when he tries to get to 1 of her recitals. They can go through doors that take them through different parts of NYC. Richardson discovers that David & Elise were meant to be together in his original plan. A guy named Thompson comes into the picture & tells him if he sticks with The Bureau's plan he will be President. He tells him if he stays with Elise he will ruin her chances of becoming a world famous dancer. These guys control the balance of what goes on in Government. Thompson uses his adjustment powers & causes Elise to fall. It sounds silly but I watch a lot of movies with ridiculous concepts & I love them. David is in fear for both of their futures so he abandons her at the hospital. 11 months later he is close to winning The Senate seat he finds out about Elise getting married Harry gives him a hat which allows them to go through doors & go any where they want in the city. David goes to the court house & finds Elise he tells her everything about The Bureau he tells her if you love me you'll go through the door which they end up in Yankee Stadium. They keep going through different doors until they end up on the roof \\"The Chairman\\" revises the plan & he lets David & Elise go on & live their life. I know I didn't do a good job explaning the plot I enjoyed this movie. George Nofli did a good job directing I believe this was his 1st time directing. Matt Damon I have said it A LOT I don't buy him as an action star but he is a great dramatic actor. He was great he got me involved & I cared about him & Emily Blunt I thought she was great. Anthony Mackie did a good job. John Slattery was good Terrance Smith wasn't bad. If you haven't seen The Adjustment Bureau check it out it definitely deserves all the praise.

B004EPYZP8|4.0|This is another random review for The Lincoln Lawyer released earlier this year. It got a lot of praise by the high brow crowd but I understand why they love this movie. It is making my favorite films of 2011. Directed by Brad Furman he directed The Lake.  Stars Matthew McConaughey as Mick Haller, Marisa Tomei as Maggie McPherson, William H Macy as Frank Levin, John Leguizamo as Val, Ryan Phillippe as Louis Roulet &  you have Country Singer Trace Adkins in there in for a small role as a leader of a biker gang. The story is you have a Defense Attorney Mick Haller he is defending this guy Louis Roulet. He & his friend Frank are going through the case on Roulet & he is talking to a previous client Jesus in prison. When he shows him a photo of Roulet he gets upset which Haller starts to believe that Jesus wasn't response for the murder of a woman. Haller has an ex wife Maggie who works as a Prosecutor she's never liked he has defended criminals. He also has a daughter. He only tells Frank what's really  going  down. Roulet breaks into Haller's house & threatens him & his family. The next morning he is told Frank has been killed. Later he finds his gun missing. He also got a voice message from Frank before he was killed. Haller goes through with The trial & go through with defending Roulet. Great back & forth between The Prosecution & The Defense. The Prosecution brings in a snitch from prison Haller makes them look like idots. Roulet gets off but is arrested for murder based on information that he got out of the prison snitch. Haller is given a gun by his driver when he gets home Maggie calls him & tells him that Roulet was set free Haller tells Maggie to get out of the house. He goes there waits for Roulet & I love this cene cause I don't really like Ryan Phillipe the biker gang lead by Trace Adkins beats Ryan Phillipe's a        s      s. Haller says \\"Hospital not the mourge boys!\\" When he gets home Roulet's mother broke into the house she confesses to murdering FrankLevin. She shoots him Haller takes his brand new gun shoots & kills her. Haller is released the next day from the hospital. The DA will seek the The Death Penalty against Roulet & Jesus was found innocent. Trace Adkins tells Haller 1 of our guys was found with drugs & they want a discount. He tells them he will do it for free. This was great movie good directing by Brad Furman. Matthew McConaughey    did a solid job. Marisa Tomei wasn't bad. Ryan Phillipe was ok. William H Macy does a good job for the small amount of time he was given. John Leguizamo is the but he isn't bad. Trace Adkins does a good job for what he has to do. It was nice to hear they guy who wrote the novel likes the movie. So not much bad to say about The Lincoln Lawyer solid film good directing capable cast.
0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a young man with a defiant attitude, a playful streak, and a wonderful talent for spinning a story.  This second installment of Kvothe's legendary exploits is one destined to become a favorite of those who enjoy a well-wrought tale.  Some parts were so good I had to stop, go back, and read them again.  The main character is a flawed hero, equally capable of daring feats of selfless bravery and uncommon mischief, but what sets him apart from so many others is his sense of justice, and how it is intertwined with his desperate need for the companionship of a woman who loves him not.  I have rarely encountered a character for whom I have alternately cheered and wanted to slap.  To write of one so afflicted is no mean feat, and if you've not read [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]], go buy it, read it, and then savor the joys of this book.<br /><br />One not to be missed, I only hope the third and final installment is published before I go into serious withdrawal.<br /><br />Buy this book.  You will not regret it for a second.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Received this in the mail today. Attaching it was easy, but everything after that was horrible. The Kinect could no longer track any features. The zoom ruins the main functions of the Kinect, and would have better off if the zoom had never been released.
B00004RJ71|4.0|From what I know this movie is one of the most accurate movies in depiction of prison life. Alot of men have lost there lives being convicts. life.  this movie is a great movie for the time and now.
B005J7K964|5.0|Yes, I'm reviewing a product before it's even released...    I first saw 'Metropolis' on video sourced from a low quality public domain 16mm print, with replaced intertitles and incoherent plot, in a university library in 1982. I was lucky enough to see Moroder's revision in Winnipeg when it was first released theatrically, and I was hooked.  Color tinting was used to establish mood or setting (a common practise in the silent era, so this was nothing new or blasphemous), subtitles replaced intertitles, an original score was supplied (essential to a silent presentation) that did not rely on previously composed music that may be familiar and therefore distracting, and while Moroder took some liberties with a few additions, such as: adding a moving skyline to the coliseum, embellishing Metropolis' Tower of Babel, and animating the living robot's eyes as it comes to life (to name a few), he did restore one thread long missing from the film - the triangle that was Joh Frederson, Rotwang, and their rivalry for Hel. It would not be properly realized again until the discovery, restoration and re-release of 'The Complete Metropolis'.    Moroder's 1984 release, as equally loved as it is loathed, may still be divisive some 27 years later, but it had a very important impact, by introducing a near-60-year-old silent movie to a whole new generation who wouldn't have given it a second thought, at a time when it could be bought for cheap as a public domain videocassette with unrelated stock music accompaniment.    Yes, I own both of Kino's restoration releases, but I look foward to adding Moroder's labor of love to my library.  It's just depressing to know that my out-of-print laserdisc copy will see its potential resale value drop from $250 to $10 once it's released, but that will be offset by the fact that the upcoming Blu-ray will look and sound so much better than the laserdsic ever could, which says a lot, since, until now, the Image/Vestron laserdisc was the best version to own of Moroder's cut.
B004K583KA|5.0|Grab this before the sellers change their minds about the price...<br /><br />Helmuth Rilling was the first person ever to record all the cantatas. He actually didn't set out with this in mind, but it sort of worked out that way. The whole thing took over 20 years to do, and the later performances were more informed by the growing knowledge of and interest in period performance. Nevertheless, these are played on modern instruments with a choir with female singers and using female soloists (including Arleen Auger, who sang in many of them). This, of course, will not appeal to folk who like \\"authentic\\" performance, but the fact of the matter is that we can never have truly authentic performance, and it's a delusion to think otherwise. In any case, I have always thought that Bach is music for eternity, to be played in the spirit in which it is written, and not confined to a musical straitjacket.<br /><br />Rilling was a great Bachian, and this set is outstandingly musical, an absolute joy. I personally regard some of these cantatas to be the best versions available anywhere - ones that come to mind are BWV129, BWV90 and BWV148. The others are also all splendid. They are different from my other sets (complete Gardiner and Leusink, and various Koopman, Suzuki, Werner and Harnoncourt), but every bit as enjoyable. And at this price they're a bargain. If I didn't already have them all, I'd snap this up. Go snapping.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|It's mildly funny, but unfortunately not too smart - like \\"Dogma\\", it's unable to get past brain-dead puns (Agent Zoil's first name, for example) and unintelligent cliched caricatures about creationists, who are somewhat - well, a lot - abused in this movie. Tellingly, the movie's only reply to their beliefs is \\"Paul is an alien and he says we evolved, so there - you guys are idiots!\\" I was hoping for a smarter, or at least funny argument. Sadly, all we get is the above, like Richard Dawkins' baseless insistence that he is right, yet refusing to debate the most compelling argument for intelligent design - irreducible complexity - because \\"I'm not an expert\\". You don't say!<br /><br />Paul, the all-knowing alien, seems completely unaware that some of the most famous believers in intelligent design were, in fact, atheists - distinguished scientists such Fred Hoyle and Allan Sandage (who later became a Christian) who, through their scientific work, found \\"everything here by chance\\" too anti-scientific and too puerile to believe. Hoyle's amazement at the evidence for design led him to conclude \\"A common-sense interpretation of the facts suggests that a superintellect has monkeyed with physics, as well as with chemistry and biology, and that there are no blind forces worth speaking about in nature. The numbers one calculates from the facts seem to me so overwhelming as to put this conclusion almost beyond question.\\" (Being an atheist, he theorized that life came from outer space.) Agnostics such as molecular biologist Michael Denton have similarly found evolutionism to be anti-scientific in nature, whereas former believers in evolution such as Michael Behe have instead found evidence for a Designer in their study of life at the molecular level. Lifelong atheist philosopher Antony Flew is another: [[ASIN:0061335304 There Is a God: How the World's Most Notorious Atheist Changed His Mind]]<br /><br />However, those who thought Dogma was \\"smart\\" will probably not even be cognizant of the above issues. They will scratch their heads, gigglingly vote Not Helpful, and move on. So much for Questioning Authority and being an independent thinker :)<br /><br />Apparently, the movie also thinks that believing in evolution will result in obsession with sex and profanity. And marijuana. Perhaps they are right, I don't know. Strangely, they didn't mention another result - war, torture, imprisonment, and mass murder to the tune of 120 million (ask Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, or see [[ASIN:140397201X From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany]]) - ruins the mood, I guess, or afraid of giving ideas to impressionable youth like Jeffrey Dahmer or the Columbine shooters, who did mention Darwinism as rationale for their actions.<br /><br />Oh. Sorry. I suppose there are some who are totally unaware of the Hitler-Darwin connection. Just for you:<br /><br />Evolutionist Sir Arthur Keith: \\"The German Fuhrer as I have consistently maintained, is an evolutionist; he has consciously sought to make the practice of Germany conform to the theory of evolution\\" (Keith, Evolution and Ethics, 230). There, all done. We may continue.<br /><br />Also, inexplicably, the movie doesn't bash Muslims at all, who also believe in - ah, wait a minute. That would be dangerous, wouldn't it? Always easy to slap someone who's supposed to turn the other cheek. But not too brave, natch. Also pokes fun at the only politically acceptable classes to mock, such as rednecks with trucks. But what's a little racism and intolerance in Hollywood? All in good fun, as long as you follow the rules.<br /><br />Anyone who has ever been interested in UFOs will probably like this movie. I enjoyed the main characters' enjoyment of their worlds of UFOs and Comic-Con. It takes a while to ramp up, though, and the middle stretch gets tedious, but if you're not too demanding (and not too worried about science) it's likeable enough for the most part. A couple of characters - their pursuers - take unexpected turns, which are not altogether explicable or satisfying. Why did these lovable goofballs suddenly become nasty? Dunno, but they waste a fair amount of goodwill invested in them.<br /><br />So, if you're willing to put aside your brain for a bit, or if you lack it in the first place, you'll probably have some fun with this movie. Unless ...<br /><br />It's quite possible that the writers are mocking viewers who are cheering the creationist-bashing. (Not to mention, as they cheer, the movie potentially exposes their hypocrisy regarding tolerance, reason, and being informed.) Because, for all his other traits, Paul ... Is a Christ-figure! The idea of sacrificial healing, the healer taking into himself the injuries and diseases of others, is a deeply Christian concept. Pre-Christian heroes were conquerors who destroyed their enemies, not self-sacrificial healers (seekers of knowledge, see [[ASIN:1595553223 The Book that Made Your World: How the Bible Created the Soul of Western Civilization]]). So we cheer Paul as he heals, giving of himself that others may be healed, yet mock the only religio-philosophical foundation for cheering this as a virtue, not a weakness. And although Ruth is \\"freed\\" from her religion by Paul, her religion - as portrayed by her father as judgmental and warped - is more representative of religions like modern environmentalism, e.g. Al Gore calling global warming doubters \\"racists\\", global warming believers excommunicating and censoring doubters, recycling nuts tut-tutting their acquaintances for not being good recyclers, and neo-liberals calling for and perpetrating actual physical violence against their \\"enemies\\".<br /><br />Is this far-fetched? Dan Brown mischievously outed elitist critics who praised his \\"accurate\\" books as uninformed know-nothings who apparently were easy prey to easily-debunkable conspiracy theories. Perhaps this movie is doing the same. But I'm just pulling your chain, actually. Pretty sure the writers were clueless about actual science.<br /><br />You may ask, \\"It's a comedy! Why not just enjoy it for the laughs?\\" I would answer with a question: do you agree with the saying, \\"It's funny because it's true?\\" I do. When comedy departs from truth, it loses its funniness, because your brain keeps interfering. Allow me to illustrate.<br /><br />Let's suppose you believe Obama is the best President ever, and this movie is a comedy about him. In the movie, Obama is portrayed as a clueless incompetent who never accomplished anything before becoming President, and wastes billions of taxpayer money on ill-advised schemes which strangely benefit his cronies. Probably untrue, of course, but stay with me. Suppose the jokes about his incompetence and corruption are hilarious. You could not enjoy it as a comedy, since you see it as an attack piece on the President, not a comedy. Furthermore, you would be concerned that clueless viewers will enjoy it and think they are \\"learning\\" something about Obama that is false.<br /><br />Same thing.ogether explicable or satisfying.

B002DKGWSE|5.0|if u don't like violence, then u bought the wrong movie. Garrett Dillahunt outdid himself here. he's as evil as they come in this movie. the violence is heavy but very tense and realistic, u can easily see this kind of scenario spiraling out of control in real life.
B004LWZVZM|4.0|The conspirator is a good movie. I have to admit its a little long winded, but that's to be expected of a historical drama. Give it a chance, it will make you think about some of the laws that we live by.
B0055S348W|5.0|This program is nice!  Cannot believe this is the free application of the day on amazon,  I almost bought this from the android market for 13 bucks a few times but didn't have the spare cash for it,  now its free still can't believe it

B004EPZ00W|5.0|This movie is great for any sports fan (especially baseball fans) and Brad Pitt fans.  It tells the story of the 2002 Oakland As and the management decisions going on behind the scenes.  Some funny, some touching moments.  Very well done.
0345522478|3.0|I couldn't finish this book. Got about half way through and just had to stop. I read a lot, and while this is a clever plot with interesting characters, it's just not written well enough to pull off the fantasy. It's almost there, but misses. Wish I could say more.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet.    The quality of the films is first class.  It's hard to believe that I'm watching a film from 1977.  Phantom Menace got a major facelift and is excellent, both in sound and video.  I'm very, very pleased.    There are a boatload of bonus features.  Admittedly, I haven't watched all of them yet to determine their quality.  There are just too many.      The \\"changes\\" everybody keeps complaining about are really a non issue.  Yes, Vader's \\"nooooo\\" feels a bit out of place, but to take it down one star, let alone four for this comes off as fanatical.    This IS the box set I've waited years for, and I couldn't be more pleased.
B0055S348W|5.0|My office Wifi is not connected to our internal network (LAN) for security reasons - but with Google Cloud Print and this app I'm able to still print at work - and then of course on my home network via PC-share since my printer isn't Wifi.    I did have to download a 4mb update for reading DOCX/XLSX files that took forever to install - but once that was done everything has worked nicely.    Droid X - (with APEX 2.0 RC3 ROM)
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No way am I buying this with the silly changes.  The pre-order was cancelled, you know a few years down the line, they'll milk it some more with another version.  Hopefully that one will stay more true to the original.  I'll just borrow or rent this if I really feel the need for a Star War fix.
B005ER6STG|5.0|In order to watch this film you must put aside any initial speculations and just let the film take over you. The reason I chose to label it as reality horror is because of the major shock value it contains. The directors intention wasn't to make a horror film, but more of a fictional documentary of a lifestyle not uncommon in Eastern Europe. The gruesome events portrayed are inspired by events that really occur. Director chose to express hard felt emotions about all the war, drugs, sex trafficking, and random acts of violence that has plagued his country for years.PLEASE don't get discourage watching this film because of other peoples reactions or harsh criticism. YOU MUST GO BEYOND that and understand that these unfortunate events such as the ones portrayed in the film do exist. This is a type of film that serves as a reality check. Very few movies such as Taken and 8MM only skin the surface of this subject matter. This is a great movie worthy of attention and a second look. Basically don't judge this book by its cover (or controversial atmosphere)As far as horror genre...10x narlier than Human Centipede...remember its Euro Horror! not boring American.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book was much better than I expected. I have not read The Kite Runner as of yet, but I hope to soon after reading this masterpiece. The words are weaved with meaning. The characters feel so real that you simply want to hold the characters in their time of need. It's painful but wit hthe underlying feeling of hope. Absolutely amazing.

I do not know how anyone would be able to wait for the next book of the series, especially with the cliff hangers in Catching Fire. It something that is heart-felt and enthralling. You won't regret it, and you will think about it for days!
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|Having previously seen Derek Truck live with Eric Clapton a few years ago I was aware of his talent but I was unaware of this band until I came across them on the Crossroads 2010 concert where they performed Midnight In Harlem. This was enough for me to buy this album straight away and I have not stopped playing it yet  every track is superb with great vocals from Susan Tedeschi and sublime guitar playing from Trucks. You will not be sorry if you buy this album!

B005DZMODI|5.0|given the choice between a recording that captures a moment,or a more polished studio recording.I`ll take the former.these guys are jamming and having fun.The beauty is you know this is real players,not a cut and paste job.Like so many modern\\"musicians\\".Ensemble playing is about weaving together,laying back at times,then cutting through at others.All the players are outstanding,including clapton.And clapton`s vocals are great.reading the setlist,I thought do we need another version of Layla.But this song is one of my favorites on the cd,clapton`s vocal phrasing is great.Music is about capturing a moment.this is a great cd.
B0055S348W|5.0|It's great! I initially gave one star, and offered the following review: I would love to give this app 5 stars. Unfortunately I can't. It found my Canon M700 printer perfectly, and when I selected the printer, the program said it needed to download the 4MB driver pack.  The status window counted up very slowly. When, after about 8 minutes, it got to about 89%, it started over at 1%. Repeated attempts got anywhere from 4% to 20% before starting over. I also got one data error. I even tried rebooting the phone and killing all nonessential apps. Not good.    Tech support requested that I try downloading later, as the servers were very busy. I did, and finally, later that evening had success. So far I have printed pdf files without a hitch.     5 stars even with the initial issues.    Droid I, Android 2.2.2.
1594744769|3.0|I came upon Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children on Amazon by chance and reading some of the reviews, it intrigued me enough to buy the book. Let me start with the one thing I disliked about the book - it took me a while to get a feel of Jacob, the 16 year old teller of the tale. You get to know someone through his relationships with other characters - and while Jacob came alive as the kid who believed all his grandfather's tales of monsters and magic, he became a boring, one-dimensional kid a couple of pages later with his rich family etc. His friend (best friend/only friend) is described in irrelevant detail but just vanishes. His father - one character that remains till the end of the book - was(for lack of a better word) - just wet! You feel nothing for him at all and it's impossible to picture him in your mind either. Golan was another disappointment of sorts. But that's it. The book gets interesting - from the moment Jacob starts on his journey of discovery after his grandfather suddenly dies - to arriving on the cold, wet, misty island halfway across the world in Wales - everything starting holding together. And Miss Peregrine could easily have been Prof Xavier running the Home for young mutants.   One reviewer had commented that pictures are an old, tired trick - actually I think Ransom Riggs needed the pictures in this book to raise it a notch above yet another attempt at teen/young adult fiction. The strangeness of the sepia photos created more atmosphere than 1000 words could and did. The descriptions of the pictures and what I saw was one of the main reasons behind buying this book. Some are downright creepy and some send a shiver through you even when it is a perfectly harmless one of two girls with their backs to the camera looking out at a seascape of sorts. If Riggs would do a bit more on the character development, the next book could go from interesting to fantastic. But would I buy this book again - yep! Am I looking forward to reading the sequel - certainly yes.
B0055S348W|5.0|I've tried others and sadly big disappointment but since this was free I said what the heck worth a try...OMG is all I can say works Perfect on both phone ( thunderbolt) and tablet(Xoom) this had to be the best free app ever offered by Amazon thank you to both parties
B000KKPN5C|1.0|Purchased May 2011 - Nice small flash that fill the void between the built-in flash of my D7000 and a SB-600. Bounces well, good for most normal shots, would not use in a large open area though. Flash died this week for no apparent reason other than \\"Made in China\\"...only used for around 400-450 shots. Sending back to Nikon for warranty replacement, out another $5.05 to ship it Nikon and now have to purchase new flash as Service/Repair takes 3-5 weeks = joy :-(
142311339X|5.0|I loved this book. For one reason really: it's like a sequel to the Percy Jackson series.     When I picked this up at the library, I wasn't expecting to love this one as much as I did the Percy Jackson series, but I really, really did. The book starts off on such a interesting note. The humor was still great, and the action was awesome. I loved getting to see Camp Half-Blood and all the old characters again.     I loved the plot of this one. It's really interesting to think of the Greek and Roman gods having different half-bloods and different heroes. The whole mystery built perfectly.     The characters were great. The threesome together had really cool powers. (I loved the flying!) And I always adore when Riordan tours the U.S. and makes them into hidden worlds. As I live in Chicago, it was fun to see what he did with the city.     It reminded me so much of my reading of Percy Jackson -- alternately laughing and gasping in surprise. Overall it's just a really great companion novel. I can't wait for the sequel. Should be interesting, especially where this one left it.
0307948560|2.0|This novel, now a movie, is a poor knockoff of Bridget Jones's Diary, complete with clever emails and repetitive notes to self.  However, this novel's heroine, and I use the term loosely, lacks not only Bridget's warmth but also the ability to laugh at herself.  Kate Reddy is an investment banker with two kids and a husband, and her strident excuses for not having enough time for them just grated on my nerves.  She envies the stay-at-home moms who go out of their way to make her feel guilty, but at the same time she knows that her job is where she finds her fulfillment.  She's jealous of the relationship her nanny, Paula, has with her children, while at the same time realizing her total dependence on Paula.  The bottom line is that Kate is weak.  Everyone takes advantage of her--her boss, her nanny, her decrepit housekeeper, and especially her children, since she caves in to their ever-changing whims.  It's no wonder that she can't catch up--on sleep, on what's happening in her daughter's school, on keeping her marriage intact.  Her long suffering architect husband doesn't have enough clout to persuade Kate that she needs to reevaluate her priorities and stop wasting energy on the wrong things.  For example, why on earth is she wasting time trying to pass off various foodstuffs as homemade?  To me, this book was more infuriating than funny, because I know that there are many Kates out there, putting the emphasis on form rather than function.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'm only in my 20s so I didn't get to see Star Wars when it originaly came out in theaters.  My mom really liked Star Wars so I remember being about 8-10 years old and watching Star Wars almost every weekend.  I had the big black VHS set and on my big screen tv a lot of the movie would be black.  I specificly remember in \\"Return of the Jedi\\" not being able to see a lot of things in Jabba the Hut's hideout.  It was way to dark.  I was thrilled later in life to get the dvds and finally see everything that is happening.  I was a little dissapointed with the changes but now I'm used to them and cherish the scenes I remember from a kid.  In blu ray it's never looked better.      If you are someone who loves Star Wars and don't mind that some scenes were edited this is the best looking release of Star Wars yet.  I'm just half way through \\"A New Hope\\" and have said wow many times at the visuals.  I agree with some other reviewers there are more positives than negatives.  I do feel for people who went to the theaters in the 70s-80s a bunch of times to see Star Wars and can't see the exact version.  Overall I think it's an amazing blu ray.
0062060554|5.0|It's been a long time since I found a book that I wanted to read before doing anything else.  This was the book!  A complete page turner which left me feeling like I was suffering from amnesia, too. In fact, what I felt after I finished the book was that every moment is a complete surprise even if we don't lose our memory.  Loved it. Highly recommend.  I ordered it after reading the review in the Los Angeles Times.
B005N0PJJO|4.0|I so enjoyed Fifty Shades of Grey, as did so many others, and snapped up Fifty Shades Darker as soon as it was available. And while it's great to get back to the combustible romance between Ana and Christian, I was disappointed to see the plot take a turn toward one of the most overused of erotica plots (warning: minor plot spoiler coming up!) -- the dominant partner needing to protect the submissive from a violent stalker. The writing is still top notch, with lots of humor and very hot, well-written sex scenes. Ms. James has a real talent for painting a picture! But when I saw she was going to rely on such a tired story line, I had to force myself to keep reading. Glad I did -- there's a lot more to the book than just that single story line -- but I had just hoped for 'more'. Oh, and there are a lot of odd, distracting editing errors that pulled my attention away from the story. I can't understand how these sorts of errors aren't caught by a good editor. Sorry, I hate being so critical. I still love Ana and Christian, and look forward to book three. Or anything else written by Ms. James, for that matter.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Ok here's a review from someone who actually owns the Blu-ray set.... One word, SUPERB! The picture quality and the sound are both amazing! The team did a great job with this transfer and I couldn't be happier and don't get me started on the price point it's a steal for all 6 movies and all of the extras, this is a must buy.<br /><br />  For all you 1 star reviewers.... Get a life! These changes come from the creator George Lucas himself, if he wants to improve on his vision let him. You can't judge an entire saga on some minor changes your probably upset that the Sagas being rereleased in theaters in 3D too Huh? Please help me with this one if you're so upset with the Blu-ray set just don't buy it, just bust out your old VHS copies with all its grainy glory, where Han shot first and have a great day.
B0054N73EY|3.0|\\"I'm With You\\", the first outing from the Red Hot Chili Peppers since 2006 begins like a garage band warming up.  And than it's down to their unique style of funk.  In the two weeks since it's release this album has received some pretty harsh reviews.  Too bad.  There isn't a bad song on the entire disc.  That being said there isn't anything as memorable as \\"Dani California\\", \\"Give It Away\\", or \\"Under the Bridge\\".  That being said there are some fun tunes such as \\"Look Around\\", \\"Monarchy of Roses\\" and a few others.     The big change this time around is the edition of Josh Klinghoffer on guitar.  He does bring some new textures into the Chili Pepper's complex sounds.  As usual Flea provides some bass chops that are just mind boggling.  This album probably won't win any new Chili Pepper fans however it's not the piece of garbage some claim it to be.  Hopefully their next release will be another masterpiece.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I was six years old when my parents took me to see Star Wars in the theater.  I still remember it.  I remember walking out of the theater trying to get \\"CP30\\" (how I said it then) right.  I was transfixed.  Got the action figures, the little death star kit with the trash compactor.  The next two movies were epic as ever as I entered my teen years.      I had a wonderful moment taking my own son to see Ep III.  Talk about the circle of life.  I loved them as a kid.  He loves them as a kid.      I'm not going to pass on these--which have been preordered since January--because of a scene here and there.  They look fantastic and we enjoy them.  If you don't want them, don't buy them.  I'm sure, eventually, the originals will be released.    I agree with most of you--I think Lucas has flipped his lid.  He basically lives in the same Tom Cruise orbit where no one around him is willing to tell him no.  Maybe Spielberg should stage an intervention.     Han shouldn't shoot first.  Vader shouldn't shout \\"NOOOO.\\"  Ewoks probably don't need eyelids.  But I'm not going to let that stuff ruin a cherished, shared family experience.     This thing is averaging two stars, mostly because of the flood of 1 star reviews, from people not even buying it?      My kid, who couldn't wait on the blu ray, discovered a battered DVD of Episode I in his room.  I tried to convince him to wait but he couldn't.  I went in to check on him, and the first comment was how funny Jar Jar Binks is.  The most reviled character in the history of the franchise.  And It reminded me all over again who these movies are for.
B0034G4P8A|4.0|Chris Hemsworth wields the hammer Mjolnir as the mighty god of thunder in the amusing superhero adventure Thor. For his reckless actions that reignites an ancient war, the powerful but arrogant warrior Thor (Hemsworth) is cast out of the magical realm of Asgard by his father Odin (Anthony Hopkins) and exiled to live among the humans. On Earth, he meets Jane Foster, a young astrophysicist who becomes his first true love, and learns what it takes to be a true hero when his treacherous adoptive brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) seizes the throne of Asgard. Directed by Kenneth Branagh, Thor is an entertaining comic book blockbuster that delivers a fun mix of drama, humor, fantasy and action, but does fall a few notches below such notable big screen Marvel Comics releases like Spider-Man and Iron Man. Chris Hemsworth breakthrough performance as the fallen hero is one of the movie's true strengths. The cast also includes Stellan Skarsgard, Kat Dennings, Idris Alba, Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander. Rene Russo and Clark Gregg.<br /><br />Thor certainly satisfies all the requisites of a Blu-ray release of a summer blockbuster. The superhero adventure is presented in a 2.35:1 widescreen format. Though not quite reference quality, the video transfer is certainly sharp and truly stunning. Its spectacular DTS-HD MA 7.1 soundtrack is one of the finest of any Blu-ray releases of 2011. Among special features, \\"Thor\\" includes an audio commentary by director Kenneth Branagh, 25 minutes of deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, several behind-the-scenes featurettes (From Asgard to Earth, Our Fearless Leader, Assembling the Troupe, Creating Laufey & Music of the Gods) and a short teaser of the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. Overall, Thor scores a \\"B\\".
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I got a \\"C\\" score on what i score \\"AA\\". It went crazy at times not recognizing me or telling me i wasn't there. So I really wanted this to work but kinect works best without it :(<br /><br />If you're not careful it could scrath ur kinect lenses while putting it on or removing it so be careful!!!<br /><br />I'm returning this product and gonna have to move couch again to play kinect games in my small studio.<br /><br />Stay away from this product if you like workout/ dancing games. I didn't even try it on \\"Your shape fitness evolved\\" but didn't bother since it didn't work on Dance Masters I don't think it'll work on that game either.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|An excellent CD full of awesome songs. Florence is no mere musician--she is an artist! I need 20 more words...Her music is by far better than the swill being put out by the likes of Katy Poopy, Lady Gag Me, Justin Boober, and Kesha. (I can't think of a clever way of disparaging Kesha's name.)
B004TF3HZ2|5.0|Steve continues to lead the way in progressive rock and Live Rails is just more proof of this. He is one of the faithful few that started out playing prog and continues to hold the course. This live album treats you to experience some of his most fabulous compositions reaching back to the Genesis days up to the present. When he tours, Steve is not afraid to surround himself with fellow artists of similar talent that display the most skilled musicianship; which enhances his own immpecible performance on the guitar.     Having followed Steve's career now since the Seventies believe me, he never fails to impress, never ceases to amaze and never, ever disappoints!  Steve Hackett is a true virtuoso of his instrument of choice. I've said enough. Buy this CD and enjoy the show!.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Forget Lady GagMe or Katy Perry! This woman is a true artist, who crafts songs and music that have true soul. That is what distinguishes a mere musician or performer from a true artist such as Adele. Adele need not rely on flashy gimmicks to sell CDs or get people to go to her shows. Her music sells itself, and I am quite happy to buy any CD she puts out, as she would never compromise her artistic integrity to make a buck.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I haven't gotten through the entire set yet, but the show is awesome (as usual). It got off to a bit of a slow start but the acting, particulary Michael C. Hall, is the best. I can understand why he is up for an emmy. He deserves it.
0345404475|3.0|As far as this book went, P.K. Dick takes some getting used to. Dropping a few scenes here and there, unusual dialogue and then just forgetting about main characters was a bit hard to take.<br /><br />On the other hand the adventures of Rick Deckert, bounty hunter of androids during a near future time was interesting. Dick does great in describing this new Earth, with its predictions of massive fall-out, \\"chickenheads\\" (retarded people affected by radiation), and the androids.<br /><br />The androids are near human and Rick has a device that can spot them. Rick also falls in love with an android which turns out to nearly be his undoing.<br /><br />Religion:<br /><br />Dick pokes at religion too, through the practice of \\"Mercerism\\" which a person may get some pathetic benefit from. As well, drugs are used to alter mood and you have your choice of mood when you wake up in the morning. His wife Iran sometimes prefers depressing moods, which drives Rick nuts. What started Mercerism and who he is was touched on, but to a slight degree.<br /><br />Animals:<br /><br />Most of the animals and bugs on Earth are dead, and the few there are cost a pretty penny. The poorer folk buy electric sheep and such. Better a fake animal than nothing at all. This could really have been delved into deeper but was not.<br /><br />Themes: Many themes are started and then dropped. Rick for example falls for Racheal, an android built by a corporation. This is never satisfactory especially at the end, which you'll have to see for yourself when you read the book (no spoilers).<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />I will need to rewatch the Harrison Ford film to make a final judgment, but Dick's book is not all it's cracked up to be. The androids hanging out, trying to take over a police station, and the love angle are each one of them started and never developed. The dropped plot lines was getting irritating.<br /><br />Recommended only for Phillip K. Dick fans or those fans of the film.
B004498KPU|5.0|I was given this video collection as a birthday gift.  Wow! I was NOT disappointed!  I already have a fairly extensive collection of his video's, but the added gems make this one all the more sweet.    For starters, They Don't Care About Us (Prison Version) is hard hitting and just plain brilliant. Next, Speed Demon was really fun and entertaining to watch.  So cool to see Michael's creative imagination in overdrive here.    I was also pleasantly suprised to find Say Say Say included.  I have always loved this song. A way cooler duet with Paul McCartney than The Girl Is Mine in my opinion. You can tell they had a really great time making that video.    Finally, I thought including the video for 3T's Why was a nice touch. So nice to see Michael so happy, smiling and singing with his handsome nephews.    My only regret is that he never got to create videos for any of his songs from the Invincible album. With the exception of You rock my   world. Butterflies, Unbreakable, Threatened, Break of Dawn, and 2000 Watts had so much video potential in my opinion. What a shame.     This video collection is a MUST HAVE for any diehard Michael Jackson fan period!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I just got my Blu Rays of episodes 4-6 and started my weekend by watching Empire Strikes Back.    Firstly, my system:    Mitsubishi 1080p projector on a 120\\" screen.  Denon receiver with Dolby Tru HD and DTS HD  Atlantic Technology Speakers 5.1  PS3    Picture quality:  Amazing!  No graininess with great color balance.  Original aspect ratio.  I've seen the DVDs (including the issue that contains the original theatrical release - that was not in anamorphic wide screen, but original!), the laser discs (both new release and the mega box set that has each movie spanning 3 discs!) and of course the VHS versions that were originally pan and scan.  Of course, the Blu Ray's picture quality cannot be matched by previous technologies.  I don't know how else to describe the picture, except that it looks like it was filmed using recent technologies, not 35 mm film stock from the 1970s.  If you see some other Blu Ray transfers from the '70s and '80s, you'll notice a significant deterioration and graininess that's typical of the low quality film stock from those decades.  Take a look, for example, at the Blu Ray transfer of Ghostbusters and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about!  This experience, however, was just awesome.    Sound quality:  The people that invented THX were, of course, going to do an awesome job and they did not disappoint.  These movies are presented in DTS HD - which I feel sounds better than Dolby Tru HD (that's not included).  Dolby Digital and DTS standard audio tracks are also on the disks, but why have a Blu Ray player if you can't enjoy the HD audio!?!  I think the sound outdid the picture quality!  There was a perfect sound emersion with excellent use of the surround channels.  Not just gimmicky noises that most other movies employ, this experience really made you feel like you were in the middle of all the action.  If you have a well calibrated 5.1 setup, pay close attention to the rainy sequence with Luke and Yoda in Empire; rain is coming down all around you!  Simply beautiful!  During the asteroid sequence, the surround channels are used with extreme precision; as ships come from the background or fade into the background, you feel it.  The .1 aspect?  The sub woofers are perfectly balanced throughout the movie.  Again, never a gimmicky use of this most important channel.  The subs rumble with great precision, just like the surrounds.  The battle on Hoth was simply perfect with regard to the use of surrounds and sub.  I never had to adjust the volume to adjust from dialog to action sequences - that was the whole point of Lucas' original mission with THX balancing.  You should hear the dialog when it's time to hear it and the action sounds shouldn't overpower the rest of the movie.  I often find myself lowering volume during crazy action sequences and raising the volume to hear dialog in lesser quality sound mixes...even from modern productions.  Not with this movie, the balance was just perfect.  This will become a new reference standard for testing sound systems!    Regarding Lucas meddling with the originals?  I don't really care.  Mostly because I think Empire Strikes Back is the best one of all 6 and he really didn't mess with this one much!  There are some CGI flight sequences that don't take anything away from the movie, in fact, I think they add to it.  Thank you George!!!  Star Wars, of course has crazy meddling, with Jaba and new creatures...just too distracting.  And I never really liked Return of the Jedi - I thought it was very cheesy with the Ewoks.  So if you're like me and want to relive the best movie ever (in my opinion), then these Blu Rays can't be beat.      Worth every penny, even if it's just to watch Empire Strikes Back.  Beware though, this box set only includes the 3 movies and no bonuses material.  The movies do have audio commentary, but no other special features.  I'm ok with that - I think you can enjoy \\"the making of\\" stuff only so many times before it gets boring.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|First off, the fact that episodes 1-3 are included already makes this a waste of time and money.  Those movies were some of the worst movies ever made.  To make things worse, the alterations and additions ruin episodes 4-6.  At some point, the true fans of Star Wars episodes 4-6 will find 35mm prints of the films, and re-edit them in high-def to their original, un-molested form. Wait for those versions.
B001NFU5WE|1.0|Yes im buyed the Bluray version but im received a 3 disc dvd version.<br />Ver y very dissapointed with this scam.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Yes we may be the fans/people who line his pockets but in the end George Lucas is the creator. This was all his vision and his dream. I'm not saying I agree with all the changes but as another reviewer said if your a true fan of Star Wars then get over it. Or just don't buy it! Who are we to say \\"you better do this\\" or \\"you better do that Mr. Lucas\\"? Again, its his dream. Its HIS baby (so to speak).   He has the technology in his hands to make true what he saw throughout this entire process a process that has consumed almost his entire life!  If you where a director, producer, writer, creator you would reserve the right to make changes too.   Again, we may fill his pockets but without him there would be no Star Wars so think about that.   Now I must go and watch my new Star Wars on blu ray!!!     Updated a long time ago in a galaxy far far away...   Shortly after initial review.     I do agree with most that Lucas should have preserved the originals on blu ray format but sadly he did not.   Hope this finds everyone well and now I must return to my HD SW in 6.1 surround sound!   I guess I'm willing to trade off some off Lucas insanity (I do not dispute that some of the changes and additions are off the wall) for quality sound and picture.    Further edited....    After a few hours of thinking about it I wonder if the negative reviews are Trekkies in disguise trying to tarnish a great thing?  Just a though.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I, like most true fans, am angry that the original films won't be present on this new set. Having said that (Larry David), I will - of course - be caving and purchasing it. Mr. Lucas, you are a thief if there ever was one. Know that with every dollar you amass you tear a little piece from the foundation of your legacy.
B004ODLUF8|5.0|This DVD had me on the edge of my seat, marveling at the delicate and dangerous work of the repair team and then at the breathtaking outcome of their efforts--the images sent back to Earth from the Hubble.

B0034G4P80|3.0|This is an enjoyable enough action movie and Chris Hemsworth makes a good Thor,there's plenty of action and alot of good humour. The downside is alot of the other characters in the movie aren't that impressive, even Anthony Hopkins is unconvincing as Odin,the guy that plays Loki is awful and what possessed Kenneth Branagh to cast Idris Elba as Hiemdall {Probably Franz Boas},and for some strange reason they made Asgard into some futuristic space station.
B0016NF06O|5.0|I have many cds of willie nelson & although many of the same songs are included in various cds, willie always phrases them differently & makes them new to me.  He can also team up with anyone in any type of music & more than hold his own.  wynton makes this one special.
B0055S348W|4.0|great app. i love the idea and was super pumped to download the app and am still keeping it but add more available printers or update so you have newer models as well. doesn't connect with my lexmark s605
B004CHURRS|4.0|This album has a lot going for it. It includes two of the arias Handel originally composed for Cleopatra but excised before the premiere; the orchestra plays beautifully and with spirit; and Natalie Dessay has a gorgeous and marvelously flexible voice she uses with taste and fine musicianship. So why not give it five stars?    There are several factors. First, as has been pointed out elsewhere, the album does not include ALL of Cleopatra's arias, and there's no reason why it couldn't have. There is enough time left on the CD to include the two missing numbers, and even if not, we didn't need another performance of the opera's overture. This is not a cohesive recital program that requires a musical introduction; it's a compilation of Cleopatra's arias, and that's really all we need.    Second, while Ms. Dessay has ample vocal charms, her notion of ornamenting a da capo aria is strange. In far too many instances, she doesn't decorate Handel's vocal line; she rewrites it, simply changing notes without any additional ornamental flourishes. There is a big difference between ornamenting a melody and blatantly rewriting it. Handel was one of the all-time consummate masters of melody, and his tunes don't need to be reconfigured.    Third, and some folks will consider this a niggling complaint, is that for all her vocal dexterity, Dessay does not possess a true trill. How serious a deficiency is this? Consider that in his 1723 treatise \\"Observations on the Florid Song,\\" written in 1723 in Bologna and translated into English in 1743, Pier Francesco Tosi wrote, \\"Who [lacks a trill], or has it imperfectly, will never be a great singer, let his knowledge be ever so great.\\"    Still, the album does offer numerous musical pleasures, and it is worth acquiring for those deleted arias, if nothing else.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I'm a knitter and crocheter, and love to download patterns from Ravelry and other sources, and I wanted to be able to take them with me on my phone.

B00596WEVI|5.0|Through the films \\"Ninja\\" and the second and third \\"Undisputed\\" films-I've gotten to know and become a fan of Scott Adkins.  I checked out \\"Assasination Games\\" more for Adkins than Van Damme but I gotta say, that despite his heyday being long over-I really enjoyed seeing the old guy in a new light with this film.  Jean Claude plays a really different character than what we're used to here and makes an absolute pro job of it.  The film itself is very competent and several levels above what we've come to expect from straight to DVD fare.  The action is good and the story is really sharp and well written.  As the movie goes along and you sort of start to see where it's heading- you can't help but enjoy the ride.  Both Adkins and Van Damme's characters are very relatable and three dimensional though their motives are very different.  The two really play well off of each other, and I'd love to see them reunite in a sequel.  This is really a good action/suspense flick.

0930289234|5.0|I jumped into this graphic novel after watching the movie, so I somewhat already knew what to expect. Unrelated to this review, the movie is very loyal to the graphic novel, as loyal as it could be. Anyway, I really liked the comic. It was completely different from anything I had read to that point. I spent hours just reading it. After I was done with one issue I went right into the next one, and then I went back to admire the artwork, to see if there was any hint into what the next issue would be about. The only thing that I didn't like about it was the ending. I mean, it was good, but for some reason I just felt that it was rushed. After the monster is unleashed on New York, it's basically, \\"All right, guys. I just killed a ton of people, but the world is finally at peace. Don't tell anyone or the world will end in nuclear holocaust. Agree? Cool. Um, the End.\\" It obviously didn't end like this, but I felt like it did. This is just my opinion, but you or someone else probably felt different. I still think that this deserves recognition and it should be read by everyone, unless you're a little kid because some of the things discussed are a bit graphic. In other words, don't leave this lying around where your little brother can pick it up. My mom still hasn't gotten off my case about it.
B0055S348W|5.0|Printed gmail with no problems.  Picked up printer right away.  Really great so far its been issue free. 5 stars
0316044695|5.0|I bought this book thinking it was going to be good, but it exceeded my expections. Like all the other reviews say, the first part of the book talks about SEAL training and why so many people fail. I mean, after I read that part I said to myself, \\"Screw the Navy, I think I'll just join the National Guard.\\" The second part is of the author's fight with the Taliban and his struggle to survive. This stuck with me more than the rest of the book. I can nearly recount everything I read, from the death of the author's friends to the nightmares he gets when he goes back to the firefight in his head. The second part of the book isn't very detailed on people or places--I mean, it is detailed--but yet you can picture everything, from the terrorists' beards to the piece of crap houses that provide shelter to the author. After reading this you can't believe that this was on the news, catching the attention of CNN and other non-famous news-networks.  My recommendation? Get the book and read it, by any means. Buy it or steal it.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|this cd by far exceeds the previous one - almost every track kicks ass... definitely keeping Rock Alive - i would recommend it to anyone
0060763280|5.0|This book is, by far, the best in its class. A very easy read jam-packed with a generous serving of knowledge and easily applied wisdom to make those extra hundreds of thousands (millions even) you've always dreamed about having. If you think you'd like to have a \\"Millionaire Mind\\" buy this book NOW!
B004T5K3OK|2.0|A nifty idea but it has a major issue--it has an image enhancement algorithm that often makes the image worse (i.e. less legible when dealing with text) than without the enhancement.  So far, I haven't found a way to disable the image enhancing and so it renders the whole app pretty useless.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|The music is rollicking fun, brilliant with vivid use of motifs and abrupt shifts. This is 100% instrumental, there are no lyrics. I loved that because I use the music for inspiration - and I mean you do want to get crazy and dance to this. Makes the heart pound. Each selection has rhythmic changes I never noticed during the movie itself. The only slight negative to this CD is that it is a true soundtrack, not a collection of songs such as you might get from say a musical like The Sound of Music. That means the works all lead straight into the next one, which means having your mp3 player on shuffle makes a mess of it. Play it straight through for the best effect.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Great action, great characters, unexpected developments -- what else can you ask for from Bruce Lee's mentor? This guy is the Clint Eastwood of martial arts without the grimmace: understated, heroic, and very, very cool.

In reading the Lean Startup I kept hitting my head and wondering if I had this book earlier in my life if some of my failed startups would not have turned out the way they did.<br /><br />Though, it is more fun to look forward. Besides running my own digital agency, the JAR group, I'm investing in a few small technology start ups. I've already been sharing the book and these concepts with the teams and I'm excited to see them put into action.
0393338959|4.0|Joseph Stiglitz's Freefall is an excellent analysis of the global economic crisis by an economist in the Keynesian tradition. Stiglitz is a critic of what he calls \\"market fundamentalism--the notion that unfettered markets by themselves can ensure economic prosperity and growth.\\" Economists know of a number of reasons why free markets fail to allocate resources most productively. A market transaction can impose costs or benefits on others who aren't party to the exchange (\\"externalities\\"), such as people who have to breathe polluted air. Market participants may act with imperfect information, as when they overvalue the house they are buying or undervalue a class of workers, and those with more information can exploit those with less. Economic agents such as corporate or investment managers may pursue their own interests instead of the interests of those they are supposed to represent. Market failures have a moral dimension, since the pursuit of self-interest is harder to justify if it doesn't actually lead to socially desirable outcomes, in accordance with Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand.\\" So Stiglitz's economic critique is also a moral indictment: We've been \\"creating a society in which materialism dominates moral commitment, in which the rapid growth that we have achieved is not sustainable environmentally or socially, in which we do not act together as a community to address our common needs, partly because rugged individualism and market fundamentalism have eroded any sense of community and have led to rampant exploitation of unwary and unprotected individuals and to an increasing social divide.\\"    The recent financial crisis is related to the misallocation of resources in the global economy. Higher productivity reduces manufacturing employment and leaves human resources underutilized. Industries save labor, which is plentiful, but waste natural resources, which are increasingly scarce. Capital isn't directed toward the kind of investments in education and technology that would create enough middle-class jobs. Developing countries underconsume, while developed countries increase consumption despite wage stagnation. The expanding financial sector promotes consumption by encouraging excessive debt, justified by a bubble in housing prices. Wall Street banks buy up shaky mortgages and repackage them as high-quality, low-risk investments. Financial deregulation leaves the government largely helpless to curb excessive risk-taking and speculation.    Most of Stiglitz's book is a critique of the government's response to the financial crisis. In essence, his complaint is that the government was far too generous to the banks and far too stingy with economically distressed homeowners, workers and consumers. With the benefit of federal bailouts, the banks resumed paying dividends to their shareholders and bonuses to their executives, but didn't do much lending to create jobs. Stiglitz calls this approach \\"ersatz capitalism, the privatizing of gains and the socializing of losses.\\" Stiglitz also discusses how international institutions such as the IMF failed to prevent the crisis and lacked the capacity for a coordinated response to it. Global faith in American-style capitalism has been shaken, but a new approach better balanced between private markets and public initiatives remains to be developed.    I would have preferred Stiglitz to organize the book almost the opposite of the way he has, putting the economic theory first, then using it to analyze the global economy, and then discussing the economic crisis. That would seem to me to be most logical, although maybe not as interesting to readers who want to cut to the chase. His policy points would sometimes be more persuasive if he had laid a stronger foundation for them in economic theory. He sometimes sounds like he's preaching to the choir, assuming that his readers share his economic assumptions. Other than that, I found the book very informative and persuasive.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|The movie was so-so, with the extra materials actually more interesting to watch. It is sufficiently historically accurate, but obviously having Robin Wright playing such a controversial character is an attempt to pull sympathies. So enjoy the movie, but don't base your history lesson on it!
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This movie was really, really awful.    It is disconnected, has no story or plot and in my opinion the visuals aren't that great either.    I suppose the acting is okay.    I recommend this movie for anyone who is sitting around home doped up on Oxycodone. Since you'll have trouble concentrating anyway you won't worry about why the movie makes no sense.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I admit, I was a bit skeptical of what the Soundfly claimed it can do. I've bought other transmitters before, all promising full functionality and then falling short in the end. But once I got the Soundfly and started working with it, I realized this was the real deal.   I kind of had a lot riding on this purchase, as I bought it before I was to go on a trip. My hope was to play lots of music throughout our 7 hour travel via the Soundfly and car radio. I hooked up my Zune player to it and within a few button clicks, was playing audio from my Zune through the radio in my Jeep Liberty. It also charged my Zune, while playing music - all I had to do was was connect the Zune USB connector into the Soundfly.   In the end, I was relieved and happy that the Soundfly worked, exactly how I was hoping it would!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I went back and forth as what to do when it came to ordering the saga on blu-ray. My ultimate decision was to buy it. Two main factors cause this decision. One I already own the DVD release of the \\"original theatrical\\" version which was actually from a laserdisc which had a maximum resolution of 567×480 that is even less then the resolution of a DVD. not even the dark side of the force can make it a higher resolution and two the blu ray editions have much better sound and video resolution that the DVD could ever dream of. When it comes down to it george left most of the major moments alone in the film aside from the NOOOOO at the end of ROTJ (yes I died a little inside when i heard it) at the end of the day it is still the same Star Wars that I grew up with and love. P.S. a majority of the 1 stars are people that have not seen or heard the Blu-ray version, and are jumping on the hate lucas band wagon the original film is lost get over it the DVD that was released a few years ago is as good as it will get so move on the the blu ray to experience the saga all over again.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|First, this arrived one day prior to its official release; one more reason to keep on buying from amazon. As for the actual product; since there were no details available pre-order, I was expecting the master Lucas to release this version in 7.1 surround, but it came in at 6.1. The sound is tremendous, however. I watched Episode IV last night and I remembered how it was actually John Williams who should have become the multi-billionaire, because without his music, that movie in particular is pretty hokey. Hokey or not, the movies are what they are, enjoyable as a piece of our living culture. I am grateful to be able to enjoy these movies in the well upgraded BluRay video, and especially the sound. Enjoy yours.

B0059DOJGY|5.0|This album has it all--speed, melody, introspection, heavy guitars and over the top vocals. All the exact reasons you fell in love with metal music in the first place. If you are a fan of European Power Metal (or its predecessor- British New Wave of Heavy Metal) then this album is for you.     Many bands have struggled to evolve after they have had their first hit album (Def Leppard anyone?). Edguy has not been one of those. In fact, you could argue that they have evolved too fast. This certainly seemed the case with Tinnitus Sanctus (half the songs are great...the rest questionable). With the Age of the Joker, Edguy have stormed back showing they can learn from their past and evolve their own brand of music meaningful.    The highlights contained within the Age of the Joker are numerous. My personal favorites are Breathe, The Arcane Guild and Beyond the Gates to the Midnight World.  The latter of which is a breathtaking journey of religion, space and time that could easily be found on a Bruce Dickinson album.     With Age of the Joker Edguy get the fundamentals right, continue to evolve their sound in a positive way and, most importantly, rock their ****** asses off!

0545123275|1.0|I read this because it was on a Missouri YA awards list, and my young teenager was told to pick books from the list for book reports. She was interested in it because it is a werewolf story, but it is a very poor werewolf story. There was way too much smooching and hiding out in the main character's bed for me. If you cut all the romance, you'd have a very short book with nothing else to hold the story together. The wolves don't change at the full moon, which gave it something new, but it was a stretch for me.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|I am not spending another cent on this franchise.  When I was a kid Star Wars was the be all end all of entertainment.  All we did was talk about Star Wars, watch the films when the came on TV, played with the toys, and anticipated when the next one would be released in the theaters.  Then we bought the original version on VHS then the THX version, then they were re-released in theaters and we saw them again. Appropriate words cannot be found to describe my personal disappointment with how these movies have been mangled and put up for view--like displaying the corpse of an executed yet once beloved monarch.  The prequel trilogy was an abomination; Attack of the Clones being the worst of them all.  The subsequent, relentless reissuing of version after version of these films has turned my stomach because every time it gets worse and worse. I don't care about the so called \\"enhancements\\" and Lucas \\"fixing\\" things with the films, I will never spend another cent on any Star Wars film or merchandise so long as I live.

B00009NHC5|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was about 12 or 13 at home on cable. I was alone , it was nighttime and it scared the s__t out of me. It is not a slasher movie so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere. It's more of a psychological suspense movie than anything else.<br />Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman who's husband has inadvertently come home with a doll full of heroine. The guys who are looking for it are right around the corner, and start devising a plan to get it. Now I believe the movie works so well because of Hepburn, you BELIEVE she is blind, there is no &#34;Oh, that's Audrey Hepburn playing a blind girl&#34;, no way, she IS blind. And her character is so likable that you find yourself screaming at the screen, &#34;Get the HELL out of there!&#34; was a phrase I remember repeating that night so many years ago. Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna as two of the three bad guys were superb, one cool and collected, the other a simmering pot of slimy oil just about to go up in flames. There is also a little girl that lives upstairs that you want to strangle or at least hope the drug dealers take her ; ) But my least favorite character is Audrey's husband, he is such an insensitive ass that you wonder why she doesn't just leave him. I know about tough love but the guy is a pain. I remember feeling this when I was a kid and when I watched it again the other day I felt the exact same thing. But maybe because he is such an idiot it just makes you want to root for Audrey's character even more. By the end you are so invested in her and her plight that you are just jumping in your seat trying your best to will her out of there.<br />I believe to get the best effect this movie must be watched in a completely dark room and let yourself get immersed in the atmosphere, you'll have a frightening good time.

B003R0MEZ4|1.0|(There are -extremely mild- spoilers in this review.)<br /><br />First off, the casting of season 6 was a fiasco. Dropping two of the strongest women on TV (to fund that terrible spin-off?) was the biggest mistake CBS execs made this year. The addition of of Ashley Seaver (Rachel Nichols) wouldn't have been terrible if the writers had time to give her a more in-depth look at her backstory or even just a personality.<br /><br />But worse than the execs messing with a winning and beloved cast? The characterization of almost the entire cast is off all season long. The writers take Reid's five seasons worth of growth and regress him to someone even less confident, less socially aware, and generally less able than he was in season 1, which makes no sense at all. Garcia becomes a wilting flower who needs her hand held after every little thing after five seasons of being shown as very capable and strong. Morgan gets portrayed as a big black thug who is only good for kicking down doors (and, alternatively, holding Garcia's hand). Rossi and Hotch have next to no personality and as mentioned, Seaver doesn't either. Prentiss goes back and forth. JJ is the only character who is decently written and she's only in FOUR EPISODES.<br /><br />Also, character interactions and team ups are lackluster. Hotch and Reid hardly even talk to each other. The writers have spent two seasons forgetting that Morgan and Reid are bros. You'd think that Reid had been pulled from field work with how often he gets relegated to maps and such. And pretty much, the only pair ups we get are Morgan/Prentiss, Rossi/Hotch, and Reid/maps, with Seaver randomly thrown in.<br /><br />Then you've got the unbelievable storylines/moments that make no sense whatsoever in the context of the show. Like Hotch coaching Jack's soccer team when it's blatantly canon that the man has no time, is always on the road, etc. To add insult to injury, he picks Rossi, who will be out of town on all the same days as he will, to help him? That just defeats the purpose of having an assistant coach. I also can't understand how Garcia has the time to be a tech analyst to not just Hotch's team, but also the spin-off's team, and counsel victims' families AND rehearse for a play in which she has the main role. The Reid headache storyline was completely ridiculous (I've edited the next few sentences to be clearer on what I mean by that). They play it like he's got some BIG and SCARY issue going on (schizophrenia/mental illness, a mystery disease, demons/ghosts weighing him down, etc) when there's a very simple and obvious explanation that no one even mentions - migraines. Anyone who's had a migraine knows that they are triggered by not sleeping well and foods (such as dairy, which is specifically mentioned in an episode when he reaches for Tums because he ate too much dairy) and made worse by stress AND he exhibited all of the \\"classic\\" migraine symptoms, including auras, which only 20-30% of sufferers get. Reid knows a lot of things and I have a hard time believing that he doesn't know anything about migraines and I have an even harder time believing that his doctor didn't bring them up. Also, apparently Doyle has good enough aim that he can shoot a guy's wrist from a moving van.<br /><br />And as someone else mentioned, the show has started \\"degenerating into cheap shock writing.\\" The sad thing is they only watched the first two episodes, which are far less violent than later episodes. The Thirteenth Step is the perfect example of how the show has been sliding on the psychological aspects and relying on graphic violence instead. Worse yet, that episode sexualizes the violence, which is against everything the show is about.<br /><br />Finally the season finale was boring. No cliffhanger, no drama. I get that they didn't know if they'd be able to bring Paget Brewster back and so they didn't quite know how season 7 was going to go, but c'mon. Look at the first five season finales...in three of them, we don't know if one of the teammates is going to die.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I am in love with Criminal Minds, but this season suffered greatly from having the cast jumbled about and good writers fired and replaced with people who just don't understand what made the show successful in the first place.get me wrong.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set is wonderful. Period. The packaging is fantastic, the video and audio is remarkably crisp, clear and revealing. The extras are copious.    That being said, I've grown up with these movies. My first experience in 1977 was life changing. I've welcomed EVERY SINGLE EDITION of these movies with joy and enthusiasm because watching them all over again is, really, a celebration. It's George Lucas' eccentric personality that created this saga in the first place. Although I can't say I LOVE every moment of the prequels or every alteration Mr. Lucas has made to these movies, they still capture my imagination; THEY'RE STILL FUN TO WATCH. As a fan, I'm gonna' have a good time tonight! Thanks, George. What a sad world it would be without Star Wars.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Okay, I'll admit I've known about this album for a while, but never gave it any serious consideration.  It popped up while I was searching Amazon for a ukulele for my daughter.  I thought to myself, \\"What kinda crap can that be, Eddie Vedder and a uke.\\"  Like most people of my age, Tiny Tim is the first thing that pops into my head when I think of a ukulele.  But today, the scales fell from my eyes.  I heard \\"Without You\\" on a local college radio station while I was driving home from work and I was gone, totally gone.  I stopped at the nearest store a bought a copy (sorry, Amazon, but I COULDN'T WAIT).  I slammed it into my car's CD player and realized that there is a depth to the ukulele that I never imagined.  The sweet simplicity of the ukulele is a great counterpoint to the complex and sometimes painful emotions that make up the lyrics to these songs.  And Eddie's voice is a revelation--I love Pearl Jam, and always have, but this is no Pearl Jam.  My estimation of Eddie as a songwriter and musician has gone way up.      Please, if Amazon suggests this for you, don't be as dismissive as I was.  Get it and listen to it with an open mind, and more importantly, an open heart.      Oh, and incidentally, my daughter loves her ukulele I got from Amazon, it's a quality instrument with a lovely tone.  It's a Lanikai Pineapple soprano ukulele, but she's got a ways to go before she sounds as good as Eddie!

B0006SNK9E|5.0|As I often do, I tend to champion the great \\"unsungs\\" in hard rock, especially in terms of US recognition and acceptance.  Sweet was one of those great British bands who aside from an occasional single or compilation release in the US never got the credit they deserved from critics. And yet they were one of the most influential bands from that era, especially for American hard rock. Nikki Sixx has often sited Sweet as a primal foundation of Motley Crue's sound (listen to early Crue single \\"Talk of the Town\\"!). `Sweet Fanny Adams' was not released in its original format in the US when it first appeared in the British and European markets in the early spring of '74.  This LP remains for many, the definitive Sweet album as much of it later appeared on the American version of `Desolation Boulevard' a year later (nothing like the British version of that one either, confused yet?). \\"Set Me Free\\" is simply awesome and is just something that would never be played on American radio yet is SOOO damn hard and fast that it would have/should have been huge. \\"No You Don't\\", \\"In to the Night\\", the title track (whose true meaning would be unprintable here but it sure as hell wasn't \\"Fanny Adams\\") and \\"AC/DC\\" are all classic hard rock/glam rock/early metal songs that demand your attention and are insanely catchy.  Although it is hard to compare the legacies of the two bands being that Queen had a twenty year career while Sweet really only lasted for six to seven years, both bands featured awesome vocal harmonies and contributions from all members. Steve Priest and Andy Scott both contribute lead vocals or sing valuable bridges/choruses on all the great Sweet tracks and Brian Connolly was a great frontman. Slade was another band (love them too) who may have been a better singles success but there is no comparison as far as I'm concerned because for three or four years Sweet was one of the best bands on the planet, could've given Queen a run for their money and \\"Sweet Fanny Adams\\" should tell you why. My copy is of the recent compilation which includes all their 1973 singles and B-sides (\\"Ballroom Blitz\\", \\"Blockbuster\\" and \\"Hellraiser\\") so it is even more essential to any lover or seventies hard rock. RIP to both Brian Connolly and Mick Tucker so a real reunion would only happen in rock n' roll heaven. As Andy Scott says in the liner notes...\\"Sweet FA, never gonna make it!

B003ZSJ212|1.0|You will not get one more dime from me. To everyone posting one star reviews in boycott of this travesty: Well done. Keep them coming. Fellow consumers, now is the time to make ourselves heard. This is not Star Wars. These is not the films we love. These are not the films we want. I don't know what these are. Lucas didn't even direct ROTJ and ESB. He's got some nerve twisting films crafted by others into deformed parodies of what they once were, especially given the content of his speech to congress. Greatest moment of the saga ruined the exact same way Vader's transformation in ROTS has become the most groan-inducing, laughably cheesy moment of the entire saga - with a single word:    NOOOOOOOOOO!!!    Seriously, it is me or is this particular revision chillingly spiteful? How could he possibly *not* know it would be universally despised? Is he that out of touch, or does he really loathe his fanbase so much that he'd deliberately antagonize them this way? Think about it. As a revision, it simply makes no artistic sense.     I cancelled my pre-order immediately upon confirmation of these changes.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Ingrid Bergman would look like Lady Gaga. Humphrey Bogart would have green hair and a nose ring.    And another thing, HAN SHOT FIRST!  (But not in this PC version.)    When Paramount released Star Trek they gave us the option to watch the movies as originally made.    Don't be a sheep, stand for something! Do not buy this release. It will be released later, but correctly, with the original versions made available.
1439152799|4.0|I saw Kate Morton's three books at a promo sale at Books-a-Million and they looked interesting. I looked at the reviews on Amamzon and most sounded promising. I checked out the Distant Hours from the local public library (because that was the only title they had) and was not disappointed. I disagree with the reviews giving only one star, but perhaps we are much different readers with different expectations. I do agree that I kept reading and waiting for something exciting to happen, but there was still enough going on in the plot to keep me interested. I omitted one star because although I don't mind stories that go back and forth in time, I felt this one did too much, cutting the reader off at a crucial detail (I suppose to build suspense), only to not return to that detail until the very end, thus going off in too many directions. Some important elements were introduced, or at least exponded upon, a bit too late in the story. It also seemed the last two chapters (or sections?) seemed oddly reversed. Overall, I am just a reader, not a literary critic, so I do commend Ms. Morton on a good job and good story. I must add that I truly appreciate her ability to tell a good story without unnecessary smut and oscenities. I have since ordered The Forgotten Garden and The House at Riverton and recommend this author to other readers out there.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|I always thought everything Joey and John brought to Anthrax was phenomenal. I was never one that was picking sides or hating one, because of the other. This album puts together their whole career and I must say if the boys in Anthrax don't keep this going after everything.........it will be a true shame. Joey's back, hold on to him. I honestly think this is their masterpiece. I can't come up with a criticism of any kind. Long Live Anthrax

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I just got this and have started watching - starting with Episode 4 - A New Hope.<br />The transfer looks great - as you would expect a Blu-ray to be - I've bought some older movies on blu-ray and they are just copies onto blu-ray with crappy and grainy resolution (ie - the Rocky Saga).<br />Some things people have  been complaining about -<br />Obi-wan's Dragon yell to scare away the sand people is kind of jarring and out of place. The scene was much more powerful  when the sand people ran off presumably because they knew who this old man was.<br />Greedo still shoots first.<br />All the other changes Lucas made in 2004 appear to remain intact - and purist have been up in arms over it - but these are Lucas' babies - so he has a right to tweak and change them as he wishes - although I don't agree all are for the better. The insertion of Jabba the Hutt in New Hope is kinda..well..deflating...part of the excitement was having to wait til Return of the Jedi to finally see him imho.<br />All in all though - these are great movies - and have been given a great transfer to Blu-ray and fans should be happy to add them to their collection.
0385341008|5.0|This book was a pleasure to \\"waste\\" a day on! The authors wove a wonderful story through post-WWII England, introducing me to some fanciful (and witty) characters and new geographic locations. Had not ever thought of an island named Guernsey before (as other reviewers have already stated....now I want to go and visit). I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the format the authors chose to tell the story.
B000067QMD|5.0|I had no idea that Avent even made something like this until I happened upon them on Amazon. When daddy watches our daughter he was clueless as how to set up her bottles and this made it easy for me to make them in the morning and store them in the fridge until he needed them. not to mention I can stuff a bottle in the diaper bag with formula and top it off with a sealing disk so the formula doesn't get stuck in the nipple before I feed her. So nice to have!
B0055S348W|3.0|I am excited about ths application but so far I am disappointed.  Setup was very easy, scanning for my printer was very easy, however printing is not working.  I had to choose the generic driver and I choose to print a very short text message.  It has been spooling the print job for over 10 minutes and it only says 46% spooled.  I am rating this app 5 stars anyway because I am hoping this is just a printer support or network issue, but I can tell you I have never had any issues doing wireless printing from my laptop.  Either way for free I am very excited, if I had paid $13 I would be very disappointed at this time.  Thanks Amazon for finally making what appears to be a very useful app Free for today instead of another time wasting game.    Well it finally completely spooled and unfortuately the document didn't print.  I am trying now to print a contact from my phone and it is taking forever to spool the document again (it's at 15% after about 5 minutes).  I also tried to print a contact from my laptop and my printer responded that it was busy printing a another document and asked if I wanted to wait (I choose yes).  Well it took about 25 minutes to spool the contact when it was done it said error, however the contact I printed from my laptop immediately printed after the contact from my phone spooled and indicated error.  I am lowering my star rating to a 3 - still hoping to get this to work.

B0055S348W|5.0|My printer is a Canon MX350, and Canon has an app that allows printing from my phone, already (Canon Easy Photo Print). However, that app only helps with photos and PDF's. (It does let my use the printer's scanner, though).  This app will print anything, and it does so extremely easily. I'm sure that I wouldn't pay $12.95 for it, but it may be one-of-a-kind right now. If printing is something you're likely to do often, it may be well worth it.  (I still have to keep Canon's app for scanning, though.)
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I was once in a conversation with a petit blond girl and her female tennis player friend. We spoke about wacky paranormal ideas. The girl was interested in poltergeists and she was convinced that she could see ghosts. She even had a pseudo-scientific theory about electricity waves interacting with the brain.<br /><br />Her girlfriend, tall, athletic and beautiful, with a strong arm for tennis which she puts to good use on her girlfriends bottom, also believed in ghosts.<br /><br />I said, \\"I am not a druggy  because I'm interested in drugs and I don't know why we have to make a disclaimer every-time this subject comes up\\".<br /><br />The girl looked suspicious. She said, \\"You are obsest\\"!<br /><br />I said, \\"If I was talking about the film, The Silence of the Lambs, wouldn't it be odd if I kept assuring you that I'm not myself a serial killer, I just like the film? So why do I have to assure you that I'm not a druggy\\"?<br /><br />The girl said, \\"So what you are saying is that the word 'Drug' is like that creature from Greek mythology that morphs into the thing the person wishes to see. Like if I turn my gaze at the creature I see a big breasted Swedish porn star who needs to snog me, but if you see the creature, you see me making love to the Swedish porn star, or if a lonely person see it, he sees his long lost friend?<br /><br />Tennis girl was not amused (she will put her girlfriend over her knee tonight for a hard spank. Tonight her little girl will know the strengh of her girl).<br /><br />I said, \\"Yes. The word 'Drug' is like that creature that morphs. People see in a prison of a nightmare, this is the creature we are all seeing; the same creature, but each person views it from different angles. Objectivity is impossible from an angle.

B005G4TJI4|5.0|Transformers: dark of the moon took a more serious tone this time around and it was effective. There were scenes in the film when a decepticon would go after citizens and sending them to their death. The story behind NASA and the continuing battle between decepticons and the autobots were great and kept you interested. A few twists here and there gave the film the suspense building up to the climatic ending. The final hour of the film was filled with action and explosions. I felt the ending was a little too quick with the battle between Megatron and Optimus Prime and also the ending itself. I would definitly recommend this film to anyone who is into the transformers films.

0062060554|5.0|I read this book several weeks ago and am still thinking about it--only the best books can do that!!  I was intrigued by the premise of the book, the cover art, well, all the way through really.  Christine can remember only snippets of her childhood and early adulthood, but she can't remember anything of her middle-aged life.  Infact, she wakes up every morning scared because she doesn't recognize herself or where she is,  Every day is like this for Christine, and from the very beginning the reader senses there is something sinister afoot and is compelled to keep reading to find out how it all fits together.  It's hard to believe this is the first book for this author as she is a very polished writer.  I'm anxiously awaiting more from this author,

B0041D843M|5.0|What an insightful and informative read. I am a fitness professional, Life Coach and wellness business owner and I think that if someone is in the health, fitness or wellness industry, they really must read this book (I don't often use 'must', but in this case it applies).<br /><br />There are lots of books written by people who have read a lot or research a lot; but not many of them have dedicated 40 years to the physical research & study of protein...which I believe is one of the most confused and confusing macro nutrients for people. The China Study, for its duration and depth, truly is a brilliant case-study, that leaves less to guess or speculation, and a whole lot to specific, measurable and consistent findings.<br /><br />Too often people are focused on external looks, rather than true 'health'. Someone may look good (for now) but actually not have good health. This book allows you to understand 'health' at a much deeper level.<br /><br />The book is an easy read too because it is so informative and interesting. Enjoy!

B000TGCR38|5.0|A Rolling Stone quote on the case is \\"Provocative and Potently Erotic\\".  This is a very good description of this film.  It is not your standard World War II movie.  This film presents a very different and very real look at the war.  The characters are well developed and we come to care about them.<br />A very good-looking woman becomes involved with the Germans to spy for the Resistance.  This is a game of cat and mouse set in occupied Holland where good, evil, truth or lies all become dependent on what one is trying to do at the current time.  While the story seems simple, there are a number of layers to it, involving greed, opportunity, fear and love.<br />The film is over two hours and is in Dutch.  You need to be ready to read the subtitles and watch the action.  Given the story, there is a good deal of nudity and sexual activity.  The film never becomes NC-17 or X rated but this is for adults.<br />This is one of the best foreign films about World War II.  This and Soldier of Orange are the two WWII Dutch I wanted in my library.  Paul Verhoeven did both films producing thought provoking and entertaining stories.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Look, let's start this off by saying I am a die-hard Star Wars fan and have been ever since I was younger. I'm almost 24 and still can't get enough of these movies. Sure, I don't know everything about the movies and every little detail, but I know enough that most people don't. So, lets start this off correctly:    Star Wars on Blu-ray is the best way to own these films. I may not own the most top-of-the-line TV and the best sound system, but all the films look amazing compared to their DVD counterpart and the sound will blow you away!    Sure, Lucas has made some changes. However, the first thing I did was go to these scenes and really take note on what everyone was complaining about. Yes, all the other changes he made previously are still in there, but like these new ones, they all have a common theme to me: They last about 2 seconds, and the movies are STILL THE SAME MOVIE. Had Lucas gone and rewritten that Leia was never Luke's sister or something, I think that's a reasonable thing to get angry over. Here's what I went over:    Episode 1: Yoda is digital. Impression: Positive! Holy cow, does he look GOOD. This sort of change is something that was necessary. The puppet Yoda always looked off to me, even at a young age. I didn't look at any other changes, or heard of any.    None from Episode 2 or 3 either that I'm aware of.     Episode 4: This is old, but, sorry, Greedo still shoots first. However the scene has been altered slightly and looks a lot more realistic vs. the old version. I still find this to be positive personally, but I'm not a stickler for these things.    R2 apparently is behind some new Rocks as the sand people are looking at the land speeder. Neutral on this one, I barely noticed the change until someone else pointed it out.     Ben's howl toward the sand people. Impression: Neutral/Negative. It feels off for some reason, but honestly, 2 seconds and it's over, to me, it doesn't ruin the film.     Episode 5: I heard they changed the Wampa's arm,but I didn't check, I'm sure it's a good thing from what I've heard.     Episode 6: NOOOOOOOO. Impression: Neutral. Really. It could have been done better, especially since Vader has no face it's hard to imagine him coming to the realization that this is wrong, but it's not HORRIBLE. I chuckled at first, but in time it will grow on me.     Ewoks blink. Heavens forbid something blinks. It looks fine and natural; nothing to get all mad over.     There are a few other (minor) things, but overall, NOTHING ruins these films. The people who are getting all worked up over this need to realize: It's NOT your movie! Lucas can do whatever he wants with his baby. If he goes and changes the whole plot of the movie, I'll fight with you. But a few minor changes to make his movies look better? Whatever, get over yourselves. I guess all this hype and bad \\"reviews\\" may have driven the price down, so at $80 for 6 films with the best picture and sound and tons of bonus features, you can't go wrong; it's friggin Star Wars.     I can't wait to have my own marathon of these movies and have a great time cherishing these films for years to come. Unless you've got a problem and demand to have originals, this set is a MUST OWN!

B0034G4P80|3.0|I am 58 and was a huge fan of the Jack Kirby Thor comics. Kirby captured the feeling of Asgaard perfectly for me. As with all of the Marvel superhero movies, we realize that most of the bulk of the comics was filled with fighting. That's why I liked Kirby... he made the fight scenes artistic, so I didn't actually realize they were violent. They were visual ballets, artistically designed sparring matches. This never really happens in the films... so far.<br />I could criticize this film by imagining how it could have been better... i.e. The Asgaardian scenes could have been more Michelangelo-ish, incredibly posed figures, dramatic and dynamic compositions, lyrical sunlit interludes, trolls and monsters and sparring matches, blah, blah, blah. But I realize that the director is only human, he is dealing with actors, and there is a budget... and... the film has to look like a Marvel film. That said... this is a pretty good film. I found myself caring for Thor when he is mortal, wishing he would kiss the girl, thrilled when he got his hammer/power back.<br />  I will note another movie-making problem here. Remember when they made Spiderman? and the CGI people had to make Doc Oc's arms realistically walk? I read that they had trouble because Steve Ditko had drawn great artwork that worked 2 dimensionally as still shots, but that the in-between action was very hard to visualize. Something like that is going on in the Thor movie. Kirby drew great sets, but we never actually saw the Gods transport anywhere, there was not an actual explanation of how they went anywhere and where that anywhere was. So in the movie we get this kind of science fiction universe, with a giant matter transporter and a rainbow bridge/wormhole. I suppose it sort-of works, and it had to be done somehow... but it all felt kind of forced.<br />  Now on to my dislikes. I never liked the frost giants in the comics. Kirby could never figure out how to draw them adequately, so I never liked them. In the movie, they are dark and black&blue, and their world is dark and black&blue. They look like bad guys, or like those Borg in Star Trek. They almost spoiled the movie for me. And then on top of that, they are main characters! They have their own realm where they just stand around stiffly being cold!<br />  And the OdinSleep! It is not explained at all. And it seems forced and unnecessary... it's a plot device.<br />  And Thor's friends from the comic book are there. But they are not as interesting and they don't do much. Volstagg is not as fat and not as funny. Sif is not as elegant and cool. Fandral is not as dashing. The other guy is now oriental, I don't remember that from the comic, but it's been a long time.<br />  Asgaard should have been more over-the-top hugely dramatic. With more eloquent speeches.<br />  Loki has been transformed from a God of mischief into a troubled son of dubious parents who is misguided and then really bad and then violent and then devious. He is confusing. He should have been much more melodramatic. He should have been a scene-stealer. The real star of the film.<br />  Thor is ok. Just ok. He looks pretty good. They altered Kirby's original outfit a little... it's darker ( what isn't anymore) He should have been more childish, fun-loving, braggadoshilicious, God-like.<br />  Most of my comments are based on my fond memories of Jack Kirby's Tales of Asgaard, Tales to Astonish, The Mighty Thor. That was a long time ago and I'm sure the Thor comic changed a lot over the years since then. I remember a long series of stories involving Hercules and spaceships and aliens and lots and lots of fun, fun, fun and imagination.<br />  There are a lot of funny, tongue-in-cheek moments in this movie. And I appreciated them. Stan Lee driving the pickup that tries to pull Thor's hammer out of the crater, The guy from  SHIELD, when confronted with the Destroyer, says to no one \\" it's probably one of Tony Stark's, he never tells me anything\\" These kind of moments harken back to the good ole days of Marvel.<br />  Oh, the Destroyer. One of my favorite Kirby designs,,, the empty suit of armor with a death beam. Seems kind of silly nowadays. In the movie it is taller and skinnier, but still scary.<br />  Again, the worst part of the film is the too dark Frost Giants and their realm. Anything else would have been better. Loki was too evil and confused. Odin was OK, should have been more massive. Asgaard should have been more dramatic. The scientists are pretty good. Nice ensemble group. Better than Thor's friends.<br />  Worth seeing, not great.le days of Marvel.     Oh, the Destroyer. One of my favorite Kirby designs,,, the empty suit of armor with a death beam.

0316098329|2.0|I imagine a lot of work went into this book. It was original and must have been quite difficult to make up all of the things that made up the life of \\"Jack.\\"<br />However, his incessant asking of questions every time his \\"Ma\\" said something was very irritating. By the end of the book I was weary of Jack's questions and his annoying habits, even for a 5 year old. It was just too much. I especially disliked his constant reference to the \\"right\\" one or the \\"left\\" one, referring to his mother's breasts. Breast feeding of a 5 year old was just plain sick as far as I was concerned.<br />By the 4th chapter I wanted to strangle the kid, but I kept trying to get into this book no matter how tedious it became.<br />I did manage to finish \\"Room\\" only because once I start a book I have made it a habit to finish.<br />The book did manage to convey to me that I have to be very choosy before I buy any book from now on.

0060557818|3.0|Pigeons. I used to think that homeless people in Chicago fed the birds to be a nuisance. I realize now that they do this because pigeons give them a reaction, which is much more than most of us do, especially when you've seen the same bum hustling the same corner for ten years, still collecting change for that bus ticket to Orlando. I hate to tell him that if he hasn't made enough to see \\"The Mouse\\" by now, then he'll never see him. So I forget him. Visible to me, but only as part of the City's landscape. Not camouflaged by concrete and noise, but woven into the day's fabric like a loose thread. Not tied to anything, just tucked in enough to not break free, but along the way forgotten. That's how people fall through the cracks, an idea that sparks Neil Gaiman's premise for his first novel Neverwhere, published in 1997.<br /><br />  Meet Richard Mayhew: a young, upwardly mobile Londoner. Meet Richard's fianc&eacute;e: Jessica, more upwardly mobile than Richard. On the way to a dinner that will significantly advance their mobility, Richard stops to help a young girl in ragged clothes who has been left bleeding in the street. Richard can't help but see this girl. Jessica is completely oblivious to her presence and continues on to the dinner. The girl, named Door, is a denizen of another London, a London below ground that operates with rules that do not apply to the logic of London's above ground reality. Richard's kindness has consequences and he \\"falls through the cracks\\" in an attempt to get back to a life he knew.<br /><br />  Neverwhere felt...safe. Like something you'd see on PBS or the BBC. Not surprising, as the novel is an adaptation of the television series created by Gaiman in 1996. Strange that its tone would retain that bland feeling you get when you watch old episodes of Dr. Who; adventure, but the feeling of no imminent threat of danger to the characters despite their predicament. It had darker moments and memorable villains, but it felt safe. Gaiman's inventiveness in creating the London below was entertaining, and its unfortunate that conceptually something like Guillermo Del Toro's movie Hellboy 2 appears to have used this idea of \\"a world below and beneath the World\\" as its background, because I couldn't help but feel as I read Neverwhere, which predates Del Toro's movie, that this had all been done before. It has been done before Neverwhere of course, with Alice in Wonderland, so the idea is not new. But unlike Lewis Carrol's \\"world below the World\\", Gaiman's \\"London Below\\" didn't read as outrageous enough as I might have hoped.<br /><br />  The first Gaiman book I read was an anthology called Smoke and Mirrors. This was a later work and within the body of it are some really dark, humorous, scary and creative stories. The second book was The Graveyard Book; a children's book and reimagining of Ruyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. That story begins with a brutal murder.

This was his first novel, and his writing since has evolved to where he is, to me, the heir apparent to Ray Bradbury's fantastic universe. So maybe Neverwhere has its place in context within Gaiman's writing as a fledgling work; an example of a writer's early promise to give us a vision much darker, humorous, biting, and fantastical than this first novel.<br /><br />  Neverwhere is a good but not great read and is missing the qualities I've come to enjoy in Gaimain's work. It's crafted well enough in its premise to make me think twice about Richard Mayhew and Door, and why homeless people feed pigeons...because the pigeons can see them.ess in creating the London below was entertaining, and its unfortunate that conceptually something like Guillermo Del Toro's movie Hellboy 2 appears to have used this idea of \\"a world below and beneath the World\\" as its background, because I couldn't help but feel as I read Neverwhere, which predates Del Toro's movie, that this had all been done before. It has been done before Neverwhere of course, with Alice in Wonderland, so the idea is not new. But unlike Lewis Carrol's \\"world below the World\\", Gaiman's \\"London Below\\" didn't read as outrageous enough as I might have hoped.         The first Gaiman book I read was an anthology called Smoke and Mirrors. This was a later work and within the body of it are some really dark, humorous, scary and creative stories. The second book was The Graveyard Book; a children's book and reimagining of Ruyard Kipling's The Jungle Book. That story begins with a brutal murder.

0385534639|4.0|The last 50 pages of this novel bumped my rating up to 4 stars rather than the 3 I had intended on giving it. The Night Circus is the highly (overly) hyped debut novel from Erin Morgenstern that revolves around a magical circus. Labeled a love story, for the two protagonists do indeed fall in love, I never really felt the love or the magic of the circus draw me into the novel. Instead, I spent most of my time waiting for the \\"really good part.\\" It never really came until the last 50 pages which contained some lovely poetic insight into human nature (magic or no).<br /><br />The Night Circus is a special circus that appears without warning, without notice and is open only between the hours of dusk and dawn. Circus-goers quickly find that this particular circus is special...whether they recognize the magic contained within depends on their particular perception skills. The magic of the circus is supported by Celia and Marcos, two magical people pitted against each other in a sort of magician's competition, although the stakes are far higher than you might think.<br /><br />Of course Celia and Marcos fall in love. But the binds of the circus and the competition conspire to keep them apart.<br /><br />It was just an average read for me, although with all the great ratings this book is garnering, it might just reflect my different reading tastes.  There were certainly a few parts I enjoyed, but not enough to look for excuses to sit down and read some more. If a sequel were to be written (and as far as I know, there's not) I likely wouldn't buy it.

1401923127|5.0|I was fortunate to take a one day seminar with Dr. Bruise Lipton as the speaker. What he showed, in slide form, was basically his book, the Biology of Belief....    Just like the book, his lecture was a fascinating mixture of wit, brilliance, and facts to make people's brains s t r e a c h.   A great read if you want to know what a man came up with from literally being intimate with \\"the cell\\" for 20 years and coming up with the concept (very quantum theory ish) that the cells --even when separated-- knew exactly what the other cells were feeling... think about it and much more with this great read.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I am another wishing for a HD version of the original prints - George said he doesn't have them any longer, and I am inclined at this point to not believe him... Yes, these are his movies, and yes, he can do as he wishes with them (which he has, again and again and again...), but to ignore the *original* originals, to say there is \\"not enough interest\\" is both short-sighted and arrogant. This isn't an issue of messing with someone's childhood memories - Star Wars was a game-changer for the industry, and for people who still love it enough 30+ years later to cry foul, people who have well-lined Lucas' pockets with their so-called lack of interest. The last Star Wars copies I bought were the \\"definitve\\" Laserdisc collection (15?) years ago, and that's not likely to change anytime soon.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I received this as a gift for my 29th Birthday. I am an avid gamer. I play a wide range of games like Minecraft, Infamous, World of Goo, CoD, Need For Speed, Boxing and RTS games. I have a PC, Xbox 360, a PS3 and a Wii. This is by far the most fun I have had with a game in a LONG time. It sometimes does not read what you are doing 100%, but it is 1000% more accurate and user friendly than the Wii.     The Voice commands are great for watching Videos or just quickly navigating the dashboard. There are not too many games out for it, but The Kinect Sports is by far the best I have played so far. My S.O. is pumped about it too. She never likes to play games with me and we have been having a blast with this.     Over all, if you have an Xbox, you should own one of these. It looks like there are several games that will utilize the Kinect that do not require it, so I could see this being something that will be really fun to have in the future as well.

B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Review by Kai<br />EMBRACE YOU<br /><br />Lady Antebellum wasn't new on the music scene when they stole the hearts of many worldwide with \\"Need You Now.\\" However, it was the aforementioned that gained them the respect they worked so hard for. The country group received much appreciation for their harmonic and pure singing filled with raw emotion that reaches the soul of anyone who dares to listen. Should there be an individual to deny that fact then they obviously don't know what good (meaningful) music sounds like. With \\"Need You Now\\" embedded into the minds of many, the trio certainly had one of the most anticipating albums of the year, in country music that is. However, did they deliver and satisfy the wait with \\"Own the Night?\\" We'll see after I dissect their precious piece of art.<br /><br />\\"We Owned the Night\\" is a song about a deep and electrifying love. It's a mix between alternative rock and traditional country. The guitar tune is on fire but there's not much else going on. You'll only find interest in the song's deep meaning and will probably disregard the arrangement of the instruments. The vocals aren't as captivating or intense as they often sound. However, it's a sweet track nonetheless and I don't mind a second listen.<br /><br />The lead single, \\"Just a Kiss\\", established high expectations for the album. From start to finish you're taking in by the heartwarming passion in their voices that blends so smoothly with the backing music. The song's about finding a new love and not rushing into anything right on but instead taking it slow in order to preserve the little things like butterflies in the stomach (if you get my drift). The music video takes on a different concept; however, the romance is depicted well in accordance with the song's purpose.<br /><br />This group surely knows how to write, well that's also expected of country singers. Is it not? \\"Dancin' Away with My Heart\\" has beautiful and blissful lyrics as showcased in any Lady A song. The track tells the story of a past love that still holds strong meaning in one's life; it's absolutely relatable because most, if not all of us, still remembers that one special love from our youthful days. The song is rather mellow and swaying a bit, but that only makes it more tasteful. The music is well arranged and Hillary sounds so sensual in this one.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night\\" is one of the more hard hitting, heavy rock songs on the album. It's much more fun and entertaining, not so much as sad, lonely, or overflowing with romance like the previous. It definitely lives up to the title, and we all know what Friday night means: unwind from the long week, go partying, shopping, just letting lose and having fun. That's exactly what this track signifies and I appreciate the fact that a song like this is included on the record.<br /><br />\\"When You Were Mine\\" takes us back to the place where \\"Dancin' Away with My Heart\\" took us. The song's about a past experience with a love that was thought to be passionate and long lasting. The words spoken seemed promising and true but in the end the love died. The track's main purpose is about reminiscing. It's also about the \\"what ifs\\". I really like how the instruments sound together and the harmonies. It's a very catchy song but I'm beginning to hear too much repetition of the same concept in the songs. And that can get a bit tiring for me.<br /><br />\\"Cold as Stone\\" is very slow paced and depressing, but I like it because the words are true and heartfelt. The song's about going through a painful heartbreak. No matter how much time passes the hurt still lingers on. It's a beautiful but sorrowful track that I keep on repeat. I'm deeply caught up in their voices driven by so much emotion, especially by the end of the song. And the ending melodies are very soulful and dramatic.<br /><br />I love how \\"Singing Me Home\\" taps into a little acoustic r&b. It's the kind of music you hear playing at a caf&eacute;. My interpretation is that the song's about appreciating the lover in your life; enjoying every second you're with them. It's an upbeat track to revive the heart after listening to \\"Cold as Stone.\\" Their track listing is just beyond intriguing. But then again, it works for me because after bawling your eyes out over a love lost, you get to put a smile back on your face knowing you have a special someone in your life.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, I thought I wouldn't fall in love with another song like \\"Just a Kiss\\" but here comes \\"Wanted you more\\" to take my breath away. The song's similar to \\"When You Were Mine\\" but there's something that differentiate the two: intensity. \\"Wanted you more\\" is about investing your all into a love that turned out to be merely one sided. You gave your all only to discover that your all wasn't good enough. This song is now my ultimate favorite on the entire album. I will not take that back. I am certain.<br /><br />Hillary owns \\"As You Turn Away\\". The song continues the breakup concept and further unravels the details of a relationship ending. One is obviously still hanging on but there's nothing left to hang on to. The instruments are arranged in such a theatrical way that there's no denying the magnitude of the effort placed into them. The song encompasses your heart in a way you are incapable of resisting. That's the kind of music I'm yearning to hear from musicians these days.<br /><br />\\"Love I've found In You\\" speeds up the pace of the album and goes back into the happy and cheery side of the album. The song, as expressed in the title, is about the new and incredible love discovered in the one you're with. As stated before, the concept switches back and forth from sad and depressing to romantic and fun. I like how it surprises you instead of being formally structured. Not to mention the song is catchy.<br /><br />Here we go again, back to the sorrowful side. \\"Somewhere Love Remains\\" is about fighting to rediscover the feelings they used to feel for each other before giving up and calling it quits. One is hoping that the other can remember the love and happy times they've shared. Sometimes it's best to try again and not throw in the towel but only if \\"love remains\\".<br /><br />With all this back and forth between sad to happy, I wondered how they would conclude the record. And thankfully, it ends unexpectedly about the beauty of love. \\"Heart of the World\\" depicts the different issues faced daily in relationships but at the end of the day, they hold on to their love and continue to cherish each other and every thing they've built together. This song touches me spiritually and emotionally because of the depth of the words. I close off by quoting myself, \\"this group surely knows how to write...\\"<br /><br />From finding love to suffering from heartbreaks, you name it and Lady Antebellum's got it on their new album. \\"Own the Night\\" is a remarkable effort by the trio and I cannot express enough how they've played with my emotions on every single track. I felt like crying then felt like smiling, and vice versa. They certainly confused the hell out of me because I wasn't sure if the hopeless romantic would ever find true love.  However, Lady A left us with a happing ending to their depressing stories and it turned out to be sweetly impressive. \\"Own the Night\\" gets a rating of 4.9/5econd you're with them.

B001GCUO16|1.0|Rumor is there are problems with the BluRay version. It won't play on many BluRay players. This is the first BluRay out of many that has not played on my HP laptop. It pissed me off as I was anticpating watching this thing all day. In the end I watched some episodes of the British show 'Shameless' which was pretty damn entertaining. I will be sending this BluRay back and just suffer through the DVD version.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|First of all, I can't even remember what prompted me to buy this for the Kindle - after reading it, I couldn't imagine what prompted me to buy it at all.  I should've gotten the sample, because I guarantee it wouldn't have taken me its whole length to decide against this book.    The only saving grace is the world of witches, vampires and demons.  I like how they are categorized and given their unique talents/weaknesses - but then it ends for me.      I have always wanted to write a book - and at least this one makes me think I can, and get published.  The prose is crap, the dialogue is stilted and cliche.  We spend more time reading about what the main character (Diana) is eating than anything else.  She makes these terrible discoveries about herself - that she's basically a vessel of enormous destructive power - but let's not talk about that - let's talk about her vampire love or the tea she drank that morning.      The plot has already been covered enough - I just wanted to be yet another voice of warning.      Don't buy this book.

B0055S348W|1.0|First, one would assume he (she) would have some measure of success with any app or program downloaded for what ever device you are purchasing an application for.  This app is a HUGE dissappointment.  Thank goodness it was free and not 12.95 (which by my standards an extreme price for any app.      I downloaded the app, and it installed just fine.  It also runs fine, however, my printer is a Kodak Easyshare printer and is wi-fi.  Upon running the app for the first time, the app did locate my printer but told me I needed to download a driver pack for it which it immediatly failed to find.  I decided to manually select my printer.  There was not a driver pack for my particular printer.  As stated I have a Kodak and it is a popular model and only like 2 years old.  Still no driver pack for it.  Now I only have one option, download the PC software and install it to my printer so my android can talk to the software, and the software can relay all material needing to be printed to my connected printer.    I went to printershare's extremely sluggish website, found the Windows 32 bit Vista download and started the download.  It took over an hour to save the software package to my computer. My connection speed is 10MB down so this should have been completed in a matter of minutes NOT an hour.  After saving this to my desktop, I attempted to run and install said software package and Windows told me this was not a valid Win32 Application and failed right out of the gate.  So, to make a long story short, this piece of technology is pure junk.

Stop shoving down things down our throat. We liked the movie the way it was! I was going to buy this. It would have been the third star wars set that i bought. But after hearing the NOOOOO that was added, I just felt disgusted and cheated. Hopefully when lucas retires or something... whoever takes over lucasfilm will have the power to rerelease the original trilogy untouched. Or atlease make it a branching bluray.
B0055S348W|5.0|Printershare is a file based app that sends its rendered pages to a printer via a wifi or bluetooth network.This app will be a lot more functional if it also installs as a printer device which can communicate with the apps. My initial experience is exclusively printing pdf files, the app really works as advertized with no additional functionality such as reformatting the content or deleting the graphics. Herewith as some of the pointers/wishes that I've come up with:<br /><br />Installation:<br /><br />1. Install printershare.<br />2. Wifi/bluetooth sharing, turn on wifi/bluetooth and printer.<br />3. Run printershare. Select nearby printing via wifi/bluetooth.<br />4. Printershare finds your printer and will need to download the driver.<br />5. Files to be printed are all located in the sd folders. Printershare will show all the contents of the folders.<br />6. PDF files will require download of rendering software.<br /><br />Observations/wish list:<br /><br />1. Files can be previewed before printing.<br />2. Pages can be selectively printed.<br />3. No option for directly sending files to printer.<br />4. No option to run in the background to print screen.<br />5. No running service feature.<br />6. Apps cannot send data directly to printershare. It must be able to create and store the data in the sd card first.<br />7. Android 2.2 does not have a printer entity that can be linked to all apps.
B00441GYZQ|1.0|One can't help wondering over and over during this interminable film if a good, or even just a better, actor might have been able to make something of this role, given it some nuance, some interest, made us think he was anything more than a compulsive self-lacerating sicko.  Ford's cretinous scowl overwhelms the movie. Wonderful as she is, Scott Thomas can't get any other expression out of him. I'm convinced that some of the one shots were filmed when the two of them weren't even on the set at the same time  -  or the same day.  Scott Thomas' very natural, non-accented American accent is impeccable; the only problem with it is that she doesn't sound like anyone from New Hampshire, the state she supposedly represents in Congress. Much of the sound track is made up of very pretty scraps of music (played on trumpet with Harmon mute in the 1950s style of Miles Davis) that might have been written by Michel Legrand on Valium.  They take your mind off what little is happening on screen.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I understand why everyone is cheesed off about not having the originals release on the blu rays. I personally grew up with the special editions, but my love for star wars grew. I have seen the original and special and well jsut about every release there has been ha ha! I love them all all equal though! I mean come one! It's STAR WARS. The greatest series ever created. I collected the games, books, and movies. I'm so excited to recieve my star wars blu ray saga simply, because I love star wars literally more than anything. It is the ONE thing that I started as a child (6 years old was my first viewing of a new hope on) and managed to keep until present day of 19. SOOOOOOOOOO many things have come and gone during those years, but one thing will stay forever...and that is STAR WARS.
B0058S0OMS|5.0|I'm no expert on transfers considering I'm new to the blu-ray world, but the picture looks fine and the audio seems excellent. The alternate ending is the one used on the television version from the 80's and 90's. There are about 6 or 7 deleted/alternate scenes that are pretty much character bits that extend the plot. No additions to the kill scenes as most of these scenes take place in the first half of the movie.<br />  The \\"Terror in the Aisles\\" documentary is okay, but it's little more than a collage of films from the Halloween 2 era. It's broken up into subject chapters, but more audience reactions than types of horror movies.<br />  Overall it was well worth $13 and I'm not complaining about the look and sound. It's probably hard to get a great transfer from a 30-year-old flick without painstaking hours and years to work on it.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I've used several FM transmitters years ago to broadcast signals from my mp3 player to my stereo system, the only problem was the constant interference I'd receive from living in a densely populated city (Los Angeles). Because of this, I've been using an aux to cassette adapter for years but even that has finally broken so I decided to try one last FM transmitter. Boy was I surprised!  The sound comes out clean (though at high volumes a little crackly) and I can finally enjoy STEREO! One grip I have is how short the 3.5mm aux cord is that comes with the unit but you can always buy a longer one for a few bucks more. Also the customer support is fantastic and responds within a day of any issues or complaints.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|Okay, I'll admit ... this is a gripe, not a review ... get over it.    So here's Lucas in a nutshell ... he is an innovator, a creator, a story writer ... what he is NOT is a filmmaker, at least, not since his original STAR WARS.  For all he knows how to drive people to achieve technical miracles, for all he knows how to create an alternate galaxy ... he does NOT know how to translate that to a screenplay or a final film.  Lucas' BEST work was when he gave control over to Irvin Kershner for EMPIRE.  His WORST work was when he took FULL control over the prequels.  The writing in the prequels was outright atrocious, because Lucas doesn't understand the difference between dialogue and stage direction, having characters utter lines like \\"I'm just so in love with you,\\" rather than writing that in the margins of the script and letting the actors communicate that feeling with their performance.    And so we arrive at the worst change THIS go-around (for you know there will ALWAYS be another revision as long as Lucas lives).  Vader, when finally choosing to save his son by casting the evil Emperor into the abyss utters a quiet \\"no\\" as if to himself, and then a larger \\"nooooo\\" as if to make sure the Emperor understands he ain't happy!      Now, \\"nooooooo\\" should INDEED be what Vader is THINKING in this moment.  But to actually SAY it, and to say it so melodramatically ... that's the problem - that's where Lucas just flat out does not understand actors, dialogue, or even audiences!  We don't NEED to hear Vader make the decision out loud by saying \\"no\\" - his ACTION communicates everything.  His looking back and forth, slowly at first, then faster and faster until the audience is finally shouting \\"DO IT ... DO IT!!!\\"  ... it builds, we see it building ... and then he does it, and we scream with joy!  \\"Yes!! Finally!!!\\"      Do we REALLY need to add a \\"noooooo\\" to this scene?  No, we do not ... to do so is an insult to the audience.  And it, once again, shows us that Lucas doesnot know how to make a movie.  Plain ... and ... simple ... This sequence, in its original form, was a testament to the director (Richard Marquand), the actors, and the film editor, because the audience was able to figure out exactly what was going on in Vader's mind without him uttering one syllable.  That is ruined now...      Will I buy this set?  Will I overlook this destructive campaign of revision after revision for the sake of a few extra lines of resolution on my screen?    NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
B005DZMODI|1.0|I was waiting for this record since I couldn't buy the tickets for the concerts. It was a disappointment what I got after this time waiting.  Very deficient sound. It looks like this records you buy in the middle of the concert and pick up when the concert had finished.  I don't understand how this couple of great musicians accepted such a thing.
0553386794|2.0|It's not a bad book but it's not a great book. Like some of the other reviewers I agree, that I was less than satisfied with the turn of events. I also agree Martin has a little too much sex in the book, and describes it like some badly written romance novel.
0545259088|2.0|Shiver was a great book.  My daughter read it and loved it so I followed suit.  Now when it came to Linger - it was an iffy book - not bad but not great.  This book Forever was not a good conclusion to a decent trilogy.  I agree with another of the reviewers that recommended reading Shiver and stopping there, or you are welcome to go as far as Linger.

0545123267|5.0|I first saw this book about a year ago, and the blue writing intrigued me.  But I never got around to buying it until I saw the complete hardback collection series in one of my favorite book stores one day.  It was an impulsive purchase of sorts, but worth it.  Sure, the set was almost $60, but even after reading just one book, I know that was the best $60 I'd spent in a long time.    WARNING:  SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW.    SHIVER starts out with Grace's wolf attack, and her first meeting Sam.  It quickly fast forwards from there to a scene from Sam's \\"last summer\\" and him spotting Grace in a bookstore.  The action picks up after a few more chapters with Grace discovering hunters were hunting the wolves; her wolf.  And she finds him, human, on her back deck.  There was a bond between Grace and Sam from the moment she'd seen his eyes on the day she was bitten.  That bond showed throughout every chapter Sam and Grace spent together.    Shelby was a [I have a potty mouth].  I was disappointed that she didn't die when Grace's dad shot her.      I didn't like Jack that well.  But, even so, I was sad that he died.  It seemed a little unfair.  Isabel got on my nerves a little with her sarcasm, but I warmed up to her towards the end.  I had to keep myself from crying during the scene after the car crash, where Sam hugs Grace mere seconds before he shifts into a wolf and then vanishes.  It was a heart-wrenching, stomach-twisting scene, and, I think, when a book can bring those kinds of emotions from me, it's a good book.  And in the end, when Sam steps out from the woods, human...I felt the tears return.  This was a wonderful book, and I would recommend it to everyone.   I'm immediately opening LINGER after I post this review!!     Just a warning:  the hardbacks of all these books are WHITE WHITE WHITE.  I've left the covers on (and done my best to not damage them) because the first time I took it off, I laid the book down on a table, and it stained the back.  So, caution to thosewho buy the hardback books.  Easily stainable.    EmmKays
B0055S348W|1.0|I was pretty excited when I saw thus app. After scanning my WiFi, and finding my printer, even more so. Unfortunately it needed to download the driver for my printer, and gave me a listing to find it. But there are NO Dell printers listed! Please update!
B0055S348W|4.0|I got this on sale a few months ago (after printing a test page) and don't regret it (even though it's now being offered as a free app of the day).  I don't think it's worth the full $12.95, but it worked as advertised on my myTouch 4G and Canon MX860 (after I downloaded the driver, of course). And it saved me once when I absolutely needed to print something at home for a meeting, so I've gotten my money's worth right there. The formatting on the Word document I printed wasn't exactly right (the spacing was a little off) but was fine for my purposes. And when I printed a lengthy PDF it stopped after about 9 pages - though those pages came out fine. It's not super fast, but good enough.<br /><br />Based on my research at the time, there didn't seem to be any good free printing options. I did a test of ePrint but it didn't work with my printer, and PrintBot didn't list my printer (and for that one you send your docs through their servers, which I wasn't keen on). And Canon's app (at least at the time) only worked for photos/images and didn't list my printer. There is also at least one app that works with Google Cloud print, but I just wanted to print directly, and PrinterShare works with that as well (according to the Android Market description).<br /><br />Also, I saw a couple reviews here that said there are monthly fees to print - I've never been asked to pay more. Apparently, according to the dev's response in a comment, that is for remote printing only (i.e., printing from anywhere and from anyone) using the computer software, not using PrinterShare.
0553801473|5.0|I am in the process of reading this book, with about 200 pages to go.  So far, it has been as good or better than all the other Ice and Fire books.  It is interesting that some of the pov chapters are from characters somewhat previously unknown to us.  As is typical of George, he throws us a few really startling surprises.  I have loved this book so far and will anxiously await the next one.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Oh, what a great book! It had me guessing all the way to the end. Just about the time I think I've got it figured out, another twist will be thrown in that would completely blow my theory and send me in another direction.

Just when you think Buddy is going to start going down hill due to his age , he just gets better. Just been to my 12th Buddy show , and he hasn't lost a thing. If you've never seen him before ,you owe it to youself to see him live. He is the ultimate showman . I've never seen a bad Buddy show.He enjoys every show. Clapton says he is the best guitarist in the world. Get this CD !

B004DMIIVO|5.0|I've loved Mamoru Hosada's work ever since i saw The Girl Who Leapt Through Time and I think Summer Wars is his best film to date.  It's funny and heartwarming and the story really does a great job of building to a narrative climax at the end.  The film is also highly relevant today when so many of the things we do day to day are controlled by computers.  It's very worthwhile to watch and I'd recommend it to anyone.  It feels great just remembering the story again.
B005974CNA|5.0|Well, if this isn't the most anticipated Dream Theater album yet.<br /><br />There were serious doubts about whether DT would be able to carry-on without long-time drummer Mike Portnoy. It was him, after all, who played an integral role is establishing the band and making them what they are today. After Scenes from a Memory, though, his role as Dream Theater's drummer extended into other areas, like \\"manager,\\" \\"producer,\\"  \\"spokesperson\\" and, bizarrely enough, \\"frontman\\". For many, especially those fans who'd only come around recently, Mike Portnoy was Dream Theater. For others, Mike's ever-extending reach into the affairs of the band had less positive connotations; for some, Mike was thought to be a creative-dictator from the drum-stool, someone who's unchecked decision making was stifling the band's creativity and leading Dream Theater further and further down a path of a caricatured and sterilized existence.<br /><br />And then, suddenly, Mike Portnoy quit and none of it mattered anymore.<br /><br />Mike Portnoy is out, and Mike Mangini is in. In the context of the controversy summed up above, this could mean two things: for some, it means the death of DT. For others, it means a second chance at doing something worthwhile again. But did this swap spur jolt of much-needed energy into the band, or have the funeral meats coldly furnish the marriage table?  Thankfully, we have A Dramatic Turn of Events to insure us that all has been put to rights in the Dream Theater world.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"On the Backs of Angels\\", a song most fans no-doubt heard months ago. Merely listening to the intro brings chills down one's spine, maybe because of its similarity with the intro of another song fans know well: \\"Pull Me Under\\". The similarities end there, though, and before you know it Rudess, Petrucci, Myung and Mangini break out into an epic riff that sees all four members playing around each other in a way that reminds one of some of Yes' best instrumental work.<br /><br />But lest DT be accused of trying to tread the same ground that make Images and Words a hit again, the next song \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" is a completely departure from anything the band have done previously. It's got a hip-hop beat, somewhat harsh vocals from James LaBrie, and some of the best string patches Jordan Rudess has ever used on a Dream Theater album. It's a nice tune, but nowhere near the best on the album. Those come in the second half.<br /><br />\\"Bridges in the Sky,\\" \\"Outcry,\\" and \\"Beneath The Surface\\", all clocking in just a bit  over ten minutes, are DT \\"epics\\" in the truest sense. What's most impressive about these three long songs is that they accomplish more in 10 minutes as \\"epics\\" that what much longer recent compositions (i.e. \\"A Nightmare to Remember\\", \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\", \\"The Shattered Fortress\\") were able to do with 15-20 minutes. Indeed, Dream Theater have managed to trim back some of the excesses and write long songs that do not manage to loose their punch at any point here.<br /><br />And then, there are the ballads, \\"This is the Life\\", \\"Far From Heaven\\" and \\"Breaking All Illusions.\\" Much in the vein of the last album's \\"Wither,\\" these three songs all manage to put songwriting before instrumental fireworks. The pay-off is great, leading this album to be one of the most successful stylistically varied DT albums out there. Imagine \\"Octavarium\\", only if \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" were actually really good. Maybe it's just me, but I almost here a Blackfied-esque Steve Wilson influence in some of these songs.<br /><br />In terms of individual performances, all 5 members are firing on all cylinders. The days of an audible John Myung have returned, and thankfully he's doing more now that just doubling Petrucci. The bass attack on this album is really just fantastic. Petrucci, of course, is as great as ever, with this album representing some of his most technical playing yet. James LaBrie is sounding great, much more akin to the way he sounds on his solo albums than any recent DT release, and Rudess is better utilized than ever--not surprising, he's being considered the album's MVP at Dream Theater's unofficial fansite. Finally, there's the new guy. As others have noted, Mangini does sound a bit low in the mix, especially compared to Mike Portnoy's prominently mixed drumming. But his playing is phenomenal nonetheless--those who listen closely to what he's doing will have no choice but to admit that they are listening to the best drumming on any DT record yet.<br /><br />Sure, there are some problems. The lyrics, while still possibly a step up back to the level maybe of those on Six Degrees, are still not the best the band have done. The album's also a bit unbalanced--the first four tracks are nowhere near as good as the last five. While none of them are bad, per se, after repeated listens it does start to seem like all the best material arrives 30 minutes in. If there's one song I don't like, it's \\"Lost Not Forgotten,\\" but even that has its killer moments.<br /><br />DT fans should really just let this album sink in. Those who've stuck with the band for the last two albums really deserve it. This is, without a doubt, DT tapping into the magick potential you only managed to hear a peep of through songs like \\"The Count of Tuscany\\" and \\"In the Presence of Enemies pt. One\\".lo albums than any recent DT release, and Rudess is better utilized than ever--not surprising, he's being considered the album's MVP at Dream Theater's unofficial fansite.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|Juliet Naked is so much more than the titillating title which is what I should have expected from Nick Hornby.  This novel confirms him as one of my favorite writers.    As with all of his novels, the writing is transparent, so breezy that it can't contain any weight.  And yet it does, always.  His sense of humor is so wry and yet makes you laugh out loud, truly, not the LOL variety where no real laughing is done.  His observations about the human condition are insightful.  In this case one of his characters gets to actually voice them.  Actually, two of his characters do, but from different perspectives.    I did find the character of Jackson a bit irritating.  It was the only character that felt a bit off.  There is quite a wonderful soup of characters.  This is certainly not my favorite Nick Hornby novel, nor is it his worse.    Read it.  Have some fun.  Get more than you expect from the writing while having that fun.

0553386794|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the excellent first installment in George R.R. Martin's epic A Song of Ice And Fire series. It introduces the continent of Westeros, where the fifteen year peace between seven kingdoms under King Robert Baratheon is growing tenuous. Add to this the stirring of malevolent supernatural forces in the wilds of the north, the reappearance of the exiled bloodline of the Mad King whom King Robert overthrew to gain control of the continent, and an impending winter as long and brutal as an ice age, and it's easy to understand how Martin's tale ballooned from a trilogy to an expected seven volumes.<br /><br />Martin sews this expansive tapestry with eight narrative threads. Six belong to the House of Stark from the northern most kingdom of Winterfell. The Starks find themselves in the center of the quickly escalating tensions in Westeros and are torn apart by duty, betrayal, and fate. Daenerys, the end of the usurped Mad King's bloodline, is wed to the leader of a nomadic people, the Dothraki in a misbegotten attempt by her brother to raise an army to take back the crown, and struggles to persevere amongst these brutal tribes in a land a sea away from Westeros. Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister the dwarf brother of the nefarious Cersie, who is married to King Robert, slowly rises from black sheep to a central player in the Lannister power grab.<br /><br />While Martin's story is certainly complicated, it's told with a style and structure that beguiles and delights, always drawing the reader further in with fast pacing and clean prose. Comparisons to J.R.R. Tolkien are not unfounded. But while Martin's world certainly competes with Middle Earth as a fabulously detailed, astoundingly elaborate, carefully constructed fantasy realm, Tolkien's hobbits and dwarves are crude sketches compared to the nuanced, gray shading that goes into Martin's characters. The cast of Martin's saga possess rich inner lives with motivations too human to make most characters simply good or evil. It's the mix of complex characters and a grittily realistic fantasy realm that make Martin's saga so unforgettable and unpredictable.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is as close as fiction gets to being a completely rapturous experience and, upon completing the final chapter, it is a tremendous thrill to know it is only end of the beginning.he mix of complex characters and a grittily realistic fantasy realm that make Martin's saga so unforgettable and unpredictable.

B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I know some people didn't like this movie because it was not as historically accurate as the older BBC four hour production. I liked it though and the music is amazing as well as sounding period correct. I love this CD, it was a good buy and it got to me really fast!
B0052WSX32|5.0|This beautifully sung album is honestly 1000% better than what I expected! Her voice is gorgeous on every single song.  I was also over the moon with MY BUDDY because I just got a new cat and I named him Buddy and didn't have this song that I so dearly love. [I'm very lucky.] This album is so PERFECT and full of musical surprises. Like Doris singing YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL. The biggest surprise of all is Doris Day's son Terry Melcher singing HAPPY ENDINGS. [Song written by Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher] I was so deeply touched by the combination of his beautiful voice and the tender heartfelt lyric that I just cried through the whole song. This album is a great album that I will enjoy for the rest of my life.  My girlfriend Amanda met Doris Day and loves her, and she was thrilled with this CD too. Now I have to hunt around for more songs sung by Terry Melcher!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|By all means one of my favorite games.  Some updates with new levels and challenges would be great.  Still a definite five star game.
B005E7AOHI|4.0|I have always loved Les Claypool, I have all his cds, movies, books, etc. This album is good but it seems like it takes a lot from the other Primus songs. For example, Tradey's A Comin' has the same basic lines as Bodacious on Anti Pop. The album as a whole though is still Les and I still really enjoyed it but honestly I like his solo stuff more. Much more indie and less commercial.

B001E3AXGS|5.0|Ms. Goodwin has done an admirable job of presenting the challenges of the nation and the Lincoln administration during the trying times of the Civil War. The biographical data on any one of the contentious members of Lincoln's cabinet is sufficient for a stand- alone book. To piece them all together in the context of competing egos and aspirations is truly remarkable. This work fully depicts the genius of Lincoln in marshalling the enormous talents of those who, in many cases, would depose him.     William Seward is shown growing from a self- important \\"prime minister\\" to an essential ally of Lincoln in his efforts to win the war, and to preserve the republic. Chase, hostile toward Lincoln to the end, provided an indispensible service in providing the treasure necessary to the Union effort. This book is a necessary read for those wishing to understand the fractious nature of politics and politicians in the conduct of government during perilous times.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I feel like I can finally FULLY enjoy my Kinect. My small, nay, tiny apartment space was really limiting my gameplay experience with the Kinect. After using the Zoom for the first time with UFC Personal Trainer, I was able to perform certain workouts that the Kinect normally couldn't read correctly in my small living room space. I literally stood 3 to 4 feet in front of the Kinect and it read every gesture and movement accurately. I definitely recommend this product if you're struggling using the Kinect in a small apartment living room/medium sized dorm room. I really didn't have issues with gesture tracking at all. Gesture tracking was about the same as it was before i used the Zoom. I can't wait to try Zoom with other games. I say...very good product!
1609611543|5.0|This book is quite the eye opener. I highly recommend everyone read this book. Very informative, and the anecdotes throughout offer proof that what the author claims about wheat really rings true.
1400049628|2.0|Just like many novelty songs (e.g. Macarena) I enjoyed this immensely to start with, but unfortunately you soon get sick of it & end up hating it. The reason for this is that this book tries to survive on one long running joke. So after I was only a quarter of the way through this \\"one trick pony\\" it had already descended into tedium for me.  Brooks rates every type of weapon to use against zombies in depth including obsolete & obscure weapons, then he rates which is the best terrain, then the best buildings to go to, best vehicles to escape in so on & so forth. He also gives an extensive list of equipment you should acquire when you are holed up, then he gives another extensive list of equipment you should carry in your backpack when you're on the move, then another separate list of equipment you should carry if you're part of a group etc, very repetitive & tedious.  Finally Brooks documents \\"recorded\\" outbreaks of zombies which is a little more interesting.  To be fair the book is titled \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" and it is exactly that. I also really enjoyed the first 20 pages when the joke was fresh. Also for an instruction manual it's easy to read, but for me it just became way too tedious too quickly.  Finally I couldn't workout whether zombies can climb or not as Brooks says if you drop anchor they'll climb up your anchor rope but in any other scenario they're not very good at climbing, this didn't make sense to me. I don't know if I'm missing something or if the contradiction is meant to be a joke.  Whilst I don't recommend this book there are many favorable reviews for this on Amazon so read a few different reviews before making up your mind.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|\\"Noooo!\\" made for a great meme. Fans had already given up long before ROTS came out, so the emphatic \\"Noooo!\\" that Vader lets out at the end of the film was a great target to laugh at. It was so over-the-top stupid, it was the pinnacle of Lucas' total inability to write a script, or create drama worthy of something outside of a children's cartoon. Seriously, remember it? The guy falls to his knees with his hands in the air and just cries, \\"Nooo!\\" and that's it. It was hilarious for most people for being so uproariously ridiculous. Most of us Star Wars fans don't acknowledge the prequels as canon, since they all sucked so horribly; we just act like they never existed, and rightfully so.    And, as I'm sure you know by now, someone decided to put that same cry into the very end of Return of the Jedi, the ultimate climax that left everyone breathless. If it's not clear yet what everyone's talking about, they added in the voice-over to the final scene in Return of the Jedi when Vader stops the Emperor from killing his son. It was a scene that was perfect in every way, stunningly emotional, showing us that Vader was never completely lost to the influence of the Emperor. Again, after the original version, it left everyone breathless. Well, it still does that, but for a very, very different reason: It makes the whole scene retarded, and ruins the entire film. If you're unfortunate enough not to know this is the case and purchased the Blu-rays blindly, you'll be in for a very depressing surprise. I believe that, much like the prequels, this is one version of Star Wars, along with the others that were totally unnecessary cash-ins, that we will pretend never happened. It's best for everyone that way.
B00466H3F4|5.0|The critical acclaim for this movie was unlike any given to a G-rated attraction in many, many years. Kenneth Turan described it as \\"the closest to perfection ever achieved in the making of a movie\\". Dozens of other reviewers declared that it was the first time that a film from another producer had matched the charm and inspiration of the first Disney movies (Snow White, Pinocchio, etc.)    This praise was wholeheartedly justified for a movie which deserves a place next to Disney's best and The Wizard of Oz among Hollywood's most beloved family perennials. What is truly marvelous is that the filmmakers had enough confidence in their story that they believe it can stand alone without the joke book jokes and phony Broadway type musical numbers that plague today's children's films. And that story concludes in a way so touching that it left tears in my eyes in a theater for the first time in my adult life.    It was wonderful that it received a special effects Oscar, but it was a crime that one was not awarded to Christopher Noonan. His direction resulted in the staging of scenes of such charm and visual poetry that they, in their own sentimental way, leave images as memorable as those from Ford, Hitchcock and Scorsese.    This is the first movie that my wife and I ever saw together, and I regard it as a once in a generation film that can create an atmosphere of love for anyone seeing it together.    (You will see a lot of reviews here with complaints about the advertising content of earlier DVD packages from Universal. The Blu-Ray can be purchased with complete confidence as the ad content is minimal and easily avoided.)
B0055S348W|4.0|I've been looking for an app that would let me print from my tablet.  I have software that can draw pictures, edit photos, receive e-mail, view web pages, and compose Office documents, but until now, I had to transfer these files to my PC to print them.<br /><br />My printer is an HP Officejet Pro L7650, which has both a network connection and Bluetooth.  The help docs for this app claim this is a supported printer.  I tested this app on a Motorola Xoom tablet and an HTC Evo 3D.<br /><br />Connecting the printer using WiFi was relatively painless and I was able to print a test document with no problems.  But when I tried connecting to the printer using Bluetooth, the printer would crash every time I tried to print.  I've printed to this printer using Bluetooth before, so I know it works.  When the printer crashed, PrinterShare would hang and I had to kill the app and restart it.<br /><br />I tried printing a couple documents containing embedded fonts and several images.  The result didn't look right; the fonts were all wrong, some of the images were cut off on the bottom and the text ran over the images.  Drawings came out fairly well, as did a photo; odd-sized images end up cropped, however.  Web pages print correctly if you print them from the browser, but if you try printing a web page from the app (by pressing the Web Pages button), they come out blank every time.  Calendar items printed out well, as did Contacts, though the latter was printed with rather large 16 and 20 point type.  The app can print Gmail messages (which it did well, including images), but it's unable to print messages from other e-mail programs.

B0055S348W|3.0|I do not use gmail as my primary email. I cannot figure out how to print my hotmail emails. I would like support of other email clients.
B0055S348W|4.0|Glad it was free. Had to download their renderer library and it never could complete the downloading. It would just recycle. 2 hours wasted.  Update, reformatted the device. Also some time had elapsed since the app was made available. It will now print fine and I need to eat crow and apologize to the developer.
B004DK5CYM|5.0|Everything about this movie is absolutely perfect: cooperation and inclusion of the family, cinematography, soundtrack etc. The end result is a movie that draws you in and keeps you spellbound even though the end result is a well-known part of history. I am not ashamed to say that I have watched this movie numerous times and it doesn't get old!
B0055S348W|5.0|I recently downloaded the HP remote printing app for my ePrint enabled printer at home. Since this is free today I decided to give it a shot. It is way better than the HP app. It works with Gmail, Google Cloud Print, Google Docs, and about every file on your phone's memory. This app simply can't be beat.
B0055S348W|5.0|Please add driver for Brother hl-4070-cdw  Works really well with a number of laser printers I have. I really like there google cloud print feature.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I cancelled my pre-order as soon as I saw the terrible new changes. So Mr Lucas spends time and money adding dodgy CGI and Sound effects, yet does nothing to improve all the previous colour and sound problems that were on the DVD release? Of course there are no cleaned up but un-touched versions of the originals are included - although I never expected that when I first ordered the set. What I did expect was the DVD release with colour and sound corrections- but we are not even offered that. What we get is a tacky mess that has been messed with so many times it has lost what made it special in the first place. Do not buy, we deserve a better product.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This headset is by far the best set for the money. I'm a runner and they are comfortable and sound great. They look and feel delicate but have proved durable. If it had an in-line volume control it would be a 5 star.

B000ZLFALI|3.0|The Beatles are a hot commodity, and with good reason. They started what became known as the \\"British Invasion\\" of the 1960's, and are the most commercially and critically successful group of the modern era. For that reason their song catalogue has been sought out by many industries from Cirque du Soleil to movies. One would think a biopic would have been made about The Beatles by now, but nothing more than the stories of their early years (Backbeat, Nowhere Boy).  While there still hasn't been a biopic about The Beatles, artists have found many interesting ways to utilize and pay tribute to the music of The Beatles. Director Julie Taymor (Frida, The Lion King on Broadway) had a great idea to craft a new musical around The Beatles' song list called Across the Universe. The result was a coming of age story set during American turmoil during the late 1960's and features 33 songs from The Beatles ranging from early classics such as \\"All My Loving\\" and \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand\\" to later tracks such as \\"Oh! Darling\\" and \\"Something\\".  Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), moves from England to New York in an effort to make it as an artist in America and to find his birth father who works at Harvard. While at Harvard he meets a rebellious student there named Max (Joe Anderson) and they become friends, and Max brings him to his home in Dayton, OH where Jude falls in love with Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Things begin to unravel for the group as Max gets drafted for the Vietnam War and Lucy joins an antiwar group.  If anything can be said about Julie Taymor, it's that she is an extremely visual and artistic director. Her visual sense at times lends itself to make elements of the film feel surreal and even avant-garde. She also has a real eye for authenticity. Across the Universe really draws you back to the times of the `60's and her staging of the Detroit race riots and the antiwar riots makes the tension feel palpable. Taymor lends an edge to the film that brings you back to that era, while also representing parallels to today's political climate while not glorifying one side over another.  To me, musicals are always best when actors actually know how to perform and sing their own songs. Adding to that is the fact that most of the actors and actresses in this film are relative unknowns, allowing you to feel their performances more thoroughly. There are several cameos that really steal the show when it comes to performances though. Eddie Izzard has brilliant fun playing Mr. Kite (the circus leader in \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\"), and Joe Cocker plays three different roles (pimp, bum, and hippie) while crooning \\"Come Together\\". Bono steals his scenes as Dr. Robert during an upscale book signing event.  While Taymor has added some brilliant flourishes to this film, her tendencies toward avant-garde and surrealism takes away from the story as a whole. At times the plot feels disjointed and major lapses in the films time frame can cause the viewer to lose focus of exactly what's going on in the narrative. There's also such a huge cast that some of the characters aren't fleshed out as much as they should be. For example, Prudence (TV Carpio) seems to be more of an excuse to use the song \\"Dear Prudence\\" and she's not much more than a closet lesbian throughout the narrative.  Despite its flaws, Across the Universe is a fun and engrossing film. All of the elements are there to appeal to just about anyone: romance, comedy, drama, and even a little action. Visually the film is impeccable. If you're a fan of the music of The Beatles, or you're just looking for a film that gives a little something for everyone I highly recommend that you check this out.  3/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This Blu-Ray saga is a must buy.... I really don't have a problem with Lucas' alterations...It comes with a beautiful book of disks....The bottom line is that it feels nice to own Star Wars in 1080p...Period.
1594744769|4.0|While at the store one day I picked this out knowing nothing about it going in, I just thought it looked intriguing, not like something I've read before, and it was in a rack listed as \\"best sellers,\\" so I thought I would give it a try.  Well, I am glad I did, because I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the concept of it incorporating the old pictures with the story, I feel it heleped to put a better picture in your head while still allowing you to use your imagination.      By the description I read on the back of the book I was expecting this to be more of a haunting ghost type story, but it turned out to be more along of the lines of a fantasy (which is usually a genre I don't read, I've never read any \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"Twlight\\" books), but I still enjoyed this book.  I read this book in a only a few sittings, I wanted to know what would happen next.  And it ends perfectly set up for a sequel, which most likely I will end up reading too.    I will say it did get a little weird toward the end of the book, with the plot unfolding, there was a lot of things to try and wrap your mind around.  Again, maybe this is because I don't really read fantasy books, so it may have been harder for me enjoy the craziness that ensued and pivotal plot lines revealed at the end, but if you are a lover of fantasy books my guess is you will really enjoy this part.    All in all I thought this was a good book, and enjoyed it, I am sure I will read the next book.
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this cuz its expensive and free for the day I don't think im ever going to use it
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No original, unaltered trilogy. No sale. I truly hope George Lucas listens to his most ardent fans and someday releases the films we love so much they way they were in the theaters.
B0055S348W|1.0|It does what it says, and does it fairly well, but the inital price for the app is only the beginning. you get your first 20 pages of printing included, after that it's $5 per 100 or $10 per month. I dont think there are many ways to justify this frill expense, at least not from a business perspective.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I'm one of the only people I know who doesn't own any version of the original trilogy whatsoever.  That's because as free market consumers, we vote with our dollars to let people know what's ok and what's not ok.  This boxset is not ok.  Don't buy it.  Don't buy ANY Star Wars releases until Lucas offers the original piece of motion picture history in it's unedited anamorphic glory as the MAIN attraction and not some bonus material.    Does he seriously not have any idea how much money he'd actually make if he did that? For someone apparently so business-savvy, he's an idiot at paying attention to his target demographic.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is an excellent printer app! Took less than thirty seconds to set up and print my first doc! (EVO 3D) Recognized my networked Canon MP640 almost instantaneously! Love the document menu, extremely simple to navigate and very intuitive UI. Well worth $5-$8, but probably wouldn't pay $12.95. As faotd, this deal can't be beat. Will still recommend at $7.99 price.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Watched a review set of these films on Blu. Haven't seen them since I saw them in the theater and let me tell you, they LOOK fantastic as far as transfer goes and sound fantastic... BUT, these movies didn't get any better over time after a second viewing. I will forever ignore this era of the SW chronology. I know the original SW films seem a bit cheezy coming back to them, but they HOLD UP! These newer films do not. Terrible. Just terrible.
B0055S348W|5.0|Wow this app is great.  I was always wondering if there was a stock way to print to my network printer from the droid x. This answers that question! My lexmark printer is not available for direct wifi printing, but it was very easy to set up the remote desktop printing, so i can now print from anywhere I have a cell connection...sweet!
0385523912|5.0|Wonderful story writing.  I was generally concerned about the characters I was introduced to.  Amazing what some people can live through and are currently living through.
B00144VBBS|5.0|Toby Keith is my favorite CW singer and this CD has a good selection of his big hits - I highly recommend this CD
B0055S348W|4.0|Downloaded this app for free today!  I checked it out by printing out part of my calendar.  Once I heard the printer start printing, I knew that this deal was AWESOME!  Its super easy to use.  My only complaint about it is that you are not able to print yahoo emails.  No big deal since I have a gmail account, but it would have been nice.  Anyway, the app is really good and for the free app of the day, its well worth downloading!
0857204084|5.0|This is a really interesting story, and the audiobook version of it was great!  If you want a very entertaining way of passing the time during your commute, go for this book.
B004A5EWZK|5.0|This is an excellent series and one I plan to view again and again.  Acting, writing and production quality are superb.
B0055S348W|5.0|Took a while to download the drivers for my PC,  but when I did... No problems at all. Great features and love the fact I can print from anywhere.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|For any Harry potter or magical fan, this product is great item to add to your collection or impress company.  It's easy to use and has a really cool and authentic look to it.
1250004349|2.0|I thought the book was terrible.  If it just stayed with the story line about Sarah and the terrible tragic events that occured in 1942 Paris it would have been interesting.  However, the other story line was just plan silly.  It seemed to me to be a story about ossession.
0307987647|1.0|The marketing people released this without ever listening to it.  The prologue sounds more like a tedious prayer recited at church than a rousing good tale that grips you and doesn't let you go.  God awful performance and it just may be the director's fault.  If only someone had thought to read with feeling rather than recite an epic.  Too bad!  Maybe they'll release a version that the book deserves.  This one is for the dustbin.
B0036T32LQ|2.0|I found this movie most frustrating and irritating like Groundhog Day - that must be the most awful way to go on and on and on and on... in a bizarre way the movie makers accomplished the task of getting the point across! Not a bad movie, just not my cup of tea!
B003XDZLTG|4.0|I see a running theme here with Crocs. Some people here feel the shoe runs smaller, some larger. For me, this particular shoe was true-to-size. I am normally a size 7 WIDE. I have had my foot measured several time as I have flat feet and have to wear orthotics except with Crocs. Though these shoes were cute, I found that the strap on the right foot cut into my foot. Otherwise, they were adorable. I'm going to try to find a flat that doesn't have a strap  since I find that straps frequently cut into my flat, wide feet. I was just hoping these would be different!<br /><br />I should note that my friend's toddler has these same flats and they felt very youthful to me. I was looking for something a little more mature-looking.
B0055S348W|5.0|While I don't foresee myself printing a lot from my phone, this apps sure does make it easy to do so. Once installed and the proper driver selected, printing is a snap. The drivers, separate download, even supported my older HP Laserjet 1012 (Windows 7 doesn't have a driver for it!) attached to my NAS. Post install of tool to render pdf and word documents is a pit of a pain, but also a one time step.<br /><br />I am running a Droid 1, CyanogenMod 7.0.1.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|I liked Hellboy 1, but Hellboy II is even better.    Del Toro is amazing.  He can take a pretty weak premise (evil character wants to rouse an evil army to take over the world) and transform it into a stunning, in fact moving, story.    The characters--usually stereotypes in this kind of movie--have great depth.  The plot clips right along from one surprise to the next, but all seems to hold together, and the sets!  Whoa.  The sets are spectacular.    The Extra on the DVD about sets is amazing.    Del Toro has both de-emphasized Hellboy in this one, and focused more on Abe Sapien.  The romance between Abe and the Princess grows as Hellboy's with Liz declines (or seems to decline).    And Hellboy, in his conflict with his new boss Krauss, in his drunken binge, and his SINGING (!) becomes even more likable.    This is great stuff.  I don't think I have ever sat through a Barry Manilow song before without squirming, but in this one I was riveted.    Funny, charming, breathless, interesting.
B005MMYCY6|2.0|Count me as one that just didn't \\"get it\\".  I rented this based on the reviews here.  Well,... there is a lot of inappropriate sexual aggressiveness between the kid actor and the bully and even Hesher.  Does this kind of talk make it real?  Maybe to some, but it creeped me out... to the point where I found it unwatchable in parts.  I kept FF through looking for a redeeming theme and found none.  It's just a darky, moody and humorless effort that really had me wondering what the hell were they thinking when they made this .
B0055S348W|3.0|When I saw this app being offered free, i had to jump on it. I had been looking for a printer app for a while. So I downloaded it and I was able to print text messages, call logs, gmail and contacts. I didnt try pictures. Then I tried to print documents and it said that it needs to download an extension to the app so it could render the documents. I tried multiple times and got an error every time. I hope the developer can fix this issue, same thing happened with PDF.
B0050PYNN0|2.0|This could have been a really great movie along the lines of Princess Bride in more capable hands, but instead it was filled with gross humor and bad acting to drown what could have been a good story/movie.  To describe the amounts of utter stupidity would be a waste, the fact that the \\"hero\\" was an idiot would be giving him more credit than deserved.  I think my IQ dropped 10 points while watching this movie.  Let me be clear, if you think cutting off a monster's penis to wear around your neck is good fun, this is your movie.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|I received this dvd fully sealed. Both on Amazon and on the dvd itself it says NEW. However, on the front label printed in the label it says RENTAL. Maybe the dvd was meant to go to a rental store and never actually was sent? So maybe it is new. I have not opened it yet. Maybe the dvd is fine. I'm just a little disappointed that if I display the dvd it says in big letters on the front RENTAL. Just FYI for future sellers that you might receive similar packaging.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|Even though that I have not put it into service much, I love it. It is firm and solid and very pratical. All the tools are handy and the pliers which are not used that often are very smooth with spring function.
B0055S348W|5.0|Prints perfectly to my Canon MP560 WiFi printer! Truly impressed! This has to be the best \\"free\\" app of the day in a long time!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Loved this book. Would highly recommend it. The author did a wonderful job of telling a most horrid story through the eyes of a 5 year old boy. This made the book so enjoyable in spite of the most despicable situation surrounding the main characters.
0143034901|5.0|I love to read and I love books. It had been a long time since a book came along and knocked me off my feet (I have read everything under the sun). I was amazed with this beautyfull story and its prose. It became a breath of fresh air for me to discover such a master like Ruiz Zafon. I have now read a few of his other books and cannot get enough of his works. Have fun reading.
B004V6MWFU|3.0|Okay, first off...this is great. I do like the album.  Vedder's voice is clearer than on any album I've heard.  Lovely songs, with a great backing sound.    BUT, that's just thing.  Where's the growls, howls, unintelligible murmurs, whispers, etc?  I mean, I could understand every word!  With Eddie Vedder, that's just wrong.  He seems so much tamer this way.      The other thing is, way too much rhyming.  Seriously.  Halfway through a verse I'd guess the next part.    Get the Into the Wild Soundtrack instead....
B003ZSJ212|5.0|What more can I say then my title,  Iam on episode IV now and its been great all day.    Finaly can watch SW again, couldnt bring myself to put in the DVDs anymore, Ill be giving them to my daughter.    I see people are having problems playing the blurays, they work just fine in my PS3.
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|Some movies have great soundtracks (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). Some albums are great but could never fit a movie. This is one of those rarities, a soundtrack that stands on its own as a brilliant album. Even if you don't like electronica, it's hard to argue with great sound, and this album has great sound. There's a lot of variety, and all it's all terrific music.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Very watchable and addictive don't want to get to the last episode cause I don't want it to finish  All the characters are gorgeous and totally different creating a wonderful mix keeping stories real and alive
B004EPZ070|5.0|The movie was not just cute but well thought out. Not everyone in the situation got what they wanted in the end but they all got what was really best for them. As always, the purchase from Amazon was a flawless transaction.
0470876417|5.0|Visually different from most business books, Business Model Generation makes plain the process of creating and modifying a company's business model.  It provides good examples to help \\"get\\" the concepts within.  While some may find it simplistic, i believe it's a must read for any start-up or running organization regardless of the industry.
B0055S348W|5.0|This app works with both, Google cloud printing, and local wireless printing. I have Brother wireless printer, this app reported that it is lacking driver for my specific printer, and suggested to use a generic driver which worked just fine.
B005D67OJG|5.0|I started watching Dexter when they ran a season on television because my daughter had been talking about it so much and from episode one was caught, as helpless to stop watching as one of Dexter's victims. I quickly grew frustrated at the very necessary censoring that had to take place for public TV and surfed hungrily across the net trying to find the episodes, or Cd's found the episodes here on Amazon and bought them, gleefully devouring the entire season in one sitting. I have been a faithful watcher since then waiting impatiently each year for the new season to come out and, I have to say this season has NOT been a disappointment. I just finished and am already \\"jonesing\\" for next season to come out. Please start with season one... you will miss out on too much good stuff if you try to start in the middle. I'm sure you will soon be a Dexter watching zombie like the rest of us! The cast is perfect, the scripts are some of the best writing I've ever encountered anywhere! Each year you will be asking yourself, \\"How is he gonna get out of it this time?\\" and each year his adventures just get better and better. I can't recommend Dexter highly enough. Enjoy, I sure have.
B0001I55OC|5.0|I read the book, played the game, and last night, I finally watched the movie. Previously, I hesitated to get it because of all these critical reviews, but when the opportunity to rent it arose, my curiosity won out. To my surprise, it was not nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be. I've seen a lot of cheap, badly-scripted films before, and I wouldn't say this is one of them. I'm sure there are ways they could have done better - I mean, what movie wouldn't benefit from an extra 30 minutes to develop the story further? - but considering what they had to work with, I think they did very well. Part of the attraction for me is seeing familiar faces, like Paul Walker, Billy Connolly, and David Thewlis, though he seems an odd choice to cast as the unscrupulous, foul-mouthed head of ITC. Chris (Paul Walker) is supposed to be the main character of the story, but in both the book and the movie it is Andre Marek that steals the scenes. Played by Gerard Butler, he is sure to charm viewers with his chivalric deeds and lilting Scottish accent.    In the book, the only takeaway point seemed to be that times were violent, contrasting this with the romantic view we have of the medieval ages today. The movie skillfully balances both the romance and the fighting, taking time to note the characters' horror at having to kill people while also delicately develop the romance. I also liked that Chris, totally disinterested in history at the beginning, discovers how real and how pertinent it really is for all of us by the end of the movie. Very nicely handled.    The music was adequate, though not as brilliant as the pc game soundtrack by Bill Brown I have to say. This being a ClearPlay review, I'll note that the profanity is filtered out (there's a lot of it), in addition to clipping out a piece or two of violence. The rest is left in. Considering that they could have easily made this an R-rated film, and didn't, there's nothing to complain about there. The battle at the end with allthe blazing fireballs was quite impressive. I now own this movie and while it may not appeal to everyone, I think fans of the book or of time travel or of the medieval ages ought to give this movie a fair chance.
B0055S348W|5.0|wow!  what an app.  within 30 seconds I was printing to my wireless printer.  NEVER thought i would be able to do that from my phone.
B000NA28I4|5.0|The acting is great, the sfx are great, the storyline is great, and the dragon is masterfully done. Why is everyone going so hard on this movie? Even though parts of the book didn't make it into the film, I can say, as someone who didn't read the book until afterward that it didn't feel like there was anything missing. It was all put together very well in the time they had to do it in. Give these guys a break - I mean, the book is over 600 pages long! You can't possibly squeeze that all into one film! And now, thanks to the poor reception it got, they're never going to make the next two movies. Happy now?    Ed Speelers, as Eragon, tackles his role with enthusiasm and believability, which is remarkable considering that his sidekick dragon was never actually there. Jeremy Irons plays the part of Brom to perfection, bringing all his professionalism and humor to the table. Saphira, voiced beautifully by Rachel Weisz, looks absolutely fantastic. These three characters are more than sufficient to hold the story together and make it worth watching. Don't believe the bad reviews - this is an excellent fantasy film.

0307946711|5.0|Finally managed to finish this book on my flight this evening, come to think of it, I read more than two-thirds of this book on the plane, as often has been the case with most of my serious readings lately.  This is all before I have had a chance to watch the film (in theatres in Hong Kong with movie posters plastered around town), something I hope to do soon.  I think I was first attracted to the book by the movie version cover of Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess kissing.  Somehow I cannot imagine another actress playing the lead for this film adaptation.<br /><br />I've always imagined it to be a rather melancholy story as soon as I read the short introduction on the back cover (reproduced on the book's Amazon page as well), yet there was this inexplicable urge to read it, as if I knew the process of digesting this rather melancholy story would be an enjoyable one.<br /><br />I suppose it's a story that I would best describe as touching, not in the cheesy, idealistic way typical of many Hollywood feel-good stories that are often the basis of romantic comedies over the years, but a story that actually feels real, despite its being set in the UK (with a small portion in Paris).  What the author manages to accomplish is not so much to write a story that makes the reader feel all warm and fuzzy inside, but rather he pieces together a tale of life, of two people whose lives are intertwined from that one fateful day.  David Nicholls manages to make the story real, so real that there are bits and pieces that the reader, regardless of having ever lived in the UK or anywhere in the West, would find easy to relate.<br /><br />It's a story about friendships and love, about all the emotions, quasi-emotions and all the rest that one goes through when two people's lives are intertwined.<br /><br />It's a story about the power of fate, about the missed opportunities and the unbreakable link that draws two people towards each other and finally allows their lives to become in sync, and then just as abruptly and mercilessly severs that link.<br /><br />This is a story neither easily categorized nor simply defined, and that is what makes it such a wonderful reflection of life and love.<br /><br />It's a story one would read and sigh, and as you approach the inevitable end, feel a different sense of warmth wash over you, and one may find oneself showing an appreciative smile.<br /><br />This is a story worth reading, with one's heart.mercilessly severs that link.

B0032JTV6U|5.0|I love Glee.  It's darkly funny, entertaining and heartwarming all at once.  If you don't like musicals you will probably dislike this show.  The DVDs are great, I don't remember the special features, so they must not have had much of an impact.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this bag. AmazonBasics has not let me down yet. Cheap and high quality.    The handle is cushy and covered in a spandex-like material (maybe neoprene?) and feels very sturdy. The bag itself is well padded and soft inside and sturdy as well. Inside the main compartment is a divider that is movable (velcro).    The main compartment opens via a zipper that runs along the back of the top of the bag. From the pic it looks like you open that big flap to open the main compartment. In reality that flap just provides more padding to the front of the bag, and lifts up to reveal a small zipper pocket on the front of the bag under the flap. This pocket has a mesh pocket inside, which will hold stuff down or for organization.    So there's the main compartment, the above mentioned little pocket in the front under the flap, and 2 more pockets: a small pocket on each side. I find these useful for those little remotes for cameras or memory cards or even batteries.    The bag comes with an optional adjustable shoulder strap and has loops on the back for putting it on a belt. I like having those options.    If I arrange things well, I can fit my Sony HDR-UX20 camcorder, the entire AC adapter folded up below it, and a large high-capacity extra battery in the main compartment with room to spare. In the side and front pockets I have memory cards, a small remote for my camcorder, and a little data cable with room to spare.    In all, very pleased with this bag. My HDR-UX20 is a few years old, so I imagine that newer smaller camcorders may fit even more easily. If your camcorder is smaller than mine then you may be able to fit it AND a point-and-shoot camera with chargers, memory cards and extra batteries, but I obviously cant guarantee anything. Great bag and for the money and amazon's service, you can't go wrong.

B004WKOCP8|5.0|I don't know why some people are giving this album a bad review.  The reason why we all enjoy Incubus music is because their ability to challenge themselves and make themselves better as musicians.  To this day all albums are completely different from the previous one so i don't know why everyone keeps saying we want S.C.I.E.N.C.E., that was well over a decade ago and although it was a great album I'm glad that was the only album of its kind.  I appreciate that Make Yourself was what it was as well as Morning View, ACLOTM, and Light Grenades.  We have all changed over the years and so has their music.  If Not Now, When?  To me is to date is there best album, because it challenged them the most to do something different and they don't care what people think of there music.  Yes the album is slower and not as rock heavy as any of the other but the lyrics are probably the deepest i have ever heard and the stories they tell are amazing.  The music is more matured then ever and i feel that it takes a true artist to make a cd that is completely out of there comfort zone and Incubus nailed it and i am glad that they made this cd because listening to it has made me appreciate music that much more.  In The Company of Wolves is a masterpiece and is probably my favorite Incubus song of them all.  For the people who give this album a bad review you are not a true Incubus fan because the band prides itself on evolving and growing with every album and if you can't handle that go listen to bands who create the same music album after album.
1594202842|5.0|I first heard about this book from my daughter, a Yale student, who was ranting about it.  I was curious as to why this book caused such a stir on the campus.  Shortly afterwards, I heard an interview with the author and was fascinated by her story, as well as a little sorry for the backlash she was receiving.  I quickly rushed to the bookstore and devoured this controversial book in a day.      Yes, she was at times way over the top, but I could also feel the pain that every mother feels when making every one of those minute decisions that we face when raising our children.  Her style of parenting is exhausting and excessive, but one can tell that she does love her children deeply and she is as lost as we all are when it comes to helping our kids become the best they can be.  It is obvious that there is no perfect model or manual to child rearing, but in encountering the results of what I call the \\"gold star\\" generation (kids and later adults who expect praise for every aspect of ordinary living), I wonder if our society would not be better served by a bit more of the Tiger Mom.

Like any Michael Bay movie this is a movie that is<br />based on special effects and explosions with little attention payed to<br />emotion or story. I will give him one scene that was pretty emotional<br />though. That said, not many people go into a movie like this for the<br />acting or plot. The action and special effects were very good and this<br />was a very exciting movie and very fun to watch. Overall, much, much,<br />much, much better then the second one.

B0051YGX6U|5.0|This episode is quite honestly some of the best TV writing I've seen for quite awhile. As a follower of this show from very early on, I'm very pleased it's still going on, and the writing for season 6 has been pretty good. Now admittedly, the season was a bit rough, and the plot seemed very confused by itself, but the last two episodes absolutely shined, with the finale of this episode leaving me gaping at my television for a good ten minutes. A plot twist worthy of awards, I must say. Great, great work, and I'm very excited for the premiere of season seven next Friday.
B003L77FYS|3.0|Well, different strokes for different folks, and I'll probably be in the small minority in saying that Castle's third season was something of a disappointment for me.  Not because it was a bad season - far from it - but because it just couldn't match the near-perfection of the first two seasons.  To be fair, the show's producers were faced with a real dilemma after the second season ended...with that sad, poignant moment where Castle left Beckett at the 12th precinct to go off for the summer with his ex-wife, completely unaware that he had finally won Beckett's heart.  Had the show picked up where it left off and brought the couple together, the show might have suffered the \\"Moonlighting curse\\" and faced an early cancellation.  Fearing this, the writers did very much the opposite and essentially re-booted the Castle/Beckett relationship, taking it - and the viewers - almost back to square one.  Yes, the murder stories were just as good, but they always seemed to be compromised by the now-strange relationship between the crime-solving duo.<br /><br />By episode 4, Beckett has a new boyfriend.  As the season progressed, he would become noticeably absent, while she would continue to exchange little \\"cute moments\\" with Castle, usually in the final moments of each episode.  After a while, it became obvious that we were being strung along and that the writers were struggling with where to take the show.  This led to a major, and (to me) unfortunate, change of direction, starting with the two part \\"Setup\\"/\\"Countdown\\" episodes (#'s 16 and 17).  Indeed, \\"Countdown\\" was the first-ever Castle episode that had me wincing and shaking my head.  For the first time, the show had gone completely over-the-top and into a world of high treason, counter-intelligence and ridiculous save-the-world endings.  Castle could no longer be compared (favorably) to whodunit shows of the past like \\"Moonlighting\\", \\"Hart-to-Hart\\" or \\"Remington Steele\\".  This was Castle as Jack Bauer and \\"24\\".<br /><br />Any hope that \\"Countdown\\" was just a fluke, a misstep from which the show could recover, was shattered in the season finale, \\"Knockout\\".  Inside of 45 minutes, we see two very unpleasant confrontations (between Castle and Beckett, and between Esposito and Ryan), the corruption and death of one beloved character and the shooting of another.  Like \\"Countdown\\", the episode plays out as if from a different show, with one implausible scene after another, until a long-awaited profession of love that somehow gets lost amidst all the wreckage.<br /><br />Without rambling on, I will say in summary that season 3 starts off well, gives us some fun and enjoyable episodes through mid-season, and then goes off the rails near the end.  How each viewer responds to the show's changes and decisions will depend on what they envision this show to be, and to what extent they can suspend their disbelief.  If you loved the first two seasons as much as I did, and wanted to hold on to the old \\"Castle\\", you may very well share my disappointment with the third season.
B003UV8TFE|5.0|Walter Lewin has a gift for making Physics approachable - you can see his MIT lectures on YouTube,  I wish he had been there in 1958. Disclaimer: physicists tend to love Physics, and I worked in astrophysics and even a bit with Walter in the late 70s. The bulk of the book deals with his lecture topics, and you will never look at a rainbow the same way again. There is an early chapter on his childhood in wartime Holland and a late one on his interest in art. The rest is on his extraordinary career in x-ray astronomy, which he entered into in its infancy and in which he played a large part. High- energy astrophysics, using satellite detectors of x-rays and gamma rays, has played a large part in our new understanding of the violent universe. Enjoy!
0307454541|2.0|I've read a number of the one and two star reviews and agree with most of them.  I won't bother to add to what's already been written but just want to add my two star vote to offbalance the incredible large number of favorable reviews.<br /><br />I listened to this on an audiobook which I borrowed from the library.  The great voice of the reader kept me listening, as I washed windows, cleaned out the fridge and drove many miles doing errands.  I threatened to stop listening at several points, mostly after the gratuitously savage rape scenes.  However the lack of anything else to listen to kept me going...and the hope that something might happen to redeem the novel. I did miss a whole disk which I left in the car.  It didn't make any difference--the story moves so slowly.<br /><br />I did enjoy the basic mystery of the missing girl and the love of the great-uncle for her. The opening scene of the old man opening the pressed flower was tender and touching. Unfortunately it went down from there.<br /><br />As a person of Swedish descent I enjoyed hearing the many Swedish names I'd grown up with and the many references to coffee and sandwiches.  Swedes do love their coffee.  What I found distressing was the casual, apparently \\"rational\\" and \\"mature\\" attitude of the protagonist, Blomqvist, towards sex.  Maybe that's the way it is in Sweden now...a sad commentary on their society, if that's the case.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was the incredible hypocrisy of the author.  The book is supposed to be an outcry at the violence committed against women in his country and yet the hideously graphic details of these acts betray his alleged purpose.  The way to decry these actions is not to describe them in such detail.  Creepy!  Someone wrote that Larsson and his partner/lover had indulged in bondage and S&M at one time.  It figures.<br /><br />The protagonist, Mikael Bloomqvist, appears to be an imaginary alter-ego for the author, who was also a journalist.  He is so irrestable to women that all of them, regardless of age, beg for his sexual favors.  And since he's really a nice guy, he doesn't disapoint any of them.  One could make a complaint that since he obviously could tell that Lisabeth Salander was a very wounded young girl, that he might be doing a good thing to refuse her sexual advances.  But no...and he does tell her several times that he really \\"likes\\" her and \\"wants to be her friend.\\"  Egad...I'd like to have seen her take her golf club to him!  Bloomqvist is our hero, though and we're supposed to cheer for him as he agonizes over his ethical dilemma as a journalist.  Gee, if only he'd given some thought to his ethical choices as a husband or a father or a lover, we might care a bit more about him. He is portrayed to be such a great guy though--he visits his ex-wife at Christmas where she gives him a tie. (choke!)<br /><br />Besides being morally offensive to me, the book is way too long, too badly written and has too many undeveloped plot elements that are clearly hooks for us to read the subsequent novels.  You can bet that the really evil guardian, whom Salander temporarily suppressed, will re-appear.  Who can't wait to see him raise his ugly head in another creepy story?

B0034G4P8A|2.0|I'm very disappointed with this movie. I've read positive reviews and have seen reviews at Amazon, but after the viewing I wonder why I believed them. Video and sound is OK, but the story... It could be better if not such a poor script. There are a lot of absurdities, not a fantasy things but just nonsense. For example, Thor came to people on the Earth from the fantasy world, he don't know where he is and even how to cross the street not being knocked down by the car, but the next morning he is in the kitchen and he is making a breakfast for a girl like he is a well-behaved model husband. What the hell! The story itself is too thin and shot. During the movie me with my wife were waiting for something special that could happen, something epic, some development of the story, but while we were waiting the movie ended. We just spend almost 2 hours pointlessly.
0739384198|4.0|With the, first two books the first few chapters were hard to get into.  But after that they kept getting better and better.  This one started off where the other one ended, but the pace was alot slower.  I remember the first 2 books, I wouldn't put it down after half way through.  This one took alot longer to get that intense.  But over all, I really liked all 3 books.  I got a bit confused with all the names and all the different plots going on at once some times, but really enjoyed it.  Now what do I read??  hmm....
B003YFIUW8|2.0|*****************This Review Contains Extensive SPOILERS *****************<br /><br />After seeing, oddly enough, a television commercial for this book my interest was peaked. I went online and perused sites like Amazon and read review after five star review. I mentioned this book to my mother and she literally jumped out of her seat telling me that she'd heard the same and was absolutely DYING to read it. I stopped reading the reviews so as not to spoil myself and immediately picked up a copy. Disappointment is not a strong enough word.<br /><br />The 5 year old child POV narration was little more than a gimmick to distract readers from the thin story. \\"Room\\" is a short novel that could have worked, that *should* have worked. Coming on the heels of a slew of `held in captivity for years' real-life stories over the past 5 years this story had all the elements of a gripping novel. The basic concept is a draw in itself.<br /><br />The real life stories of women such as Jaycee Lee Dugard, Elizabeth Fritzl and Elizabeth Smart and their years-long ordeals are familiar to millions around the world either through interviews or autobiographies. We have been told their harrowing stories of sexual slavery, captivity and depravity, often told in the tone of a 'survivor'. With `Room' we were supposed to be given an account of this kind of ordeal, as it was happening...from the inside. Better still, told from the perspective of the child born out of this degeneracy. I was fully prepared to be riveted.<br /><br />Somehow Donoghue managed to turn an extraordinarily interesting concept into a tedious exercise in endurance. Donoghue had a wealth of information on similar cases like this to work with and yet she did little with it. She outright stole many aspects of various real life `captivity' stories and merely threw them in.<br /><br />Jack's vocabulary and grammar alternate between that of a precocious child who has had years of one-on-one tutoring from a college educated tutor and that of, well, a five year old boy. He jumps from calling jokes \\"Hilarious\\" to saying things like \\"Hotted the air\\" to which his mother only sometimes corrects. It's glaring inconsistencies like these that further add to this books lack of credulity.<br /><br />After being given an account of their monotonous day-to-day lives (in which Jack breastfeeding -- or `having some' as he calls it -- plays a major role) for what seems like `thousands of hours' the story begins to pick up.<br /><br />Following a series of back and forth verbal battles waged between \\"Ma\\" and Jack as to how Jack can escape and get help, they reach a compromise: Jack is to play dead whilst wrapped up in an old rug and thereby enabling him to escape. It seems odd that after a half decade of protecting Jack from whatever danger there was, Ma would simply thrust an unwilling Jack into a most perilous situation.<br /><br />Although it feels a little contrived that `Old Nick' is supposed to simply believe that the boy is dead and carry him off somewhere to bury the body without even checking for a pulse, I suspended my disbelief temporarily as I saw this as a means to an end. Jack escapes in a haphazard, lazily written few pages and encounters a man walking his dog with `Old Nick' fast on his heels.<br /><br />Here Jack only needed to start screaming (an exercise he has been doing almost every day of his life) and asking for help as he's been instructed but he is supposedly so `shell shocked' that he can only stare dumbly at the stranger who holds the key to his very life and safety. `Old Nick' approaches and tries to take Jack back to his truck however the stranger finds this all too suspicious and calls the police. Old Nick flees and after even more sloppy, frustrating writing, \\"Ma\\" is rescued.<br /><br />Part two of the book begins.<br /><br />After suffering though Jack's oftentimes downright annoying inner monologue and dialogue for half the book I felt we were finally going to get somewhere.While their captivity was over, I knew their ordeal was far from it. A story based on this kind of depravity does not simply end if and when the captives are rescued. Questions are to be answered, back-story given etc. Or so I thought.<br /><br />Instead we are treated to some half-assed conversations between \\"Ma\\" and her doctors, the psychiatric hospital staff and Jack himself. None of this answers any questions. Since Jack can't bear to be out of her sight (and vice versa) it's reasonable to assume all of \\"Ma's\\" treatment would take place within his hearing. As such one would also assume we would finally get some insight into exactly what took place before and after her kidnapping or why a nineteen year old college student would be dumb enough to fall for the `lost dog/sick dog' trick. We are not.<br /><br />\\"Ma\\" agrees (voluntarily) to an interview with a television reporter and we also reasonably assume we're going to get some insight there. Instead \\"Ma\\" is abrasive, rude and defensive toward the reporter and rather than give real answers to quite pertinent questions, she uses sarcasm to deflect as if she has been forced into it with a gun to her head. The interview ends and we know no more than we did before.<br /><br />The next day, \\"Ma\\" attempts suicide and is very nearly successful. None of this makes sense, why would a woman who for five years raised her child in an 11x11 room and somehow managed to fiercely protect him from their captor then commit suicide knowing full well that Jack is solely dependent on her for everything? She is rescued just in the knick of time once again, she gets better, the story ends.<br /><br />I must add, while I know I'm in the minority -- even for the low-star reviews -- I have to say it. Jack was annoying. Held in captivity and cut off from society or not he was probably the most annoying little boy in fiction in the past decade. He whined, he cried at every little thing, demanded \\"some\\" from his mother and threw tantrums, inside AND out of \\"Room\\". He was clingy and impertinent and tiresome. I'm not generally a violent person and I know it's not nice to say but I wanted to choke him more than once and wanted to slap him every few pages. I understand everyone's reasons for babying him and I know he grew up in a strange place but god a-mighty I wanted to see him left in a locked room somewhere away from \\"Ma\\" for a good long while, just to have him NOT get his way for once.<br /><br />Donoghue writes the characters of \\"Ma\\" and \\"Old Nick\\" (who could have been arguably two of the most interesting characters in fiction) as one dimensional caricatures of real people who are only there to further serve the story of Jack. Nothing is ever resolved or explained, we never hear from \\"Ma\\" as to how she feels about her captivity or how she got there except for in the most terse, stilted ways, nor do we hear Old Nick's reasons for his behavior.<br /><br />Also, I don't know if Donoghue was championing the breastfeeding of school-aged children or what but when a child is old enough to VERBALLY ask for the breast in complete sentences it is time to stop. Nevertheless I excused this as I assumed it was because Jack had not been immunized at birth. Though \\"Ma's\\" continued breastfeeding after their rescue and \\"Ma\\" not actually giving a reason for it (other than `I had no reason to stop') beggars belief.<br /><br />Ma and Jack share a `special' relationship that caused my eyebrows to knit on more than occasion. She breastfeeds him, they bathe together and they're often naked around each other just because. It feels...wrong, it feels off. Even at the end of the book when the breastfeeding is forced to end, she allows Jack to kiss her bare breasts to `say goodbye'. It made me a little uneasy.<br /><br />What puzzled me the most was that the most interesting character in the book by a LONG shot was \\"Steppa\\", a minor character of little value who actually had a personality. He was interesting; he was funny andseemed to be the most level-headed of all the people in this book. And yet, we see so little of him. From his character it's clear that Donoghue KNOWS how to write a proper character and give back-story, she just chooses not to.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say this book is simply not very good and I can't find a single reason to praise it.I know it's not nice to say but I wanted to choke him more than once and wanted to slap him every few pages.

B001F7MSG6|5.0|Deeper than the first, but admittedly great movie, \\"Hellboy\\", \\"Hellboy II\\" is right up there with the best of this genre breed, the last two Batman's, \\" Watchmen,\\" & \\"Superman II!\\"<br /><br />There are so many great moments in this film it's hard to pick a favorite, but two come right to mind. The \\"Stars Wars\\" bar scene inspired \\"Troll Market,\\" was just a plethora of far out characters in a far out world! I especially loved, \\"I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor.\\" LOL! The other is the scene with Red & Abe, where they remorse over the loves of their lives while drinking beer. Both were hilarious in this scene, but Abe really stole the show here, but then again, when they both started singing along to Barry Manilow, it was a moment of pure comedic genius! I busted a gut on this one!<br /><br />Ron Perlman just owns every role I've seen him in, & this may be my favorite yet! That is not to say the cast was not uniformly excellent, as they were! I could not picture a better cast for this film, all had memorable parts, lines, & the acting was top notch, especially Luke Goss, as Prince Nuada! His determination to save his world, his obvious vulnerability for the love of his sister, yet willing to sacrifice her & himself for his cause, was quite a performance, though tragic, to behold! To bad I've not seen him in more films, though he was particularly good in \\"Blade II,\\" as \\"Nomak\\" who spread the Reaper virus through out the Vampires. A role not unlike his in \\"Hellboy II.\\"<br /><br />\\"Hellboy II\\" looks & sounds magnificent on Blu-ray! It's razzle dazzle special effects, it's beautiful palette of colors, & it's superior overall cinematography is a site to behold in high definition!

As to the binding I do not Find it any different from other paperbacks out there on the market. The books are worth reading and I recommend them to anyone who likes fantasy-adventure aand medieval topics.
B0055S348W|1.0|works as advertised.  I would pay $12 to purchase but no extra monthly fees on top of that.  greedy developer
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The only thing I would knock it for was not having the original theatrical versions of the original trilogy.  Other than that, everything else is on point.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Mr. Pitt is strong in exaggerating his own importance in the roll of the Greek Warrior Achilles. He gives no respect especially to the waring king whose battlels he fights. In the end he must give in to poor Priam whose son he has killed, and surely disrespected in death. He conquered the one woman who ever gave him any peace in his lifetime. He loved hard and was very faithful to his cousin and his men. As he hoped, they still tell stories about Achilles today. He was indeed a great warrior. In Picking Brad Pitt, he surely gave movie goers their monies worth. This is not for children nor the faint of heart. This is your real blood and guts action. Don't even think about looking back or being sorry. That's not in the game plan.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|We are huge fans of Hayao Miyazaki and because of Him we are now big big big fans of Anime and Manga.  Love all the details in the movie, the way the live, eat and love. It makes you feel you are part of the movie.

B000021Y7X|5.0|The DVD was sealed and perfect condition.  Regardless if you are a huge fan of the Talking Heads or just a music fan, this movie is a must see.  The movie is very entertaining and a great addition to all movie collections.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Just listened to Whitney Houston's Ultimate Collection. What a great voice she had. I will cherish this CD for a long time.[[ASIN:B005KGBL5W The Greatest Hits: Piano/Vocal/Chords: 0]].
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is an absolutely exquisite read. It is riveting, touching, provocative and compelling - everything you could possibly want in one book. The story is even more alluring when one considers that much of it actually occurred. Even when I did finally put it down, the characters and messages stayed with me. I have recommended it to anyone asking for a good read and they have all been very grateful. Do not hesitate in buying this book. You will not regret it.
0060531053|5.0|I love this book.  Entertaining way to learn about brewing.  I have only 1 year experience in the brewing arts, and I got some helpful info out of the beginning part.  The intermediate and advanced sections are challenging me to explore further the mysteries of beermaking.  Cheers!
B003O86MY8|4.0|I discovered David Garrett while watching NPT.  They offered this CD for a $65 pledge, but I found it on Amazon cheaper and was thus able to purchase other of his CDs for less.  What a talent, classically trained, but hip with today's generation.  Super conbination.  Eager to hear more.
B0055S348W|4.0|Just bought a bionic and it came with some other app. I havent tried that yet but when i saw this app for free i immediately jumped on it. Installation was a breeze and it found my wifi printer right away. Told it to print a contact and right within a minute i had my contact info printed out. Works perfectly! Would deff recomend.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is one of the greatest app that Amazon has came out with so Far. It's funny that suddenly Amazon has made it the free app the day because O have just bought a Toshiba Thrive Tablet. And PrinterShare comes pre installed. And I've used it so much through this past week. And now I can have it on my phone.<br /><br />now for the review. This  app is extremely usefull for business and students primarily that do a lot of work mobile either through their Tablet or phone. and.they quickly need to print something. the benefit of this is that you your not restricted to certain brands of printers or compatibility. only restrict for standard printers is that it needs to.be.wireless. but that printer may have either WiFi and or Bluetooth to receive a transmission.<br /><br />Another feature that you are not restricted to printing to a printer on your network its even on remote printers. but you can print to Google cloud printers. Meaning print your items to Google docs.<br /><br />In the end I Highly recommend this app to anyone and everyone. not just business people or students bit even home use. this app is a life saver and will save time.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All the discs boasts a 6.1 DTS HD Master Audio and believe me, the moment that intro slides out, the entire room rocks. The video quality is, needless to say, impeccable. When i was watching A New Hope, it felt like the movie just came out last year, that's how stunning the video quality is.  The worst video quality is on episode 1 but that doesn't mean its horrible. Let's just say it's the least best in terms of picture restoration.<br /><br />The extras, oh my are you kidding me! I highly recommend to fans who want to step up (and i mean way up) their star wars experience. Your home theater may not have the same grandeur and scale as a regular theater but once you plug these discs into your blu-ray player, that grandeur is recreated somehow.<br /><br />I highly recommend but the decision is still yours. If you want to stick with the original theatrical versions then by all means buy the old DVDs or if you already have 'em just save your hard earned money, that's what those DVDs are for.  Or do you want Star Wars...on Blu-ray...with 3 additional blu-ray discs of extras...right now, then get yourself one. Because at the end of the day, no one is really forcing anyone from buying anything. It's your deal.
B0051T46XM|4.0|Although the movie isn't as great as all the hype, it is still a great movie. It was worth the price especially for a blu-ray. I enjoyed the troll hunter character immensely and an interesting take on the found-footage genre. The CG is really well done and the quality of the video is top notch. The only problems I had with the blu-ray itself is the few number of bonus features. It merely had 3 deleted scenes, and the concept art reels, while interesting, should have been a lot longer. The amount of troll concepts they exhibit seems like they didn't give it a lot of thought. Great movie, but lacks bonus content.
B0055S348W|5.0|I've been using this for months and love it. It's so awesome to be able to download a pdf attachment from an email then print it directly from my phone, without ever having to turn on my laptop. It works with lots of other formats, too, but that's where I've needed it most.  There was a period of a couple of months where PrinterShare and my phone (myTouch 4g) weren't getting along, but updates have resolved that.   I can't recommend this app highly enough.
B0055S348W|1.0|This printer is actually a Lexmark, so I should have heeded the previous reviewers comment on this not working with their newer printers. I really wish that developers were testing to the extent they can provide a compatibility list in the description. At least it was free.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Been a Star Wars fan for over 30+ years.  Thank you Mr. Lucas for creating excitement with each release and new easter eggs and treasures.  I can relieve the fun and magic of enjoying a new Star Wars event every few years.  I am not offended by your changes.  When you look at the OLD, outdated versions and compare them with the new high def ones, it's like using a smartphone instead of an old rotary telephone.  You can NEVER go back.  Enjoy the magic with your kids, grandkids, etc.  Keep that special memory in your mind of the original version.  More importantly, enjoy life and enjoy the new Star Wars set.  And yes, I will buy the 3D version too when it comes out.  Stay healthy Mr. Lucas and keep doing this!
0553801473|1.0|I've just finished reading A Dance with Dragons, and decided to look at what other reviewers thought.  Unfortunately, it seems I am not the only reader whom has come to the belief that Martin is stretching out this story because absolutely none of the characters made any appreciable advance of the story.  The only plot lines we were left with were more cliffhangers.  I am unsure if Martin has become bored with this series (as another reviewer believes), or if he just does not know where he wants to go with this series (which is my belief), and thus keeping all his options open.  But for a book that required years to complete there was really nothing within it to excite me about waiting for the next volume.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|works very well on 7&quot; Galaxy Tab. great game as always, although, the ads are sometimes a little too big!  if summer picknick wont load, open levels on wifi first, not 3g. if you people would just email the Dev, instead of whining on here, you'd know how to resolve.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Everyone is entitled to an opinion and here is mine. I liked it. It was well-paced and as another reviewer said, \\"without the fill\\" of King's early novels (some of which still have me shaking my head after 30 years)...it was an enjoyable King read without having to make a 1000 page time investment. He got in there, told his story and got out without leaving you hanging.     What I got out of it was a reminder of how children are so willing to believe in what they see and accept things that we as adults have long forgotten about. Adults are quick to tell children they are being silly or don't believe them but truthfully...how do we know they haven't seen something that we can't? Just a thought...
B0055S348W|1.0|I can't download my printer driver. I can't tell how well it works because of that. So fix that and I can tell if it works and will change rating.
B0057VY45O|5.0|I love this show.  I was intrigued at first with the concept and it is interesting to see how it plays out.  The show is very well written with great and witty dialogue that keeps you entertained.  Be the end of each episode it is like a book you can't put down and you want to turn the page to find out what happens next...... except you have to wait until next week :)    If you like clever writing you will love this show ....

B003UYV08E|1.0|Iron Man 2 had all the elements of a blockbuster movie. A strong cast, solid direction by Jon Faverau, and spectacular special effects. Unfortunately, the film is bogged down by a soulless poorly written script that's all over the place. One sequel into this franchise and Iron Man is looking rusty.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 picks up where Iron man 1 left off. Six months after telling the world He's Iron Man, Tony Stark is now dying of the palladium in the arc reactor that is keeping him alive. On top of this, the U.S. government is trying to take the technology for the Iron man armor from him, and competitors like Justin Hammer are trying to replicate the armor.<br /><br />But somewhere in Siberia...the son of a former Stark employee Anton Vanko, Ivan Vanko has the secret arc reactor recipe that powers the suit. As Stark confidently testifies to the congresss that he's the only person who has the technology, Vanko heads over to France with his powered whips and own version of the Stark's secret recipe for the arc reactor.<br /><br />After the big display at the Stark Expo, a dying Stark keeps his secret as he heads to France decides to race his own car. This is where the wheels fall off the movie and it becomes a jumbled mess. It's clear this sequence is just conveniently there so Whiplash can wreck stuff and Iron man can beat him up. I rolled my eyes as Happy Hogan drives down the race track the wrong way to give Tony his red and silver Mark V suit to beat up Whiplash and deliver him to the French police.<br />After Tony returns from France, we get more tacked on plot points in his new secretary Nancy Rushman who beats him down in his boxing ring. As he banters with Pepper Potts more convoluted stories are started. Nick Fury shows up with a mystery regarding some element Howard Stark was working on. Ivan Vanko gets busted out of Jail by Justin Hammer. Hammer goes to get his \\"burd\\" as the plot meanders to the midpoint.<br /><br />A few sequences later it's Tony's birthday, and a drunken Stark celebrates by putting on his Mark IV armor and blasting stuff. Realizing he's putting people in danger, Jim Rhodes (again coming out of nowhere) suits up in the Mark 2 suit to stop him. After a big rock-em-sock-em robot fistfight between the armored gladiators, and an repulsor blast explosion that shatters all the glass in Tony's house, Rhodes announces he's taking the suit and flies away. As this tacked on plot point moves the movie forward, Shawn tries to figure out how he learned how to fly an Iron man suit, accessed the pass codes between movies. He also tries to figure out how a suit with no repulsors has them.<br /><br />As Rhodey delivers the Mark 2 suit to the government to be weaponized, Tony goes to get some donuts, Nick Fury drops by to put Tony under House arrest. In addition to giving him something to do while cleaning up all that broken glass, he's told to figure out the mystery of the element. Tony goes and watches home movies, breaks out a model of the old Stark Expo and begins to solve the mystery of the triangle.<br />Meanwhile Vanko and Hammer are putting together drones. But Vanko has an eleventh herb and spice he's not telling Hammer about.<br /><br />Meanwhile at the Stark mansion, Tony wrecks his house finding out the secret of the Triangle. As he installs the new coconut flavored element into his arc reactor, his life is saved just in time to figure out what Ivan Vanko is up to with his eleventh herb and spice.<br /><br />At the Hammer expo, Hammer does the Hammer dance as he reveals the drones and Jim Rhodes as War Machine. Vanko reveals the last part of his secret recipe. As Iron man enters in his shiny new Mark VI suit, he confronts Hammer and the drones start attacking.<br />From here, Nancy Rushman goes into action as the Black Widow, and takes out Hammer's guards to get to Vanko.<br /><br />But Vanko is long gone and she has to hack the computer codes get control of the drones. All she does is get War Machine back under Rhodey's control. Well, he needs to help tony beat up some robots. After destroying all the drones, Here comes Vanko in his souped up Crimson Dynamo knock off armor. After a heavy metal beatdown, Tony and Rhodey fire repulsors at each other, Vanko is KO'd. Vanko knowing he's beaten decides to make himself and the drones blow up just in time for tony to save Pepper.<br />At the end of the movie, Tony gets a medal for beating up on the Hammer drones, credits roll and we see a hammer and Agent Colson telling Nick Fury he's found it. I'd like to find out what happened to the story in this movie. Somewhere around the fifteen minute mark it stopped making sense.<br /><br />It's clear there's something missing in Iron Man 2; it doesn't have the heart or spirit of the first film, which had a light lively tone. By contrast this film feels artificial and manufactured. It's clear the studio executives and the toy companies meddled in the creative process for this film to sell as many T-shirts, action figures and whatever merchandise they could imagine. Instead of the plot flowing together organically like the first film, Iron man 2 is jam-packed with characters that serve no purpose and a jumbled plot that goes nowhere. Tony's armor gets an upgrade but the franchise needs a downgrade. This movie is too much like the jumbled storyline of a comic book and nothing like the linear pacing of a movie.<br /><br />As a diehard Iron man fan I was deeply disappointed with this film. As a Movie fan I was disgusted. Usually the process of executive meddling that ruins a franchise starts with the third movie.<br /><br />I can't fault the actors here, they were prevented from doing their best with the horrible script they were given. Robert Downey Jr. is solid here but is held down from greatness due to the bad script. Gwyneth Paltrow who was amazing as Pepper Potts last time is awkward here. She and Downey don't have the electric Cary Grant/ style chemistry they shared in the first movie. the Don Cheadle is wooden as Jim Rhodes. Terrence Howard had much better energy and charisma in the role. Cheadle has no chemistry with Robert Downey Jr, and is just flat in the role. Sam Rockwell is solid as Justin Hammer. I'm still trying to figure out what Scarlett Johansson's purpose was in playing the Black Widow. Her part was severely underwritten and underdeveloped. Samuel L. Jackson is passable as Nick Fury. But again, they give him nothing really serious to work with.<br /><br />Director Jon Faverau does his best to maintain the integrity of the Iron Man Franchise. The shots are about the same, the sequences are consistent with the first film, but it's clear the film doesn't have the same energy. What was once a fun superhero action franchise looks like it's on the slow road downhill like Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise after Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man 3. All I know is you won't see me in line for Iron Man 3. If you're thinking about getting Iron Man 2 Pass on it. This franchise is getting rusty.bots.

B003L77GRO|5.0|The 5th season of Dexter is one of the most intense. There is hair raising scenes that have you on the edge of your seat wondering if he's going to get caught or not. The only annoyance is his teenage daughter, but besides that it's great! I highly recommend the entire show.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Awesome! great album, period. Just buy it, you won't regret it.  I bought this CD a few days ago I cannot stop listening to it.
0439023513|5.0|I loved this book, but I read the frist two books in this triology. All the books, starting with the Hunger Games were great page turners...I read the first one in about a week, and just had to buy the second one, then of course the third. The first book was a summer reading assignment for my high school kids.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Excellent album, I personally feel that the Peppers began to write good music with BSSM and have been progressing and getting much better since Anthony decided to sing instead of rap, and I am glad Dave Navarrow was only with them for a hot minute.  Californication, By the Way, and Stadium Arcadium are near masterpieces and all really stand out on their own.  The same can be said for I'm With You, this album is excellent and who better to replace John than one of his best friends who has been collaborating with John on most of his solo projects over the last decade.  Anyways, I had to force myself to stop listening to it after about three weeks so I didn't wear it out.  I hope they tour close to my area soon so I can enjoy some of the new songs live, even though Anthony, Flea, and Chad are almost 50 years old I know they can still get Red Hot on stage.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is what the calendar app should have been like from the beginning. Worth every bit of the $5 price tag.
B000GSA59M|5.0|Multi-track recording, works great with most every popular software, and it is an INTERFACE mixer. you can use it for live shows as well as a recording digitally. If you are shopping for home studio equipment your quest is now over. This mixer is awesome! comes with a massive software package as well (I would advise getting Logic later on though, but for beginners it includes everything you could possibly need)
B0055S348W|3.0|Excellent. Works flawlessly. Some of my friends use this application. I had been thinking of buying it. Today though it's free!  Can't beat that.   Downloaded it and was printing within moments.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I'm not going to let a few changes that are heart wrenching destroy my enjoyment of the series on Blu-ray. At least I have the slightly less altered versions on DVD to fall back on. I'm sure the improved sound and picture will be enough to overcome the alterations.    *** Update  I had my first look at episode IV and I must say that it's the most beautiful way to experience it outside of the movie theater even with Obi-Wan's scream to scare off the sand people. I have a 65\\" screen and an Onkyo THX receiver with a 7.1 speaker setup and the sound mix is awesome. I feel that blasters are about to shoot me in the back of the head. I grew up watching these movies and that alone justifies the expense of experiencing the movies in optimal conditions.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|There are the die-hard AMD fans.  I am a die-hard Intel fan.  Been using them since they first came out.  If you want so save bucks and overclock your sytem to death them go AMD.  If you just want to plop the thing into your MB and get it up and running and get your stuff done...get one of these.  Great CPU for the price.  Fan is quiet.  If you do want to overclock then get a bigger heat sink.  I use it for video editing and I am amazed at how fast it is.  I run alot of programs at once and I have yet to see any lag.  Excellent CPU for the money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I just got the disks today.  I've been worked up all week and had my kids all psyched as well.  Pop the disk in and I see a message that says I need an update with a link.  I go to the link and there is no update.  I have an HTPC with Arcsoft TMT3 (latest version).  I start searching around and EVERYONE is having this problem with TMT3/5 AND PDVD9/10.  I see that they did not get pre-release versions of these disks so they could test it so they are just starting to look at all the issues today.  Meanwhile, full versions unencumbered by copy protection are available for download.  The hackers have already figured out how to get around this new version of copy protection.  So once again, paying customers are suffering and those that are stealing it are enjoying their copies.    So I called Fox to get my refund.  The stooge on the phone told me that the disks aren't guaranteed to work.  Total BS.  For decades, EVERY SINGLE DVD/CD I HAVE WORKS ON EVERY SINGLE DVD/CD DEVICE.  He then proceeds to tell me that they can't refund me either.  So I say to him \\"you mean to tell me that you knowingly sell defective goods and then do not provide refunds?\\"  Again, total BS.  So I tell him I want to talk to a manager.  She says she is going to refund me but needs to figure out how since I didn't buy it through them directly.  Still waiting to hear back.  I'm guessing I won't.    I was an HTPC early adopter and have had minor problems with playback every once in a while.  The big releases usually do something new the with copy protection and the playback software needs a hotfix that usually fixes the problems that day.  This is the first time I've seen it this bad.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I understand people being angry about the changes Lucas is making to these movies, I also understand why he is doing this. I know I will get 1000 hatefull comments for this but I dont care. The \\"Noooooo!!!!!!\\" at the end of episode VI is actually said twice, once spoken onced yelled. its Vader's realization that he dosent want his son hurt, which adds a sence of him realizing he is on the wrong side. The blinking ewoks is such a minor thing I wont even bother to comment on it, as is the different sound made by Obi-Wan. As for the CGI yoda in Episode I, think about it people, its a BLU-RAY!!! which meand computer images look beter than a puppet would. it will be enhanced by the blur reduction HDTVs have now. they are still the same movies, I am all for the preservation of classics dont get me wrong, and you cant blame Lucas because He released American Graffiti (which is my second favorite movie, first is Fantasia) and it was the same as it always was. The changes are to enhance the movies, the way that Lucas thinks is best, and when your thinking about that think about this, with out American Graffiti and Lucas, THERE WOULD BE NO STAR WARS!!!!!!!!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|\\"Worship Music is a good record full of impressive musicianship and songs that don't feel as though you've already heard them before by a thousand other bands. Importantly however, it isn't exactly a return-to-thrash nostalgia record. The music was written before Joey even returned and only tweaked to suit him later, consequently the album feels like a mixture of both Anthrax styles, with songs that they'd never have written with Joey before as well as songs that they'd don't sound like they'd suit John anymore.\\"    That's all you need to know...and succinct or what?
B003ZSJ212|1.0|\\"My name is George Lucas. I am a writer, director, and producer of motion pictures and Chairman of the Board of Lucasfilm Ltd., a multi-faceted entertainment corporation.<br />I am not here today as a writer-director, or as a producer, or as the chairman of a corporation. I've come as a citizen of what I believe to be a great society that is in need of a moral anchor to help define and protect its intellectual and cultural heritage. It is not being protected.<br /><br />The destruction of our film heritage, which is the focus of concern today, is only the tip of the iceberg. American law does not protect our painters, sculptors, recording artists, authors, or filmmakers from having their lifework distorted, and their reputation ruined. If something is not done now to clearly state the moral rights of artists, current and future technologies will alter, mutilate, and destroy for future generations the subtle human truths and highest human feeling that talented individuals within our society have created.<br /><br />A copyright is held in trust by its owner until it ultimately reverts to public domain. American works of art belong to the American public; they are part of our cultural history.<br />People who alter or destroy works of art and our cultural heritage for profit or as an exercise of power are barbarians, and if the laws of the United States continue to condone this behavior, history will surely classify us as a barbaric society. The preservation of our cultural heritage may not seem to be as politically sensitive an issue as \\"when life begins\\" or \\"when it should be appropriately terminated,\\" but it is important because it goes to the heart of what sets mankind apart. Creative expression is at the core of our humanness. Art is a distinctly human endeavor. We must have respect for it if we are to have any respect for the human race.<br /><br />These current defacements are just the beginning. Today, engineers with their computers can add color to black-and-white movies, change the soundtrack, speed up the pace, and add or subtract material to the philosophical tastes of the copyright holder. Tommorrow, more advanced technology will be able to replace actors with \\"fresher faces,\\" or alter dialogue and change the movement of the actor's lips to match. It will soon be possible to create a new \\"original\\" negative with whatever changes or alterations the copyright holder of the moment desires. The copyright holders, so far, have not been completely diligent in preserving the original negatives of films they control. In order to reconstruct old negatives, many archivists have had to go to Eastern bloc countries where American films have been better preserved.<br /><br />In the future it will become even easier for old negatives to become lost and be \\"replaced\\" by new altered negatives. This would be a great loss to our society. Our cultural history must not be allowed to be rewritten.<br /><br />There is nothing to stop American films, records, books, and paintings from being sold to a foreign entity or egotistical gangsters and having them change our cultural heritage to suit their personal taste.<br /><br />I accuse the companies and groups, who say that American law is sufficient, of misleading the Congress and the People for their own economic self-interest.<br />I accuse the corporations, who oppose the moral rights of the artist, of being dishonest and insensitive to American cultural heritage and of being interested only in their quarterly bottom line, and not in the long-term interest of the Nation.<br /><br />The public's interest is ultimately dominant over all other interests. And the proof of that is that even a copyright law only permits the creators and their estate a limited amount of time to enjoy the economic fruits of that work.<br /><br />There are those who say American law is sufficient.

B005974CNA|5.0|Well, I figured the music will never be fresher in my mind than after listening to it for the first time, so here goes. I am surprised that John Petrucci had seven and a half songs worth of lyrics in him. Eight interesting unique lyrical themes. Giving him an A+ for that.    I didn't miss Mike Portnoy's lyrics or vocals, but I did feel like the drums went to the back of the room for this album. Hopefully Mike Mangini will bring them back in a creative and powerful way on the bands next album.    I didn't like Build Me Up, Break Me Down or Far From Heaven. In retrospect, I should have used Far From Heaven as the soundtrack to my bathroom break. If the album looked like this, wow, I think you'd have hit a grand slam of musical perfection:    1. On The Backs Of Angels  2. Lost Not Forgotten  3. This Is The Life  4. Bridges In The Sky  5. Outcry  6. Breaking All Illusions  7. Beneath The Surface    So it just needed a little editing and focusing, and nothing that can't be remedied by ripping the songs onto your computer then making your own perfect cd :)    Short of a return by Kevin Moore, (wonder what he is up to these days) I can't really see Dream Theater doing better than they did, considering the hangover left behind by Portnoy leaving. I'm optimistic for the next album, expecting Mangini will inject some of his own personality and creativity into a blossoming, reinvigorated mix. If these five guys could all get as involved in an entire album as they do during the songs where John Myung writes the lyrics, they could produce a truly special work.    Light years better than black clouds, thus the five star rating. Don't miss this interesting scene from the Dream Theater Show.
031603441X|3.0|This is a very long book filled with detail, that in my opinion, could have been edited out. I read the whole book but skimmed sections where it would veer off and discuss undeveloped random characters or events. I didn't like the style in which the book was written. It was choppy, lacking style, almost putdownable. Keith Richards was a heroin addict. He prides himself in always using high quality drugs and not having killed himself like some of his foolish friends. He was a terrible parent. I couldn't decide if I didn't like the book or didn't like him. On the positive side, he does give a peek into Rolling Stones music and its creation and has some interesting thoughts about big names in rock and roll. Someone who is really into the Rolling Stones would probably like it. As a piece of literature, I would not give it a very high rating, but as a historical account with insight into the Rolling Stones, it would be rated better. And by the way, Mick Jagger is not mentioned that much. It really is about Keith Richards.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|This movie was a delight for the whole family.  My husband who is not usually an animated film lover laughed out loud and watched it twice.  The music, animation and story line were outstanding. Quick delivery time had it in hand for an extended family weekend.
B0055S348W|5.0|Saw it as being no-charge (free) and reading the positive reviews. I ordered it for the HTC Flyer. It could not find the driver to my WIFI printer and recommended me to use the generic one. Within 2 minutes of ordering, installing and used the recommended generic driver, I was printing to the printer. Awesome product. Get it while it is FREE!

0684872153|4.0|The book was in great condition. Like new, as specified. No pages were marked on the inside. It did not take long to arrive, but I thought it would get here faster. Also, the shipping package material was flimsy, so I feel like the book could have easily been damaged in transit (which it wasn't).    Overall, happy with the purchase, no complaints :)
0897502027|3.0|I have to say, I don't see the point of this edition versus buying the original Tao of JKD. Despite being a Bruce Lee fan, I'm going to give it 3 stars as this \\"Expanded Edition\\" is just a rehash. I don't really care for the extra exerpts of Linda Lee and company. I just want to read Bruce's own words. I don't see the need to come out with a new edition without much if any new content. Putting borders and boxes around text is not new content. Fixing originally, wrongly translated Chinese characters is not new content.    Buy the regular version of Tao of JKD.  [...]
0307887898|5.0|Eric Ries is a master of laying out actionable roadmaps for finding one's way through the gnarly forest of launching a company.    That being said, his real genius is in illustrating the inherent dichotomies to entrepreneurship, which mirror all of the other aspects of our life...in a word, 'moderation'.      I will try to sum it up as 'you must drink enough of your koolaid so that you, your team, and your customers get a nice little buzz that helps you all keep climbing the mountain...but not guzzle too much so that you get drunk and start embracing denial'.    For the people who may naturally want to simply buy a 'blueprint' to success, please realize that there can be none...but that Eric will show you how to embrace the 'fundamentals and philosophies' to create your own.

B0055EAJ7A|5.0|The story of how Thor becomes king of the nine realms, directed brilliantly by Kenneth Branagh. Brilliantly acted also by stars Chris Hemsworth and the gorgeous Natalie Portman, and Branagh bringing it all together into this epic masterpiece from Marvel Studios. Also brilliant is the way Anthony Hopkins portrays Odin, the reigning king of Asgard and the other realms.     Not since Iron Man was released has a movie had so many well-crafted effects, the Rainbow (Einstein - Rosen) Bridge between Asgard and the eight other realms, just as in Norse mythology, and watching the movie not only spectacularly reminds us of the comics some of us grew up on, but also, for some of us who studied it in school, it is also a wonderful reminder of the Norse legends we know in mythology.     I watched the SD DVD this evening, and will be sure to watch the Blu-ray version soon, to compare the brilliance of the picture, and then the 3D version for even better comparison, but undeniably a very entertaining film.

0810993139|1.0|Children need to develop what I call a narrative muscle - the ability to read more and more complex and profound narrative. Frances Hodgeson Burnett's works - Alcott's, Patterson's, Canfield's, Konigsberg's and thousands of others - help kids build that muscle. Cartoons do not. Reading is one of the most satisfying past times we have, but reading comic books is much like playing solitaire. It is unfulfilling, unenlightening,tedious and little more than a distraction. This is a \\"television\\" book. It's full of smart-ass put downs and unsophisticated, mean-spirited sarcastic humor. There is nothing poignant, moving or particularly relevant in it. The attitudes are flippant and dismissive towards the human experience. It celebrates the boredom of over-choice and over-indulgence - no it doesn't \\"celebrate\\" anything - it cynically wallows in it. It is wearing to read - it no more builds a narrative muscle than television does. After forcing myself through two of the books (I prefer not to write a bad review of something without making sure I have a good familiarity with what I am criticizing) I felt the same way I feel when I grossly over-sleep - a feeling of past gluttony and disgust. There is so much great literature out there for children. Reading for the sake of reading is pointless. It matters WHAT you read. The argument that this gets children reading when they are not so inclined is wrong-headed. Holding a conversation with a friend - even a friendly dog - would be more fulfilling than this kind of cynicism and self-indulgent rhetoric. It stops being funny after the first 10 pages - just like TV sitcoms that can no longer be aired without a laugh track. Give your children GOOD books to read. There are so many to choose from. It matters. Don't let them waste their time with this - they would be better off messing around in the woods or lounging around with friends. The fact that this book is popular is a pathetic reflection on our culture. Quality matters - it matters in all things.

0307887898|3.0|If you help people who start new businesses, buy this book and read it.<br /><br />Read it because it will make you think. I got my copy yesterday (why so slow, Amazon? I preordered) and thinking about what I'd read last night woke me early this morning to read more.<br /><br />Buy it to encourage Ries to write another ASAP, I'd like to see something along the lines of the \\"Big Book\\" of Alcoholics Anonymous [[ASIN:1893007162 Alcoholics Anonymous: The Story of How Many Thousands of Men and Women Have Recovered from Alcoholism]], a pivot that would make it a how-to text book for new entrepreneurs. On page 148 of \\"The Lean Startup\\", Ries says, \\"Only 5% of entrepreneurship is the big idea, the business model, the whitboard strategizing, and the splitting up of the spoils. The other 95% is the gritty work.\\" I'd like to see Ries now do a Zoom-In Pivot and write a book that focuses on that 5%. In my opinion the gritty work gets plenty of attention, and is readily available to entrepreneurs via good CPAs and commercial bankers, especially those who read this book.<br /><br />For over 10 years I've held a weekly startup workshop for people who are thinking of starting a new business, and I've formed the new Small Business Chamber of Commerce to help local chambers start similar groups. [...]<br /><br />This book is not one I'll be recommending to the people who attend, but I will recommend it for those who lead the workshops. I hope Ries's next one will be something I can recommend to everyone, there is a real need for such a book, in my opinion.<br /><br />My biggest criticism is that Ries does not cite Amar Bhide's watershed book The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses, which the publisher of Inc Magazine called the most important book on startup ever written. [[ASIN:0195170318 The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses]]<br /><br />It seems impossible to me that Bhide didn't have a big influence on Ries's thinking about startup. Bhide was writing about lean startup, although he never used that term. [...]
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I'm a huge hard rock guy that likes bands like Staind, Korn, Limp Bizkit, etc. However, I do appreciate pure amazing talent in other music genres. I first heard \\"Chasing Pavements\\" from Adele's previous album and knew she was extremely talented. Her first album was great. Then, this album came out and, basically, you never know. For example, I thought Norah Jones first album was incredible as well, but I was not as impressed with her second. This album, 21, is great from start to finish. It starts with the popular song \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" and ends with \\"Someone Like You\\". (Billboard reported that Adele's \\"Someone Like You,\\" which is currently the number one song on the Hot 100, is the first ballad to sit atop that list in over three years. - Music Mix). Simply, that means the general public that loves poppy rock or dance music is appreciating her simple ballad! That says a lot! Plus, I'm a big fan of CDs still too. MP3s are OK, but if you have a nice stereo at home, buy the CD and you will be rewarded!

1612130585|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker, the second book in the Fifty Shades trilogy was un-freaking-believably good. When I began this novel I had crazy high expectations, and this novel surpassed them all, in ways I couldn't even imagine.    At the beginning of this book, I started highlighting all the parts that I enjoyed because they were either hilarious or really sweet. I had to stop this at about 10% because almost every sentence on my Kindle was highlighted. That's how AMAZING this book is.    Fifty Shades Darker picks up right after Fifty Shades of Grey, when Christian comes to Ana with another proposition. Personally, I enjoyed Fifty Shades Darker more than its prequel, Fifty Shades of Grey. The reason I enjoyed this novel more is because it wasn't as dark, or maybe I was just more comfortable with the dark. Don't worry; you still have Christian Grey, his dark past, his control issues and all his \\"Fiftyness\\", but you also see a lighter, sweeter, and more vulnerable side to him. Mainly, his relationship with Anastasia isn't as dark.     Fifty Shades Darker, just like its predecessor, is a graphic, detailed novel. It has some sexy scenes: pool table, piano, elevator, boat, just to name a few. In Fifty Shades of Grey, I felt like Ana was trying to be someone she wasn't with the whole Dom/Sub, kneeling in front of the master thing. But in Fifty Shades Darker, I felt like Ana and Christian were just trying to fulfill one another's desires, not turn each other into someone their not.    You see a lot of character development in this novel. Christian really opens up, physically and emotionally. These scenes were extremely emotional for me because I could feel how much it tortured him to open up and let someone in. And like I said before, you also see a softer, sweeter side to him. He's more playful, vulnerable and open in this novel. Ana's character also develops in this novel; she becomes stronger and more understanding.    I thought this novel was CRAZY SWEET, not exactly in yourtypical \\"hearts and flowers\\" way, but in Christian's own \\"Fifty\\" way. My heart melt every time Christian lowered his shield and let Ana in. I smiled like a goon every time he would laugh, joke, utter an endearment, or act out of character. And, every single time Christian said, \\"Laters, baby\\" I thought I'd die.    Fifty Shades Darker is also WITTY & HILARIOUS. This book made me laugh out loud SEVERAL times. The witty banter between Anastasia and Christian is sexy and hilarious. I love their emails. Also, I am obsessed with Ana's inner goddess and her subconscious. Seriously....BEST THING EVER! Her inner goddess is the funniest part of this novel. I love her.    This novel also has some SURPRISING TWISTS & TURNS. E.L. James keeps you engaged and waiting to see what will happen next. James is an extremely talented author. She knows how to write a sexy, suspenseful, amazing novel.    I gave Fifty Shades Darker by E.L. James 5 STARS. I strongly recommend the Fifty Shades trilogy (third book not yet released) to every adult who can handle a dark, graphic, intense, lovely, witty, sexy romance.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I was looking forward to this item.  Before leaving a review I read everyone's and even tried some of your tips in the positive reviews to see if I could make it work.  I tried top and bottom of the TV and even with ALL the lights on in my living room creating the worlds most well lit play space and tried all of the calibration functions. It seems the main defect is that fact that the lenses make what your KINECT \\"sees\\" too dark and it could never really track my hands.  I have a small apt. in Brooklyn and was hoping this would make it easier to play 2 player on anything, though it can see two people the tracking was slow and mostly off.  The one benefit to purchasing this item was that when I took it off it truly showed me how great a product the KINECT really is.  Perhaps we'll get a V.2 of this item that will work better, but until then this item gets 1 star and sent back due to it's inability to deliver any benefit to my Xbox KINECT.

B0037TRVD0|5.0|My exposure to the truly Incredible String Band began with this singular album. While I have since grown to love \\"Wee Tam/Big Huge\\", \\"5000 Spirits\\" and Mike Heron's \\"Smiling Men with Bad Reputations\\", this remains their most accomplished and bewitching musical statement in my opinion.     I've heard it said that this is very much a product of the 1960's, and perhaps somewhat dated today. I maintain that while the attitudes of the 1960's allowed for such a record to be made, \\"The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter\\" is a truly timeless album. It is a very human album, rooted in sensations, memories, mythology, ideas and emotions that imbue it with a sense of familiar continuity. That is, once the listener can absorb the global folk music approaches and sounds that have been amalgamated into the ISB sound. These can range from the Italian sounding harpsichord Oom Pa Pa on \\"Waltz of the New Moon\\", to the Arabic scales used for the vocals throughout the second half of the album. From the Bahamian spiritual incorporated beautifully into \\"A Very Cellular Song\\", to the sitar and gimbri that add colour and dimension to many of the melodies. While the combination of so many influences can make this album a bit daunting to approach, they ultimately ensure that it is not solely of one time or place.     To be sure, this is haunted music if ever there was such a thing, but it is also by turns whimsical, wistful and reverential. It addresses some of the most basic (though not simple) human thoughts and desires. And by God, when Heron sings \\"turn your quivering nerves in my direction!\\", my nerves most definitely do quiver in response. Which just goes to show you, if you are willing to open your ears and hearts, this is music that can move you at the most basic (though not simple) level.
B0055S348W|5.0|Just downloaded the free premium version from Amazon's app of the day and I love this! Works just as decribed. You can print photos, web pages, calendar, contacts, messages, call log, email, and documents all from your phone! It was easy to set up and easy to use. I can see how this will be very functional. I also like how you can even change setting from your phone. You can adjust margins, paper size, paper source and printout mode (eg. normal, grayscale, high quality). Really a great app and can't beat the price (FREE)!!

B001E45XT4|5.0|There are a lot of good reviews already posted so I'm mainly here to say that this headset works with PS3. I found a few reviews saying after buying the syba stereo audio adapter associated with the product post that the headset can only output audio for the voice chat which is true. In order to make the headset work you need to purchase this,     6in. Stereo Splitter (3.5mm) Audio Adapter   $2.99   Qty: 2   Sold by: BlueMall  Payment Method:    Items: $5.98   Shipping & Handling: $5.96    which is a male RCA adapter (those red and white plugs used to input output audio) with a female 3.5mm headphone jack.  I'm using a HDMI cable so to get the audio to output to an RCA you will need to plug in the PS3 analog cable that outputs to 3 RCAs: red, white, and yellow. The audio adapter will let you plug the headset right into this cable and will let you hear in game audio along side game chat. Because I have audio outputing to HDMI and the analog cable, I had to set the audio settings to multi to out put to both cables at once.  The syba adapter is straight forward and most people posted they were able to get it to work, so I'm not explainig it.    I specificly bought this set up to play Black Ops. This is my first headset and I didn't want to dump a bunch of money into something that may not work for me. I must say you get more than you pay for absolutly. As far as the mic is concerned I believe people can hear me because I don't have to repeat what I say. The audio is loud and vivid. When it is all quiet and a sniper rifle goes off it can be startling. While sitting still I do get the notion that people are walking from left to right but can not determine if the steps are infront or back of my current position. The lack of 3D is a price point compromise having only 1 speaker per ear that I do realize. I have noticed that sitting in one spot and slowly scaning my view left to right changes the angle my character recieves the audio giving me a simulated 3D effect to locateplayers.  While moving quickly and spining the character's line of sight the audio is changing distance and angle of the sound at the same time which can cause some choppiness of the rapidly changing audio all around me. The audio from the headset is at the will of what is processing it, so I can not leave out the fact that it does what it's told by the game and the PS3, so if the game or the unit does not put that detail into the audio content then it would hinder my experience with the audio coming thru the speakers. In short, I can not be sure if it's \\"crap in crap out\\" because I have no other headset for comparison.    The Game Com 367 was a great investment being able to do all that it does at that price point. The headset is really big and makes you look like airport runway personnel. The cable is more than long enough however the wire splits into a y where the cabling goes thin, so I reccomend anchoring it down from being yanked out. I don't know how to clean the ear pads on the headset so I try to wipe grease around my ears to prevent build up before putting them on. I have also kept the blister pack the headset came in because it is great for storage. Any one deciding to buy one of these will not be dissaponted.
B0058VA2U4|5.0|A true return to form. Joey is back and it is like he never left. Sure, he looks older in a weird way but he still has the poodle hair on top of his head.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|So I read some of the reviews and was a bit sketched out, but decided to pick one up anyway, just to test it out. My living room is pretty cramped, and I barely play the Kinect because I always have to move my furniture around. I punched out the holes on the protective sticker, placed it on my kinect and then put the Zoom on. Easy enough, but when I went into the Kinect Hub to calibrate it, I ran into a few problems. At first, it was not detecting me properly because it could not see the floor. I read through the troubleshooting on Nyko's site and made some adjustments with the lighting and the tilt angle in the Kinect Tuner, which helped somewhat, but then I noticed it was a bit jumpy. It looked like my legs were dancing on their own and the cursor was also a bit jumpy. I had the kinect mounted on top of my TV, and decided to put it below just to see what would happen, and sure enough, it worked a lot better. I started playing the game Joyride, and it worked fine.  Went back into the Kinect Tuner before switching to Dance Central and noticed it was a bit jumpy still. Popped in Dance Central, started jerkin' to some Audio Push and it seemed to track just fine. I also tried it out on Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sports, and Gunstringer and had no issues. I was able to play closer and did not have to move my couch.      I guess it might just be in the Kinect Hub where it's a bit weird, because during gameplay, I did not have any problems. Overall, I am pretty satisfied with it. Tis a keeper!

The app should be able to run on its own without having to log in to a remote server, all it needs to do is communicate directly with either my wifi printer or over my local wifi network to my networked printer, it's unacceptable for it to need an additional log in to the company's servers after purchase.  Deleted.
B0055S348W|5.0|Got it free today for my Xoom.  I was printing on my WiFi HP within 10 seconds.  Could it get any easier?    If you do not have a WiFi printer and on a PC...you still have to print through the web to a PC that is always on...that is hooked to the printer.  I tried this as well...very very easy (one download on PC for software).    Only thing I would say is it took me a while to print outside of PrinterShare.  You do it by sharing and selecting PrinterShare, etc...few ways to do it.  Wish it was more integrated within the OS somehow.    Anyhoo...great product.    Cheers
B0055S348W|1.0|This App sucks. There are no drivers for my Brother printer. I Cannot even print from generic brother driver they recommend. Sounds like a cool idea but is unless with your printers support driver.
B0055S348W|5.0|Great app. You can print using four different methods. You can almost surely find one that works for you. I personally tried two of the methods (direct WiFi and Google cloud print) and they went off without a hitch. Has nice printing options and a useful preview before committing the print job. I highly recommend getting this one,  especially while it's free.  Motorola Droid X GB 2.3.3 (4.5.602)
B0055S348W|1.0|got the app via amazon marketplace when it was avail. for free.  installed fine... but printing over the network requires a driver pack, which won't load (internal error: null).  printing a pdf requires a driver pack, which won't load (internal error: null).  Entirely worthless app, glad I didn't pay money for it... but sad that I wasted my time trying to make this garbage work.
B005COO1X6|1.0|This story seems to have been written as a challenge.  \\"Hey, you guys throw out some random ideas and I'll write a horror story based on them in the next two hours!\\"    It's really hard for me to express just how disappointed I was in this bit of work.  I didn't find the characters believable.  The ending is laughable.  It just doesn't work.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Well, I've got a room with about 8 feet between my couch and the TV.  The normal Kinect works OK in my room, but it can't see my feet and hands at the same time if I have my hands above my head, and so I have trouble with some games.  I decided to try this Zoom to make it so I can play more comfortable, a bit less backed up at the couch, and have it read me from toe to fingertip with no problems.  Instead, it just doesn't work at all.  I installed it properly, I followed all of the instructions in the manual, and it just doesn't work, period.  I have calibrated it multiple times, I have adjusted the lighting in my room to various levels of darkness, brightness, and everything in between, and no matter what I do, the device won't recognize hands at all.  If I wave at the camera for 15 full seconds, an overly long time, it will wake up and start looking for me to do something.  But then it stops even trying, it seems, as it doesn't track my hands at all to even navigate the menus and begin playing a game.  I literally couldn't even succeed in selecting a single menu option.  Plain and simple: it absolutely distorts SOMETHING, I don't know what, but SOMETHING significant, and it renders it completely incapable of tracking hands.  The purple spots that the IR view has where it represents tracking points on the Kinect Hub, well, they jump around constantly, even when I'm standing completely still.  It just can't get a good read.    Do not trust this product!  I have no idea how some people are using it and having it work for them, because for me it was an instant failure, just completely destroying the Kinect device's ability to track me, right from the start, and nothing I did could correct it.    Beware.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I stupidly thought that this would include all the bonus stuff relating to Chapters 4-6.  Wrong.  It's just the 3 movies with audio commentaries.  If you want the bonus stuff u have to buy the box with ALL 6 movies.
B003INBNXO|2.0|Imagine that you sit down to watch a film titled \\"Mickey Mantle's List.\\" The description of the film says \\"Inspired by the life of baseball great Mickey Mantle.\\" In the film, Mickey travels to Germany, where his uncle owns a factory, and uses it to save lots of Jews. Then, in a baseball challenge, a Nazi general tries to strike him out, but he hits a home run. As a result, Americans back home are inspired, and launch D-Day. At the end of the film Mickey goes home to hit a lot of homers for the Yankees (while the crowd chants \\"U.S.A.\\"). Your reaction is \\"the story was like 'Inglorious Basterds 2,' but the tone was completely serious. Also, isn't Mickey Mantle's actual life good enough?\\" Your friend replies:    \\"You just don't get it. Mickey Mantle was a hero, and he loved his wife. This movie might take some liberties but the important parts are true. Also, these are the best baseball scenes ever filmed in a movie. God bless America.\\"    So, yeah, that's basically what's going on in this film. I know most American viewers won't really care, and they try to get into it as fantasy. But I lived in China for three years, so I just wanted to put this review on here. In real life Ip Man lived in his mansion throughout the war, worked as a policeman because he liked it (not because he needed the money), and obviously never fought a general or whatever (or escaped afterwards, lol). He left for Hong Kong after the war, only because he was rich and the communists were confiscating people's property. I'm not knocking the guy, he certainly was incredible at martial arts, and I'm a Bruce Lee fan. Just weird to see this Chinese nationalism be so popular in the U.S. suddenly (these kinds of movies are on Chinese TV all day, though lower budget of course).    So, with that done, let me review it as a fantasy kung fu movie real quick. The early fight scenes are really well done, though the later ones are a bit rushed. Donnie Yen gives a great performance. The visual look isn't so great: the sets don't look like real buildings, and a lot of the scenes that are supposed to be outside are clearly inside. In fantasy movies that's fine, but then they throw in the WWII setting which is trying to be a real time and place, and it distracts from the fantasy.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Words can't do it justice. Negative remarks made by critics are just that (negative). It may sound like a cliché, but ... SEE THIS FILM!!  I'm here because I loved it so much I was hoping I could ... purchase it on DvD...    This is one of the ultimates for those with a nostalgia for simpler times. A real tear jerker too!    It deals with lost hopes and dreams of the families of so many American soldiers whose lives were lost in such a real way!    Bravo Jim Carrey! This is one of his best performances yet and he certainly has more than his share. I'm so impressed with his ability (in this film) to play such a serious, loving and (at times even calm) role! Awesome! What an incredible actor in an incredible film! Jim is right up there with some of the masters like Robin Williams.    In a word, \\"Magic!\\"
B002AKPECW|5.0|Reynolds generates a fast paced and caturing story! We all want to hear the second story of the Shatterling couple in the andromeda galaxy!
B0055S348W|5.0|Best I've had works miracles I've been printing things on peoples printers all day they think their stuff is being hacked hilarious. Thanks amazon. Great for work too
B0055S348W|5.0|super easy to set up.  printed a doc within two minutes of downloading the app.  so far no problems. i can't believe its free today
1614270198|5.0|If you can ignore the typos, which I did considering how good this book was, I do believe this book has the power to change your life. Contrary to one negative review, this book is not just written for the religious. Granted, I will say that if you have a religious upbringing like myself, but do not adhere to an organized religion, this book may especially speak to you. Whoever said that misunderstood what God is defined as, though it is hard to define it at all. The divine within, my friends. If you believe it is there, then you have all that you need. Buy the book!!!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|Fly From Here is certainly a credible recording and was a pleasant surprise.  I was not sure what to make of it, seeing as YES had not recorded a studio album in ten years; however, as soon as one listens to each track, it becomes easy to tell that a lot of effort and care were put into this music.  The opus, Fly From Here, in six stages in quite unique in YES history.  It sounds like a serious Broadway musical with a prog-rock twist.  The rest of the songs are quite strong, especially Into the Storm, a group effort.  I agree with other reviewers.  Fly From Here is like an extention of Drama (1980).  In some ways, I like Fly From Here better because of the 20+ minute suite.  The biggest surprise was Benoit David (a Canadian like myself!).  He sings with a lot of heart, and the lyrics have a lot of surprising Jon Anderson-like moments.  Benoit sings like a cross between Jon Anderson and Trevor Horn but with a slight French accent that makes his style rather unique.  This may disappoint some Jon Anderson fans (and I am a huge one), but Benoit David stepped up and delivered the goods. Squire, Howe, White, and Downes play very well on the recording, and Trevor Horn's production is outstanding. I can only say YES to this new music.    Stuart Chambers, Ottawa, Canada
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in one sitting. The story took me for an emotional journey that I didn't see coming.  I couldn't put it down. Great story.
0156027321|5.0|I won't write a ten page review about how wonderful this book is. I read this book about 10 years ago, when a friend gave it to me as a great read. It did not disappoint me. I feel that anyone who could not appreciate what the story was \\"really\\" about, has sadly missed a great epiphany. It is one of the best books I have ever read.
030788743X|3.0|Perhaps someone can add an explanation as to why the ebook is more expensive than both dead tree copies of the book?
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I grew up on Warren Miller and skiing movies, I ski now but have always wanted to learn to snowboard, after watching this movie I have one goal this winter and that to learn.      This film is unbelievable.  The shots are so well placed but at the same time look as though they happen by accident.  From beginning to end its amazing.  It is broken up perfectly with non-snowboarding scenes, but they don't seem forced into the movie, just placed where they should be.  As soon as you start thinking about the next snowboarding scene it there already.    The only movies that are even close to the same category are \\"That's it that's all\\" and \\"Picture This\\"    Thank you Travis Rice and Red Bull, keep doing what you're doing.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Really not much to say minus a great product at a great value. Shipping was very quick as well. I am very pleased with this batteries.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This Light is phenomenal, and well worth the money! It's extremely bright on the high mode (140 lumens), is nice and dim in the lowest mode, and automatically defaults to medium whenever being off for 2 seconds or more! Fenix makes incredible light products, and everything they produce is very durable and well made.    This incredible little light stays on my keychain and goes with me everywhere. I highly recommend this light. If you are considering purchasing this light, you will not by sorry!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is a must read book.  I had a hard time putting it down and would stay up late reading.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Removing the pole in the Wampa's arm is one thing. Even adding the lost Jabba scene to Ep. 4 ( as bad as the animation of Han is) was kinda cool, but adding these stupid lines where it is completely unnecessary and actually takes away from the drama of the scene just doesn't make any sense to me more than it offends me. I'm just confused. Darth Vader's silent internal struggle was iconic. Same as Han shooting first established him as the scoundrel he was and enhanced his transformation into a hero.    I would buy the extras but if I want to see the movies in HD I'll just wait until the weekend and watch Spike.
B0053EZXRS|2.0|Now there is 90 min of my life that I could have spent scrubbing the staines out of my tighty whities than watch this crap. Is Nicky that broke? I only gave it two stars because the Accountant was ill, and Piper was sexy and tough. Shame on you Nicky. I did like the gun battle in the motel room though.
B0055S348W|5.0|I just downloaded this app and printed from gmail and it worked!!! Been looking for this app for a while. Finally!!!!!!
B000053VJI|5.0|Looked like new, it plays well, no scratches.  It is good to hear the old music the way it sounded when it first came out, and brings back good memories.
B001UV4XFG|1.0|I ordered the product because it was the 2 disc edition. When I received the movie from the seller it was in half Spanish and English. I did not bother to open the movie and sent back for a full refund.
0141331976|5.0|If you are working to get your elementary student to read more chapter books, these are great to help your progress.  I think a lot of parents hear \\"I don't like reading books without pictures.\\"  The Diary books let your child get the feel of reading a chapter book, but still have their pictures they love.  I feel that the movie's do not do the books justice.  This is our second copy of this book because our American Bulldog thought he'd \\"read\\" this one too (loves eating go reads!)!
B004LWZW42|1.0|Worst version of X-Men Movie... pure dribble.<br />Took awesome comic and butchered it in to a boring 2 hours.<br />  -Also The beast costume looked cheap & cheesy like 1950's wolf-man. Laughable
B0055S348W|5.0|My toshiba thrive came with the trial version, and it worked really well.  Now,  it's free on here, and I just saved like 12 dollars! I love this app.
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Just as good as their first album! Every song has cool and unique parts that set The Strokes apart from all the plain generic bands of this time period
B0055S348W|5.0|One of the best free daily apps ive gotten so far.  I hope Amazon compensates the developer.  That said, I would not have paid $13 for it.  Works perfectly to my HP wifi printer, setup took moments, the longest being the download and instillation of a 4mb file to my SD card.
B003BKF696|5.0|This album has great melodic and droning songs that will be in your head for days, which is a good thing.
B0055S348W|5.0|What a great freebie! This installs easier and works better than any other mobile printing solution I've tried. Thanks to the developer and Amazon for the most useful free app yet!!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|I can't imagine listening to this album Not at loud volumes. This is certainly one to keep in your car when you have the itch to speed down the highway
B005J0VPNC|5.0|I have several third party cameras on my phone. Paper Camera is absolutely one of the best I have tried. It's easy to use and the adjustable filters produce some very cool photos. Works great on my Thunderbolt and well worth the $1.99.
B004ISVH5W|3.0|He tries to be too creative on this and goes overboard. Too many hip-hop beats for me, and doesnt compare to his previous albums or the verve at all.
B0055S348W|4.0|I had been uusing Cloud Printing, which works but only if I have mydesktop PC running and with Chrome running in the background. I wanted to try this program but frankly did not want to spend that much money. But, hey, for free, I'm a sport. It works just fine with my WiFi printer which other programs I tried could never find or recognize.
B00005ARDC|4.0|I liked this album but I didn't love it. Many of the songs sound too much alike but overall this is a great band and a tight debut album.
B0055S348W|4.0|Setting up the wi fi connected printers was a snap.  Found both of my hp lj  and ep son aio.  One minor gripe is no duplex support for the printers.  Also, want to mention that there is no support for Google Voice e.g. text message print out.
B000069HKH|5.0|With a great modern mix and songs with amazing lyrics, This is Bruce's best album within the last decade in my opinion
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|This movie is brilliant in many ways.  The best movie I have seen since the King's Speech, if not better.
B00000637V|5.0|Every song on this CD is performed so well that you can feel the sadness and dark vibes coming through your speakers. By the time you get to the last song it is hard to switch to any other albums.
B0055S348W|5.0|I download the demo of this and it worked great.  I kept on finding things I wanted to print from my phone, but didn't want to pay 12 bucks.  If it were around 5, it would have been reasonable.  The application finds my printer easier, and faster, than my laptops.  Great application.   One of the best to have.
B00006LLOG|5.0|This was the perfect album that would eventually go ahead and revolutionize rock/alt. music from then on. I can't think of many other works of art that set such a great mood and landscape of NYC during this time period
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I'm sorry but I can't see much of a difference over standard definition. I purchased the BlueRay version because I love the genius of Star Wars, however I was not wowed by this version with the exception of the price. Forty bucks for the same videos. If you have the Standard Def. Save your money.    Maybe the 3D version will be worth buying. As long as people are willing to spend their hard earned money on minor revisions to the product George Lucas is willing to take it.
B005COO1X6|2.0|As a loyal Stephen King follower for years I was very disappointed with the lack of any substance. As soon as I thought   the story was about to go somewhere, it ended. I have to say this was absolutely my least favorite.  Sorry Stephen, but I still gave you 2 stars for potential. Want a good short story? Read \\"The Long Walk\\" again.classic
B0055S348W|5.0|I am truly impressed with this app! Easy to set up and use with my networked printer.  I'm having problems downloading the document reader though. I'll keep trying.
B0058ZPNOK|3.0|On the whole, I rather liked this movie. I thought the plot was good, I thought the acting was really good, and the music within it was awesome! (Metallica, Motorhead, etc...good stuff). What I really didn't care much for in this movie is all of the abbrasive and crude language throughout it. A little bit is one thing, but there comes a point when it begins to become too much...and the language in this movie is blatant, awful, and shall we say creative sometimes too. Did not much care for that. If it hadn't been for that, this movie would have gotten a higher rating in my book. It's a good one time watch in my opinion...just be aware that there is a lot of harsh language in it. If that doesn't bother you, then have at it, because that aside it's a pretty good movie, but if it does sort of bother you, then you'll have to decide for yourself whether it's something you want to watch or not.
B000005JA8|5.0|It's a weird album, and on first listen, willfully and gratuitously so.  Eventually your limbic system rewires itself to do the frug to this like nothing else.  Beefheart himself sounds obnoxious, some kind of twisted martinet (r.i.p.), and I could take or leave the lyrics.  But no other music jumps like this -- sideways, straight up, somewhere else.  Hooks galore, after you learn to hear them.
B0055S348W|4.0|I am impressed with the large list of printers supported, and the interface with so many smartphone apps. Please add Kodak Office ESP drivers, as the available ones won't work.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|So I've pre-ordered this movie in August thinking of saving money. Turns out Target and few other stores have it for $79.99!!! I wouldn't have need to pay a month in advance for it and I would have already have it in my house. I should receive it in 2 days with an extra charge of $7.98. Very disappointed. Not planning on pre ordering any again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This puzzle game runs and looks both clean and smooth. The music is a nice change from the cheesy soundtrack these types of games usually have. Seems as if the developer didn't just throw this game together, a lot of effort must have went into it.

B000JMLFLW|3.0|This was a required book in high school English. Thank God for Cliff Notes, because this is the book that taught thousands of young men to hate reading.<br /><br />This summer, I forced my way through the book, because I wanted to understand what was so great about it. I discovered it was GREAT to finish the book. Don't give this book to a kid to encourage reading.<br /><br />This book was clearly written for a different time. Chapter upon chapter of utter tedium conveying precious little to the course of the story. However, in that tedium was character development worthy of study by would be writers. Maybe that's why we were supposed to read it.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|When I read the book the first time I thought it was just another dull book. But when I read it the second time with an open mind I saw the philosophy in the story:<br />A man in search of meaning to life and the actions that drive people to do things. the main character in the story is very unique and an interesting person to examine along with the questions about life...

B005BZQS1E|2.0|This seemed like funny movie from the previews, but it was more crude than funny.  It turned semi-serious about half way through which was redeeming.  It seemed like it was trying to be two types of movies but came up short in both.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|I am a fan of adventure stories whether in books, on films, or Nintendo games -- love all the Zelda adventures. But I've been nuts about the Harry Potter stories since I introduced my grandson to the excitement of the first book, he was in kindergarten. We've been sharing and enjoying these adventures through the years and now he's ready to graduate from high school and go off to college. Oh, the movie. I would recommend it, I liked it a lot, although some of it seemed a little disjointed. But I'm 73, maybe it's me. I'm waiting for the final half of Deathly Hallows, hope it comes out in time for my grandson to watch it with me. -- Old Netty

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I. have spent countless hours over a two-month period with Kindle tech support trying unsuccessfully to resolve my problem. I am unable to access the Table of Contents on two music books I purchased; the program simply crashes when I use the \\"Go To\\" function, or if I try to turn pages to get to the Table. V. 3.0 is installed. I have tried to uninstall it, but have been unable to do so, even with multiple app managers and uninstallers, both free and paid. I have tried to upgrade to V. 3.1, but it simply opens V. 3.0; 3.1 will not overwrite the older version. I have deleted and re-downloaded the books; nothing works. The books work correctly on my laptop, desktop and iPhone, but simply will not work on my Android. Tech support has spent hours with me on the phone, trying all kinds of different things, but nothng works. Amazon has credited me the price of those two books, but I really would like to use them on my device. My main reason for purchasing a tablet was to be able to save and use music when traveling. Other (non-music) books work correctly on my tablet.

0525425578|5.0|This is the second book that John Grisham has written about Theodore Boone who is a 13 year old son of two lawyers.  Theodore is a detective/lawyer himself who wants to be a judge because \\"In what other job can an entire room of people, regardless of their age, job or education, be required to stand in solem respect as you enter the room?  Theo could think of only three - queen of England, president of the United States, and judge.\\"  In this book, Theodore's friend April has disappeared and is presumed to have been kidnapped by her uncle who had been her pen pal and who had recently escaped from prison.  The book is well written and exciting and I was laughing out loud at the scene with the parrot in Animal Court.  I loved the book and thought it was fantastic!
067144901X|5.0|my 2 yr old has love this book for a yr now.  it's his favorite and this is the 2nd time we have bought it since it has been destroyed...with love :).  sandra boynton writes the best books, they are all fun and funny for both me (the dad) and the son

B000007UTN|5.0|If i was stranded on a desert island, this would for sure make it. I am a huge radiohead fan, seen them live at Bonnaroo, and had my face melted. The album OK Computer is a concept album, centered on one theme. It is best listened to with headphones on and in its entirety. I bought the CD the week it was released, after owning and listening to the bends i needed my fix - new radiohead. This is my favorite of all their albums, but i do strongly enjoy Kid A and Amnesiac. Pablo Honey, their first album has its moments, but not a great record. If you notice anything about radiohead, each album demands a few listens to get aquainted to what they are expressing in each new album. Because with every new album comes a totally new sound and direction. Radiohead is always growing musically and their talent to adapt and change the sounds to progress musically is amazing. I know alot of people hate Radiohead. I know alot of people that hate Pink Floyd and the Beatles too, just because its not your taste does not mean that this music appeals is trash or pretentious.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I got this because i have a small room so you would thing this would work. Well it dont. I have to stand 2 feet from my tv just for it to see my hand. If i stand back any further it had trouble with my movement. and i also had the problem with it not seeing the floor even tho it was at the edge. You better off with out it. Do not buy
B0058EBNAO|3.0|love the app, especially the earthquake notifications.   runs smoothly, no battery drain, several widgets, not the prettiest though.  have trouble with intelicast, foreca works fine though. also radar only shows last 2 images.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I grew up on the X-MEN, before my father died it was the first comic we collected together.  I came home the day it got there as a kid and waited until he finished reading it and I got my chance to read it.  We collected those and The BSG comics together back then.  So, everytime I see any of the X-MEN Movies it takes me back to collecting those Comics with him about a year before he was killed.  But this one though not accurate to the comicbook history just felt like the comicbook came to life and made me feel like my dad was setting next to me there in the theater with my wife and I.  This is a movie that will take you back to your childhood and trying to get every X-Men Comicbook to have a complete collection.  Least we not forget they have 10 free digital comics with this set with the first appreance of all the characters in this Movie.  you get to go back and see there comicbook origin story.  This is a must have for all true X-MEN fans young and old.
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|Simply one of the best movies ever made.<br /><br />First off it's got Morgan Freeman talking. That's a recipe for success in and of itself. The man could read the tax code and make it sound interesting.<br /><br />Second, it's just a good story. It could be five hours longer and I'd watch it intently. I want to know what happens when Red gets to Saywatenayo! Do they get the boat restored? How is business at the hotel?<br /><br />And the Blu Ray looks spetacular. I'm not sure if it's a new print with a true HD transfer or just a port of the DVD print. But it's pretty stellar quality.
B0051MKMNC|2.0|This is an interesting concept with too many problems within.  Here is a pill that makes you smart yet somehow Cooper always has problems!  He didn't know he was out of pills until he grabed the last one.  Never occured to him?  He forgot to pay his loan shark back with his millions of dollars of profit?  The worst of course, is that he successfully predicted a texting driver would crash into another car.  Out of all ways and means to prove this guy is brilliant, the movie has to resort to complete random chance.<br /><br />Not to say it was terrible - it was entertaining but too many scenes threw me off.  It's a problem to have a genius run into problems he could have easily avoided.  The final scene is Cooper chewing down on De Niro when in fact that speech should be geared toward the audience, not some small character we don't care about and can't connect to.  There were not enough connections to everyday events (people) to engage us.<br /><br />It's enjoyable but I wouldn't say go out of your way to see it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I was under the impression that Matt Woods, the guy in charge of the SOUND for this release was reading the blogs and knew people are so pissed off about some stuff.    Well, why can't Lucas release this retarded version, AND give ALL the STAR WARS fans, the original trilogy as well? And I mean, original, just clean it up, and have better sound? I swear. Why can't he do that???      I'm so pissed.
B002VECM72|5.0|I love this movie, I had to buy it when it came out and amazon has some of the greates prices around.
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|I thought twice about reviewing this book even though I rate it highly. What more could I possibly say that hasn't already been said? (Yes, I know, it's hard to believe that a bookworm like me has only just discovered this gem.) But then I started making comparisons with another classic I have read and felt compelled to say something if only to set the record straight.   Having noted the blatantly obvious in my usual way, with a Homeresque dimwittedness that I ascribe to age, I dug out Salinger's classic and read it through again, partly to make sure that the five-stars I had given it on Goodreads was justified, also to see if my memory was playing tricks on me or if these classics really are comparable.  My conclusion is that `Catcher in the Rye' is only a four-star read. Comparable, indeed, but lacking in many ways. That said it's important to remember that Holden Caulfield's female counterpart, Esther Greenwood, is also Plath's alter-ego and as such is empowered with the voice of experience.   And what an experience. Five-stars all the way.
B000U6DU92|5.0|I'm not a big fan of television and I remember a few years ago seeing a promo for this new series.  However, my cable company didn't carry the Sci-Fi channel and I had forgotten all about it until it I got my subscription to NetFlix.  While the show typically uses the same mechanical plot from week to week (something big is scheduled to happen but is interrupted by another experiment that only the Sheriff can figure out so in the end everything is o.k.), the mix of science, science fiction, and humor makes the show entertaining.  I've found myself researching the different theories presented on the television show out of sheer curiosity and it has sparked my interest in returning to school to finish up my Master's.    Colin Ferguson, hands down, is one of the funniest men on television today.  While \\"Dr. Fargo\\" lends a hand now and then, \\"Jack Carter\\" is the show's comic relief and the man that we can relate to.  There has been many times I have found myself laughing out loud while watching the show and that rarely happens with any other series.    It's a shame that the series will be cancelled after season 5, especially after being revitalized with a very great season 4, but all good things will eventually come to an end.  I would highly recommend this to any aspiring young scientist and/or science fiction fan looking for inspiration.
B00356CO1E|5.0|I am a beginner at workout videos.  This is the best workout video I have tried.  Jillian explains everything and I don't feel so clumsy and the moves are not complicated.  It works you hard and just when you want to give up... It's over.
B0055S348W|1.0|Downloaded quickly to my DroidX but wouldn't recognize my Canon Pixma iP100 sitting 2 feet away on bluetooth. Oh, well, didn't really want it reading my contacts and email anyway...so uninstalled it.
B004EPZ09S|5.0|As a practicing physician in the hospital (including caring for critically ill & dying adult / pediatric patients) for 16 years, and a father of a 5-year-old who also witnessed the miscarriages of my wife's twice, who was born in Macau, lived & visited Hong Kong / Kowloon, San Francisco, Tokyo, Chicago, London, & Paris, plus dealing with frontline physicians, academic scientists, insurance companies, Big Pharma, public health leaders, elected officials, non-profit organizations, homeopathic practitioners, ...  this movie (especially experienced with IMAX) SIMPLY knocked my socks off unexpectedly!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Not only that it scratches the Kinect, eventhough it comes with protective sticker. It also comes with many issues. With the sticker applied, detection are non-existent. After I take off the sticker, it detects but causes scratches. But then again it will not detect the floor. Followed the online guide but to no avail. Contacted Nyko, but gets no reply. In conclusion, unless it comes with a return policy it is a bad investment.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Great movie about an amazing woman who single-handedly revolutionized the packing industry!  Clare Danes won an Oscar for her performance.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|I own the original, extended version and now the Blu-Ray version. I can't top the other long winded review that was amazing further down from mine but I can only echo those sentiments. Overall, it is better than the original but yes, it sure could have been sharpened up. Either way, it's worth the money.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is a insult to every Star Wars fan... Stay away from this... The modification that have been done to the original movie is just a crime.  We just want the original scenes, maybe some modifications to remove grain, etc. But no color changes, no music change, no mix changes...    As I said if you are a star wars fan, stay away from this product, tears from pain will come from your eyes by watching this...
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My son really likes this toy.  My only qualm with it is that the hook that is supposed to pull cars in is a bit short but this is probably to keep it from being a strangulation hazard?  Anyway, nice toy.
B003UESJH4|5.0|We had good service ordering, receiving and of course, the movie was great!  Gave us an insight for those with speech problems and thankful for speech therapists!!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I had high hopes for the zoom..granted i've got like 9 ft between the kinect and my couch but kids like to move closer.  So i bought it the day it came out.  Hooked it up.  Played with it for 10min (calibrated it). and it worked horribly.    It is horrible at tracking any movements even with my hand right in front of the kinect Palm flat like you're telling someone to stop (it says to do it that way in the manual).    Tried fixing lighting.. nothing worked to make it worked smoothly.  I figured i'd try out fruit ninja with it and it couldn't accurately tell where i was even slicing my hands.      Decided to try your shape with it to see if it would help with that and also worked horribly.  [...]    How is it supposed to work right if it can't register your whole body?    Before Zoom  [...]    After zoom  [...]    See how it's all splochy after you add the zoom.. Those sploches move around so it can't track well at all.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Got this CD for my husband.  He loves rock, so this was a great addition to his collection.  The only problem was that he blew the speakers in his truck and had to get new ones installed.
B0055S348W|3.0|does not support lexmark x7675. needs dropbox integration too. looks clean though, I'll have to try it on other printers though.
1601251831|5.0|You know you've done something incredibly right when the mere thought of having to look through another monster manual from any other system is met with trepidation and annoyance.<br /><br />**SIGH** \\"You mean it's not in the Pathfinder Bestiary? I have to look up stuff in some other less organized, poorly edited monster manual? Maybe I'll just choose something else from here.\\"  =)<br /><br />In all seriousness, this is the best, easiest-to-read, monster manual / bestiary I've seen. The artwork is fantastic and evocative; I can't count the number of times as a GM I've wanted to turn to a player and say, \\"You're about to fight THIS. Isn't that awesome?\\" As noted, there are several classic D&D monsters that couldn't make the cut due to intellectual property considerations, and they are missed (my personal non-appearing favorite: displacer beasts).<br /><br />Doesn't change the fact that this is a prized GM possession, and should find a worthy space on any serious tabletop gamer's shelf.
B004V7EXO2|5.0|I heard the song Rewrite one night and had to hear the album. I down loaded it and was not disappointed. I thought the creativity with the music was simply awesome. After listening to the entire album a few times, I realized how much I enjoyed the lyrics. I continue to hear different things in the album. I love this album.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Don't let the inexpensive price fool you. This is a pretty good case. It is a harder plastic/rubber mix that is good for gripping and yet flexible enough to get your phone in to. I like the slim profile of it. I use an otterbox case 90% of the time for work. I change cases maybe once a week for an evening when I want something much smaller and sleek to carry in my pocket. This gives me an opportunity to clean my otterbox case. This case to me seems just right to protect the iPhone yet allow the iPhone's design to show thru. So far after several months of occasional use, I am very happy with it.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Words cannot describe how stupefied George Lucas has made me. The numerous modifications to this edition brings back the very same nauseated feeling when watching the \\"remastered\\" flight into Cloud City when the VHS set came out. The awful CGI has only become a growing motif in regards to the Star Wars IP; there is an entire TV series which runs off of this principle change--for a target audience to which these offensive, ill-conceived visuals are marketing towards. Star Wars was originally intended for kids, but its collective following garnered enormous support from all age demographics over the decades. What baffles me is why George actually EXPENDS MONEY in making these modifications, instead of IMPROVING upon the EXISTING Audio \ Visual elements. That is to say, Georges idea of improvement involve modifying metaphysical aspects, such as the atmosphere of a situation, where he should have been focusing on something like color saturation, audio levels, things which could be taken advantage of in the contemporary living room. Instead adding some half-baked excuse of a graphic \\"extra\\" character walking in the background is immensely distracted in low resolution situations; it is tenfold worse exploded on a larger high definition screen. He needs to simply release the originals, in HD, period. Nothing else, nothing extra is needed. I don't want special features, or deleted scenes, I don't want anything of that nature, and that's what the fans--at least I believe as much--feel. All this time and money has been expended for something denaturalized from its original form, it isn't an improvement of the old, but some sick twisted mutation, a foggy image of what once was. Perhaps that's saying a lot about George Lucas at this point in his career, maybe he should just get out of the business all together.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This blu-ray set arrived today, some 2 weeks earlier than expected.  Well done Amazon and the various postal services involved.    The movie made a huge impression on me when I first saw it on TV so when I found it on blu-ray I had to have it.  It's every bit as good as I remembered.  The transfer to blu-ray has been well handled, too.  The only gripe I have is that they've kept the original episodic construction from TV.  I'd have liked the option to play the whole thing straight through, uninterrupted.  Perfect for a cold, wet afternoon like today.    Do I recommend this movie?  You bet!
B0055S348W|2.0|the app is good. However there is a 20 page limit for the paid version. Boo! Bad developer. save your$$$ and do Google cloud print instead.
B0055S348W|5.0|Great app that does just what I hoped it would.  Love printing across wifi to my epson 610.  Thanks to @mazon for making this free app of the day.
0553582038|2.0|All the other reviews are right. I mean, anyone who made it this far was so excited after books 2 and 3 that they think there is no way book 4 can be THAT bad. But it is. It falls off a cliff. Either the author is just trying to make more money by extending the series, or he's gotten senile and is out of good ideas, or his publishers forced him into this. Martin even includes a note at the end basically saying \\"sorry, the characters you care about will be in the next book.\\" The entire book is full of new characters and stories we don't care about, and basically NOTHING happens. There is more action in 2 chapters of Book 3 than this entire book. His repetitive style of starting a chapter in the middle of some story, leaving you confused, then explaining the past and filling in the holes through a narrative or dream, gets very old very quick. The only characters you remotely care about *SPOILER ALERT* include Arya, Sam and the Cersei/Jaime/Brienne plot. I finished the book and still am not sure what happened to Arya. She went from place to place, narrowly missed learning about her family and rejoining them, then prayed in a temple and sold some clams. Sam leaves the wall to become a maester and rides a boat. Jaime can't fight, Cersei's a scheming b*tch and Brienne is still a failure. The rest of the book is the Greyjoys and the Dornes, whom no one cares about, and Sansa stuck with that whiney brat Vale kid. End book. It almost made me NOT buy dance of dragons, but after reading 10,000 pages to get this far, I can't stop now.  I'm stuck. He should've had an epilogue in book 3 of Dany and Jon riding dragons wearing crowns side by side and ended it. Thanks for nothing Martin.

B00005JLKN|4.0|After the disappointment that was `Hannibal', I really wasn't expecting anything substantial out of `Red Dragon'.  I have not seen the original adaptation, `Manhunter', so I had nothing to base my expectations on outside of the incredible `The Silence of the Lambs' and the horrendous free-fall `Hannibal'.  What I got was something far grander than I expected.  It is laced with a familiar feeling that can allude to something along the lines of `Law & Order: Criminal Intent' at times, but overall this is a tout thriller that delivers the chills.<br /><br />Much like in `The Silence of the Lambs', Hannibal Lector himself is not the chief `villain' here, but merely a sounding board and advice column for an FBI agent, this time a male by the name of Will Graham.  The villain this go around is The Tooth Fairy, a disturbed serial killer covered in a dragon tattoo.  Graham, battling his own demons (aren't we all) uses Hannibal to track down this savage killer.  Hannibal and Graham have their own history though, and it is that history that plays an integral role in the advice Graham receives.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is extraordinary here.  He is truly terrifying; chilling to the bone.  This was released the same year that Fiennes plays another disturbed soul in Cronenberg's `Spider'.  I feel that his portrayal of The Tooth Fairy is far more complex and effective.  Edward Norton is one of my favorite actors, but he doesn't pop as much here; especially when he's sandwiched between Fiennes and Hopkins, both of whom steal spotlight rather effortlessly.  I'm happy to see Hopkins more effective here than in `Hannibal', though I'd be lying if I said I was happy to see him continually reprise this role.  I don't know, I mean; I'm one who says that if you play a role once and a sequel or whatever is made then you should do it again, but there is something about this franchise that feels a tad unnecessary.  Maybe it's because Demme's 1991 masterpiece was so unexpectedly and universally lauded that the subsequent sequels (and prequels) feel like cheap attempts at capitalizing off the initial success, especially with Hopkins.  Maybe I should blame the rest of his career, which at times feels like it's always trying to remind us of his turn as Hannibal (countless movie posters using his face and that `look' as a way to pull in the crowds).  I feel like I've seen him do this enough and I don't want to see him do it again.  An actor as brilliant as Anthony Hopkins should never be reduced to a variation of a singular character.<br /><br />That's enough ranting.<br /><br />Outside of a few glitches and an ending that was clearly designed to illicit a desired reaction that is a bit of a cop-out as others have called it, `Red Dragon' is a well-rounded thriller that isn't an embarrassment to its source material.  Fiennes is dynamic, and even supporting performances from Emily Watson and Philip Seymour Hoffman make an impact.<br /><br />It's better than you think it'll be.the subsequent sequels (and prequels) feel like cheap attempts at capitalizing off the initial success, especially with Hopkins.

B004SB60OC|5.0|Christina Perri is such a refreshing talent.  She comes across humble, content with delivering great music and not preoccupied with catching our eye with the unessentials.  She focuses her energy on writing, and what we are left with is a collection of supremely inspired songs that are layered with emotional depth that is backed up with intelligent and inspired lyrics.<br /><br />I'm so excited to review this album!<br /><br />`Bluebird' opens the album flawlessly.  The songs theme, which tells of a love triangle that is taking its toll on Perri emotionally, is impeccably tailored with such allegorical mastery.  I loved the likening of the `other woman' to a bluebird.  Perri also throws blame in the right direction (\\"if he was something special I wouldn't have this song\\") while accepting her inability to do the right thing by herself (\\"what if when she comes over I am in your arms taking all I want from you again\\").  `Arms' seriously gave me chills.  As Christina sings softly about the love of her life, the one who she didn't expect but who swooped in and saved her, you can't help but feel such emotional connection.  The lyrical content here is so sublimely crafted, with astute words that help create a well-rounded understanding of her `love', right down to the insecurities that corrode her happiness (\\"I believe that it's easier for you to let me go\\").<br /><br />`Bang Bang Bang' has such energy, with those bouncy piano keys and that explosive chorus.  I love the way she takes the subject (relishing the karma that strikes and ex beau) and ignites it with a chant worthy chorus (\\"bang she shot you, karma tastes so sweet\\") while never negating her knack for piercing verse structure (\\"you lied and you lied and I died and I dies and now you know why\\").<br /><br /> `Distance' plays out beautifully, as Christina sings about that king of love that you have to keep secret for fear of losing it.  As the male vocals slip in to elevate the chorus line (\\"say I love you while you're not listening\\") the song just swells with such restrained intensity.  It is a heart touching song about loving the wrong person, or possibly the right person who is just willing to accept that he (or she) loves you too.  `Jar of Hearts' is the first song the world heard from Perri.  It is impressively haunting, even now that it's been played and played and played out.  The imagery that comes from her words (\\"who do you think you are, running round leaving scars, collecting your jar of hearts and tearing love apart\\") is truly inspired and leaves lasting impression, and the way she delivers it with such solemn intensity over those haunted piano keys is just devastating.  `Mine' shows a more edgy and upbeat side to Perri.  She even inserts a slightly sinister atmosphere into the way she repeats that word; \\"mine\\".  It's fun and bouncy, and the musical breakdown (I love the fluctuations) is completely engaging.  That total feeling of losing the control you thought you had (\\"how did this happen and why are you laughing and how do I get back together again?\\") really illuminates the close of the song extremely well.<br /><br />`Penguin' is so soft and sweet and gentle moving; and I just have this utter adoration of penguins, and so likening true love to those cuddly little creatures was such a marvelous metaphor (\\"like a soul mate, he's your penguin\\").  The track is very simple and really rests on Perri's soft delivery (she almost whispers the song).  The song is ethereal, especially the closing bridge where Perri's voice pierces with the enchanting chanting of \\"let go\\".<br /><br />The song feels special.<br /><br />`Miles' is extremely catchy, but in that vein it is also somewhat familiar.  It doesn't stand out as much as the other tracks here.  Instead, it sounds like a B-Side off of a Sara Bareilles album or something like that.  Even the chorus line (\\"don't count the miles, count the `I Love You's'\\") feels a tad stale and uninspired, and especially disappointing when you consider the staggering depth she brought to nearly every other song here.  `The Lonely' sends shivers down my soul.  She just bleeds with such emotional devastation here; certainly her most haunting track, even more debilitating than `Jar of Hearts'.  The rise given to the chorus (that piano work) really gives the track an almost orchestral quality.  She really captures the realities of loneliness (\\"I'm the ghost of a girl that I want to be most\\") with such curious intensity; and that singular line about \\"dancing slowly in an empty room\\" is visually shattering.  `Sad Song' is my least favorite track here because it seems to be trying too hard (\\"today I'm gonna write a sad song...so that everyone can see that I'm very unhappy\\").  It's just too straightforward for its own good.  Telling us that this is a sad song doesn't necessarily make it sad, and the bouncy musical shift for the chorus is an odd match to the solemn verse structure.  I understand the lyrical content, but I found it a little too conventional; but I'll admit that Perri's vocal's make the song enjoyable regardless of the `immature' feeling I get from it.<br /><br />`Tragedy' closes out the album allows Christina to show such vulnerability in her voice, in the process embellishing her vocal range.  I love the way she starts her words without completely finishing them, allowing the break of her voice to finish the thought.  The song gets into the cracks of a relationship, and the sharp pains that come from realizing for yourself that this was the wrong thing to get wrapped up in (\\"why did you feel the need to prove that everybody else was right\\").<br /><br />It's a stunning way to close out the album.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, for it is certainly one of the best of the year!<br /><br />For those of you interested; my personal track ranking:<br /><br />1) Distance<br />2) Arms<br />3) Mine<br />4) Penguin<br />5) Bluebird<br />6) Tragedy<br />7) Jar of Hearts<br />8) Bang Bang Bang<br />9) The Lonely<br />10) Miles<br />11) Sad Songrly every other song here.   `The Lonely' sends shivers down my soul.

B000FQJAIW|5.0|Since George Lucas is a douche bag I was forced to search for the movies on DVD at a gouged price. I'd like to thank GoHastings for keeping the price reasonable, and getting them to me quickly. Since I live in Texas I got them in only a couple of days.     It's a shame I can't watch the theatrical versions in HD, but at least I can watch them on a Blu-Ray player, and not on a VCR.
0440244412|5.0|Loved it! When I first started the series I was a little bitter. I love my Durid Scots and their wives. All of them independent and strong. The spin-off was a wussy 'Rainbow Girl'. I couldn't get Reese Witherspoon's Elle Woods character with several twangy \\"bless you heart\\" lines thrown in. I hung in only because, heck if I know why I hung in and read the rest. I just kept thinking I'd get lucky and she would fade or die. I was SO glad she did find a spine. I'll keep it brief. Loved the last 2 books. Are all the questions answered? Nope. Was everyone singing the Smurf's La-La song? Nada. Was it all rainbows and butterflies. Perspective. I liked the way it finished.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bottom line folks, if you are a SW fan...who cares of the reviews, I've seen the movies in the thearter, on VHS, DVD and now I'll see Ble-ray, and well enjoy them just the same.  You don't need to see the blu-ray version just review it, watch the dvd or TV if you don't want to buy (spike shows them all the time), but just because the orginal versions aren't included is no reason to give it a bad review, its $80 bucks for 6 movies which cost 120-150 to get on dvd.  Give It Up Folks!!! rate the movie not the collection!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I don't get the complaining - the DVD set has just been released, so why soooooo many negative reviews. I received my set today and watched episode I - it was phenomenal. The 5.1 surround sound had my cats scampering every where.    Most of the negative reviewers appear as though they based their ratings after they watched a youtube video. I'm at least basing my review on the actual product! So, are all the complainers people who got laid off when they worked at ILM?
0439023521|3.0|A couple of persuasive people convinced me to read this book. It was a pretty decent read, although I was initially bothered by its unoriginality; It's essentially the protagonist of Winter's Bone (A somber, no-nonsense teenage girl living in the economically repressed Appalachians with an absent/dead father and a catatonic mother who is forced to hunt squirrels and other animals to provide for her younger siblings) inserted into the plot of the Japanese movie Battle Royale (Teenagers drafted into a reality television show set in the woods and forced to fight each other to the death). But the importance of originality can be overstated-the main point of the story is not WHAT it is about, but HOW it is about it (I think I stole that from Roger Ebert).    And I don't think either of those other works holds much appeal for a lot of young women anyway.    Hunger Games is a definite page turner, but unfortunately it isn't a wholly satisfying read-even by `young adult' standards. I got the impression that the author is more motivated by book sales and movie deals than providing a complete story experience for her reader. The book ends abruptly and you have to buy the rest of the trilogy to find out what happens. Perhaps this is the main reason for the lack of any serious characterization with the story's protagonist, Katniss. She's not terribly deep or insightful; at times her response to the whole battle to the death thing seems to border on nonchalance.    This is likely because Hunger Games: The Motion Picture was always meant to be marketed as an action-romance movie (rated PG-13!) and too much insight would slow things down. Plot is all you really need to make money. But Katniss is likable enough to carry the story and Collins does a capable job of highlighting her character's inner strength and craftiness and making her endearing.    Up until the arbitrary ending, I enjoyed it. If I had a young daughter (I would guess the targeted demographic here is between 10 and19), I would give her a copy of the book with the hope that she could find some inspiration in a tough female character who climbs trees, hunts rabbits and has more important things to do than obsess over getting a boyfriend.

1439156816|5.0|Stephen King knows how to write. He's been around a while and he's sold lots and lots of books, which I knew, but I'd never read any of them myself. The type of literary horror he's known for was never my thing. But after a friend convinced me to read King's memoir `On Writing,' I can understand why the guy is so popular.    The first half of `On Writing' is an autobiography. Again, not really my thing, but King drew me in. Most of the anecdotes about his \\"odd, herky-jerky childhood\\" range from funny to hilarious, and true to the title of the book, he involves the reader in the process of writing an autobiography as he does it, describing what it feels like trying to sort through his lifetime of unorganized memories.    The second half is where he actually writes about writing. I've read very few books about writing since composing sentences and stories always seemed to be something you just had to try; I never understood what knowledge a book about writing could impart that couldn't be discovered through my own attempts.  I was also weary of the kind of spiritual ridiculousness that some people attribute to creative pursuits, but King seemed to anticipate this concern, stating in his preface: \\"This is a short book because most books about writing are filled with bulls--t.\\" He won me over right away.    King keeps his writing advice succinct and tangible. My favorite two rules: Don't use a thesaurus because the first word you thought of is the best, and avoid adjectives because as a writer you should be showing instead of telling.    (Example: `\\"Stop that,\\" John said angrily.' That's a stupid sentence because a reader should be able to hear John's anger without being told it's there.)    Though King isn't unrealistically encouraging--he states a belief more than once that a bad writer cannot be made into a great one--he does a great job of sharing his love and enthusiasm for his craft. He made me want to write more and I plan to keep a copy of his book around for reference.  I'll also always keep in mind another piece of his advice:    \\"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot.\\"
B000PMLFRA|3.0|I have to admit...I will be buying the upcoming six disc set, but what I'd really like to see and what it looks like most of the other \\"original\\" fans would like to see is the Blu-Ray version of the originals. Clean up the video and audio tracks, but do not give us any of the special edition changes. Less is more. I am however, seriously considering cancelling my 6 disc BD boxed set in favor of the 3 disc set of both versions (wouldn't bother watching the SE versions though) and the 3 disc set of the newer trilogy. Sigh. If only a BD boxed set existed with this configuration, I would be satisfied.

0439023513|5.0|This was a great finish to a really great series.  Our whole family read these books and loved them, even my husband.  I would recommend to everyone, maybe a little strong for kids under ten, depending on the kid of course.  Hope you all enjoy it as much as we did.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I finally finished this book. I am so disapponited in this and the last book. The first three books were great. If there is another book I will wait to buy it after I have read the reviews. This book dragged from the begining. I dont feel like he new were it was going. Cant put into words how let down I feel. Buyers beware.

I now can say that I feel he is totally lost in where his character are, where they've been or where they're going!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first 3 books, dispite killing off so many main character we'd all invested a lot of time in. So, if you haven't started the series...and want to read some really good story...just read the first 3 and stop...never go any further..just use your own imagination to determine the rest of the tale...you'll much more pleased in the results.<br /><br />However, I now compare reading this book (a 956 page continuation of the last one) to swimming in a pool of thick pea soup. (Dispite the sterling reviews of his NON-GOT stories....I wouldn't even think of attempting getting involved in his other literary efforts!!)<br /><br />I read book 5 (only up to page 913 of 959 before said bank shot into the trash took place) as it reminded me of Ronald Reagan saying, \\"Wellllll, there he goes...again!\\"<br /><br />When Martin killed of the 1st of the house Stark (Eddard) in book 1, I was sorely disappointed...but carried on because \\"Merde Happens\\"....when he killed off the 2nd of House Stark (Rob) I felt betrayed because of his taking sooooo much of my time to build up the \\"Wolf-Boy King\\" (was this an nod to the Kennedy assination?)...but I still carried on because of his excellence in descriptive writing and after all...we were getting interested in the Imp and the Stark girls, Jammie and those storylines...which are now going no place but in boring circles.<br /><br />However, killing off Jon Snow is the end for me.

B004EPZ070|2.0|This movie is based off the chick-lit novel by Emily Giffen of the same name.  I went in with low expectations because I loved the book so much, and unfortunately the movie lived up to those expectations.  Had I not read the book, I might have given this movie 2.5 - 3 stars.  As it is, I will generously give this 2 stars.    Amazon's laughable product review says it all, \\"borrows some of the best bits from earlier romantic comedies like When Harry Met Sally..., 27 Dresses, and Sex and the City\\"  How do those movies belong in the same sentence together at all?  Let's make this clear--this movie is nowhere near 'When Harry Met Sally'.  And '27 Dresses', really that's a selling point?  That movie was awful--so yes, I guess this movie does have something in common with that one.       Where do I start?  The movie 'Something Borrowed' was flat and disjointed.  There was definitely something missing.  I hated the flashback scenes; they were awkward & the writers and director could have found other ways to inject the past into the storyline.  The actors themselves did an okay job, but considering who was on board I expected so much more.  It was a waste of Ginnifer Goodwin's talents to portray Rachel--here she was a mousy doormat and I wondered why Dex, Ethan, or anyone else would even want to be with her.  Kate Hudson fared better--though her appearance is a complete contrast to Darcy in the book, she was the most successful in bringing life to the character.  The Marcus character made me cringe whenever he was on screen.  Colin Egglesfield as Dex was just there; I don't particularly think he added or detracted anything, which is not really good since he's supposed to be a huge part of this story.  I don't know if he could have done more based on what he was given to work with because the script cut out a lot of the development of Dex & Rachel's relationship.  And I guess that is true for all the actors--they should have been great instead they were just \\"eh\\".      One ofthe few bright spots in this movie is John Krasinski.  His character was elevated from the minor role in the book in order to provide much needed comic relief but also to set up for the sequel that's in the works (which should hopefully be a little more successful if for no other reason than John Krasinski will be the lead).      If you absolutely want to watch this movie, rent it don't buy it.  Instead, I recommend you read the book which takes a difficult story and explores the intricacies of relationships and betrayal.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is a great family movie!  Highly recommended!! Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone!  The shark sequence may be too much for younger kids but overall the whole movie was very inspirational.
0553801473|5.0|I'm not quite sure how I'd rate this book as a standalone story if I wasn't already enthralled with the overall Epic Story (and all of the substories that fashion it).<br /><br />I am lucky in that I started in the series about 6-8 months prior to \\"Game of Thrones\\" being released on HBO.  I found it at the top of several lists online for great fantasy books and reluctantly gave it a try.  I hope I don't have to wait 6-8 years for the next one like some of you did for this one.<br /><br />I read some of the reviews complaining that the book might be \\"running to stand still\\" (moving along for 1000+ pages but not ever getting anywhere).  To me, any continuing series is a bit that way.  If the stories ended at the end of each book, then each book might as well be its own unique story.  As is, the stories continue from one book to the next.<br /><br />Having said that, one would hope that some things would be resolved in so many pages of story.  I think in an epic series, some of the sub-plots should be at least apparently resolved with others possibly being left open to the next book.  It is probably true that this book is a bit more open-ended with less resolution than the others.  I can't imagine trying to keep a somewhat parallel time-span (i.e. with the previous book) in some parts of the book while accelerating through time in other parts of the book and keeping it all straight.  I think the POV and ambiguity of time helps.<br /><br />I saw people complain that he wasn't true to his \\"shades of gray\\" character types and \\"anyone can die at any time and be really dead forever\\" mantra.  To that I ask, if he has to unpredictably kill a main character or two in every book, is it really still unpredictable?  Isn't it then more unpredictable to not kill one?<br /><br />Without giving spoilers, this book made me care about some characters I hadn't previously liked as much.  I hope they don't die anytime soon.<br /><br />Despite any criticisms, the Epic Story, as it continues from book to book, is fantastic.  This book is quite enjoyable.  I don't know that any of the others made me want to rush to finding out what was going to happen next to a character more than this one did.  Too bad, you don't always find out in this book but as long as the next one isn't too long in coming, that will be fine.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Wonderful animated movie for the whole family!  Wish I had seen it in the movie theater because the graphics looked awesome on our HD TV via the bluray player so can only imagine how it would have looked on the big screen! Thoroughly enjoyed the extra special features with educational info on Brazil!
B0055S348W|5.0|After installing and testing this app, I highly recommend it.    I obtained the premium, unlocked version of PrinterShare Mobile Print as the \\"free\\" app of the day.  All together it took me about 10 minutes to install all components and set up the account.  1. Install PrinterShare Mobile Print from Amazon onto Droid 3  2. Install 'PrinterShare for Windows' (32-bit) onto my PC running Windows XP (There is a 64-bit for 64-bit Windows 7) [...]  3. Select printer(s) within the 'PrinterShare for Windows'  3. Sign-up for \\"free\\" PrinterShare account  4. Install rendering software onto Droid 3 (4 mb)    Now you are ready to go.     I printed a small photo and a small MS word (.doc) file on the Epson printer from the Droid 3 and it printed as expected.  I also 'printed' a file to Adobe PDF and a .pdf file was created.    There is a slight delay from pressing 'Print' on the Droid 3 until it appears 'ready-to-print' (or auto-prints depending on your print set up). This delay is based on the size of the document. With the 3 docs, the longest delay was under 2 minutes and it was for the Adobe PDF, the 2 that went straight to print were under 1 minute.    My wife also downloaded and installed PrinterShare Mobile Print.  We linked it to the same account on the PC and it worked flawlessly. She especially likes the ease in printing pictures from her Droid 3.     This is a great app.
B005IU1OMA|3.0|Funny enough, you still need to buy it and watch it.  Brain Farm is the at the top of their game, and even when the conditions totally hose them over, they manage to make something as good as Art of Flight, which is a testament to their talent.  I've probably watched Thats it Thats all at least 20 times.  When you put the two side by side, TAOF pales.  This is a movie made by adults (compared to TITA which was made by some extremely talented kids).  The voice narration felt forced, and only some of the music hit as hard as the first movie.  The little things, like showing how a snowboard was made, and the guy driving a snowmobile over a lake really added to the movie.  In this one, they shoot down trees with a shotgun and blow stuff up.  I get it, they're thrill seekers, but killing a tree like that seemed a bit crass.  Them knocking dead parts of a tree when they hit jumps is part of their craft, I guess?  However between them nearly dying, and everyone telling them they were insane, and the tension when the heli had to shut down on top of a mountain, this movie felt dark.      Anyway, what happened to the M83 track from the trailer?  Don't get me wrong, I like Deadmau5, saw him in concert even, but Fire Shall Devour them is better than any of the tracks on the soundtrack.      What is frustrating is the fact that Jackson had probably their biggest snow year ever, I think.  They could have spent most of the time there doing tree runs, tricks, and runs there.  I would have been happy.  Jackson Hole is the greatest ski resort on the face of the earth.  Watching them strike out three times (Chile, Patagonia, Canada) for good conditions was really deflating.  More like \\"The art of getting your heart broken\\".  I still love Brain Farm and Travis Rice and crew, I just didn't like this as much as TITA, which had more passion, and unbridled joy for snow boarding throughout the movie.  Then again, I'm just a skier, what do I know? ;-)
B00004Y6O7|5.0|In this fourth effort from Van Halen, Edward starts Fair Warning with a guitar introduction as revolutionary as his work on Eruption four years earlier. Mean Street is a killer and somewhat mean track with an extremely agressive sound and tone both from David Lee Roth's lyrics and Eddie's guitar. Dirty Movies is a gesture to the Porn Industry, which was coming off a high point with the success of John Holmes. Sinner's Swing is a raucous rocker, Dave using the F-Word on record for the first time. Hear About Later has a very catchy hook and good vocals from Dave and the rest of the band. Unchained is a favorite VH track, good phasing/echo intro and a funny exchange between Dave and Eddie, ad lib by Dave of course. Push Comes To Shove is a track with a great bass line from Micheal Anthony. So This Is Love, one of Van Halen's best tracks, is funny, uplifting, and entertaining. The album closes with Sunday Afternoon In The Park/One Foot Out The Door, a noodling adventure for Alex,Eddie, and Micheal. Although the album is criticized for being too \\"Dark\\", it does contain some brillant guitar work by Edward Van Halen. Highly Recommended!

B000001FKY|5.0|In this Multi-Platinum best-seller(20 million + certification), Def Leppard entered into the company of an elite class of Rock History. The album, produced by Robert \\"Mutt\\" Lange, equally famous for his work with AC/DC, had set the bar for studio production on this album. The album contains 7 Hit Singles, yes 7 of them, and ANY song of the twelve on this disc could easily receive radio airplay. Joe Elliot(lead singer), Steve Clark(lead guitar), Phil Collen(lead/rythym guitar), Rick Savage(bass), and Rick Allen(drums) combined their writing/composition skills and created what is undoubtedly one of the Top 5 Albums in rock history. The album opens with Women, a track that although was not a huge hit had huge lyrical inspiration from the Book of Genesis in The Bible, telling the story of Adam & Eve and the creation of women. Rockett, the next track is the most musically ambitious of the album, and probably the dics best live performance track. Animal, which was Leppard's first big sucess in the UK, also featured a great video for MTV. Love Bites, the bands first and only chart topper is still played on stations everywhere to this day. Pour Some Sugar On Me, a sweetheart of strip clubs everywhere reached #2 on the Billboard Album charts and had extremely suggestive lyrics. Armageddon It, the albums sixth single, is still a live favorite. Gods Of War, was a reflective piece on President Ronald Reagan, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Pope John Paul II and the end of the Cold War. Don't Shoot Shotgun, a great rocker with some good trade off leads. Run Riot, probably the most raucous track in the Def Leppard catalogue, is great for preparing for sports outings, soccer in particular, haha. Hysteria, the albums 7th single, featured a Police-like drum beat and very staccato phrasing by Phil Collen. Excitable, another \\"party\\" track with an acrobatic bass line from Sav. Love and Affection seems like a track you would here at the end of a movie, great slide work from Steve Clark on this one. This album is a MUST have in Any Rock Music collection, if you don't own a copy I urge you to buy one.Clark on this one.

B005HG4C4C|4.0|Edit: After more time with record  Musically, this is probably one of the band's most traditional albums in years. The band has returned to the solid, song-oriented melodic prog that made Images and Words and Awake so special. In all fairness, Dream Theater did make a minor move towards more song-oriented tracks on Black Clouds and Silver Linings, but without `metal' Mike Portnoy the band have entirely returned to that focus. That isn't meant to imply that the band have given up on a bit of musical indulgence from time to time, but just like in the band's early days, they actually complement the songs and are surprisingly brief (by Dream Theater standards). Also, without such an obsessive focus on belting out the metal, there's a lot more diversity to be found on this album.  More interestingly the songs all have something distinctive. It takes a while to appreciate them though, which isn't that surprizing considering we're talking about archetypical progressive music. Mike Mangini is more than capable of reproducing Mike Portnoy's parts in a live situation, but it still left me wondering what he could do on his own. Unfortunately it goes without saying that Mike Mangini is a technically proficient drummer, but he is also entirely bland. Maybe it's the over production but the drums have no original sound of there own and just leave me a little to flat, 4 stars
B005DZMODI|2.0|This will make a good soundtrack for the next Woody Allen movie!    For God's sake Eric move back to the left or right !

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book for me started out as a suggestion from a few friends, and as I began I found myself not being able to put it down.

0307454541|1.0|At the risk of sounding like a Hipster, after Twilight, Water for Elephants, Atonement, and now--Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I swear I will never read another best seller with raving reviews. Harry Potter, Dickens, and Christopher Moore got me all confused and thinking that the masses had good taste. Apparently not.<br /><br />Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has one major problem: editing. As in, there wasn't any. The book took two hundred pages to get going, the mystery was solved about a hundred pages later, but kept going for another three hundred pages. There were pages and pages of superfluous details about what people were wearing and what they were eating. Not exactly gripping stuff. Not to mention, all characters wandering around and doing nothing.<br /><br />Actually, even if all that stuff were edited out, there wouldn't really be anything left. The mystery itself is completely and utterly predictable, boring, and unrealistic. I can't possible spoil anything because there's nothing to spoil here. And, with all the characters being utterly flat, boring, and even obnoxious, there are no twists, turns, or emotional investment in what happens to them.<br /><br />So, my advice, toss this book away and curl up with a good old Agatha Christie. Shorter, but packing more twists and turns, more psychological depth, more intrigue, more humanity and more profound thought, in one page of one hundred, than this entire book.  Grade: F

B003ZSJ212|1.0|This is yet another insult to those of us who made Star Wars the success that it was.  For Mr. Lucas to thumb his nose at us and continue to make changes to the original trilogy after we all cried out in terror and were ignored by him the last time is to add insult to injury.<br /><br />The new sound for Obi-Wan scaring off the Sand People was awful, and sounded like it was made in a small sound stage; the Greedo shoots first scene is still awful; Ewoks should not have CGI eyes; and Vader isn't the type to yell out, \\"NOOOOO!!\\" as he makes the fateful decision to save the life of his son.  I'm still upset about other changes made in the past, such as adding in a bad dub of Threepio explaining how the tractor beam is controlled by X different switches in the Death Star, and a power loss at any one of these would allow the ship to leave.  It's pointless and sounds awful!  And since when do clones raised from babies have the exact same *accent* as their prime?  Give Boba Fett his original voice back!  And need I say it?  ... Yes.  Han shoots first!!<br /><br />You can still find the original trilogy on the Limited Edition DVDs that came out a few years ago, but those are going fast.  They also are letter-boxed (not anamorphic widescreen), standard stereo (no surround sound) and are very raw, with graininess and lines the order of the day.  But at least they are not altered!<br /><br />To borrow from one of my favorite web comics (Dork Tower), he spends all this time revising movies that were beyond popular, and yet does *nothing* in an attempt to improve \\"Howard the Duck\\"??<br /><br />Poor form, Mr. Lucas.  Poor form.  Release the original trilogy on Blu-ray, and this time, make them anamorphic widescreen, give them surround sound (without screwing with the sounds!) and for the love of God, clean them up!!

B0055S348W|5.0|Scanned and found my Brother 2170w printer instantly.  Suggested a generic driver which worked, perfectly.  Most useful Free app of the day in a long while.
B0034G4P80|5.0|All I can say is that Mr. Branagh was the perfect choice to lead a brilliant cast fortified with spectacular writing. As a Marvel comic aficionado since I was a child and classical literature for slightly less time I can say that this is a Damn Fine Film!
1594744769|5.0|The thing that drew me to this book in the first place was the picture on the cover...and I'm so glad it did!  I loved this book!<br /><br />When I first started reading I was expecting a thriller, something scary, but was pleasantly surprised with a fantasy land with a daydreaming quality.  It was an easy read with an easy plot to follow, but the pictures added a fabulous effect!  They actually gave the book a creepy feeling, making it seem much darker than it actually was without taking it too far into the scary range.
B005E7AOHI|5.0|This album is pretty experimental - a mixture of \\"Brown Album\\", \\"Frizzle Fry\\", John Tesh, and songs that remind me of \\"Pilcher's Squad\\". I like it a lot. Some pretty spacy, out there stuff on here. Les' annual trip sessions on mushrooms seem to be paying off dividends. I think I'll have some Mountain Dew now.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is probably one of the best printing options available for Android. Setup is pretty simple. Even though my Epson Artisan 835 wasn't listed, I was able to select the 810 driver and it tested just fine. I like the fact that it will connect to network printers without needing a computer (depending on the printer.<br /><br />The desktop software was pretty easy to set up on my computer a well. The things that threw me off at first was seeing a page count at the top of the desktop app. Using the free/test app from the Marketplace deducted from the page count. But, using this premium version doesn't, so there isn't any need to pay anything more to use this remotely. I love having the ability to print from anywhere, even when out on the road.<br /><br />I only have two issues with the software. First, I use K-9 Mail for work. The neat thing is that from within K-9, you can print emails using the Share option. The down side is that it doesn't print HTML emails this way. When I contacted support, they responded quickly to say this is something they are working on.<br /><br />The second issue its along the same lines. You can print web pages directly from the browser. The problem comes from how Android passes things overt with the Share option. If I buy something over the internet, then wasn't to print a receipt, using the Share option from the browser only sends Printer Share the web address. What I end up seeing in the print preview screen is the websites login page, not the receipt. I don't think that is a problem with Printer Share, but just with how Android passes the information.<br /><br />If you are looking to print from your Android device, this will definitely work. It works very well on my Samsung Mesmerize.
B000SC245E|5.0|The new belt unit came very quickly.  Instructions were as good as they ever seem to be;-)  Make sure you have room to spread out when you install this.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is the first print app I've found that allows me to print web pages without having to convert them to PDF! I couldn't be more delighted. Using the nearby wifi the app found both my wifi printers. I chose to use my HP Photosmart Plus because only generic drivers were available for my Lexmark. I think this is the best print solution I have found for my tablet so far.
B0055S348W|5.0|Downloaded the app, checked for wifi printers in area, found mine. Driver downloaded automatically. Picked an email, previewed it, printed it. Start to finish, 2 minutes tops. Very impressed. Will be great for recipes off the Web, google maps, lunch box funnies. Full marks.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|Lucas opened Pandora's Box when he started tinkering with the films. It seems that whatever he does now, will still disappoint many of the fans of this series. When you are presenting a box set such as this, YES I would have liked to have the originals. Also digital copies are now the rule rather than the exception with this format. Last, on a minor note, the discs are somewhat difficult to remove from the packaging.
B005HEUF0Y|5.0|This is by far the best episode ever done on STNG. A must see. A very insightful tale. Well written. What would your life be in another life?
B004N44SOI|2.0|Ok, I figured I'd review this since I just sold it to a used CD store. First off, WTF happened? The Heroin Diaries was absolutely amazing. Top to bottom greatness. This album however, has 3 decent tracks. Them being \\"Live Forever\\", \\"Lies of the Beautiful People\\", and \\"This is Gonna Hurt\\". I would just suggest downloading them or importing them from a friend. The rest of the tracks are some of the worst songs I've ever heard. The artwork is ok, some pics from the new book. Needless to say, don't waste your money. Hopefully they call it quits and there isn't a third album.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|To leave out the original theatrical releases is an insult to all of us who knew and loved the first movies! I do not want changes! George Lucas is a fool for conducting himself this way. Saddens me, it does.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|They changed it! They changed that one part about when luke sees that one thing and why!!!! I dont like it. thats all I should say i think
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The changed are minor, the clean up is major. Episode 3 is reference material. 4 through 6 never looked or SOUNDED better! You will not regret this purchase
B0055S348W|5.0|I bought this app months ago and actually paid for it. It was totally worth it. And for anyone who gets their work email on their phone and may occasionally need to print attachments, it's a must have.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|\\"This will be a day long remembered.\\" This quote from the first Star Wars film, known since 1981 as \\"Episode Ⅳ: A New Hope,\\" describes the feelings of myself, and countless other Star Wars fans on the eagerly awaited Blu-ray release of the Star Wars saga. I just received mine about two hours ago as of this writing. But with every new release of Star Wars comes a looming question: What will George Lucas change this time?<br /><br />This was not always the case. Fifteen years of home video releases saw the trilogy presented exactly as they were seen in theaters (albeit usually in panned and scanned versions formatted to fit a standard television screen), and with the release of 1993's THX edition release (available in widescreen for the first time on VHS), it seemed the movies would never be better than they were.<br /><br />The work Industrial Light & Magic did for Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park changed all that. Lucas admitted that he was never happy with the way Star Wars came out, due mostly to restraints of time, money, and ILM's pioneering, yet crude technology, and announced that with current computer graphics, he could finally go back and complete scenes from the original trilogy that had bugged him for years.<br /><br />1997 saw the release of the Star Wars Trilogy Special Edition, a theatrical (and eventually home video) re-release of all three films with newly enhanced special effects, and a handful of additional scenes. To say the reaction was mixed would be an understatement. Nearly a decade-and-a-half after they were revealed to the world, many of the changes Lucas made have been heavily criticized and hotly debated. Those who grew up on the originals felt that the new additions ruined the movies. Disappointed fans took solace in the fact that at least they could still watch the original versions of the films at home on VHS.<br /><br />Seven years later saw the DVD release of the \\"Original Trilogy\\" as it was now known, following two prequels, with one last film on the way. Fans pleaded and prayed that Lucas would see fit to release the theatrical versions alongside the Special Editions, which were now said to have even more changes to better tie in the Originals with the Prequels. Not only did they not get their wish (at least not until a few years later), but many fans scoffed at some of the newest changes made to the series, believing the prequels to be further ruining the series, and any changes made to accommodate those films would be even more detrimental to the dignity of the Original Trilogy.<br /><br />So here we are today. I have my Star Wars Blu-rays laying on my sofa, awaiting their weekend marathon. I have heard rumors of even more changes to Episodes Ⅳ through Ⅵ, as well as a few for Ⅰ through Ⅲ. These rumors include deleted scenes incorporated into the films, a new CG Yoda to replace the puppet (I knew they were doing this for Episode Ⅰ, though I'm still unsure about whether this plan also includes Episodes Ⅴ and Ⅵ), and the possibility of Han once again shooting first. I will thank anyone who has knowledge of exactly what changes have been made to keep quiet. I want to be surprised.<br /><br />The thing is, after all these years of changes and complaints, I still don't see what the big deal is. There are very few changes to the Original Trilogy to which I strongly object, and none of those changes affect the over-all film in any way. What difference does it make whether Han or Greedo shoots first? As long as Greedo misses, the other approximately 13 hours, 20 minutes, and 59¾ seconds of the saga remains roughly the same. Sure, the Jabba the Hutt scene in A New Hope seems redundant and unnecessary in terms of the single film, and maybe it ruins the \\"big reveal\\" of Jabba in Return of the Jedi, but since Jabba already appears in The Phantom Menace (canonically the first film in the saga), and that scene was always supposed to be in A New Hope in the first place, it hardly ruins anything. I will agree, Jedi Rocks sucks, Lapti Nek is better, but since it is only a nonsensical musical number with no relation to the plot, whichever song they use is more personal preference than pertinence. Speaking of music, I also prefer the instrumental music and galactic celebrations used at the end of Jedi now to the \\"Yub Nub\\" teddy bear picnic from the original. And as for replacing Sebastian Shaw with Hayden Christensen... it could have been done better, but again, it's only a few seconds of footage, and for the new generation of Star Wars fans who have grown up with the prequels, it does help tie the whole story together.<br /><br />I have yet to even look at the Blu-rays (as of this writing), and I will not see anything from Episodes Ⅳ through Ⅵ until Sunday, but when I do I will reserve judgement, and determine for myself if anything \\"ruins\\" Star Wars. I doubt anything will. I might not agree with some of Lucas' decisions, but when it comes right down to it, they're not my -- nor anyone else's -- movies, but his. I challenge anyone who says that they could make a better movie than George Lucas to do so. Making fan edits and indie movies based on the Original Trilogy do not count as creativity. They are just stealing a brilliant idea from a more successful person and modifying it to fit someone else's tastes. The original movies were not perfect -- they have always had flaws -- but if the man who created them feels that the current versions are the best versions, that is his prerogative as their creator. If you don't like them, create your own multi-billion dollar franchise, and make them your way. These are his movies, and as long as they are his, they are mine too. Besides, they are only movies...<br /><br />UPDATE: I have just now finished watching all six movies and I can now confirm that more than ninety-nine percent of the saga appears on Blu-ray exactly as it appeared in theaters (Episodes Ⅱ and Ⅲ are, as far as I could tell, identical), withmost of the alterations being to Episodes Ⅳ-Ⅵ, which are still nearly ninety-nine percent the same as their theatrical versions.<br /><br />How do I come to this conclusion? Simple arithmetic. The combined total runtime of the entire saga is 805 minutes, 418 for the Prequels, 387 for the Original Trilogy. The only noticeable changes to the prequels were the aforementioned CG Yoda, and a brief fly-through of Coruscant, both in Episode Ⅰ (the fly-through was included on previous home video versions). By my rough estimate, there are approximately 4-5 minutes of significant new footage to Episodes Ⅳ-Ⅵ combined: about one minute each for the Jabba scene and Jedi Rocks, about 30 seconds each for Mos Eisley and the Victory Celebration, and about a minute or two of scattered CG enhancements like the animated Dewbacks, Rebel fly-by, Cloud City expansions, Sarlacc, etc. (The infamous \\"Greedo shoots first\\" shot is literally eight frames -- or one-third of a second -- long, in which Greedo fires an imperceptible two frames before Han. I counted.) Figuring conservatively that's approximately 98.7% of the Original Trilogy's footage left intact, all of which is story and character-based, meaning nothing even remotely alters the original plot.<br /><br />Since the Special Features discs were not included in the individual trilogy box sets, you'll find my review of those on [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]].
B005KAH7QU|5.0|Superb on many levels.  Right off the bat there is something different in terms of setting.  Then you have the unusual but genuinely close relationship between father and daughter.  Commence action.  Lots of action, and violence, but you can take it.  There is humor too.  A few moments when you might even bust a gut.  There is a mystery to solve that is interesting and original.  Saorise is beautiful, pure, innocent and deadly.  I was just reading a poem that asks the question, \\"Can a person be capable of both love and murder?\\"  In Hanna, you have an answer to that question.  Cate Blanchett is evil, and I didn't like her shoes, her hair or her fake Southern accent (why is it that that is the only one people can do if they are doing American?), but these all contribute to her role.  All in all VERY entertaining.  Highly recommend.

The most exciting ones were the deleted scenes from Episodes Ⅳ-Ⅵ.  I also liked the features on the building of the various models, including the Death Star Ⅱ and the Super Star Destroyer.  The Prequels' features were a little less interesting.  Most of the best stuff was already included on the DVDs, and unfortunately, as far as I could tell, none of the were carried over to the Blu-ray, including, sadly, the deleted scenes.  It would have been nice to have had the option to watch to Prequels in extended branching versions, since most of the deleted scenes were mostly completed for the DVD release, and would have served the subplots of the trilogy, but the only deleted scenes we get here are incomplete, pointless, and in some cases, only animatics.
B003YOZNBU|1.0|Bad acting and a silly script are only two of the problems with this film. It's hard to convert a comic book hero to the big screen, and for every one that succeeds (Spiderman, X-men, Batman) there are two or more that fail (Green Lantern, Green Hornet, Thor, Captain America, Fantastic Four, the Hulk) and that's especially true when the comic character is complex (Ghost Rider).<br /><br />Bottom line - this film will appeal only to the most hard core comic book fans, and even some of them might be disappointed.
B00000DWE2|5.0|Given the Who's reputation for being among the bad boys of the 60's, smashing instruments and lights and blowing up drums, who could have guessed that they would create one of the most cohesive pieces of rock music ever, a concept album, an opera, and plain solid rock.  The story is relatively easy to follow, with a variety of sordid elements, the details of which can be found in a host of places, and which have been covered by other reviewers, so let's focus on the music.<br /><br />The music holds up well; more than well, it was well done, and remains one of my favorites.  Released originally in 1969, the album had the benefit of building upon ground broken by the Beatles, among a host of others.  The Beatles infused elements of classical music into rock.  The Moody Blues fused classical music and rock into one.  The Who raised the ante by creating a new \\"classical\\" opera where the music was rock instead of classical.<br /><br />An example of some of the best instrumental neo-classical rock on this album is track 5, \\"Sparks,\\" which has excellent bass, is definably rock, and yet retains the complexity and flavor of a classical work, in rock music form.<br /><br />Among the other songs that are definably rock are \\"I'm Free,\\" \\"Tommy Can You Hear Me,\\" \\"Eyesight to the Blind,\\" \\"We're Not Gonna Take It,\\" and \\"Pinball Wizard.\\"<br /><br />Other songs that fill in the story that have the flavor of a musical are songs like \\"It's a Boy\\" and \\"1921.\\"  One song that has elements of a Beatles song is \\"Christmas.\\"<br /><br />I will allow the reader to categorize the other songs.  Truly it's not important.  What is important is that the Who took a variety of musical elements, classical, rock, opera, and created a master work of music.  Music that tells the poignant story of a child abused by his mother and step-father after witnessing the murder of the boy's father.  Thrown in are classic elements of opera: infidelity, exploitation, and cowardice, along with elements explored at that time in very few works: incest, homosexuality, and sexual abuse.<br /><br />As you listen to each of the tracks, discover that the Who were able to infuse multiple styles of rock music into the various songs, because each song allowed a variety of styles to enhance the subject of each song.  Hard rock, instrumental, pop, harmonies, raucous solos, hard-driving riffs, heavy bass, horns, it is all here, and more.<br /><br />Has \\"Tommy\\" dated well since 1969?  I think so.  The essence of the sound remains the Who, and if you know Who music at all, much of it sounds current, three decades and more after it was written.  \\"Tommy\\" is no less current.  Listening to the \\"The Acid Queen,\\" I hear music that some of today's artists are trying to achieve: a more basic rock sound, steering away from complex synthesizers and an over-orchestrated, over-exaggerated rock sound.<br /><br />Okay, where is the drawback?  The album really needs to be listened to in its entirety.  Some of the songs and lyrics make little sense outside the context of the album.  But given that the album is an opera, it makes sense that the album needs listened to as an album.  I only listen to \\"Tommy\\" as an album, except for the stray tracks on collections.<br /><br />\\"Tommy\\" is another of the numerous works of rock that were very experimental at the time it was released.  \\"Tommy\\" succeeded in being very good rock, and broke more new ground for rock music.  It has aged well, and continues to be one of my favorites.  It is the Who.  How could you go wrong with the Who?sexuality, and sexual abuse.

B000007ODX|5.0|My favorite recordings of the nocturnes are those by Barenboim and by Moravec. I prefer the Moravec recordings, yet relish these by Barenboim. Each reveals more about this music, the Barenboim more strongly lyrical, the Moravec more deeply moving, as if he's actually inside the music. I strongly recommend both. Top notch recording quality.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Born This Way is amazing but I think that the Fame Monster was better.... Everyone has different opinions so you have to check it out for yourself! It is a great lesson its one of the best albums this year.
B000002J6H|5.0|Stephen Stills, as most everyone reading these reviews knows, is one-third of CS&N, and one-fourth of CSN&Y.  He is also clearly the Mozart of the group, writing many of the most memorable songs and playing and recording most of the instrumental parts, and with such mastery, that this cohorts nicknamed him \\"Captain Manyhands.\\"  In short, in terms of pure musicianship he is, contrary to the Amazon reviewer's statement, easily THE most accomplished member of the bunch.  Anyway, on to the review:     I called this the \\"Solo\\" album in the \\"Classic\\" sense of the word because it seems to be the work of a BAND musician (at heart) stepping away from his main group to make something much more personal.   He's.. say, given his \\"regular\\" band most of his top-tier stuff, but he's got some songs in the vault that are still close to his heart, and he wants to record them.  And this wonderful album is the result.  If the songs don't quite reach the same heights as \\"Carry On\\", Suite Judy Blue Eyes\\", they are, nevertheless, beautiful to the ears, and full of great musical and lyrical touches.  Stills can jam (even with himself) and it makes a gorgeous noise, the guitars, bass, and organ tearing it up on every cut.       The first track, \\"Love the One You're With\\" is a giddy ode to adultery.  It's bark is perhaps bigger than its bite, and with all its heavy instrumentation and over-the-top choral cheerleading, remains a rather lightweight little anthem.  Great for singalongs though, and has a very infectious chorus that has kept it around even after all these years.      \\"Do for the Others\\" is much more interesting tune, and the melody winds its way around the chord changes in all sorts of amazing ways.  This is the kind of cut that sounds very.. Stills.       \\"Church\\" gives him a chance to experiment some more with his \\"cast of 1000's\\" approach.  This is one the Ray Charles could have done a great cover of.  After many hearings, I find this recording of it to be, for me, a bit too heavy on the \\"epic\\" side.   If the song was a little more interesting, compositionally, perhaps the mega-production might have been a better fit.   I'd love to hear a remix one day with 1/3rd as many people on it.       The two following cuts again illustrate the brilliance of Stills when he's got similarly gifted collaborators to work off and push against.  Again, the songs taken by themselves, are very, very good, if not necessarily hallowed classics.  Still the way they're brought off by Stills and his guests Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix elevate them to what can only be described as absolutely jaw-dropping killer tracks.  Stills knew exactly how to work these guys into his musical vision, while giving them a fresh backdrop for their own great talents.   Everyone here just shines, and makes these among the strongest cuts on the album.      \\"Sit Yourself Down\\" is another rousing sing-along, but perhaps less interesting than \\"Love the One..\\" or \\"Church\\".  Not bad for a side 2 opener (for those who still play their old vinyl copies).  Still very fun, and a good one to crank up when you're alone in the house, doing chores, and want to feel like you've got company just in the next room.      \\"To a Flame\\"~This one is another bit of pure introspective Stills, and with its great moody atmospherics and beautifully strange chord movement.  Never tire of hearing it.      \\"Black Queen\\"~Stills has recorded this one more than once, but I believe he saved his best take for this album.  The song, simply a rather loose collection of word-plays and vocal/guitar Blues runs, is wielded into the masterpiece it is strictly by its fiery performance, and great sense of drama and atmosphere.  Stills, the solo Blues-man is at his absolute best here.   Ironic that the least-realized actual song on this album, in terms of its ability to stand alone and apart from its performance, is also its strongest cut.  This is definitely the one track I'd play for anyone who hasn't heard it, and wants to know if Stills was ever really \\"All That\\" back in the day...    \\"Cherokee\\" is a song that introduces some Jazzier touches, including flute and sax solo breaks played by Sidney George.  The rhythm section includes Booker T. Jones on keys.  \\"We Are Not Helpless\\" is Stills' response to Neil Young's song \\"Helpless.\\"  These two songs are, well, very much of their time; you can almost smell the incense and feel the vibe of bell-bottomed guitar player/singers around you.     Overall, a very good collection of tunes performed by the musical shaman of CSN (and sometimes Y), with a little help from his awesome friends, and lots of recording tape.         Michael
B003ZSJ212|4.0|There's just no need to complain or act outraged and especially no need to act surprised by these new changes. Lucas has been messing with these films since almost the beginning. The first big one was the 1981 theatrical re-release of A New Hope. (That's the year it was named A New Hope in the credit roll, it was previously just Star Wars). He changes something small or large with every re-release. Don't sweat it. He'll be dead soon. He's getting old and his health can't be that great (have you seen him lately?). Once he's gone, I'm sure a great company like Criterion will get a hold of a pristine set of original prints from a private collector and do them justice. Just wait a few years. In the mean time, watch these, or don't. I love Star Wars too. I'm sure we all do or people wouldn't be acting so butt hurt about a bunch of stuff that really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Really, think about it. It doesn't matter. Its a movie. They were fantastic and now they're just okay. That's the way it is. Deal with it.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie and this was the first action movie I have downloaded instead of renting the blu-ray and I was pretty impressed. I knew the picture would be good because I have rented plenty of non action movies by digital download, but I was very impressed with the sound as well. I really didn't miss the difference between this and blu-ray. The movie itself was great as well. You have to realize there will be some cheese due to it being about thor, but if you are looking for a good action movie with good special effects, and a decent story this one is a good choice.
B0055S348W|5.0|Just downloaded and tested it via wireless and worked like a charm.  Easy set up, clear option choices and fast.  Although I may have missed a font selection as it was way to big....?  As for big A,  I was beginning to worry about your FAOD selections until now,  thanks!  EVO 3D,  Gingerbread
B003ZSJ212|1.0|They didn't include the theatrical version of the film, it's just another in a long line of re-edits, even if you don't care about the theatrical version of the films you could wait a year for the even more special edition in 3D. So what is the point of this set? It's just a couple of truly worthless plastic discs.
B0055S348W|5.0|Works great on my lg optimus v. Tried printing both docs and pics and I get great results. I especially like the optons and setrings, also gives you a preview of whatever you will be printin so you can adjust paper, size,etc. Its a bit expensive in my opinion but then again I think its worth it.
B004SUSZB4|5.0|Great condition! Thank u so much for the prompt service! MY daughter loves the book! THAnk you again and again!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|It blew my mind when I realized that I could see all the info I cared for in the &quot;clock&quot; ui.  And I keep finding more cool hidden features everyday.  You'll never go back top any other weather app after trying this one

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This is one of the best cds I have listened to in a long time.  Not as much rappy hip hop and just downright good tunes.  Every song is great!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|One of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different outcome than before.  DON'T buy this crap in the hope that Lucas will finally get some sense and put out the product people want.  So long as people keep shelling out money for new versions of Star Wars minus the original cuts, just so we can get the few new extras he cynically adds each time, he will continue to pull this moneygrabbing crap and withhold what everyone really wants.  Lucas: \\"Come back to me baby.  I won't hurt you again!\\" Right answer: \\"No\\".  Wrong answer: \\"OK, baby.  I'm sure you'll be different this time because you WANT to change.\\"
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I usually don't care much for sequels, especially ones with such huge time lapses inbetween them...but this movie was so well written and fantastically acted it was worth the wait for this sequel! again Flanery and Reedus are on top of their games in their signature roles. Billy Connolly is unstoppable. The addition of Clifton Colins Jr. In the character of Romeo was just what the film needed to make it that much better. If you haven't seen this movie, you need to! It'll be worth it!
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Loved it!!!!! Connection problems and all. I agree, the directors/producers/writers did an excellent job tying all of the XMen saga together. Bravo!
B0055S348W|1.0|The free version won't print anything except a test page.  $13 for the version that will print, maybe.  misleading and a waste.
B00470HPJI|5.0|I love this album. Agnes Obel has a beautiful voice and her music should cater to all types of music lovers. There's not a bad song on the album. You will find your self listening to this for relaxation at night and for plain enjoyment during the day. I can't wait to hear more from this artist!
B000053VAZ|5.0|Before I was ordering from Amazon I only seen bits and pieces of this movie. The only way I remembered it was the part Sam (Johnny Depp) was messing around in the dinner. I am a fan of Johnny so I looked for this movie the best way I could, not knowing what the name of the movie was. After getting an account on Amazon it was suggested to me. It had Johnny in it so I bought it. Not knowing it was the movie I've been looking for. After watching the whole movie from beginning to end I really enjoyed it. My fav. parts are when Johnny is doing his bread dance in the dinner. Then serving two customers different foods in a circle. That scene made me fall in love with Johnny. I also like when Johnny, Joon (Mary Masterson), and Benny (Aidan Quinn) are at the park and Johnny does a hat trick for everyone at the park to watch. The music video is great too. I watched it about 7 times in a row. This is a love story/comedy. If your into both, u'll enjoy this movie.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|I am not a history buff, but with the cast and subject I was curious enough to get the movie.  I was really surprised at how captivating the story was dealing with honor and courage not on the field but in the court room.  The acting was great and although I suppose it shouldnt have been, a surprise ending.  A keeper and one I will share with friends.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I like this movie. Specially the part when the family and their guest are sitting down at the dinner table and the ghost, Adam (Alec Baldwin) and Barbara (Geena Davis), make Della (Catherine O'Hara), start sing a song. Then Adam and Barbara make everyone join in with a dance. Very funny stuff. I also like Beetlejuice, Michael Keaton. I think they picked the right person to play Beetlejuice.
0062068423|4.0|This is my second book by Jo Nesbo. In The Readbreast, he had the skills to conceive a story blending the high beating pulse of an international thriller mixed with the intrigue of the hard boiled. Fast paced, suspenseful, entertaining  and with an arrray of similar characters and ingenious twists and turns, The Readbreast will not disappoint readers, who will have to make an intellectual effort so as not to get lost in the story who looks confusing with purpose, it leaves some unsolved issues for a sequel. After having finished it, I now feel compelled to go and read all the following Nesbo published books. He shows he is a cultivated, smart and sly author.
1400052181|5.0|This was a wonderful book.  Even though it was chock full of scientific information it read like a novel.  It was very informative.  It provided insights into the study of genetics, and how those studies provided the springboard for many of the medical miracles we have today.  The author did a fantastic of gathering and organizing her material, and presenting it to those of us who aren't scientists.  Her sensitivity to the people she interviewed for the book, especially the family members of Henrietta Lacks, was remarkable.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Sadly the majority of the reviews here are whining fanboys who yearn for things that few modern viewers are interested in. It is true this set features alterations from their original releases. I for one hope the theatrical versions eventually come out so that the internet won't be clogged with irate fans who often equate the Star Wars films enhancements with a physical or sexual assault. But then how would they fill their pathetic lives? I have seen all six at the theaters when they were originally released as well as their rereleases. I have owned every VHS, laserdisc and DVD copy and can honestly say the films look spectacular on blu. I am not crazy about the Han shooting at the same time as Greedo instead of first in the Catina scene but I'm not losing sleep over it. Most of the changes are positive from the original films. Special effects have been enhanced, the antiquated yoda puppet in episode one is now cgi, cities are filled with more activity and character, the sound mix for the older films has been updated and so on. I would like to see a theatrical version release one day, but honestly on repeat viewings I'm going to reach for the new special effects, additional footage and superior sound mixes over the historically important but technologically dated originals more times than not. The theatrical versions exsist on DVD so if you don't like the new ones you can pass on this new set but you will be missing some great special features, a plethora of rare deleted scenes, informative audio commentaries and some cool Easter eggs including the kickass Boba Fett animated short featured in the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special! These films are the way Lucas inteded and intends them to be seen and who are we to say he is wrong? My advice for the truly outraged is to perhaps become a genius, create some of the most iconic characters in modern film history and then do with the property what you see fit (or you could just chill out). To everyone else I encourage youto pick up this set and enjoy these fantastic films and explore the hours of entertaining  special features.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very relaxing and interesting puzzle game. Easy for some and challenging for others. I was playing with a nine years old kid and he just finish every level really fast. Wish that there is more levels.
0545265355|5.0|These books are definately in the couldn't put them down category.  The charcaters are well developed and interesting people  The stories are intriguing stories and full of action.  I don't recommend them to kids under 12 years of age though due to some of content.  It may be too much for some kids to handle.  Enjoy!
B0058S0OMS|4.0|OK, there are currently over 400 reviews telling you how good or bad \\"Halloween II\\" is.  Chances are, if you're reading this, you already have your own opinion of the film itself and want to know about the Blu-ray.  The transfer is quite good, although not perfect.  Unlike the 1978 original film, this one takes place all in one night.  And some of the scenes are pretty dark.  Still, it's probably the best the film will ever look on the home screen, so I'm reasonably satisfied with the picture quality.  Unfortunately, the sound suffers a malady common to too many discs: You have to really jack it up to hear people talk at times, only to have your walls shaken by a sudden sting of music during a scary moment.<br /><br />The real treat that no one seem to be talking about, however, is the bonus feature film included.  \\"Terror in the Aisles\\" was a theatrical release way back in 1983.  The Universal-produced feature is a compilation of scary moments from films from the 50's through the early 80's.  Co-hosts and frequent genre stars Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen not only narrate, but sit in a crowded theater watching the film clips.  The theater scenes are generally a bit cheesy, but not really out of line with the often irreverent tone of the film.  I remember watching this one in the theater back in the day, and I'm delighted to finally have a copy.  As far as I know, it was previously only available on a long out-of-print VHS tape.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the movie, this is certainly a must-have (especially at the current low price).  But even folks who are just fans of horror cinema in general should pick it up for Terror in the Aisles.  Aside from the aforementioned technical deficits, it's a welcome addition to my Blu-ray collection.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I gave this box set a 4 star because it deserves it. Since it looks like I am the first person on here to have actually bought the box set and watched it, I think it's fair to say that the rest of you are a little strange. First off, no one that has written a review before this had actually seen the media. Say what you will about the stuff you all saw on the Internet, none of it compares to the actual blu ray discs. The physical discs offer the cleanest, most crisp picture you can get. This cannot be accomplished through the videos seen online because they all fist have to be compressed in order to transfer their massive amounts of data. This makes all the Internet products look inferior to the physical media itself.   Next, we know that Georgie has changed parts of the films. Does that change the cannon of the story arch?  No, period.  Although the story is not enhanced by the changes, the changes within themselves do not take away from the story either: anyone who says that they do is out and out wrong. In addition, it is these same people who have posted reviews on Amazon without even seeing the final product. Not only are you people wrong about how the changes affect the films, you haven't even seen these versions yet.    So if you are wondering if you should buy this version of star wars, I suggest that you do if you don't already own the whole saga. I do own them and can tell you that the quality is high because I have seen them on blu ray, unlike these prejudice, pompous, ridiculous people who are more concerned with whining about small changes then passing on the story to another generation.
B00004YKUY|5.0|Steve Augeri,lead singer after Steve Perry left,was far and above the best vocalist Journey had. Not only did he master the Perry ballads but Arrival proved he could carry on the tradition of this great band sans Perry. I was very disappointed when he left for throat issues but recently saw him and he is as good as ever and wish him the best.Who knows if Arnel Pineda burns out maybe Augeri will be reunited with Journey. Journey's aggressive tour schedule is not conducive to giving a lead vocalist pipes the needed rest.    Seger
B0055S348W|5.0|I'm not sure if I would pay $12.95 for it, but it works very well and has come in handy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This is a perfect example of why Amazon reviews are worthless! 90 percent of the reviewers are writing reviews about something they haven't seen! I'm watching the original trilogy on Blu right now and the picture quality is outstanding. The bonus discs are full of fascinating documentaries and deleted scenes, which every star wars fan has been dying to see for over thirty years.  If your on the fence about buying the complete set; just do it. You won't regret it.
B003MC5N28|4.0|Really love the book. But it's very short and stops suddenly. Then book 2 doesn't pick up where it left off so your left \\"wondering\\".
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard gives us an intimate look into how she was able to live with a monster for so many years, while giving birth to his children and raising them  with hope and dignity and somehow coming out on the \\"other side\\" with sunshine in her beautiful smile and eyes.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" is rock-n-roll at its purest.  I was always rather cool to the Stones.  They weren't the standard-setting pop group, like the Beatles, and had that notorious rep.  I mean, wondering from where your reputation as a devil-worshipping, drug-user came, I heard Keith admit in an interview.  Serious?  Who knows; but after viewing \\"Stones in Exile,\\" an hour-long documentary, last May (2011), my interest in this double-album was re-ignited.  I say `re-ignited' because I actually had the album earlier, checked out from the local library, but didn't bother to listen to all of it, and then deleted the ripped tracks later.  So, I bought it; then listened to it, over, and over...  \\"Loving Cup\\" is currently the reigning top track (out of thousands) on my iTunes Top 25.  Pure, I mean, from the documentary, Keith, Mick and the other Stones pouring all they had into it, as well as top session musicians Bobby Keys, Jim Price, and Nicky Hopkins, with long-time Stones pianist, Ian Stewart.  Hearing this work definitely created a before and after effect in my musical world - Pure, as in Good, Eternally so...
B003ZSJ212|4.0|People continue to complain about the changes Lucas has made to the movies without actually looking at the benefits of this set. As far as the changes go, save for the new dialogue for Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi, most of them are cosmetic at best and bear very little on the narratives presented in the films. Since most of the changes from the '97 special editions have stuck, the changes to the films since then have been marginal at best.<br /><br />The facts at hand are that this is Star Wars in high definition. There are a lot of new features to peruse on the complete set, and this is the best that the original films have ever looked. New deleted scenes, documentaries, and an attractive addition to your shelf should be what determines your decision to buy this set or pass. If you haven't yet made the jump to HD, you probably don't need to worry about it too much unless you're a big hound for new material related to the films. If you have a Blu-ray player and are sick of watching the films upscaled from your old DVD's, this is a set worth owning.<br /><br />I just hope that you base your decision not on stereotypical fanboy bitterness that treat these films as if they're the bastardized word of God, but treat them as films you enjoyed. That should be the determining factor in any film purchase.<br /><br />At least, that's what I think.
1594744769|5.0|A great book! It was a story that kept you wanting to turn the next page.I love the book from begining to end!
0307595862|4.0|Jo Nesbo has certainly written a creery narrative with an sadly flawed hero/detective. The plot is quite complicated and character development is often lacking. Over all The Snowman is a fascinating book with never a wasted word. A must read for mystery fans. (ending is -no, won't be a spoiler) Mary Frances, Texas
B004EPYZZI|5.0|I could not wait to watch this movie after it arrived. What a wonderful story, one for the entire family.  I've had several friends over to watch the movie with me and the special extras with lots of information about the real event and how the movie was made. Everyone was very impressed with the movie in all aspects. The photography is incredible, not to be missed. I encourage anyone to watch this movie.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have wanted an app like this for a long time. I was worried it would not work on a business network that required a domain name. I'm impressed! Setup was simple, quick and uneventful. Printed first time and every time.
B0055SJVPW|5.0|This is a great movie for those of you who LOVE Emily Giffin's other books.  I've read the book multiple times and felt that the movie version followed the storyline well and the actors captured the essences of each character.  I great movie to add to you collection if you're a Rom-Com lover like myself.  Now if we can get Something Blue made into a movie as well than that would be an ideal double-movie pack.    The only missing is a commentary.  I always like hearing the actors, directors, etc. giving little tidbits of information and helps me feel more connected to the movie.  WIthout it, it's still fantastic!  I <3 Rachel & Dex!
1439138311|1.0|While the major character is appealing, the writing is so poor that one is struck by the author's inability to describe anything in detail.  The only references to the time period are the use of the subway and telephones, and the Brooklyn Dodgers.  But this could place the story within a much larger time frame than the 1950's and, perhaps, even a wider geographical frame.  There were few descriptions which placed the story in Ireland aside from names of places.  Dialogue was continually presented as she \\"said,\\" he \\"said,\\" They \\"said,\\" without any variety or expression about the speaker.  Had the sexual scene been eliminated, this could have been a book written for a ten year old.  I am assuming that a six disk audio book was not edited.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, though a little unbelievable at times, it was still fun. It's worth a watch. The ending was satisfying.

B0055S348W|5.0|this thing really works, and works very very well. printed a test page of Google.com over wifi to my network laser printer. Quality was superb must say this app is freaking awesome.   Only complaint I have is that you have to pay $9.95 a month for more than 20 pages. That's a bit ridiculous considering you are already spending $13.00 on the app itself, so why does it have this silly limitation?
0553807919|5.0|Our daughter has two VERY active little boys, one age 2, the other age 6.  The two year old has been particularly challenging (deep in the pit of the \\"terrible twos\\" right now).  She has a bachelors degree in Marriage, Family, and Human Development, and has already done a great job bringing her 9 year old daughter along so far.  Still, her 2 year old is especially challenging, and her 6 year old is experiencing some specific challenges of his own.  This book came along within a day of her asking for help, in sheer frustration with the two year old.    With an advanced degree and years of licensed experience in marriage, family, and individual counseling, I began to give her some suggestions.  But I also ordered this book for her to read.  Her report - far better than mine, since she's the one really using it the most - is that it is excellent.  She also said the pictures are helpful in illustrating some points.  But most of all, she's applied several of the principles in the book, and had very visible success.  Nothing's 100%, so it certainly should not be purchased as a \\"cure-all\\" book, but this book goes well beyond typical \\"how to do it on your own\\" child management books.    With that kind of success, I think it deserves something we rarely give on our reviews - five stars.  We reserve those for the best of the best, and even an otherwise excellent book or product often gets a 4-star rating from us if it doesn't stand out from most of the rest of the higher-tier books or products.  This one does - it delivers results.  One cannot approach this like a cook book, expecting to find a list of problems with specific solutions that can be referred to in a given situation for the \\"need of the moment.\\"  Instead, the book should be studied and understood (not terrible deep reading - just requires some concentration and openness).  Very nice job indeed!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book is incredible. It's one of the few mystery/ thriller books that is not only captivating, but also very realistic. I also like how all the tech details in the series, down to the models of iBooks and Powerbooks and the ADSL modems are realistic and time period correct.
B001P9EQH8|1.0|The FiiO E5 is a worthless piece of plastic.  If you want a decent headphone amp your gonna have to at least get the E7.  This amp doesn't improve your music it only distorts it.  Not only that but it only has a limited number of charges before the battery completly dies.
B002X7FELS|3.0|I had been told great things about this novel, so even though the premise (a guy pretending to choke to get his saviours to give him money out of pity) seemed funky (in the bad sense), I gave it a shot. As a Palahniuk novel, is it bad? No. Having read a number of his books, I expected pretty much everything and was not disappointed in this regard. And by \\"expecting\\", I don't mean I knew what the book was going to be, but in a general sense, I was not surprised.     - narrative in present tense, first person, check  - lots of trivia about specialised knowledge, in this case medical knowledge, diseases, etc, check  - important character that turns out to be something else, check  - starting declarative sentences with  \\"what, where, etc\\", as in \\"What you have to do when you're here, etc.\\" \\"Where you're supposed to be is, etc,\\" (as in Invisible Monsters)    There are others, but I found these in every single novel by Palahniuk I've read. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but this may explain why I didn't like Choke as much as I liked the others.    There's always a touch of above the top in Palahniuk's novels, which I usually don't mind and take it as a satiric rather than a \\"realistic\\" approach, although that's always done in measured ways, but with this novel, the typical character-twist, I couldn't buy. There's over the top and there's plain impossible. I won't go into details to avoid spoilers, but that one was far-fetched.    While not a bad novel, I liked it far, far less than Survivor. Survivor I read in three days because I couldn't get enough of it; with Choke, it took weeks, and I went back to it with less enthusiasm. Admittedly, this is not a bad novel at all. Denny is an endearing character; Colonial Dunsboro is pretty cool a location and context, and there are some very relevant quotes with regards to our time. Let me see if I can find one...    I can't find the one I was thinking of, so I'll paraphrase; it's about how the Oedipian Complex (boy kills father,has sex with mother) is turned around to become \\"mother kills father and kidnaps son\\" or something. The actual quote is much better. Here's another related to that, and no, the bulk of the novel isn't masculinism, relax (or be sad, depending):    \\"I mean, I'm just tired of being wrong all the time just because I'm a guy.    \\"I mean, how many times can everybody tell you that you're the oppressive, prejudiced enemy before you give up and become the enemy. I mean, a male chauvinist pig isn't born, he's made [this a reference to de Beauvoir's famous words], and more and more of them are being made by women.    \\"After long enough, you just roll over and accept the fact that you're a sexist, bigoted, insensitive, crude, cretinist cretin. Women are right. You're wrong. You get used to the idea. You live down to expectations.\\" P.118    Living down to expectations, that's good stuff. Even though I only gave the book three stars, it's still worthy. If you've never read any other Palahniuk novel, you may enjoy this one more than I did. Or maybe you will enjoy it better than I did even if you have read other novels by the same author. Who knows.    Finally, I think my main negative impression was that the novel isn't focused enough, perhaps. There's a bit of all the following things in there, without any of them being thoroughly used, I felt:    - sex addictions (I expected more weird obsessions and urban legends and such)  - crazy mothers / sons and mothers  - men and women in modern times, and their relationship  - Christ (made me wish that anatomical skinned human had been raising his arms to look like Christ, would have been a terrific cover)    And others I forget. Would I have preferred to have only one of these themes used at the exclusion of the others? No. I'm not suggesting I could have written a better version of that novel, I'm only trying to precise my reaction to it. I have a hard time knowing exactly why I didn't like as much as others by the same author. My best guess remains that it's so similar to his other novels that I've been somewhat blunted by now. Maybe I shouldn't read Palanhiuk novels in rows.    Still a commendable book for the average Palahniuk reader.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|All the changes are unnecessary, sloppy and wrong. Hey Mr. Lucas, how about making something new and original and quit ripping off your fans. Quit tampering with the original 3 movies( the second trilogy is crap so please feel free to do what ever you want, till you're blue in the face). Ill take the original 3 movies on vhs with mono sound rather than watch this crap. I will not be buying anything star wars related. People just you wait, the original theatrical release on blu ray, the 1997 versions on blu ray, the 2004 release on blue ray, all of them will just put more money in George Lucas's pocket. All he will do is release something else star wars related in a few years. NO THANKS!!!!!!

B003L77GG0|5.0|Ok, this review is for the AMAZON PRICE, not the actual show... Currently the DVD set is 53.99 and the Blu-ray is 44.99.  I realize both prices are subject to change and the pre-order guarantee and such, but...  Blu-ray cheaper than DVD? That's just crazy.<br /><br />*Minor changes made to review to reflect that price can change, and to not unfairly impact the show's rating based on this review.  I love the show, I just could not justify purchasing the season from Amazon when the prices were as they were when it was released.*
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These films are clearly unfinished!!!! Lucas can't expect me to pay good money for this slipshod rushed out set of films.  How he hasn't taken the time to fix every detail that must clearly be bothering him about these half films is beyond me.  GET TO WORK YOU BULLFROG LOOKING BUM!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Star Wars looks absolutely fantastic in high definition. The extras are great too. Yes, the prequel deleted scenes are a bit of a let down but the classic trilogy's are excellent. Don't be fooled by these negative reviews, this is a wonderful set.
030746363X|5.0|This book is absolutley changing my life! It's easy to do, and results are fast. I will buy more and send as gifts to family and friends.
B0059ILFJ8|5.0|excellent reissue of an excellent album. practically no surface noise, quality 180 gram vinyl, and some classic tunes. worth every penny.
B005KH928E|2.0|This record feels tossed off...\\"Why don't we stick it out there.  Marsalis and Clapton?  Lots of people will buy that.\\"    The improvisations are routine.  Really...not much going on.
B000KIRT6A|5.0|I own a Behringer Digital Delay/DD400 and I own a set of 3 Dynamic Microphones XM1800S also from Behringer. Now I own the Behringer EQ700 Ultimate 7 - Band Graphic Equalizer and I am equally happy with all of these products. The price of these products is so low that one might think they aren't good stuff. Behringer packs quite a surprise. All of the Behringer products I've used and purchased are as good or better than others of higher price. Amazon is very fortunate to have Behringer on board. Behringer is very fortunate to have Amazon on their side. This purchase was a 100% win, win, win...
B002QQ8HAG|4.0|The September Issue didn't turn out to be as incendiary nor as icy a portrayal of Anna Wintour as I thought it would be.  In spite of her image, Anna Wintour is no ogre, and holds court as a slightly human; slightly alien; always aloof character doing the job that she does.  If you want extreme, go watch Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada.  Anna hates black and brings her own personal peeves into the world of fashion.  Apart from that, she doesn't seem to exhale in spite of extremely large nostrils (filmmakers take note) and has that ET go home body language about her.<br /><br />Nonetheless, she is feared and the documentary cameras have just captured I believe just the tip of the iceberg.<br /><br />One comes away with a nice look at the making of Vogue - a tremendous amount of work months in the making; condensed into one documentary.  Nice unadorned, straightforward - no send ups or dramas ala what we've been accustomed to on reality tv.  Just documentary.<br /><br />Grace Coddington is really the unsung heroine of the story and (ala Amazon's description) \\"Frenemy\\" of Anna Wintour.  Anna is the scythe; the tree cutter; the silent bulldozer - while Grace is the one trying to plant a tree; or make the flowers bloom.  It was really nice to see her amazing work and appreciate her for the uber stylist she is - loving her work and living up to her name.  She is half the sky in this film - ie. she really does hold it up.  Grace - blue skies; Anna = portentous clouds looming across the screen.  The once flamboyant Andre Leon Talley seems largely neutered, like a mascot in the show; a figment of another era.<br /><br />All in all, the September Issue is a pleasant viewing experience - strangely enough.  And far more real and spot-on than Project Runway or Top Model with its fashion wanna-bes.  This is the real deal.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  All the songs that you know and love by Toby, with a few exceptions.  The song Mockingbird with his daughter is okay, but I would not call it one of his greatest hits.
1572814349|5.0|This deck is exceptional.  Destined to become my go to deck for readings. Comparing this deck side by side with a Rider-Waite deck the imagery is pretty much spot on.  For some people that isn't a big deal, but for people who read alot with with afore mentioned Rider-Wait, the transition into this deck is seamless.<br /><br />I actually really have to tip my hat to the creator of this deck.  Taking a traditional deck design and creating a thing of beauty like this is a tough job.  So many decks these days the symbolism just becomes a jumble, which in turn makes it difficult to change decks because the meanings of the cards change from deck to deck.  That isn't the case here.<br /><br />There are only 2 cons I have found at this point:<br />1.The gilded edges sometimes stick together, so you have to pay close attention when shuffling/dealing.  With a little bit of time spent with the deck, this does go away.<br />2.As the sole bad review pointed out the deck is definitely larger than average.  As an amateur graphic designer I understand that if they were printed on smaller stock, a good deal of detail would be lost.<br /><br />Overall even past the 2 down sides, I still have to rate this a solid 5 stars.
B0055S348W|5.0|This app works great, I don't know why so many people complaint right away without trying it a little more or giving it a chance. I have a Brother printer and the drivers were not available for my model either.  I saw that someone said something about Google Cloud printing and since I wasn't familiar with it, looked it up and installed Google chrome with that option, set up was easy and it worked perfectly, I also loved the fact that I can print from anywhere and don't have to be on the same wireless connection fit it to work, it prints thru my computer connected to the internet. Very awesome.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent product. I watched a marathon Episode 4, 5 & 6 last night along with the spoof reel (good stuff). I wasn't really offended by any of the new tweaks added to the series - I actually enjoy some of the changes (like the yet again reworked Greedo scene - this scene moreso than any other seems like an ongoing dialog between fans and Lucas - he doesn't want to give it up, but always tried to compromise and improve it).    You can join the haters and those calling for boycotts (I imagine most of them are secretly purchasing it anyway)or you can enjoy yourself. Enjoying a tweaked Star Wars is like any guilty pleasure - you savor every moment and then complain to your friends that you hated it.    Buy it, you'll like it.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My nephew saw the commercial once and immediately knew he wanted to see it. It was in great condition, perfect quality. This movie is great for the whole family! Sooner or later you'll find yourself singing one of the many catchy songs featured in the film.

B003L77GRY|5.0|Dexter is not only one of the most amazing TV shows I've viewed in my lifetime, but it keeps me wanting to watch more and more episodes. Michael C Hall is a wonderful actor and absolutely makes me coming back to this series. He's the reason I'm subscribing to Showtime.

B0058H8V6K|5.0|When i heard alot of buzz around this lady named \\"Natalia Kills\\" and her album \\"Perfectionist\\", i wasnt sure what to expect...would she just be another sex / glam doll wannabe tryin to make a career?    But no, my hypothesis was wrong. Natalia Kills is an amzing ARTIST at the purest of the word. All her tracks are haunted, twisted, and paint a picture with beautifully polished beats.     These days expressive artists like Natalia are hard to find, but shes got a TON of talent. Creative songwriting, mixing and dark productions lace together for a greatly balnced album. As you can tell by now, this album is by no means mainstream. Production-wise, yes, but you defineteley wont find a smash hit single off of this record. A.K.A., you have to really appreciate music at its finest to enjoy this.    (Grade: A++++)
0670022411|5.0|I haven't been this excited about a novel since the first time I read The Master and Margarita... I couldn't put it down; by page 3 I was hopelessly hooked. A book about witches etc. at first sounded to me like just another author riding the Harry Potter wave, but this book is 100% for adults, and the love story is one of the most real I've encountered in a novel despite the fantasy elements involved when your protagonists are a witch and a vampire.  It was such a pleasure to read the main characters' very realistic dialogue juxtaposed against the magical elements in the story.  I think I'm in love. Can't wait for the author's next book!
B0001WGDX0|5.0|Having been fed on a musical diet of Toscanini and Kempler, I sometimes find Bernstein a bit laid back. Taking nothing away from his great conducting style, sometimes, particularly when conducting Beethoven, I wish he would condense his pauses and speed up the more dramatic phrases.<br /><br />Well, this collection, perhaps the most ambitious work Bernstein has completed, certainly with the Vienna Philharmonic, will find no such complaint from me. I thoroughly love each and every one of the entire Beethoven Symphony collection. Outstanding vitality in fiercer passages, and the melancholy ones are dealt with gently. You will also note that the sound is \\"pure\\", i.e. each passage almost stands out on its own, and embellishes the melody. Beethoven's peculiar juxtapositions--his style of introducing a phrase and clinching it with surprising speed---are handled superbly by Berstein.<br /><br />A great collection for all times.
0451196716|1.0|Normally, I love King's books.  But The Long Walk is not one of them.  When I was about 30, I realized that I did NOT have to finish every book I started.  It is the author's job to keep me interested enough to keep on reading.  Sadly, Mr. King did not keep me interested enough in this book to keep on reading.
B004LGPBZI|3.0|1.  Four Letter Word - The opener follows the oasis formula for a catchy tune to kick off the album. FLW is Beady Eye`s version of D'You Know What I Mean?, Lyla or The Hindu Times. The song isn't a complete miss but its exactly the type of song where Noel Gallagher would provide the icing on the cake.  In the immortal words of the Chief himself, \\"Icing is what I do very well.\\"<br /><br />2.  Millionaire - The song opens with Country-inflected guitars more akin to a Dwight Yoakam record than anything English, but there you have it. I seem to recall Liam slagging off the b-sides from Whatever for what he referred to as Noel making `F***ing Country songs.' Millionaire plods along in no rush to keep up with the track before and not terribly if wholly unremarkable.<br /><br />3.  The Roller - Here we have an oasis cast-off, but they shouldn't of.  The Roller would've made a better b-side than the likes of Eye Ball Tickler or Thank You For The Good Times. The piano sounds great and while I hear the Instant Karma comparisons, the song evokes the feeling of something familiar instead of the outrage of something stolen.<br /><br />4.  Beatles And Stones - Beady Eye seem to answer the critics before the question can be asked, why do you want to sound like the Beatles or the Stones?  Because they make classic music. The ode to bands that came before is natural and as long as you emulate great bands and tunes, I've no complaint. The song is more of a declaration of intent than a classic itself, however.<br /><br />5.  Wind Up Dream - Here we have A Storm In Heaven Verve-esque production and lyrics with Liam-esque melody. Again the Country guitar shows up which is the most surprising influence on the record but nothing groundbreaking.<br /><br />6.  Bring The Light - The first single and debut for the band. Bring The Light consisted of several great ideas mashed together into a terrible amalgamation that is sonically abrasive. The b-side was a cover of a dreadful song (Sons of the Stage) that they did little to improve upon. The b-side will be released as an iTunes bonus so you can skip over it whenever it appears on shuffle.<br /><br />7.  For Anyone - For Anyone is the upbeat acoustic ditty we've come to expect from Liam Gallagher since the success of Songbird. His simple lyrics while a sticking point on Little James became endearing and nearly inimitable on tracks like Meaning Of Soul or I Believe In All. Here he falls a bit short from the standard he set himself but it won't keep it from being covered by guitar-wielding beach-dwellers hoping to sleep with doe-eyed bikini-clad idyllists. Cheers to them.<br /><br />8.  Kill For A Dream - Here we seem to clearly have a Hurricane #1 track.  For those of you too young to remember a band with almost no hits, they were another act signed to the now defunct but legendary Creation Records. If I recall correctly, there was the inkling of a rivalry between singer Alex Lowe from the Andy Bell-led band and Liam Gallagher. Now we can definitively say, Liam would've sung those songs just as well if not better. Sorry, Mister Lowe. And yes, this song was penned by Andy Bell.<br /><br />9.  Standing On The Edge Of Noise - SOTEON sounds like the audition tape for a band hoping to ghost-write for Noel Gallagher. The vocal effect is similar to the faraway vocals Noel uses on tracks with the Chemical Brothers (Setting Sun or Let Forever Be). The song feels a bit like the Small Faces` Here Comes The Nice crossed with something Slade.<br /><br />10.  Wigwam - Wigwam is almost a Polyphonic Spree-type trip into psychedelia. Liam's Death In Vegas colloboration, Scorpio Rising, has a remix performed by the robe-wearing hippie choir and maybe Liam liked the feel they gave it. The song sounds slightly out of place though refreshing for an unexpected turn. Maybe Liam plans to front the Spree or lesser known contemporaries The Secret Powers And The Electric Family Choir. The Leader urges me to remind you, cult rock is forever.<br /><br />11.  Three Ring Circus - A Gem-penned rocker without the bite of Hung In A Bad Place or the heart of A Bell Will Ring.  Not a bad tune, just not a good one.<br /><br />12.  The Beat Goes On - Hands down, the best track on the album. Andy Bell has his best songwriting in a tune where Liam sounds brilliant and not a single note is misplaced. If Beady Eye never make another record, The Beat Goes On will still be the tune played as the encore to the \\"gig in the sky\\" and should be considered a requiem to the great, great band that was oasis.<br /><br />13.  The Morning Son - Echoe-y vocals create the ambience for a Liam-penned answer to Acquiesce. Noel steadfastly said Acquiesce was a song about friendship and not brotherhood and Liam will probably say something similar about this song. \\"You're blinded by what you idolise... He's in my mind, he's in my soul, he's even in my rock n' roll... You go your way and I'll go mine.\\" Here's hoping the brothers find a way to bury the past.hout the bite of Hung In A Bad Place or the heart of A Bell Will Ring.

0071762345|5.0|I \\"Like\\" Dave Kerpen's book, Likeable Social Media.  Fascinating book. I know there are some ideas I can apply to my Twitter account and the library's Twitter Account, since I handle their Tweets. I borrowed this book from the library, but I'm buying my own copy. How's that for an endorsement?<br /><br />Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Linkedin, blogs and Foursquare are all covered in Kerpen's books, with suggestions as to how they can be used to benefit companies. Kerpen suggests readers start with the Appendix for a guide as to what these social networks are and how to use them. It's an invaluable tool.<br /><br />The author also highlights the most important points for companies hoping to succeed in social media. He recommends these points - \\"Listen carefully, be transparent, be responsive, be authentic, tell great stories.\\" In my opinion, those are great points, not just for social media, but for life.<br /><br />If you're curious about social networks, Kerpen's book is a good tool to learn about them. Anyone who has a business could certainly benefit from the book. In fact, anyone who has a social media presence could probably benefit from the helpful tips and ideas.<br /><br />So, thumbs up to Dave Kerpen's Likeable Social Media. I \\"Like\\" the book.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Why do people complain so much?? it's just a movie..pure fantasy..get a life. The total changes account for less than 2 seconds of the movies so big deal. Want the original cut? buy the VHS tape!
B0055S348W|5.0|I tried this out today on site at a doctors office and it even worked on an UP based full sized commercial copy/printer!
B0055S348W|5.0|I was not aware I could ever print from my phone, until I saw this great app.  Great for docs pdf pictures and i bet more.  Easy to install, located my wifi Hp4680 very quickly. Ihad to download the free update and it prints super.  Thanks.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is A SUPER movie.  I love it and it is a favorite for movie night with the girls.  The acting and music are superb.  It is the best movie ever.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This CD has an awesome assembly of their hit songs that I still hear on the radio today. Songs like Breaking the Habit, Numb, Lying From You and Somewhere I Belong. Best investment I've made in music. All their tracks flow and are consistent with the entire album. Great Job guys your music totally motivates me and gets my heart jumping. On the way to work or in the gym this album fires me up.
0553573403|5.0|I noticed the flaws in the Kindle edition but do not think it justifies a rant. The books are great with the exception that at some times I think I'm in a fashion show. His descriptions of fashion are complex and tedious at times. Just finished book 5 and I am stunned. I have no words. You know nothing Jon Snow! Book 6 must come soon!
B003ZSJ212|1.0|No good. Save your cash, yes the Blu-Ray looks amazing, but for real, Lucas totally jacked it up. Stick with your DVD copies, or better yet, your VHS tapes to seriously enjoy this cinematic masterpiece.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After reading the reviews prior to the release of this set I was hesitant of buying it. However I have seen the dvd's this set is replacing and did not think the changes were enough to have me wait until some 'unknown' time for theatrical versions to be released. Also I read reviews at blu-ray.com on the picture and sound quality being great. So I bought the set at target with bonus lithographs this morning. After watching the first one and the last I now understand that with the added special effects the old movies now blend better with the newer ones. This is what Lucas had intended. I enjoyed them very much.   The blu-rays are a dramatic improvement over the dvd as it should be. The light sabers are much better than the original theatrical versions IMHO. I actually sense their power now. Everything looks crisp and the sound is amazing.  I am glad I purchased this set and with the added bonus features are just that a great bonus. When and if the original theatrical versions come out(for the original 3) I will buy just those 3 and see them as an 'addition' to the set I have now.   No regrets. Enjoy
B0055S348W|5.0|What a deal!  Not only does it print to wifi printers,  it will print to printers that are wired but addressable through your wireless network.  Printed to an older HP 4050 Laserjet and a newer HP inkjet.  AWESOME!

B0051QO4QY|5.0|Say what you will about Lady Gaga, but I don't remember any artist in recent memory that created a CD in which each song has a different vibe, melody and feeling. Most artists put out a CD of songs that all blend and sound the same, but when you listen to Gaga's new album, each song has its own voice, melody and feel.     I love the darker songs, an amazing change from the fame and the fame monster, and how she incorporates real issues into her tunes. No one else is doing that right now, or has been for a while.     I'll continue to support her as long as she keeps slaying, keeps making amazing music, and keeps fighting for the gay community, and keeps being flawless.
B000021YQV|4.0|I expected to receive the album booklet/art with it, but received it in a generic case without the slightest bit of art. This was not mentioned online though the receipt with the item listed it to not have the art. Just a little disappointed that I'll need to hunt down the booklet and back art is all. however the album itself was in great condition, and read just fine.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|All we want are the original, uncut, unenhanced, movies that we loved as children.  Heck, if you really HAD to tinker with the originals, then find some way to erase the Ewoks from all the Endor scenes.    HAN SHOT FIRST!
0786838655|2.0|I took out this book at my local library because I had heard of it, but it was pretty bad. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it if I were a little younger - the story is not very original but when I was younger I loved stories about becoming an unexpected hero. The language is pretty simple and the story doesn't really develop. I never felt like there was something I was looking forward to, it took me actual energy to keep reading it. I do think this is geared for a younger audience, with the simple language and the weird references to NYC, the empire state building, ect. I feel like if I read it younger though, it wouldn't be so bad but I wouldn't really have been in love with it.<br /><br />I recommend this book for people around age 13 but really no one older than that.
0547258305|5.0|While I was reading this book, this incredible, imaginative book, I kept thinking to myself: how on EARTH did the author manage to think up such an unusual story?  It was a very new, fresh idea with excellent writing and captivating characters.  I highly recommend.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There have bene many haters and people complaining about the star wars blu ray release, many of these people rating a product 1star before ever seeing the actual product themselves, relying instead on what they hear and fan ranting. Yesterday I got my blu ray set and began to explore what it has to offer. The first film I watched was Empire Strikes Back which looks amazing in 1080p. The Colors are crisp, the sound blaring through the 6.1 surround sound and its star wars as one would see it on the big screen, the theater experience brought to your living room.     Also I explored the bonus features which as many people know, focus on deleted scenes. The prequel scenes are mostly unfinished or animatronic scenes but honestly I can say I loved them. None of them are double dips from the DVDs and you can see what was in the mind of the team before the final product. Many are too violent (such as Obi Wan killing Grievious by ripping out his heart and then blasting it) for the actual film but are great to watch. The OT scenes though are what we all want right? And these scenes are just as legendary as one would hope. Growing up a fan of the Radio Dramas, I knew about these scenes and finally seeing them myself, the star wars fan inside me was giddy with excitement, they are worth the money I paid alone. Also you get the boba fett animated short from the Star Wars Holiday Special - the first time anyone saw the famed Bounty Hunter.     I have not watched the entire set but the changes thus far are perfectly fine in fact gorgeous. Most of the changes seem to be in Episode 1 where the Podrace is extended, Yoda is now Digital to match the rest of the PT and several rendering/CGI errors have been fixed. Overall I can say this, thank you for giving me Star Wars in 1080p Lucasfilm. Thank you for giving us the deleted scenes we've heard about for years. And THANK YOU FOR THE SAGA ON BLU RAY WITH ALL SORTS OF NEW STUFF FOR THIS STAR WARS FAN TO ENJOY!
B000VNMMWA|5.0|Hot Fuzz(released Apr/07)stars everyone's fave English sensations Simon Pegg and Nick Frost starring as Constable Nicholas Angel and Constable Butterman,respectively.Pegg and Frost are closerthanthis in real life and they also brought in their friend director/writer Edgar Wright,and when all is said and done they whipped up a winner of a movie.<br />The plot takes place in London,England(I had to say that because I live in that city in Ontario!).Const.Angel is a supercop of sorts,graduating highest in his class from the police academy,earning all sorts of awards in his career and basically showing up every other living and breathing person to put on a cop uniform within the greater London area.One day he is pulled into his superiors offices to be told that he is to be transferred to a sleepy little town miles north of the city,called Sandford.<br />He arrives in town only to almost immediately arrest the entire clientele of a local there,thereby,for all intents and purposes,shutting it down.One of the people he arrests that night happens to be the son of the Police Chief Frank Butterman.The town(and the movie as a whole)is populated with a plethora of off the wall characters and Angel has a tough time of it fitting in.One day he stumbles onto a clue that something is very amiss in Sandford after a local business man gets blown up in his own home,and that the suspected perpetrator might be the owner of a local supermarket.Then the local writer of a newspaper is killed trying to provide Angel with an important clue and Angel soon after witnesses the murder of a shopkeeper,dying horribly by gardening shears.The perp is a hooded figure and when Angel gives chase,as fast as he is,he cannot fathom the  unbelievable speed of the pursued who he loses.<br />Circumstances are now rolling along like an out of control snowball with his colleagues all sneering at his bravado and no one in which to turn to for help.He is jumped upon at his apartment but manages to survive the attack and he eventually uncovers a meeting situated at the old churchyard with all the local business leaders gathered around a table like a witches coven,in hooded garb.He runs but is captured by who he thought was his only friend Constable Butterman,who takes him outside the village to send him packing back to London.As he is about halfway back he is at a rest stop and it is there he decides to stop running and return to clean up the town once and for all.<br />Upon arrival he immediately enters the police station,obtains a load of illegal weapons,straps them on,obtains a horse and rides down the main street to stop near the towns square.Wearing shades and ready for action he is in short order shot at by all of the business people involved in the twisted plot in Sandford.Constable Butterman didn't believe Angel before but he quickly realizes there has to be something to it as he rises to the occasion to help his friend.They take down most of the opposition but the Police Chief and the local supermarket owner escape by car.The Police Chief runs into a tree while Angel and the supermarket owner duke it out in a miniature village.It all ends as the owner gets impaled on a miniature church's steeple.<br />The movie comes to an end as all the towns business men and women involved are arrested and booked and Angel and Butterman,a year on,are close friends and keeping the streets of Sandford safe from any and all criminal element.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable from more than a few different angles,this film is both funny and irreverent and boasts a wonderful supporting cast of actors to help them in their 121 minute romp on celluloid.Timothy Dalton is among the cast and his impalement on the church steeple is nothing short of cringing....ouch! Kind of a turnabout is fair play thing,as it was Dalton's character that sent a church steeple down upon the reporter who was to clue Angel in,earlier in the flick.<br />This three disc set is nothing short of fantastic.The first disc ispretty much what is contained in the single disc release but it gets much better.Into the second disc and third you will discover facts,trivia and behind the scenes info that will keep you enthralled for literally hours,in fact FIVE to be exact!I can't possibly list all the features in detail but generally you are looking at:the video of their pre-release tour of the U.S. with the movie and its reactions at various points along the way with its two main stars and director Wright,and it's,well...you'll just have to watch to see,a plethora of deleted scenes and outtakes,commentaries on almost all the features,eight featurettes,a look at the S/FX,23 vid blogs,a look at Wright's first cop film,many other inside looks at just about every angle of the film making process including stunt driving training for the cars used in the film,etc,etc.Whew! If you loved the film you will love all of this stuff as they couldn't have done it up any better.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is clear and crisp,along with the dynamite sound.<br />All in all,this is as good as it gets folks for all fans of this movie;and I can't imagine who wouldn't or couldn't be one.A funny and irreverent look at the life of an overzealous English cop,Hot Fuzz has what it takes to get your adrenaline going but at the same time have you laughing in the aisles.Get it while the getting is still good.ed in the single disc release but it gets much better.Into the second disc and third you will discover facts,trivia and behind the scenes info that will keep you enthralled for literally hours,in fact FIVE to be exact!I can't possibly list all the features in detail but generally you are looking at:the video of their pre-release tour of the U.S. with the movie and its reactions at various points along the way with its two main stars and director Wright,and it's,well...you'll just have to watch to see,a plethora of deleted scenes and outtakes,commentaries on almost all the features,eight featurettes,a look at the S/FX,23 vid blogs,a look at Wright's first cop film,many other inside looks at just about every angle of the film making process including stunt driving training for the cars used in the film,etc,etc.Whew!

0596009208|3.0|I was hoping for more from this book. I guess I wanted more than just a basic introduction to Java. I have the Head First SQL and Head First C# books and I enjoyed them greatly. This book got me going into Java and did help to explain some Object Oriented stuff that I did not feel that I picked up on in the Head First C# book, but by the end of the book I did not feel that I really grasped so much of the language as I did with the C# book. If I had been brand new to programming, I probably would have loved this book, and I still do enjoy what it taught me about Object Orient Programming, just not so much the Java part of it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I loved the role king's wife played in his life.  Oftentimes supporting the ones we love is overlooked in pursuit of our own goals. A great reminder that we can be the greatest support and influence by our quite trust and love.

0307716511|2.0|Beatrice jumps on a plane from New York to London when she gets the word that her younger sister, Tess has gone missing.  And when she learns of her sister's death, she moves into Tess's apartment and becomes obsessed with investigating her murder.<br /><br />For me, this was a tough read: too irritatingly slow, too drawn out, and consistently boring.  The end...ridiculous! Rosamund Lupton may be a skillful writer, but lacks when it comes to telling an exciting or even interesting story.<br /><br />Not Recommended.
B004VRK3ZU|5.0|Love Robin Williams and loved Jumanji.  Was real happy to see it on Blu-ray.  Thanks for sending it so quickly.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Love Beyonce! Her music is fantastic! So many tracks on this cd are great to listen to and of course sing along with!
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Received Blu-ray/Blue-ray 3D/DVD all for the same price of only two disks at other places & it arrived fast.    This movie is a great mix of action, relationships & humor.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|Very unhappy the day Amazon let this go for 99 cents.  My computer crashed and froze and eventually loaded a virus with this that desroyed my computer.  McAfee didn't even catch it.  To bad, I like the album, just don't have it now because the computer had to be completely wiped out and reloaded.  The 99 cent album cost me over $200 in repairs.  So not cool!  Will never download from Amazon again.
B005974CNA|5.0|Any fan of Dream Theater no doubt has strong opinions on the direction that their sound has been going in recently, the departure of founding member Mike Portnoy, and the continuation of the band with new drummer Mike Mangini. I'm no exception. Personally, I thought Dream Theater's last two albums were crap. Dream Theater has always been a heavy band, however they are first and foremost a progressive band. There is a variety of sound in their music that sets them apart from other bands. On Chaos and Black Clouds they seemed to have lost those unique elements and simply tried to make albums for metal fans. I do not think this works for Dream Theater, and this disappointed me as a fan. When Portnoy left, I tended to side with him, thinking that yes, maybe the band would benefit from a break from each other. When the band posted their videos chronicling their search for a drummer, I didn't pay attention. When they released the first song, \\"On the Backs of Angels,\\" I had pretty much already written off the album, listened to the song once, and dismissed it as the same crap that had been released on the previous two albums. Unfortunately, my fandome would not let me completely dismiss the band, and I was forced by some unknown reason (perhaps curiosity) to purchase the new album a few days before its official release from an awesome independent record store that shall not be named. (Support your local record stores, kids!) My expectations for this album could not have possibly been lower. I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Everything that I used to love about Dream Theater has made its way back onto this album. Who knows, maybe Portnoy was the problem in the band, because the songwriting seems fresher, more natural, and just... better. There is a lot of experimentation with song structures, keys, and timing on this album. The melodies are strong. Overall, the album is still on the heavy side, but not too heavy. The solo sections sound like they compliment the songs overall instead of feeling out of place and contrived like they did on Chaos and Black Clouds. Those two albums seemed to basically be about who could masturbate with their instruments the best. With A Dramatic Turn of Events, Dream Theater has turned their focus back to the music.<br /><br />Listening to the album now, I don't see how I could have not liked \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" when I first heard it... perhaps I was still a bit jaded... or maybe it just needed more than the one listen that I gave it. It is an excellent song in classic DT fashion. \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" has a sound that is reminiscent of LaBrie's solo albums. It's heavy, and has a strong chorus. \\"Bridges in the Sky\\" is probably my favorite song on the album. It's a complex song, its heavy, it's melodic, it has a strong hook; it's everything that I love about Dream Theater. The heavy songs are complimented by the ballads. While on Chaos and Black Clouds, the ballads seemed like they were almost written for the radio, the ballads on A Dramatic Turn of Events seem to compliment the rest of the album. I definitely hear elements of Images and Words, Scenes from a Memory, and Six Degrees on this album, however while there are passages that seem to be influenced by previous work, Dream Theater does a good job to not rip off their previous work.<br /><br />A Dramatic Turn of Events is an album that you need to listen to a few times to begin to really appreciate it. Even now, having only had the album for about a week, I feel as though I might not have had enough time with it to truly give it a proper review. I feel that 4 stars is a fairly accurate rating for it as I really am liking it a lot, but I do not feel like it is in the same category as albums like Scenes, Images, Six Degrees, or Octavarium.... though, who knows... give me another month of listening to it and maybe I'll have it up there. The album definitely seems to get better with every listen. One thing is for sure: As a long time DreamTheater fan, I am incredibly happy with this release. As cliche as the phrase is... A Dramatic Turn of Events represents a return to form for Dream Theater.<br /><br />---<br />UPDATE<br />---<br /><br />I'm coming back to this review and updating it after several months of listening to this album. As I stated in the last paragraph of my review above, this album indeed gets better with every listen. I absolutely love this album now and am regarding it as one of their best albums. I am changing my rating of 4-stars to 5-stars. If you haven't already, pick this album up. And go see them on the summer tour!Theater fan, I am incredibly happy with this release.

B003L77G6A|5.0|I purchased this to share with my boyfriend and we absolutely love the show. The cast hasn't lost it's touch and the geek humor remains to be undefeated by any other show.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is awesome. Everyone in my family loves it-from my 4 year old nephew to my 80 year old grandmother. My 35 year old boyfriend who strongly dislikes board game even likes it! This is my new favorite game. The four player is great for the whole family. I liked it so much I bought the two player version to play when it's just the boyfriend and me! You have to get this game!
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Got this as an Amazon Free App of the Day a while ago and didn't have high expectations going in, not being a big fan of previous tower defense type games. However, it's been installed on my phone since I got it and play it several times per week. It's really a very fun and addictive game that you can play for a short 20 minutes per round and stop or get lost in the game and easily pass an hour.  Having a storyline helps and there are a good number of weapons and zombies to keep your strategic brain working. Add to that the excellent graphics and you've got a winning game.     Even though I got it free from Amazon, I would definitely pay for this game and if the developer comes out with a new, different game, I'll definitely give it a look.    HTC Incredible
0525948023|5.0|This company goes above and beyond to provide outstanding customer service! Very positive experience! Will buy from them again and again! Turned out I was going to be leaving town before my book arrived, and the wonderful people over at RVME upgraded me to priority shipping just to make sure I received my product in time. Glad to know that some companies still remember the importance of good old fashioned customer service!
B0050SYS5A|3.0|For calibration, go to kinect tuner when adjusting the tracking you have to choose \\"adjust angle\\" and tell the kinect to tilt up or down to get your whole body (and floor) in the picture.  My kinect is on top of my TV (which is on a stand)and the kinect sits just under 5' from the ground.  I have about 6' of floor space from my tv to my couch, which is enough for child of eden but I'm tall so for full body games like kinect adventures and dance central I need the zoom.  I need to step forward to about 3' to operate in game menus, then step back to play the games.    To play child of eden with the zoom on I have to be practically on top of the screen but it does work.    I put the kinect with zoom underneath my tv on the stand and after adjusting the angle found it works just as well but I can get more play space in my living room with it on top of the TV.    Someone else mentioned finding the \\"sweet spot\\" to get it to work and I think that's the key.    Good luck
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I'll keep this pretty short. I got my set yesterday and let me just say this is one of the BEST packaged boxed sets ever. It's simple, yet stunning at the same time. Each episode comes in a flip case, housed in a cardboard cutout on one side, with boxart from that particular episode in the background.<br /><br />I watched Episodes 1 & 2 yesterday and the picture quality is absolutely jaw-dropping. It's extremely crisp and clear. Love it.<br /><br />The audio sounds good too, and honestly the William's score sounds great in surround on a low-end system (can't imagine what this sounds like for those of you with more expensive sets). I heard notes and lines that I'd never heard before, and I'm not talking about, \\"Noooooo.\\"<br /><br />I can't wait until my next day off to watch some more episodes, but so far this is total win and totally worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I'll edit my review after I watch more.<br /><br />Edit #1 - I got a chance to watch Episode 3, and just wow. Video quality was phenomenal!!!! I can't say that enough! I started playing it right after I sat down with some pizza, and right after the scrolling pre-synopsis was done I had to stop eating because my jaw was wide open! This held true through the whole movie.<br /><br />PS. I am a huge Star Wars fan!! And yes, I'm disappointed that they aren't the exact theatrical cuts (first release), but I am ok with that.

0691142165|4.0|This is a fantastic book covering economic events over the last several hundred years.  It provides a lot of insight about where we are in the economic cycle and where history says we might go next.  It is written in the style of an academic study, so it is not conversational, easy night-time reading, but it is well worth it if you are interested in why things are happening now and what might happen next.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|To me this is a great release. 9 Disc Set all 6 Movies Plus 40 Hrs of Bonus Features. The Picture Looks awesome the sound is great! I know people do not like the changes but to me it does not bother me. If you want the unaltered version the Star Wars limited Edition DVD'S are widely available still that have the Original Theatrical versions. To me this is a great Blu-Ray to buy and well worth the $80 the best Star Wars has Looked and sounded Ever. Don't listen to all the negativity about it something you just need to judge for yourself like I do I never pay attention to negative reviews I judge every movie myself. if you do not give this set a chance you will be missing out 40 Hrs Of Special Features alone warrants a buy for people who love Star Wars!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever heard.  I listen to it at least once a day.  You will not be disappointed.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|It 's beautiful slip cover color. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, tehe sound e imagem was amazing too.
B0055S348W|5.0|one of the best apps I've ever seen.  I love the functions for printing selected contacts and calendar dates. android should have had these abilities built in from the begining.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|One of the best utils I have. my touch 4G gingerbread 2.3 easy to use and always works !!!! thanks for the great work
B004V9J3HM|5.0|By far one of his bests releases since One,deep & moving lyrics and catchy songs this album is what Neal Morse is at his best.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This came up on my suggested list on Amazon and I avoided it until I saw the hardcopy at the airport and became more intrigued.  What a waste of time.  I was actually angry at the end of the book that I wasted so much time on such a shallow book.  No real character depth, no chemistry between characters, so-so premise.  When I got to about 98% on my Kindle and realized the whole book was working up to what should have been the most interesting part of the story I was just plain angry.  There was zero closure at the end of the book and I am sorry, it just wasn't good enough for me to even consider buying a sequel, so please, don't bother writing one. I kept hoping it would get better and it just never did. There were a couple of compeling scenes, but not worth the rest of the time the book took.
B0055S348W|5.0|Thoroughly impressed, very nice app. Worked like a champ and I would recommend this app to anyone looking to print. Works on both my EVO 4G and my Galaxy Tab 10.1
B003ZSJ212|5.0|After reading all the negative reviews about people complaining about Starwars in HD before they even seen the product, i must say they are going to be missing out on one of the best starwars presentations. You can stick to your VHS video and tape quality audio, ill stick with the Master 6.1 HD Audio and stunning colors and clarity that the bluray expresses.  I never knew how many colors and textures there were in these movies, from the reflections in C3P0s body to every little detail in his wires and the storm troopers outfits.   One of my favorite aspects of the bluray is the sparks from the fire fights, simply stunning. the blu ray shows so many  colors that have not been seen through the DVD and VHS versions.  The quality is extraordinary and makes you feel like your on the set watching the movie.  You can see every little detail of the jets coming out of the millennium falcon, instead of a blob of blurry blue you see multiple jets at work with colors ranging from white to a tipped blue flame.  defiantly worth 80$ for 6 movies and 3 bonus discs. its a must have for any starwars fan.
B0055S348W|4.0|Where is the additional 4 mb download at. What am I missing here.  Everything else downloaded fine.  Want to make sure that everything is downloaded. Looking for some assistance.  Thanks in advance.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|There's a lot to like about this set as a fan of these films (IV, V, VI especially), but why oh why won't you stop \\"improving\\" these films Mr. Lucas.  I know you have the right to do whatever you want but it really was more compelling to have Darth Vadar silent when he threw the emperor down the shaft.  As a fan of silent cinema, I thought you knew the meaning and power of silence.  You were obviously trying to tie \\"Nooooooo\\" to the \\"Noooooo\\" in episode III.  When I watched episode III in the movie theatre people laughed out loud at that scene.  Never a good sign.  It doesn't ruin the film for me completely as it seems it does for some but it certainly takes me out of the film and disconnect during such a key dramatic moment in the series.  The transfers are beautiful on bluray for sure and sound amazing.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Dexter is fantastic... it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Each season is different and has a little something to keep you watching. Two thumbs up!
B005KWL2IW|5.0|This is no nostalgia trip and no comeback album; it surpasses the classic albums SPREADING THE DISEASE and AMONG THE LIVING.     Personally, I parted company with Anthrax shortly after those albums when they jumped the shark with \\"I'm the Man.\\" I really liked Anthrax, but I never saw them as in the same league as Metallica and Slayer. Belladonna is a great singer, but he was too high up in the mix on SPREADING THE DISEASE and AMONG THE LIVING. In addition the bass was way too low in the mix on those albums--too much Charlie and Scott. The result was a sound that was too thin, tinny, choppy, and hollow. Lyrically and musically those albums had too many corny, cheesy, cringe-worthy moments.    WORSHIP MUSIC starts with some atmospheric tones ala Sabbath and launches into a blast worthy of Slayer. The rhythm guitar and riffs sound more like James Hetfield than Scott Ian--and that's a major compliment. The album has a deep, thick, rich, full tone with plenty of bass. Belladonna sounds like a genuine metal singer and produces vocal lines worthy of Bruce Dickinson, strong but not overwhelming. His voice is an instrument in its own right and is in sync with the other instruments.    It's hard to pick out the best songs because WORSHIP MUSIC does not have a weak moment, never mind a weak song.  If I had heard one of these songs on the radio before buying the album, I'm not even sure I would have recognized it as Anthrax. It's that good.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I think the Blu-Ray of all of the Episodes were great. Lucas did add things that did not have to be added but so what he is entitled. I am a star wars fan no matter what. even the ones that complain still bought so more money to Lucas for movies you say you did not like.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have 2 other apps that allow me to print a .pdf and photo to my WiFi HP printer, but this one app does this and soooo much more. Plus .it easily found my WiFi printer, something the other apps couldn't always do.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|As the title says, How can you rate any item before even receiving it. That is absurd. That say that George Lucas has ruined ones childhood memories by making changes makes me laugh, as if any movie could do that. If anything, Its new Star Wars!!! some of the scenes were filmed years ago. George would have put many of them in years ago if he had the technology... Seriously people.... stop acting like whiners.     As for the product.. It truly is amazing. The picture vibrant and the sound exuberent!! The new scenes look great and the deleted scenes are so much fun to watch. The only negative thing I might say is that some of the special features have all ready been released in the past , But thats ok. Its a nice definitive collection. BTW, the lightsabers look amazing! I didn't enjoy the adding of Nooooooooooo! by Vader as he throws the Emperor down the shaft, but it did not  \\" ruin my childhood\\"! You will enjoy these!!!
B002CLBJPK|5.0|Wonderful movie.  Angela Lansbury is a very favorite of mine.  We had this on VHS and definitely want it on DVD.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Temple Grandin is one fantastic movie.  Her process of thinking and knowing through pictures exemplify her sense of humor, misunderstanding and understanding of her world.  The explanation of autism is enlightening and her growth through the incredibly strong and persistent mother as her early support system is touching.  Grandin's strength of character in overcoming obstacles mimics the persistance of advocacy originally displayed by her mom.  This is a heartening story of success.  In part I enjoy this movie because I too think in pictures, though they are not as technical as Grandin's.  I am a 2-D artist and have struggled to make my pictures look \\"right\\".  Her final products are more 3-D oriented but she excels in working out the details in her mind and on paper.
B0055S348W|5.0|works smooth, easy setup.  great features like selecting which contacts to print allows you to create custom contact lists.  i like that you can also &quot;print&quot; into a Google doc.  All around great app, exactly what i have been looking for.
B003PBB4ME|4.0|The x-grip is made mainly for camcorders, although i use it with my Canon T2I for filming skateboarding.  The t2i does not have a flip out screen like the t3i, so it is sometimes a little bit difficult to set up/view a shot with out a fisheye or wide-angle lens.  The X-grip keeps the camera more sturdy, and significantly reduces camera shake while skateboarding.  Installing your camera on the x-grip is fairly simple, and you can mess around with the position of your camera on the x-grip, to find the best balance/viewing point.  Overall this is a good product, and i feel like it is worth the money especially if you have a camcorder or DSLR with a flip out screen.  I would also recommend purchasing a fisheye or wide-angle lens for your camera if possible.
B004LROMSO|3.0|King Arthur seems to be rather a difficult subject to adapt. For me, not one of them has really done it well, but a few come close. Excalibur is a stand out, Mist of Avalon isn't too bad, and even Sam Neill's Merlin tries hard. The recent King Arthur starring Clive Owen was fun, but really a retread of The Seven Samurai.    One of the major problems, is what do you put in and what do you leave out? Do you set it in a medieval fantasy world or in the grim Roman-Britain dark ages? How much magic do you put in? Is it real or pagan religion?    This adaptation is rather poorly thought out. The stand out problem for me right off the bat are the costumes. The ladies do all right in nebulous renaissance fair outfits, but the men fare poorly. There is hardly any armour and virtually no helmets. This makes the whole thing look cheap and rather silly. Even dark ages Britain went in for armour, if not as much as the later ages. The story of King Arthur, for me, is about KNIGHTS IN ARMOUR, and that's what I expect. Instead you have rather floppy hairstyled young men running around in baggy shirts claiming to be the champions of the king. I don't believe them, they look rather wet. There is no sense that this is King Arthur, these are his KNIGHTS and he is a military force to be reckoned with in the land.    The magic aspect is poor. Morgan can do an impressive spell and make herself look like some one else. Impressive. Merlin can burn people and turn lakes to ice in minutes. Very impressive. So magic, powerful magic, exists in this world. So why go for nonmagical explanations about the Sword in the Stone or Excalibur? The treatment of the Sword in the Stone would work in an adaptation with no 'real' magic, but not here. The Excalibur adaptation is worse. Merlin gets the sword for Arthur in a very mundane way (from a weaponsmith), kills the smith, chases the smith's daughter (named Excalibur?!) to her death out on the lake and prises the sword from her dead hand as she sinks beneath the ice that Merlin magically turned the lake into. How bloody complicated! How dumb! The story's already there, why not just do that instead?     The cast are OK and there are a quite a few shots of attractive naked ladies on view for those of us who like that sort of thing. Joseph Fiennes and Claire Forlani seem to be trying to act being each other in their scenes together. Fortunately Forlani has long hair, so you can tell them apart. Actually, that's kind of mean for me to say that, but their scenes are rather tedious. The whole Arthur, Guinevere, Guinevere's so-what husband character plot line is lame too. It just wastes storytelling time.    The best thing in this is Eva Green. She does a great job. Pity the show around her is lame.    So, all in all, a wasted opportunity. So much gold in Malory, so much drek here. I did watch this right after watching Game of Thrones, but even without that excellent series fresh in my mind, this is LAME.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|Thomas Bergersen's \\"Illusions\\" is a pleasure to listen to--at turns epic, symphonic, haunting and ethereal.  It's rare that I'm just enthralled by an album, but this one did the trick.  My favorite track is \\"Age of the Gods,\\" which is aptly titled and seems to be the most popular download from the album on iTunes.  (Give the sample a listen on Amazon's player.)<br /><br />Bergersen is known for his music with the movie trailer music company \\"Two Steps From Hell\\"--\\"trailer music,\\" by the way, is the epic, compelling music that you hear in trailers for upcoming attractions, and it's designed to make you want to see the film being advertised.  It's usually shorter and more complete than the longer pieces found on soundtrack albums, which often include compositions designed for a particular movie scene that may not be pleasing to listen to on their own.  Bergersen's work in \\"Illusions\\" goes a step beyond the epic trailer music genre and aspires to be something more like classical world music.  It seems to me that Bergersen has succeeded.<br /><br />For those who like visual settings for their music, I have a suggestion that I stumbled across:  If you have an iPad, download \\"Illusions\\" onto it, then download a free music player app called \\"Planetary\\" and listen to \\"Illusions\\" while watching the app.  You may enjoy the result--I certainly did.<br /><br />If you are looking for other examples of Bergersen's work, try [[ASIN:B005K15XR4 Invincible]] , [[ASIN:B005OC6A9Y Archangel]] and [[ASIN:B004U83SM0 The Human Experience (Music From The Motion Picture)]], to which Bergersen contributed several tracks.  According the the web page for Illusions, a CD of the album will be issued in October 2011--for the moment, it's available only as an MP3 download.
B005KWL2IW|3.0|From the perspective of a fan whose been actively listening to Anthrax since \\"Among the Living\\" - I've just listened to this for the first time, and I come away being neither surprised or disappointed.  It is a solid Anthrax release with all of their trademark aspects.  It doesn't break much new ground, nor would I expect it to.  I know that will be hard for some of the extreme 5 star reviewers out there to deal with - but it is what it is.  That said.....    The band sounds just as good - if not better - than they ever have.  Joey Belladonna has found some manliness in his voice and displays in places - as well as his spot on Dio impersonation.  I mean that with no disrespect.  His voice sounds better here than it ever has in my opinion.  If I had to compare this album to any in Anthrax's catalog for similarities, Persistence of Time probably comes the closest.      We get started off with an intro which goes into \\"Earth on Hell\\", a song that sounds uncannily like \\"One Man Stands\\" on P.O.T.  Then the album starts for real.    There is a reason why Anthrax released \\"The Devil you Know\\"  in advance of the album.  It is BY FAR the strongest track - a tightly played fast groove that brings Metallica's \\"Holier Than Thou\\" to mind, but better.    The album continues on with some good standard-issue anthrax.  \\"Fight em Til you Can't\\" sounds like \\"In My World\\" off of P.O.T.  I'm alive is the obligatory 3/4 grind to break things up.  \\"In the End\\" - a slower song which showcases Belladonna's vocals, is a high point.  Belladonna does have some pipes.  Lot's of DIO overtones here.    \\"The Giant\\" then comes in with it's fast football chant which brings a welcome boost of energy from the slower \\"In the End\\" and also pushes some of Anthrax's more punkish aspects - something I have liked about them since hearing Among the Living for the 1st time back in '87.    \\"Judas Priest\\" is Anthrax's shot a progressive metal. It starts off with a slow Hard-hitting progressive angry feel with multiple \\"movements\\" with some pantera-ish drum moments and some of he best guitar soloing heard from Anthrax in a while.  Definitely a showpiece for the fine musicianship of this group!      For the final part of the album, Anthrax sort of falls into a formula of mid-paced anthem-type songs - \\"Crawl\\", \\"The Constant\\", and \\"Revolution Screams\\".  All respectable, though none particularly attention grabbing.    Just to clarify my rating criteria  5 = I would buy it today - on vinyl if possible  4 = Would buy and listen to a few times probably  3 = Possibly worth another listen in the car or while doing other things  2 = Forgettable  1 = Self-explanatory
B003ZSJ212|1.0|We all know the deal.    He's the fat guy sitting at the table and we're the dogs chained in the corner, eating the table scraps he throws at us every now and then.  But we're so hungry we'll eat what we get us as we watch him choke down another steak, laughing, dripping juices on his fat belly.    The next table scrap that hits us in the head will probably be a ridiculous 3D version.  He'll put a lot of salt on that one.     But someday, he might loosen the chain a bit and throw us the \\"original\\" version, but that day is far far away....

0316017930|4.0|Gladwell does a great job of showing you \\"the other side of the coin,\\" when it comes to success.  Gladwell examines factors those who are successful have no control over.  Advantages they inherently had.  He uses studies as a basis or proof on what he is explaining, which I thought was cool and really validated what he was saying.  He picks great examples and this really helps the book.  The examples are strong, well rounded and of very successful people (Bill Gates, Bill Joy - SUN Microsystems, The Beatles, Youth Athletics, American VS Western Education/Cuture)<br /><br />In the beginning of the book he seems to play this off as more beginning, and it seems to bother him more as the book goes on.  He then talks about the 10,000 rule, which is a cool rule I will allow you to explore by reading.  As the book goes on, it seems to get more bleak and he lost me a little.  I really did enjoy the facts, examples and cultures he examines.  He simply start to become a little too morbid in my opinion, but it did not detract from the value of the book.<br /><br />The book is a great, quick read.  If my review is short, or didn't quite help you form an opinion, let me do it for you now - read this book.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|I have this on my iphone 3gs and love it.  Unfortunately this android version is just a phone port and not a tablet version.  It doesn't fill the screen, the graphics are rough, it's just not elegant like on my iphone and is even worse on the 10&quot; tablet platform.  I'd get a refund if I could, then repurchase if they introduce a tablet android version.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Just got my Blu-Ray set in the mail yesterday.  Excellent picture quality, excellent audio.  Not to mention, 3 Blu-Ray discs filled with extras!!  Very impressive packaging, too.  We watched Episode I last night with my kids.  The high-def Blu-Ray is unbelievable.    Cranked the surround sound and popped it on the plasma and it felt like we were in a movie theatre but better!!  I've been watching Star Wars since I was a little kid and its fun to watch my children enjoy it now too.  All the haters that posted reviews on here before it even came out are idiots.  Who cares if it is a puppet yoda instead of a CGI yoda?  What does it matter? You still live in your parents basement and have never touched a girl either, probably.  For those of you who enjoyed the magic of Star Wars, this will not disappoint!
B004F9OV5C|4.0|Adam Kindred, a British climatologist who has been working at an American university, returns to London for a job interview. A chance encounter in a Chelsea restaurant gets him involved in a brutal murder, and some foolish steps taken in panic quickly result in his becoming a wanted man. What Adam does not at first realize is that this is not merely a police case; he has unknowingly stumbled upon information that could derail a multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical launch, and the company has deadly resources at its disposal. The opening chapters show how astoundingly quickly a hitherto upstanding citizen can be reduced to nothing, barely able to keep from going under at the waterline of society.<br /><br />Literally so. Almost all the story takes place by the River Thames: in a triangle of waste land by Chelsea Bridge where Adam hangs out, in the depot of the river police where a young policewoman starts making inquiries of her own, in the wards and morgues of the riverside hospitals, in a brutal block of high-rise apartments where Adam develops an unexpected relationship with a prostitute, in the gleaming new office buildings built in the former docklands. Boyd's intimate knowledge of the city and its river does much to counteract the unrelieved bleakness of the long middle portion of this book. He also imagines a wide range of characters from the homeless at a bizarre religious soup kitchen, through an assortment of slum bosses and professional killers, to sleek boardroom manipulators. And Adam, though stripped of resources, is by no means stupid.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Adam realizes \\"that it was impossible for everything to be all right in this complicated, difficult, mortal life we lead.\\" It is a realization that accords with Boyd's obvious interest in the fragility of identity (see also his [[ASIN:0375702164 ARMADILLO]]) and his moral relativism. Those looking for the nice clean ending of a traditional thriller will not find it here, and our hero is by no means heroic throughout. But it is a satisfying outcome and -- after the occasional suspension of disbelief required earlier -- a surprisingly realistic one.heroic throughout. But it is a satisfying outcome and -- after the occasional suspension of disbelief required earlier -- a surprisingly realistic one.
0375826742|4.0|Great book!, a little darker and a bit more gruesome than the previous books but I still got hooked just the same. Definitely unpredictable, most things left me on my bedroom floor gasping for air, well that was a little over exagerrated but it was such a good book!<br /> If you have read Eragon and Eldest don't hesitate (though you won't if you're like me!!).
B0055S348W|5.0|This app is what I heave ben looking for. It works with my printer even with the generic driver. Expensive but worth it (especially of you downloaded out for free. Thank you Amazon).
0345472322|5.0|This really blew me away.  The whole concept is so interesting.  What really caught my attention was that I was living in a fixed mindset.  I was always told that I was smart.  When things became difficult, I would blame everybody else or muscle my way through. I was that student who did everything to pass the test, not to learn. Once you give up that goal of 'passing the test' and try to learn, you will succeed that much greater. This is great for everyone.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I received the headphones and have been enjoying them.  I was hoping for<br />(1) good sound -- these have the best sound of any headphones I have -- I had forgotten how good some music could sound<br />(2) lightweight -- looking at the size you might think that these are heavy -- they are not<br />(3) comfortable -- I have not had them on for hours on end but the more I wear them, the more comfortable they seem to get<br />(4) price -- these were in my price range and I think they are worth more than I paid<br />(5) fits two plug sizes -- almost forgot -- these have a large (I think 1/4 inch adapter included -- it actually is threaded to fit over the 1/8 plug and was easy enough to remove) -- but just be sure you notice -- you don't have to buy an adapter to fit 1/8 plug, just remove the 1/4 inch plug that is placed over it.<br /><br />So all in all, these are good for me and may be just what you are looking for too.

B003Y5H542|1.0|We just watched Rango. The extended version was only FOUR minutes longer and much more inappropriate for children.   I looked at the case and realized the extended version wasn't rated. I am glad two out of my three fell asleep. That is the last time I make the mistake of selecting a particular version without reading the case!  What a waste of plastic!  If you have a children's movie that is listed as PG and it gives you the option of \\"Theatrical Version\\" or \\"Extended Version\\" READ THE FINE PRINT ON THE CASE! The extended version may not be rated. It is pathetic what they will add in there in only four minutes. It bypassed our player's parental controls because the dvd is marked PG. It didn't warn me on the screen. The title insinuated that it was merely a longer version. Next time I will read the fine print first.    Aside from that..  I didn't like the movie, it dragged on. My kids didn't hate it, but they thought it was super long. These kids have sat through three hour movies. The extended version is only four minutes longer. My kids were not disappointed that we won't be watching it again.     Perhaps the \\"Theatrical Version\\" was better, but I am not going to waste 107 minutes of my life to find out.      If you want to see the funny parts, just watch the trailer.
0385523394|3.0|Piper Kernan gives the reader a good view of what life is like in a women's minimum security prison.  She goes into great detail on the day-to-day existence of an inmate.  The jobs, food, visitation, guards, and recreational activities are all very well described.  However, this book must be read with a critical eye to fully appreciate it.  The reader must understand that Kernan is trying to put herself in the most positive light possible, and what she does not say is very important, too.    For example, Kernan says that she only delivered drug money once, and that was the extent of her involvement with her lesbian lover's drug operation.  However, on page 22, in describing the evidence against her, Kernan says \\"the evidence the government had gathered against me - it included a detailed statement from her that described me carrying cash to Europe.\\"  She wants the reader to believe that she pled guilty on the basis of only an admitted drug dealer's statement and nothing more. However, The key word is \\"included.\\" That means the government had a lot more evidence that Kernan does not share with the reader. It is doubtful that her very expensive lawyer would have allowed her to take the plea if that was all they had.  It is far more likely that Kernan was much more deeply involved in her lover's drug operation that she reveals and that the government really had the goods on her.        Also, in the \\"Questions for Discussion\\" on page 325, question 3 begins with \\"Piper is indicted for a crime she committed several years earlier and is sentenced to more than a year in prison.\\" There is absolutely nothing in that sentence that tells the reader that Kernan pled guilty of her own accord.  It tries to give the impression that if a person is indicted, the government can send them to prison without a trial.  This is juvenile in its effort to make Kernan appear to be the victim of an evil government that is out of control.      Kernan never seems to say that what she did was wrong.  It is not until page 180 that Kernan finally admits that what she did helped to increase the suffering of the female drug addicts that she was incarcerated with.  But, Kernan only gives her guilt trip one short paragragh before going back to her theme that society is really the villain here and that these unfortunate women should be given counseling and treatment rather than prison terms.  She completely overlooks the fact that most of these women committed other crimes to support their drug habit.    This brings us to the biggest error in Kernan's reasoning.  Throughout the book, she insists that drug offenses like hers are non-violent crimes.  She completely ignores the fact that many burglaries, muggings, and car-jackings are committed by addicts trying to get the money to buy drugs from people like Kernan and her lover.  The money she carried to Europe probably included the life savings of some elderly woman, stolen to get drug money. But, Kernan ignores this because she did not steal the old lady's money herself.  Her refusal to face this fact is probably due to her super-liberal, priviliged upbringing, which allowed her to close her eyes to the unpleasant realities of life. She just doesn't think about it, and that makes it OK in her mind.    Finally, Kernan's life was not negatively impacted at all by her incerceration.  After being released, she tells us \\"Work began a week later, at a marketing job created just for me at a tech company that was run by a friend.\\"  Must be nice to have a friend who can make a job just for her.  Of course, he did make wait a whole week for it.  Ah, the problems and miseries of the idle rich.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|I was apprehensive at first about buying this set up since it was so $$ but so far it was well worth buying. Not only is the monitor crisp and sharp, no game lag, the whole set up is protected by a hard case. FYI- If anyone is interested in getting a bag to put this in, timbuk2 has messenger bags big enough to carry this. I emailed the main site about this and they stated they are eventually making a strap for the setup but in all honesty any carrying strap is a nuisance because it goes through the locking mechanisms on each side. I'm not a huge fan of advertising that I'm walking around with 600$+ worth of gaming entertainment, so I got a bag big enough to carry it comfortably. At first i thought the interior peripheral bags were lame but they actually hold everything together and keep things from scratching the monitor while not adding extra weight. The straps hold the PlayStation in place and the pad keeps it from sliding around. I have had no problems with over heating but i still recommend a small usb fan for anyone using the ps3 slim for extended amounts of time. placed outside the set up blowing the air out from in between the system and monitor makes my ps3 run almost completely cold and I play 3+ hours at a time. Overall i recommend this set up just because it makes your ps3 easily portable which is great for anyone who ether travels or can play their systems at work :)
1933952806|5.0|This book is fantastic. I am only through the first 100 pages and I have already learned a great deal about not only the camera but a variety of techniques like the lightning picture that I would have never thought of and can't wait to try out.    It explains very clearly what the settings will do for you or not do for you. I have had a D40, D70 and D90 before this so I am quite familiar with Nikon DSLRs. I think for a DSLR beginner this book is indispensible, but even for an old hand it has some extremely useful tidbits.    I agree that the \\"My recommendation\\" sections for each setting are most useful and clearly explain why you would probably want to select the same settings as the author, but he also explains why some one with a different shooting style or needs would select another choice instead. I think that so far I either already did choose the same setting or chose it after reading this section. But other things don't really fit my style or workflow (like the file naming convention Darrell advocates for example).    It is a hefty volume though for sure, so not something I will want to carry with me on a trip for example. But after reading this book I think the manual will certainly jog my memory if need be.

B0050SYS5A|1.0|My story is like everyone else's here.  I live in a very small apartment and was sold on the idea of no longer moving my couch to play Kinect.  I pre-ordered the Zoom and could not get it to work properly.  Hand tracking was very course, kinect tuner could not find the floor, IR feedback was mostly black.  Occasionally the kinect would lose my forearm and the hand tracking would follow my elbow...  Dance Central was not playable, menus were hard to navigate.  Luckily Amazon has a great system in place for returns.  My Kinect is mounted above my TV.  However I am not sold on the idea that the unit would work better if it was below the tv and could find the floor.  I may be mistaken but calibration in relation to the floor only tells the kinect which angle to view the room, it wouldn't help or hinder the hand tracking, and that is where the Zoom fails.
B0055S348W|5.0|Cloud Print support, nearby printers, etc, all make this app a winner! Worth every penny of the $13, and great for free.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Lucas shot second and continues to kill the series. Proves that old saying that the first idea is the best idea and you should leave it alone!!!!!!!!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|The astonishing thing is not that so many read certain reviews here (such as that of N. Lucius) but that so many responded positively to such blatant ignorance.    For someone to complain so vociferously about changes,  and then to ignorantly complain that other scenes were 'changed' (i.e., Luke's light saber training session on the Millenium Falcon) when they were in FACT exactly as presented in the original theatrical release from 1977 is ironic and humorous in the extreme - in spite of a handful of changes, these films are presented almost entirely as originally released, and in a quality approaching that of the film formats  (which, kiddies, is superior to the cute little HDTV setups so many of you are now used to) of the past.     These are beautiful transfers, from picture to audio quality, and are simply the best these films have looked in a home viewing situation. Yes, Lucas has made some minor changes here and there (and it is his right - he owns these works, regardless of what some minority of extreme fans may believe), but it really makes little difference in the impact of these works.  Goofy? Yes. Naive? Undoubtedly, but such things are the charm of films inspired by space opera and Saturday serials. Regardless of source material and inspiration, these films forever changed the landscape of cinema worldwide, and presentations for home viewing remind us why.    Don't listen to the envious, ignorant haters out there - the old flaws are there, the mistaken changes are present, and the films continue to shine as an example of world-building in cinema and as grand entertainment.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I fought loving this collection in protest of having purchased these movies over and over throughout the years, but the second \\"A New Hope\\" fired up, I was 18 again seeing it on opening night!

0143145088|5.0|As a small business owner in a growing company, I found this to be an essential book when considering how to structure my firm's culture, who to hire, and how to compensate. At least in my industry (financial planning) and probably most if not all others, a carrot and stick mentality seems to persist in regards to job performance and compensation. Daniel Pink discusses this in detail and how intrinsic motivation is much more powerful, satisfying and productive. I've completely changed my compensation philosophy after listening to the audio book and feel that I can grow my firm by leading autonomous, intrinsically motivated individuals and not managing staff with carrots and sticks.

0060775858|5.0|I know we're supposed to read to our boy every night. It's difficult for me. My wife is better. His grandparents are much better. He doesn't much care for some books and I can easily understand why. It just seems to take a special knack to reach some children. Well, one book he really loves is \\"Midnight Moon\\" by Margaret Wise Brown. He likes to go over it again and again, even on his own. It's amazing. Plus, it's helped him to recognize all sorts of things around the house and in his external environment. When he points upward and says \\"Moon\\" at night I know exactly where it came from. Interesting! Personally, I think it's really corny, but I'm not the one to judge. Based on his continuing interest, I'd say this is positively one of his better books.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B001U887T2|5.0|This is my first pair of Crocs.  I originally planned to use them as slippers this winter around the house since I have ceramic tile floors and these seemed to fit the bill for warmth and extra cushion.  Now that I've worn these an hour, I think I'll wear these out of the house and get another pair for use as slippers inside the house! They're so comfy & warm and don't make my feet look like clown feet (which I thought they would being that I have big feet)!  I wear a 9 1/2 or 10 in women's shoes and I ordered a 10, they are snug but not too tight and I think they'll loosen a bit as the lining compacts/stretches.  I usually wear thin socks or go barefoot so these will work out great for me.  If I wore thick wool socks (or had a wider foot) I think they would be a little too tight and I would have had to go a size bigger. I also like that you can hand wash the liner.  I highly recommend these!
B002KH4KSY|2.0|I liked Preston Bailey as Isaac and some of the cornfield shots, but the rest of this is a mess: the woman is so annoying that you just want her dead, her husband has Vietnamm flashbacks, the kids' twisted theology is never explained, and neither is the fate of their parents and all the other adults who must have once lived in Gatlin.
0887431453|2.0|Only buy this if you own a copier or you plan on buying a copier or even multiple copies of this book. This book us a random compilation of activities that didnt teach my preschooler anything.
0553801473|1.0|Martin admits in the acknowledgments that this book \\"was three bitches and a bastard\\" to write. If you can withstand boredom on an epic scale, you can see why.  Too many characters, too little action, and far, far too much musing about the past or what may or may not happen in the future.  Very little of any consequence happens in over 900 pages.  I had hoped that after the \\"Crows\\" fiasco the author would get back on track.  Unfortunately, GRRM went even further off the rails.

B0050SYS5A|4.0|So for most of us that dont have 8-12 feet of open space in our house to devote to kinect, this is a must!<br /><br />First thing you need to do is re-calibrate everything, even the ID thing needs to be re-calibrated. Also make sure you get the zoom on there nice and straight, for me its was easy, it pretty much snapped to the perfect spot on its own.<br /><br />First thing i noticed is that navigating the XBM is kind of clunky with the zoom on, but once you find that sweet spot its not so bad. Once you get into a game though, you dont even know the zoom is there, it works flawlessly.<br /><br />I played the Kinect Adventures and a Dance game, and there was no issues at all, and i was approx. 2 1/2-3 feet away from the kinect!<br /><br />You do have to watch for being to far, i got used to being a certain distance from my kinect, with the zoom on, it was too far to be detected, so move on up to the kinect!<br /><br />So overall, its not perfect, but its a major improvement for those with limited space. You may have to give up using Netflix, Hulu,etc, with the kinect, but its worth it to play the games and have plenty of room. Now my wife and i can play games together!
B00002E233|5.0|I really enjoyed Deep Blue Sea.  You've got a pretty interesting storyline (looking to sharks for a cure for Alzheimer's) that rather quickly turns into quite an impressive little disaster movie (I'm talking explosions, fire, and flooding) with the extra bonus of sharks hunting down those trying to survive the whole ordeal.  It's sort of like The Poseidon Adventure - but with sharks.  It gets even better, as the filmmakers throw a couple of significant surprises at the audience along the way.  Anyone who says Deep Blue Sea is wholly predictable couldn't possibly have seen the movie.  The filmmakers really throw down the gauntlet at the very start, showing the viewer that they aren't working with some tired, old, predictable cookie-cutter script.  Throughout it all, the special effects are excellent, and the scenes of the sharks swimming and attacking are very effective (they're animatronic and CGI, but they look real enough to me).  It helps that the sharks involved are mako sharks, best known for the fact that their deadly teeth are plainly visible even when their mouths are closed.  They may not be the biggest sharks in the ocean, but none are more frightening-looking in the water.<br /><br />Who knew that the secret to curing Alzheimer's disease lay in the brains of nature's perfect killing machine, the shark?  I guess Dr. Susan McCallister (Saffron Burrows) did, having secured the necessary funding to carry out her experiments at an old naval submarine station she renamed Aquatica.  Her work consists mainly of sticking a big needle in the heads of her three mako shark subjects (after they've been subdued and sedated by her team members, of course) and drawing out samples of the precious enzyme she is convinced will prove capable of refiring neurons in dead human brain cells.  Unfortunately, she meets with some inconvenient setbacks, forcing her to accelerate her research before her funding is cut off.  In order to increase the supply of enzymes from the sharks, she resorts to illegal genetic manipulation to increase the sharks' brains by a factor of five.  It really should have come as no surprise that the test sharks would grow significantly more intelligent with their bigger brains, but no one seems to have seen it coming.  These sharks coordinate their attacks, recognize and react to threats against them, and will stop at nothing to kill their human tormentors and make their escape from the facility.  You can't blame the sharks, really - if some alien creature made a habit of sucking juices out of my brain, I would be out for some nasty revenge, too.<br /><br />While Dr. McCallister is a bit of a cold fish, and her colleagues do little to stir the viewer's emotions, the film does feature three great characters.  Carter Blake (Thomas Jane) is the maverick shark wrangler who becomes the de facto leader of the would-be survivors.  Samuel L. Jackson add his strong imprint to the film in the form of Russell Franklin, the financier of this project who chooses the wrong time to visit Aquatica to determine whether or not to pull the plug on the whole thing.  Then there's Preacher (LL Cool J), who adds a lot of humanity and a bit of comic relief as the cook - he's great in this film, and his modernized version of the 23rd Psalm is really something to hear.<br /><br />If you're a fan of shark movies, I think you have to put Deep Blue Sea on your must-see list.  Not only is this a real blockbuster of a thriller, the shark attack scenes are very well done.  You're going to see a lot more than just some unfortunate victim disappearing under the water never to return.  And to top it all off, this movie gives you one of the most shocking surprise deaths you're likely to see.rts to illegal genetic manipulation to increase the sharks' brains by a factor of five.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|as said in the title one of the best movies ive ever seen. i wont give away the ending but theres not much to say really. amazing movie even my mom and sister liked and they really arent that big of harry potter fans.went to the midnight premiere, totally worth it. all in all completely amazing take my word for it u wont regret seeing this movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|I've never enjoyed a book/movie more.  I've read the book twice and watched the movie over and over.  It is a sweet, sweet story.  Of course, Hollywood has added explicit love scenes and profanity, but I scoot past as much as possible and enjoy the rest.  Great acting and really excellent casting.  Thanks Amazon and Seller.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Darth Vaders voice is so different I don't even know where to begin. I'm going to have keep the VCR machine around for a little while longer. WARNING: HIS VOICE IS SO BAD IT WILL RUIN THE MOVIE. CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF BEFORE YOU BUY!!! [...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so good! It's the best book I have read in a long time. I was extremely excited to learn that it is part of a trilogy. I recommend buying all three. You will want to read them once you have finished the Hunger Games.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this story. I heard about this book and was told it was a little weird at first, a little far-fetched. However, I didn't feel this way in the least bit. I completely enjoyed this book from first starting to read it and it just got better and better...I could NOT put this book down. I loved the characters Katniss and Peeta, loved their back story, loved everything about them. I am currently reading it to my 8 year old son, and he loves it too. I think its a really important look at how the world we know could change at any minute, and that all the things we take for granted (like food, electricity, etc.) could be gone in an instant. Makes you wonder if you have what it takes to survive.  I recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick/easy read. To anyone looking for a story that really makes you think and take stock in your own life.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|George Lucas may tinker with the movies, and fans my cry and whine about it, but in the end, Star Wars created the Hollywood blockbuster and brought me (and countless others) many, many hours of fun and play as a kid.  So whine all you want about the changes, the effect Star Wars has had on pop culture will never go away.
B0055S348W|5.0|I have downloaded numerous apps in an attempt to print PDF and word docs on my NX625 printer, with no luck.  Epson released their own iprint app a month ago, only to find out it only prints web pages and images.  I downloaded this app, and downloaded the NX400 or 415 driver, along with PDF and doc render downloads, and now I can finally print these from my phone.  The developers should look at the Epson Iprint app reviews, and market this for Epson users like myself who have been searching ( for at least 6 months) for an app to print directly from my phone!  THANK YOU!
0061438294|2.0|have honestly found nothing new to add to what i already know, i read basic psychology and body language from time to time.. and this has added nothing to what i already know from life experience. as opposed to \\"the definitive book of body language\\" which is the book id recommend it this genre
0143039431|3.0|The book arrived in a timely manner, but I was surprised to find that the paperback book had absolutely no front cover on it! I ended up taping an old pizza menu to the front. It definitely encouraged me to read when I was hungry, but it would be nice to know about a missing front cover before I bought the book. Otherwise, the pages themselves were all present, which is the most important thing.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For all those complaining about the blu-ray addition and how Lucas ruined it by adding stuff to the movies such as extended seens, Shut up and watch it.  Because it is obvious you haven't.  I got it as a Birthday gift and none of the seens were actually added to the movies, but appear on bonus discs. Since most that have complained were doing so hours after the release it makes it more obvious that you have no clue and beleive everything you read or hear from the media speculation.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I became hooked on the first two books of the trilogy and was hoping that this would wrap up the story with the same level of excitement.  Unfortunately, I couldn't wait to be done with it.  It seemed to be an aimless story with an unremarkable ending.  The plot line is just a mess and I found it difficult to take interest in what happened to any of the protagonists by the end, despite the investment in the first two books.  Utterly disappointing.
B0055S348W|1.0|Prints garbage when trying to print a doc file. Formatting and font is all wrong. It prints boxes for apostrophes :( Even though its free, its kind of useless if it can't print the document properly. DROID x 2.3 printing to canon mg5220.
0767810856|3.0|Nick Cage is my favorite actor, and he played the role of a good-hearted and generous cop with the sincerity that he brings to all his roles.  I had read about Bridget Fonda, who played the waitress in this film, and was happy to see her in a movie for the first time--and found her quite engaging.  The plot for this movie, however, was a disappointment.  There were too many coincidences to allow me to really feel fully engaged in this movie.  There was also the problem that the contrast between the good characters (the cop and the waitress) and the bad (especially Rosie Perez as the cop's greedy wife) was too great.  I generally need a movie to endow its characters with more complexity--especially for bad guys who are meant to be everyday people rather supernatural creatures, monsters, or comic-book villains.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Can't really add much to to other reviews.  The author is focusing on to many point of views which is really getting annoying.  It takes multiple books to accomplish what you could normally get done in a few chapters.  The most frustrating thing is he often focuses on non primary characters and events that leave you wandering why it was even included in the book.  Also, the constant \\"sex scenes\\" are getting annoying.  It is starting to sound like some old perv who hasn't gotten any for a while.  Maybe if he did he could do a better job and get back to what made the first books so good.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought the blu-ray box set and immediately watched episodes 4 and 5.  About to watch 6.  Thought the picture and sound was amazing and thoroughly enjoyed the movies again.  Reminded me of seeing it in the theatre the first time when I was a kid.  Dont understand all the negative reviews, I think this set is awesome and I love these movies.  I am sure episodes 1, 2, and 3 will be great also.  I would recommend buying this if you love blu-ray and star wars.
B004222UC8|5.0|It is so easy to get caught up in a particular era of Sabbath, and kind of 'ignore' the rest. A couple of years ago I found that the easiest way to enjoy them was to appreciate the variety of different people and talent and style the band has delivered over the span of their career. Some of the best music ever made came from that 1st 8 year period with Ozzy at the helm as vocalist; but a lot of great music came from the band on every album released after Ozzy left!<br /><br />1987 was a very `difficult' year for Black Sabbath. Or, `Tony Sabbath', as critics were starting to call them. Right after starting into the \\"Seventh Star\\" tour, vocalist Glenn Hughes was fired, and Ray Gillen was brought in. Then they went into the studio to cut the new album, and Ray then split, leaving Tony Iommi no other option but to bring in Tony Martin and re-record the vocal tracks.<br /><br />Well, what we have here is a very mixed result. In some way this is possibly the best Black Sabbath record yet, but in some it's the weakest. This has a lot of newer elements in it, and has a lot of Sabbath fans split down the middle about whether it should have been called Sabbath or not. Personally, I have went back and forth about it myself over the years, but always come to the same conclusion: I am SO glad that Iommi kept the Sabbath name going!! Plus it is so cool to listen to all the great singers that he worked with in the confines of the Sabbath 'family' over the years.<br /><br />The songs on this are killer. Especially the title track, \\"The Shining\\", \\"Nightmare\\", \\"Ancient Warrior\\", and \\"Glory Ride\\". The acoustic \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" is amazing, and a great throwback to early Sabbath stuff like \\"Fluff\\" and \\"Laguna Sunrise\\". Sabbath always get stereotyped for being too 'hard'. I wish there would be a good compilation of all of their more lighter stuff released sometime. They are such a versatile group. The song \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" on this is simply divine. And songs like \\"Born To Lose\\" and \\"Lost Forever\\" rock faster and harder than anything they have ever recorded.<br /><br />The problem isn't the material. The problem is in very weak production. Yes, this sounds too clean and crisp, and, well, not as dark and moody like Sabbath are known for. If you are looking for something with the malevolent dark crunching sound like \\"Mob Rules\\" and \\"Born Again\\", then you will more than likely be disappointed here. But, if you are looking for something fresh and new (and harkening back to things like \\"Technical Ecstasy\\" and \\"Vol. 4\\"), then you are gonna love this one! Martin is heavily compared to the likes of Ronnie James Dio. While I do hear shades of that, I hear more of a comparison to Don Dokken here on this record. Live, he sounds so much like Dio it's almost scary!! But yet he has his own unique voice and style.<br /><br />If you like the Dio era outings, then you will more than likely like this one. It is a bit 'polished' though, but still delivers some of the finest music from that decade. The title track is like the sequel to their signature song, \\"Black Sabbath\\" in a lot of ways. The Tony Martin era is just as good if not better than any other era IMO, especially equal to that of the Ozzy era. Just 'different'.<br /><br />As I mentioned, there are some tracks on this that are as classic as things like \\"War Pigs\\" up through \\"Heaven & Hell\\". The title track here is possibly my all-time favorite Sabbath track ever. The band on this are some excellent musicians as well. Tony kept drummer Eric Singer, but also had Bev Bevan do a bit of percussion work too. Bassist Bob Daisley was brought in to do work in the studio, but no plans to tour with them.<br /><br />The tour this band put on was phenomenal! On the road, bassist Jo Burt and drummer Terry Chimes filled in for the MIA Daisley and Singer. Bottom line: This is a very highly recommended album from one of metal's best bands.<br /><br />And the copy of this with Ray Gillen, like me, could probably make youwant to shoot Iommi for erasing his vocal tracks! Gillen sounded like a young Robert Plant fused with a young Ronnie James Dio, yet had a unique style all his own. Plus the mix is so much better, more 'Sabbath' sounding than on the final 'cut' here. But over the past few years I have come to prefer the \\"official\\" Tony Martin version. It's sleek, hard-driving, mystical, and heavy!<br /><br />I have followed Sabbath 'religiously', owning everything they ever released, buying them as they were released, from their 1970 self-titled debut with Ozzy to their last studio release with Tony Martin in 95. Sabbath were kind of hard for some to follow, especially during the 80's. But, to me, it was well worth sticking by them through all the turmoil. I've been listening to the bootleg live cd's I have from this tour, and I am almost in the mind to say this was possibly the best year they had in a very long time. It's really great to have all their live stuff, especially rare stuff from the 'Tony Sabbath' years. This album was super! It's a bit 'polished' compared to a lot of other stuff from this band, but compared to other music that was happening at the time, well, this is so much superior to any of it. Be sure to check this one out because it is awesome!!<br />Thank you!! :>)<br /><br />PS: And may I suggest downloading the disc to your computer and rearanging the songlist in this order:<br />1. Born To Lose<br />2. The Shining<br />3. Eternal Idol<br />4. Glory Ride<br />5. Lost Forever<br />6. Nightmare<br />7. Scarlet Pimpernel<br />8. Hard Life To Love<br />9. Black Moon (demo)*<br />10.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|This series by SYFY is something I look forward too. Based off of Stephen King's \\"The Colorado Kid\\", it has a little of everything.  Mystery, romance, fantasy, action, comedy and a touch of horror.  It's more akin to a fantasy soap opera.  The lead actress, Emily Rose, who plays Audrey Parker FBI agent, has come to Haven to track down a fugitive who ends up murdered in this small town.  While she's there, weird occurances happen that lead her to believe the citizens of this town are hiding something.  Something they refer to as 'the troubles'.  She meets the sheriff's son, Nathan, who is 'troubled'.  He cannot feel anything, touch, pain etc. and he's assigned to help her with the case. The snappy dialog between these two is funny.<br /><br />During her time here, she meets several of the Haven's people who inform her that she looks just like this woman in a picture that was taken when the Colorado Kid was murdered.  Once she sees the newspaper clipping, she's shocked by seeing a woman identical to her, but with dark hair.  She never knew her parents, so immediately she wonders if this is a picture of her mother and at the end of the case, she decides to stick around to find out.<br /><br />Throughout season 1, Audrey Parker tackles new mysterious deaths with the help of Nathan.  She finds that she instinctively knows how to handle each case of \\"The Troubles\\" and Nathan finds out that the only thing he can feel is Audrey's touch.  Each episode fills in a little more information for Audrey's search into her past.  And she begins to find out who each of the others in the photograph who were there are also.<br /><br />At the end of the season, you know definitively who the woman in the picture is, which I was surprised at. Once that mystery was solved, what would keep her around town or how would we be kept in ongoing suspense when you found a new clue???  The last five minutes of season 1 answers the question of whether you'd be interested in a season 2. It was a \\"no sa!\\" moment.<br /><br />How could they be so cruel to end it while my mouth was hanging open in shock and not start Season 2 until the following summer.  I am very good at figuring out the answer to a lot of mysteries, but I never saw that ending coming. Only one other show, BBC's miniseries called \\"Jekyll\\" left me with the same feeling.<br /><br />Season 2 is almost wrapped up for the summer now and it keeps delivering.  I hate buying a Season 1 show cause it was so great, just to find out Season 2 was a total disappointment. (hint: Heroes) or it was abruptly cancelled. (too many to list)  So far I do not feel that way.they be so cruel to end it while my mouth was hanging open in shock and not start Season 2 until the following summer.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|Fly from Here really surprised me on its ability to gravitate from the Classic Yes sound that Yes fans have loved for decades and a more modern edginess.  The lyrics and imagery that resonates from the new CD is pure and thoroughly enjoyable.  Whether you're a long time fan or just a newer Yes fan, this CD is definitely worth a listen.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|So Star Wars has never been perfect, but that has always been what has made it special.  I wish George would spend less time changing the classics and make another trilogy based off Timothy Zahns books.      In the end it is exactly what you want, Star Wars in 1080p.  Great sound, great picture and all Star Wars.

B0058GYP5W|1.0|It's not often I find myself completely unable to finish listening to a film score due to me hating it so much, but that's what happened with Hanna - twice. A contemporary thriller directed by Joe Wright (who previously directed the Oscar-winning Atonement), Hanna stars Saoirse Ronan as the eponymous character, a 16-year old assassin who has been trained by her father (Eric Bana) to be a perfect, and totally unlikely, slaughter machine. When Hanna is dispatched to a remote part of Europe on a mission, the baby-faced killer finds herself having to fight for her own life when she is targeted for elimination by government operatives with a covert agenda of their own. The film also stars Cate Blanchett, Tom Hollander, Olivia Williams and Jason Flemyng, and has garnered generally positive reviews, not least for Ronan's star performance.    Before I launch into my appraisal of the score, let me make a few things absolutely clear. First, I am not a reviewer who only likes orchestral scores. All-electronic scores, when done with panache and expertise and creativity, entertain me as much as orchestral scores do, especially when the uniqueness of the electronic sound palette gives the film an extra edge. Secondly, I am not a reviewer who looks down on artists from the rock and pop world writing film scores. I own, and have enjoyed, scores by the likes of Daft Punk, Jonny Greenwood from Radiohead, Arcade Fire, Charlie Clouser from Nine Inch Nails, and several others, most of whom are much more well known for music other than film music. I have always said that I would love to hear what bands like Within Temptation, Evanescence or Rammstein would do if offered a film score. I'm all for giving everyone a chance.    Having said that, I found this score by The Chemical Brothers to be utterly intolerable. The Chemicals Brothers - Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons - were groundbreaking pioneers when they first emerged into the Manchester big beat electronic dance movement in England in the1990s, and so I absolutely acknowledge their fine musical pedigree in their chosen genre. Unfortunately, film music, with all its subtleties and nuances, seems to be completely beyond them. Hanna is a complete and utter mess, an incessant and dramatically incomprehensible set of dance music tunes that do nothing to illustrate the film's dramatic arc, offer no commentary on the story, or even provide much substance as a standalone listening experience.    The best cues of the entire score are the first and last ones, beginning with \\"Hanna's Theme\\", in which layered vocals sing a sweet, almost lullaby-ish motif over a minimalist, almost Philip Glass-style electronic pulse. It sets up Hanna's child-like nature and sweet demeanor, as well as her naïveté, despite her ruthlessness as an assassin, and has a good recapitulation in a breathy, almost orgasmic vocal version at the very end of the score. The second cue, \\"Escape 700\\", isn't too bad either - a more upbeat, driving electronic rhythm with wavering chords over the top and a throwback 1980s sound that has a cool nostalgic appeal. So far so good, you think. But then it all goes downhill.    Cues like \\"Chalice 1\\", \\"Map Sounds/Chalice 2\\" and \\"Isolated Howl\\" are little more than space invader-style sound effects tracks. \\"The Devil is in the Details\\" is simply bizarre, a calliope-inspired ditty which sounds like it should be accompanying a pre-school children's TV show like the Teletubbies. \\"The Forest\\" sounds like a minute or so of mutated, distorted whale song heard through a closed door. \\"The Sandman\\" sounds like a music box ballerina whose batteries are running low. The first minute of \\"Bahnhof Rumble' - which ostensibly is an action cue - sounds like raindrops combined with the sampled sound of a microwave hum, before eventually picking up a set of cymbals and a more strident beat towards the end of the cue. And so on and so forth...    \\"The Devil is in the Beats\\" revisits the Teletubbie theme from earlier in thescore, and overlays it with a harder and more pulsating beat, sampled vocals, and a sound which can only be described as someone doing unspeakable things to a Theremin. This theme appears again, in a very mutated form, towards the end of \\"Grimm's House\\". A couple of cues at the end - \\"Hanna vs. Marissa\\" and the nightclub-friendly \\"Escape Wavefold\\" - do raise the tempo somewhat with accelerated rhythmic elements and a more energetic attitude, but it's all too little to late, and even these pieces seem astonishingly simplistic in their construction, and of course they never miss an opportunity to layer in a grinding noise or an industrial sample akin to fingernails down a blackboard. The \\"Special Ops\\" cue, as well as the conclusive \\"Container Park\\", are especially nightmarish in this regard.    It was all I could do to muster the intestinal fortitude to listen to this soundtrack enough times to be able to form an opinion of the entire score. I don't enjoy writing reviews like this. I want each new score to be great, and to impress me. But Hanna was so jaw-droppingly awful and inappropriate, showed such little understanding of the narrative requirements of film music, and contained so many bizarre and wildly out of place samples that I had a burning desire to say something about it. I dare say that fans of the band, as well as admirers of hard electronica, will love it; I have read numerous reviews online about how bold and daring and original and fresh and uncompromising it is, each written by mainstream critics who look down on traditional film music like it was beneath them. To those people, I say this: I'm happy that you like it. Knock yourself out. But I won't be listening to this score ever again, and it's only because the opening \\"Hanna's Theme\\" is OK that it gets a single, solitary star.

B0041D843M|5.0|First things first, I have already been on a vegan diet for several years and I only just read this book. Because of this, I expected it to tell me exactly what I wanted to hear. Unsurprisingly, it did. The authors claim that animal protein can be linked to almost every single modern disease that plagues the most developed countries more than the less developed ones, which is a nice thing to read if you're already avoiding it. He specifically links casein (one of the two main milk proteins) to different types of cancer, and on top of that, osteoporosis, which is even nicer to read for me, seeing as how I used to be taught that milk was absolutely necessary to build good bones.     The kicker is, of course, that this book is full of references to scientific, peer-reviewed research. Now, I do enjoy reading paragraph on paragraph full of references - there are several cases where every sentence in a paragraph is followed by at least one superscripted reference, and some sentences by four or five of them. But that's not the point! These references enable us to validate everything the authors claim by looking up the referenced research, and making up our own minds. Even if you finish this book in utter disbelief, you still have a wealth of information to dig through. Maybe you're not interested in cutting out dairy or even meat, but at least you can make an informed decision. This is not a diet book, it doesn't push you either way, it just makes some very convincing points, and backs them up with research and cold, hard data. Make of that data what you will.
B000IHY9UW|1.0|Even with star power there is little to like about this film, at least for anyone with any interest in it from the perspective of a historic narrative.    The first time I saw it I was impressed at how well Kilmer did at emulating and looking like Morrison. His singing was even okay, in a way. His performances would have been passable even, if it had been a local college putting it on as a weekend theater event, but to suggest that Kilmer did a passable job at singing Morrison's parts is to admit one has either never listened much to the Doors, has a tin ear, or is already impartial to Kilmer.   The film would have been much better with Jim Morrison's own voice whenever possible, and much as I hate lip-synching, that's what Kilmer should have done.   I'm sure that it would be very hard to find any professional singers who would be impressed by the singing in this movie.    Any doubters may want to try a little experiment - watch some of the movie tracks, then put on the Doors and listen to how much more effective, natural and musical a singer Morrison was. Better yet, find one of the many available videos of Morrison onstage and see how amateurish the impressionism of Kilmer's performance looks.   Now just in case anyone thinks I have a bone to pick with Kilmer; I don't. I simply find the emulation of Morrison to be very poor for a movie with the kind of budget that a maker like Stone would have had available.    That said, I think Kilmer did a much better job on L.A. Woman than any of the other tracks, and wonder if it isn't at least partially because he was focused on the much more relaxed atmosphere of the track, rather than the weird side of Morrison he was instructed throughout to portray.    By all accounts Jim was a strange fellow in many ways, but also anything but one-dimensional, but with Oliver Stone being so one-dimensional himself, it's impossible for him to tell any story as a passive teller. He finds it impossible to stand on the sidelines and let usknow what happened. It's much more empowering for him to interject his values and agenda onto every story told, which is so much more disappointing because he tells so many important stories - always with his opinion/agenda as more important than history itself.    They say that fact is stranger than fiction - I also find fact to be more interesting than fiction.    When I read so many positive reviews of the movie itself and Kilmer's performance, it immediately reminds me of the Emperor and all the crowds exclaiming about his stylish new outfit. Maybe I'm only a child, because to me, the Emperor has no clothes.    Anyone who thinks Morrison was nothing but a sick weirdo might want to listen to the Doors a little further, and some evidence of the romantic in him is very easily unveiled by listening to such tracks as Touch Me, Love Her Madly, I Can't See Your Face, Indian Summer and Blue Sunday.   The incredibly up-beat and positive atmosphere of Land Ho! from Morrison Hotel is very often surprising to people not completely familiar with the Doors albums in general.     Now go check out some real Doors material!

B003ZSJ212|3.0|Lately, I've been taking the tact of renting any movies blu rays first before purchasing them for my collection.  More so for controversial product quality such as this package appears to profess.  UPDATE:  I watched Episode IV my feeling is image and enhancements such is brighter colors, sharper edges, animated models to what already exists is fine, but changing the sound effects, adding more stormtroopers, etc. is like colorizing a Black and White movie... call it like it is: STAR WARS enhanced or director's cut... lets cut out all those unnecessary changes that changes the storyline.  I'm not waiting for Blu Ray 3D.  Give your customers what they want now.
1584282584|4.0|The author states that this book is for professional wedding photographers.  But then he, and the person who wrote the Forward, made degrading remarks about them.  I guess they think that by putting others down they appear more wise, more professional, and more important.  Also, I found some parts of the book annoyingly written - as if written for children: \\"You have to do this\\". for example, along with some overly detailed walk-through lessons.<br /><br />As for the book being written for professional wedding photographers, consider this:  If you or I were going to hire a wedding photographer, we would expect to be shown examples of photographs that demonstrate his/her expertise.  Wedding photographers should already know everything taught in this book or they would rarely, if ever, be hired.<br /><br />All criticisms aside, I found the lessons informative and appropriate for amateur photographers.  I mean for those those amateurs who are going from available light only to include a single on camera flash unit.  The rules for single flash wedding photography, as the author states, do apply to general photography.  For them, this is a must read.  It is not about high level insider award winning photography.  It's about the basics of using a flash.  I learned a lot from it.
B0000024YL|1.0|I should read the 1 star reviews first, all of them point out the lousy recording quality. It is horrible distortion if you play it at the pure stereo.
B0053DA2CA|5.0|-> BLU RAY / Optimum release ONLY  Very fine print with original aspect ratio.   Saw this movie twice in theatres and now the BD looks even better, recommended to all fans of the film / Nicholas Roeg! (I'm not going to comment on the film itself, I guess it's the usual 'either-you-like-it-or-you-don't' a.k.a. 'take-it-or-leave-it' kind of thing...)   This is the original director's cut NOT the former US version (120', cut) released in theatres.

B004UFEJS0|5.0|My only complaint is that the rat doesn't get a girl rat at the end of the movie! I recently bumped into the actor who voiced him and asked him how he felt about that and he just chuckled...then frantically answered his cell phone. Oh well.    Gorgeous video, fantastic audio, great characters.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Wow that is amazing how bad of reviews that this set is getting. Ok yeah george lucas made a little changes here and there and yes it does suck that he altered the originals. The question is am i against it? Not really because the simple fact that half of the movies that hollywood has came out with are remakes of an original movie to update the movie with today's technology to attract young viewers or viewers that has never even seen the original bc it lacked the attraction of the movie on the shelf. While star wars original 70's movies added a little cgi and darth vader saying nooo didnt really ruin the movie for me. I still enjoyed these movie for what they are even if they have been altered a little bit. I am a star wars fan and i love the unaltered versions as well as the improved versions and i know im gonna have a lot of people get mad and tell me that im not a true fan but hey i said i was a fan not a obsessive freak. to the people that are pissed off about this set u go ahead and boycott this release its not gonna change lucas mind bc even himself said that he hated the originals and it is his jurisdiction to change what he wants to change because he is the creator of this wonderful movie. Like i said they have alot of remakes of the old horror or comedy movies and i dont see anybody bashing them yet unless they are just plain horrible
B0055S348W|5.0|During set up I could not find the driver for my printer, so I downloaded one that was close and it worked.
B004EPZ09S|4.0|This is truly an exceptional film.  First, as some frustrated reviewers pointed out who were expecting a faster-paced, cliched, Roland Emmerich type \\"end of the world\\" disaster flick, this is a relatively slow story about the deadly outbreak of an influenza virus that wipes out millions of people (much like the flu virus of 1918 that killed over 50-million people).  It's contains little of the hysteria and mass panic that normally characterizes the disaster genre film.  Instead, it presents a hyper-realistic version of an outbreak that is absolutely riveting precisely because it seems so likely and real.  I'd call CONTAGION nearly flawless with one major exception: A World Health Organization disease investigator sets off to Hong Kong to determine the origin of the disease.  While there, she works with a Chinese interpreter who has less than honorable intentions for her.  This track of the story seemed wholly unnecessary and was somewhat confusing.  It unfortunately cast a shadow over an otherwise near-perfect film.  But the distraction is not so bad that it significantly diminishes the impact of CONTAGION.  In fact, all the other elements of the story are so strong that I intend to see it again.  I'm sure there are things I missed in the first viewing that a second go-round will hopefully reveal.      Go see CONTAGION - if you're like the majority of moviegoers who have made it the number 1 film at the box office, you'll be thoroughly intrigued by the story.
B000002KHH|4.0|So often Led Zeppelin are credited with starting heavy metal but I never understood that. I love Zep but they do much more acoustical, melodic stuff than Sabbath ever did. Plus their riffs were never as dirty and heavy either. The first 3 BS albums, in my opinion, define the beginning of heavy metal. They may not have the same depth and punch as say Pantera but that would probably be due to technology constraints of the time. Paranoid and Masters of Reality are 2 of my favorite heavy albums. Sabbath deserve the Fathers of Heavy Metal title exclusively.
B0041KKYBK|5.0|I've read some 1 star reviews here that mention the movie doesn't blame the real criminals - the FED. But the movie does that, as it mentions both Greenspan and Bernanke as maintainers of the status quo and as people that did nothing when knowing full well about the problems. These two presidents of the FED are the most powerful people in the world, following orders of some very behind the scenes powerful and small groups of financiers.<br /><br />The real ones to blame here are the international bankers that have arms of their evil influence in all continents of the planet, perhaps with the exception of the Muslim countries that in their own weird way understand what those international bankers are all about, hence them being under constant war and attacks.<br /><br />This is a good movie if you want to understand the mechanics of what happened in this crisis. But the propaganda side of it has a little bit of left leaning, even though it mentions Obama at the end as another one that could not change anything, and appointed the same crooks to run the show behind the throne.<br /><br />The accountability part is where this movie lacks, because it fails to show how the grass roots movement in America is indeed fighting against this great evil that has installed itself in 90% of the countries of the planet. From now on, until elections in 2012, the Media will do everything in its powers to keep the status quo in the white house, being Obama or Romney. And the grass roots movement will have a great battle to fight. This movie helps, but it doesn't mention all sides of the story.
1451629184|5.0|Great book! I def recommend to those who are able to read horror stories, except this one is a true one. She's very graphic and almost feels like you're there watching her. This story is remarkable and Jaycee Dugard is a brave women!!! It reminds you how crazy some people are out there.
0802130208|5.0|I just finished reading this book. It is one of the best books I have ever read. Toole's prose is beautiful, but not showy. Toole is a masterful storyteller and its a shame that he died young. I can't recommend this book highly enough.
B0058ZPNOK|1.0|SPOILER ALERT~ Rented this one on Amazon Instant Video because of the strong cast. The description of this indie film as \\"a comedic, dark fairy tale\\" is the understatement of the year. T.J., the stoic boy in the film, has just lost his mother in a car crash and is bullied and abused while the four adult characters are too powerless or self-involved to notice. The father (Rainn Wilson) is paralyzed with grief and his only parenting skill is to send his son to his room. The loving grandmother is too old and ill to intercede. The psycho drifter Hesher (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) moves into the household and his volatile, obscene behavior serves to get T.J. in trouble with the law, who are also strangely blind to this child's plight. Natalie Portman's character, also burdened with a life of woe, makes a weak stab at intervention, but ends up betraying T.J. by sleeping with Hesher. At least she apologizes to this tough little kid for her bad behavior. I kind of felt like I deserved an apology for the two hours I wasted on this depressing mess.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener does as promised. It is small sturdy and adds a nice edge to a knife quickly and efficiently.  It is not as sharp as a hand sharpened blade on a fine stone but does the job quickly and is nice for a backpack especially.
B005HG4C4C|5.0|After spending almost a week with the album and about 15 or so front-to-back listens, I'm pleased to say that I love this album a great deal. It hopefully signals a rejuvenation for the band itself and also its fanbase. Even without founding drummer Mike Portnoy, the band's talent and spirit truly does carry on.      While I have been a serious fan of the band since Images and Words came out, mostly due to the fact that I was a budding guitarist at that age and John Petrucci proved to be my greatest inspiration to better myself as a player, in recent years I had found myself less and less into the direction the band was going. I knew I'd always be a fan, but I'd always felt the band sounded best with a 60 to 40 prog-to-metal ratio, and not the other way around, which was the way they had been heading aside from their '05 release, \\"Octavarium.\\"    The first things that come to mind when I think of why this album is superior to anything they've done in a long time deal with sound quality and are two things that deal very little with the songs themselves: the way the band members seem to be balanced with each other in the mix and also the manner in which the album was mixed and mastered.     Mike Portnoy's absence is incredibly noticeable, primarily because he had always such a prominent place in the band's mix. His sound had itself evolved since the band's earlier days, taking on a much deeper, harsh timbre than what he'd played on the band's first three classics, \\"Images and Words,\\" \\"Awake,\\" and \\"Metropolis Pt. 2.\\" New drummer Mike Mangini enters the DT fold with the lighter touch that Portnoy showed on those earlier albums, but allows himself to sit lower in the mix. This combined with Jordan Rudess' most tasteful keyboard work since joining the band being raised in the mix leads to all instruments getting an easier-to-hear presence in the band's sound, leading to much richer and fuller harmonic details coming out. This is also the band's best mixed and mastered album since \\"Metropolis Pt. 2\\", abandoning the louder-is-better trend that shamefully started with \\"Train of Thought.\\" Listening to this album, you'd never know the so-called loudness wars existed, as there is not a single hint of clipping or harsh sound texture to be heard. Yes, you have to turn the music up a bit louder to hear the subtleties, but it allows for much greater and more exciting musical dynamics. When the music is supposed to be soft, it is soft, and when the band builds for a crescendo, you can truly feel it. This is so breautiful to hear, because \\"Systematic Chaos\\" and \\"Black Clouds and Silver Linings\\" both had such horrible dynamic range that made them borderline unlistenable.    Much has been said already about the music, and for the most part it is excellent, if a bit overly inspired by easy-to-spot moments in the band's past, specifically key \\"Images and Words\\" songs. \\"On the Backs of Angels\\" seems to consciously reference \\"Pull Me Under,\\" \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" gives me a strong \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" vibe (specifically seems to share a mood space with \\"Burning My Soul\\"), \\"Lost Not Forgotten\\" seems to spirit of \\"Under A Glass Moon,\\" and \\"Outcry\\" plays out like a slower-tempo cousin of \\"Metropolis Pt. 1\\".     This is not a negative thing, though. I've been anticipating a true return to DT's earlier sounds, of course with fresh ideas. The band almost got there. I still consider this release a 5-star album, though, because of what an achievement it was to survive the departure of one of its founding members while reinvigorating their sound with a combination of classic characteristics and fresh songwriting. There's a whole lot of musical pyrotechnics going on, but all of it serves the song and little of it is pointless noodling.     The album's instrumental highlights have purpose, and the band takes itself just seriously enough to come across less corny and more sincere than in its recent past. Most of all, though, on \\"A Dramatic Turn of Events\\" the band seems to play with recently-absent heart and soul again, evidenced on moments such as Petrucci's pitch-perfect solo in \\"Breaking All Illusions.\\" I know as a budding young guitar player that would have left me in awe. I hope a lot of young guitar players are listening to DT now, because they're back in the game for real.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|You know that point in a school paper where the student stops caring so much about the quality of the paper and just wants to fill the pages to get it finished? That's what many parts of The Hunger Games felt like to me. I was continually surprised and disappointed how little detail and description was given to important events and characters. I downloaded the Kindle sample chapters of the second book but really don't have much desire to read it.
B0034G4P80|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, bringing a Norse Thunder God (and Marvel Comic hero) to the big screen might  be just  a little chancy. Fortunately, Director Kenneth Branagh, veteran Shakespearean and TV/movie actor, embraces the epic quality of the hero and the story and runs with it. The result is an entertaining and eye-pleasing movie with just the right amounts of humor and gravitas, that moves easily between the otherworldly realm of Asgard and a dusty New Mexico town.<br /><br />As the story opens, the arrogant young warrior Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is banished from Asgard by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), for restarting a war with the feared Frost Giants. Ambitious trickster brother Loki (Tom Hiddleston) is left behind to scheme for the throne.<br /><br />Thor, stripped of his godly powers, plummets to Earth and promptly collides (literally) with a group of off-beat astro-physicists led by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and Dr. Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). The movie milks some good humor from the resulting fish-out-of-water scenario without overdoing it. Thor is meant to learn some humility and wisdom; the path to worthiness will run through an action-filled encounter with S.H.I.E.L.D., a drunken mentoring session with Dr. Selvig, a delicate relationship with Jane, and a dramatic showdown with a monster sent to earth by Loki.<br /><br />&#34;Thor&#34; is highly recommended to Marvel Comic fans as a good adaptation of the Thor character to the screen, and as another entertaining step on the road to 2012's much-awaited Avenger movie.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I really wanted to like this app, but I have yet to find a sound that doesn't have a noticeable pause when it loops.  I'll keep experimenting with multiple layers but so far I haven't found a combination that will mask the loop pause.  Add'l comment: I have since found out that the problem is a Motorola bug that they have no immediate plans to fix. :(   5 stars to Sleepy Time for a great app... 1 star to Motorola for ignoring a known bug.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|From the very start of this movie to the tragic ending; this movie will keep you on your seat itching for wanting to know what happens next to the trio of our heroes: Ron, Hermonie and most of all Harry. I must say to all the filmmakers and actors of this movie franchise even though its at an end with the second part out now at least i m gonna own it all from year one all the way up to year seven its been fun watching those three grow up and learn more each year it ll be sad to see them go but knowing them all those years was quite a great treat.
1594484805|3.0|Pink presents a simplistic view of what he calls Motivation 2.0, a system primarily reliant on rewards and punishments and then moved on to describe why this system is no longer compatible with contemporary society in most situations.  He then moves on to a presentation his idea of a newer, more intangible system of motivation called Motivation 3.0.  The idea is very compelling and flows well especially if you have knowledge of traditional economic principles as well as the challenges that behavioral economists are making to these principles.      He then goes on to identify the elements that he believes to be most important to this new system of Motivation.  He cites numerous well known studies as well as some lesser known ones to make his point.  These are elements are presented logically, however I felt like they could have used a little more fleshing out.  He presents the information in a Gladwellian manner, so that those without much knowledge of economics and psychology can understand.  For someone who has prior knowledge of some of these things the presentation may seem a little too simplistic.  It left me wanting more information about some of the claims he made and a couple times I put the book down to do some further research on my own.      The third section of the book, presented as a \\"toolkit\\" on how to apply his Motivation 3.0 to your life is the section I had the most trouble with.  It takes up over one-third of the text and to me it felt like a simplified regurgitation of what had already been covered.  I think this section was a little overdone and would instead have liked to see the previous two sections fleshed out a bit and had him let the reader apply what they have learned to their lives in their own way, rather than have it spoon fed.      Overall the book was an interesting and quick read, however it always left me wanting to find out more about the underlying principles.  One third of the book is merely the same material presented and wouldrather have had the first two sections fleshed out and be able to develop my own plans and ideas about what I learned.
0385534639|1.0|Book editors are such tricksy hobbitses...    They're constantly telling authors to 'hook' the reader in the first fifty words or so.  I was seduced into buying this book by reading an excerpt, as the words are so lush and descriptive and set a delicious mood.  After that, however, the book is a thudding bore.    It suffers mainly from a lack of characters, which are somewhat central to that wonderful thing called a \\"plot.\\"  The characters were so thinly drawn, made up of only sparse conversations and even sparer descriptions, that I didn't care whether they were killed with a well-aimed dagger.  In fact, I wanted to do it myself.
B002BB702M|5.0|My wife and I watch this unbelievably beautiful movie about once a year, and then listen to the music theme for days afterwards! It's wonderful.<br /><br />Is it wonderful because we can relate to it? That's just one of its qualities. Or is it wonderful because it touches the heart on many different levels? Just the right amount of suspense, great characters, wonderful acting, and a movie about life choices. One never tires of watching it.<br /><br />How lucky we are!<br /><br />Taos Guy<br />2011

It's funny, fun, and a great escape (not to mention a wonderful love story, whether either of them wants it to be or not!). Nathan Fillion and Stana (can't remember the last name or how to spell it) are absolute magic together ... again, whether they want to be or not! And \\"Beckett's\\" detectives are wonderful fun! \\"Castle's\\" daughter and mom rock! My ONLY let-down is the captain ... watch Season Three and find out why. Watch them ALL! You won't regret it.

0385737955|2.0|I bought this book from an amazon recommendation because I like Psalms of Herod, Sword of Mary and the Hunger Games trilogy.  However, those books had something that this book lacked.  They had meat, emotions as well as action.  This read like the love child of the Hunger Games and Lord of the Flies without the depth.  The plot is simple - Thomas wakes up with no memories except how to speak and basicaly get along.  The little commune where he wakes up has a Maze that must be solved in order for the Thomas and the other boys to escape thier idyllic life.  But the emotions get lost, the depth that should be there is forgotten in exchange for gross outs and rote action.  For those looking for a dystopian fiction, there are so many other options ... This should be way down on your list.  I will not be reading the sequels.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Sorry, haters, but I'm loving this puchase.  I picked up this set yesterday and am thoroughly happy with my decision.  The sound and video are absolutely amazing.  To say that you have the DVD version and that's good enough is just your way of rationalizing your non-purchase.  These transfers look better than the theaters.  Seeing and hearing these blu-ray versions, I felt like I was seeing more detail than ever before.  You really get to see all the extreme detail that the model-makers and CGI artists put into their craft.    Should Lucas have added the \\"Noooo\\" to Jedi?  No.  Should he have made Greedo shoot first?  Absolutely not.  Should he have added CGI to the original movies?  Sure!  I like how it makes the movies come alive even more.    I'm not blind or dumb.  While I don't agree with everything Lucas has done, I realize that those 3 minutes of changes in no way affect my overall enjoyment of a 14 hour cinematic adventure.  I love Star Wars.  And now, I have all 6 of the movies in the most superb video and audio available today.  You should buy it, too.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|If you're a fan of this series, it certainly doesn't disappoint. I will say, however, that the gratuitous sex scenes were a bit much at times. The thought, \\"Enough already\\" crossed my mind for sure. But, over all, being someone who thoroughly enjoys anything taking place in ancient times, the action packed fight scenes and the way you come to care about some of the characters was very enjoyable from beginning to end. The only thing that detracted was the bitter and sad knowledge that Andy Whitfield is no longer with us. A traggic loss indeed.
B0057XSCJG|1.0|THIS BEEPIN MOVIE WAS THE MOST BEEPIN MOVIE IN THE BEEPIN WORLD!  THIS WAS TOTALLY NOT WHAT I WAS BEEPIN EXPECTING!  TO DARK!  AND IT WAS FULL  PLOT HOLES!  REMINDED ME TO MUCH OF BEAUTY AND THE BEAST BUT TO STINKING MODERN!
B004Y1USV2|1.0|I just feel that this album is missing something without Jon Anderson.  Some people will disagree with me; but that is honestly how I feel.  It is like having Led Zepplin without Robert Plant... which is rather ludicrous.  It would be great if Rick Wakeman could be back also.
0553801473|5.0|I think to enjoy this book you must understand the complexity of human nature and the cut throat world of politics.  This is for people who do not need every plot point explained.  Finally a fantasy book for those of us with intellect. Thank you George Martin!!

The copy option doesn't seem to be copying the book name correctly, they all show up as &quot;Genesis:&quot; and not the book I'm reading. Also, scrolling can be a hassle since one tap makes a highlight show up, but past those two issues, good job bible-ing.

0439023521|5.0|I had a nagging feeling that I'm too old to be reading a novel where a teenager is the protagonist, but boy was I wrong. It is completely engrossing, and it has all of the qualities of a great story: suspense, interesting characters, intriguing plot. I highly recommend this story to everyone- you won't be sorry and you'll have a hard time putting it down.  I now am interested in reading some of the stories that may have inspired this book, such as Battle Royale.

B005HG4C4C|5.0|So far I've listened to the album maybe half a dozen times. I can tell already, that it is far superior to the previous two efforts of the band. While I don't think it's quite up to the level of the band's best albums (but then again, those are pretty high standards we're talking about!), it's definitely a very very big step up. I don't think there's a single song on this album that I don't enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne Collins has one heck of an imagination. I was genuinely surprised and never thought I would be able to get past the idea of children being used as pawns, but I had to know what all the hype was about and I am glad that I did. The author is brilliant. However, be warned parents: this book can get very brutal and violent. I would recommend this book for older teenagers and up.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|This is a review of the entire collection of Star Wars films in the Blu-Ray format. This release features even more changes and updates to the films than the previous 1997 Special Edition of the first trilogy contained. The prequel trilogy also received some changes, more so than their initial DVD releases.  I grew up with these films when they were initially released in the late 70's and early 80's, and I collected many of the toy figures and spaceships when they were available. I also went to see the \\"Special Editions\\" of the original trilogy on each of their premiere nights when they were released in theaters back in 1997.   On to the review of the Blu-Ray box-set itself.  The equipment I used to view the discs consisted of a Sony HDTV, a Sony 3D Blu-Ray player and a Sony Home Theater with 6.1 Surround Sound.  Following are my reviews of all the Star Wars films in this release.  This also includes updates/changes that I spotted while watching them.  Episode I looks much better than the 2001 DVD release of the film.  Colors look excellent, the scenery is much more vibrant and realistic and the DTS-HD 6.1 sound (particularly the music, laser battles and lightsaber duels) just explodes with furor across all the speakers in my home theater.  Even Jar-Jar and the rest of the Gungans looked much better than the previous 2001 DVD release.  Darth Maul also looks meaner and much more sinister.  Episode II features improvements on the scenery shown on Naboo and Tatooine and looks much better and brighter.  The sound is also much better and clearer than the previous 2002 DVD release.  Yoda also looked better and more realistic.  An edited change was also done during Anakin's nightmare.  Episode III looks amazing.  The scenery looks much better than the previous 2005 DVD release with sharper details.  The battles and lightsaber duels look and sound much better with sharper detail.  Mustafar in particular has a much improved look.  Episode IV looks incredible, especially considering its age at 35 years old.  New details are now much more visible, from updates on the appearance of the Death Star to the ship chase in the film's opening.  Darth Vader's costume looks much better and the very familiar breathing sound is much clearer plus the updated scenery look a lot better and is much more defined.    Speaking of sound, the multiple crunches of the soldier's neck when he's being strangled by Darth Vader now sound so much more realistic with the crunches of bone being much improved.  All in all, a great update of a great film.  Episode V now looks better than ever.  Some much needed touch-ups to many of the scenes in Cloud City have been done and they all look much better now.  As was the case with Episode IV, the spaceships have a much more life-like appearance now.  Also, Hoth has a much better appearance and the ground battle has been improved with more snowspeeders headed for eventual impacts on the ground when shot.    The same can be said for Dagobah with the planet and scenery receiving a much-needed improvement.  It all looks much more realistic now.  As was the case with Episode IV, I think this was a great update of a great film.  The updates and restoration were badly needed and came out looking and sounding very sharp.  Episode VI also looks better.  The spaceships were again touched up and look much more realistic now.  The scenery has also been improved upon as well as the lasers and lightsabers with both looking much better than I have ever seen.  Other changes that were noteworthy were the eyes on the Ewoks blinking and the much-discussed \\"Noooo\\" that Darth Vader says while Luke is being electrocuted by Emperor Palpatine. I liked both changes, especially the eye-blinking on the Ewoks.  However, I noticed that some areas were missed where I thought a blink was warranted.  Perhaps they'll fix those spots in a future release of the film.  Again, this was a great restoration of this film that's closing in on being nearly 30 years old.  The changes and improvements made it much better.  Three bonus discs are included with this boxset.  They include deleted scenes, interviews and behind-the-scenes documentaries, some of which date back to 1977.  All were interesting to watch.  So why am I deducting one star?  The problems I have with this set are the lack of artwork on the discs and the way the discs are held in the binders themselves.    I would have liked to have the discs featuring some artwork on them as was the case with the previous DVD releases of the films.  In this set, the discs are plain with no artwork on them.  It's also worth noting that the way the discs are held make it very difficult for someone with arthritis in their hands to get the discs out of the package for viewing.  I would have liked to have them on trays or perhaps in individual Blu-Ray cases in a cardboard box much like how the 2004 DVD release of the original trilogy was packaged.  In spite of the physical problems I have with retrieving the Blu-Ray discs out of the box-set, I have no hesitation in recommending it as a marvelous upgrade from the previous DVD releases of the Star Wars films.  I personally prefer the updated versions of all the films, be it the prequel trilogy or the original trilogy that I grew up with. To me, these updates are vastly more entertaining than the original versions of the film and give a much better glimpse of the fascinating Star Wars universe that I have enjoyed since first seeing Star Wars in the movie theater back in 1977.
4770031246|5.0|I've been using a Laptop Lunchbox for years for portion control, but wasn't really doing Bento, exactly. I found the Just Bento blog, and decided to get the cookbook, which was a great decision. I love the complete bento chapters, with all the variations, and the explanations about techniques and ingredients that aren't necessarily obvious to a western cook. The not-Japanese section is helpful, as well--gives me so many ideas for lunches using ingredients I already have on hand.    There are so many great suggestions, and I've mixed leftovers with bento recipes for a really great lunch.    I love the timeline--one of my big excuses for not doing my own lunch is that it will take too long, but if I have all the ingredients ready, it's really only about 20 minutes, and I have plenty of time for that in the morning. I got great ideas for small containers, and how to use veggies to divide the dishes, if I want to use my big Ikea container. I'm driving my family crazy with photos of my lunches--they're so cute! but a couple of people are now interested in packing healthy lunches for work.    Maki is down to earth, and the book is well-organized and easy to follow. Love it and am using it constantly.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|i spent every spare moment i had these past two days finishing this book.  it was so good!  i was so engrossed with these characters that i found my emotions going right along with them.  it was a very very romantic book,  so completely swoonworthy.  ana and christians story is something that will stick with you even when not engrossed in the story.  i cant wait to see where book 3 leads them to,  hopefully 50 shades of happily ever after!
1933952806|5.0|This is my second paperback purchase from author Darrell Young.  The first was for the D700 and now the D7000.  Had it not been for the superb first I would not have purchased his latest book on the D7000.  His comprehensive writings are outstanding and if you own the D7000 you need this book but not the kindle version.  Buy the paperback which has no limitations in content, have your camera in front of you, read this book and become a \\"master\\" of your D7000.  I simply echo the five star reviews of all who have posted before me and don't really see the need to duplicate what has already been stated so very well.   Mastering the D7000 is a well written, carefully thought out, concise and logically presented \\"master piece\\".    Also, if you wish to join nikonians.org you can receive a 50% Gold member discount as a benefit of buying this book.  Nikonians.org is a wonderful community of Nikon shooters.    Excellent price and service as usual from Amazon  [...]  Doug  San Leandro, CA
0316098337|3.0|I kept wishing I could hear the mother's point of view, and later, the grandmother's or even grandfather's. It got tedious always being subjected to Jack's point of view. After a while, it did not ring true and felt too one-sided. Like some other reviewers, I also thought the book went downhill after the middle. In the beginning, I found the premise so awful (the thought of being imprisoned in a room with your five-year-old, kept there by a sexual predator), that I could not read it before retiring to bed. That is good writing. It was very evocative of the situation these two were in. But then I learned that they escaped, so I continued reading, and found myself less and less interested in the 5-year-old's perspective.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Horrible changes.  If you want the original trilogy you are not getting it with this set!  Send a message by not purchasing this set!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|OMG my favorite movie that I just had to have while I am deployed!! I love the quality of the this DVD. It was received prior to the estimated delivery date.. I LOVE KYmANI Marley <3
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|The 3D video is very good, but the real winner here is the 3D sound stage presented by the DTS-Master HD 7.1 soundtrack.  Thor's mighty hammer \\"flies\\" around the room.  Four discrete rear channels.. Amazing.
B000PMG16U|2.0|A CGI Yoda in the Phantom Menace??  The last performance by Frank Oz performing Yoda as a puppet has been chopped out of the film and replaced with the over articulate CGI Yoda.  I can't believe it.  It is very upsetting to see this happen.  The product itself is well packaged with a slim case and easy navigation menus.  The special features are lacking, just commentary.  If you want special features buy the complete set on Blu Ray.  I'm disappointed, however that is all the Star Wars franchise has been doing to me for years now.  Lame. 2 Stars, only because I like the dvd packaging and menus.
