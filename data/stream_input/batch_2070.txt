B008B92U32|5.0|First off, immediately tap the info button after you open this App. You need to understand the basics of the program before you begin working with it. If you want to go a step further, there is a 4:38 min long video that can be accessed in the \\"images and videos\\" box to the left of the App's price. This video will greatly help you sharpen your abilities with this App.<br /><br />In my Kindle's gallery, I had a group shot of my wife, my daughter and me.  The program automatically detected our faces and tried to frame them. I pressed the \\"swap\\" button right away just to immediately get an idea of what modified photos look like.<br /><br />If you want to tinker with your photo, you have the ability to stretch, compress, \\"mirror,\\" and reposition the faces to create the best frame. After you're satisfied, press \\"swap\\" and you will be rewarded with an amusing and personally customed group photo.<br /><br />It's easy to get frustrated with the framing controls (they are very sensitive). Just be patient and you will eventually get the hang of it.<br /><br />One problem with this App is that it can't contend with dramatic differences in skin color.  If someone is very tan (my wife and daughter) versus very pale (me), the swap is going to be more obvious (but likely much more funny).<br /><br />When you are finished adjusting the photo to your final product, you can save it to your gallery.  The App gives a large variety of sharing options to transmit images from your device (Pintrest, regular e-mail, etc.).<br /><br />I used a Kindle Fire HD to try this out.  It worked well with this device.  I'm wondering how well it will work on a device with a smaller screen.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this App.  It will give you a few good laughs and you can send the grandparents something a bit more interesting than a plain, boring family portrait.

B0070Y46UY|4.0|A delightful tight storyline.<br />Starts off a little skittish jumping around as it develops the background and nearly loses you.  Bear with it and it all comes together and then solidifies into a masterful tale with excellent imaginery which is easy to image as you read.<br />You even get to choose which of the two &#34;stories&#34; your prefer for your ending.<br />Only missed a five as I'm not a fan of too many small chapters.

B009E9QOEO|5.0|I grew up watching Led Zeppelin perform in the Song Remains the Same at the midnight movies every weekend. I have dozens of their bootleg concerts, and all their official releases, and have listened to them thousands of times or more.<br /><br />I had not bought this album until now, because I have seen them in Live Aid (1985) and some of their other one-shot appearances, and I did not expect much.<br /><br />However, I can honestly say that I was blown away. These guys still have it, and they sound great. I could notice the differences in drumming between John Bonham, and his son, Jason, and that was good. It was fun to be able to notice how this band has changed, 27 years after they ended due to John Bonham's tragic death.<br /><br />There is nothing that I can say bad about this album. Whole Lotta Love, Dazed and Confused, In My Time of Dying, Kashmir, and No Quarter are incredible anthems that transcend time. For Your Life, Achille's Last Stand, and the rest of the songs sound fresh, slightly different, slightly improved in some ways, still crushing the Hammer of the Gods!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Its a great book, ex military as well as none milirtary will like it, because he tells it like it is, no a watered down government version

B00005TQKQ|5.0|I hadn't used my Sony camcorder for over a year and wanted to view some cassettes from a trip. The playbacks of these videos were horrible..broken speech and very unclear images. The camcorder had been kept in a case, so I couldn't figure out how the heads might have gotten dirty, but they had. I ordered this head cleaner, followed the instructions and ran the cleaner for the recommended length of time and voila..camcorder was good as new!

B009329ZF2|1.0|The aliens were too anthropomorphized to take seriously, in addition to the massive suspension-of-disbelief conflict about arbitrarily choosing between whom to attack and whom to leave alone. I don't have anything positive to say about this movie, so I'll end this review here.
1419702963|5.0|My son was very happy to get this book.  As long as he doesn't start acting like Greg I am glad he is reading.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|After seeing  a dvd of the film ,I was very disappointed. What went wrong? The acting was  superb as expected.The music  memorable, but I failed to get involved  with the  show which was over-long and bordering on the tedious in places.Almost the entire  film looked like the camera's lens was covered with a dark filter.Why? The rapid editing  really annoyed me. It seems to be the trend today but  in this film they went overboard. There seemed ,for the most part,a new camera angle every 3 seconds or less.I got  dizzy from the rapid  editing. You need to at least  look at a scene without  changing to another  in  a couple of seconds.It ruined the film for me. The opening  scene was  spectacular  but I thought it was totally over the top.There was no need to go back in time for the finale  as  many of the characters seen  were already dead.Filmed versions of musicals used to be superior to the stage shows but in this case the stage show  had a greater impact on me and was unforgettable.If you can get a copy of the  stage show then watch it and compare the difference.The film version was indeed Les Miserables.
0792844793|5.0|I like the Movie. Shipped to me in a timely manner and quality was great. Some times people call me Frank when I get upset.. Frank Nolte... Brute force. That is what its all about.

1439102813|5.0|My mother-in-law recommended that I pick Still Alice for my book club and I must say that I'm happy I listened to her recommendation. I learned so much about Alzheimer's disease and ways you can find out if you have the gene before showing any symptoms. To be clear for anyone thinking about reading this book, Still Alice is a story about an educated, highly respected woman who works as a professor at Harvard University. She begins to forget things that she contributes to the start of menopause. The story is told through the mindset of Alice, which I really liked because it allows the reader the chance to see what it's really like for someone living with this disease. For instance, as Alice forgets things that she would normally remember or repeats herself in a conversation, the story is depicted in this way as well. The characters that the author Lisa Genova added to this story helped to make this a page turner and an informative read. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to read a good book.<br />Ayesha L. Shoulders, author of When it's Time to Walk Away
0307454568|5.0|This book could not be put down and has been finished already!  Thank you for having this book in stock!
B004X75RK4|4.0|I have watched this movie sevral times and I laugh out loud every time I watch it. Sandra and Ryan are great together, The cast of this movie is outstanding I love watching Mary Steenbergen, Craig T. Nelsom and Betty White. If you enjoy well directed, good story line and fine acting you'll enjoy this movie. I get so tired of all the gory filled R rated movies these days.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you haven't seen all of Season 3 and the 2012 Christmas special, called &quot;A Journey to the Highlands&quot;, you probably don't want spoilers. I am going to give a synopsis of the Special Features, and that's difficult without giving some facts away as to season 3. Two important characters die in two different places on this 3-disc set (I won't say who, but the actor playing the one that dies during the Christmas Special wanted to leave the show). But having tragedy amidst the joy is what makes &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; a really really great show. I have a couple people hooked on &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; who have never watched &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; before!<br /><br />This Season 3 DVD set contains three discs. It DOES have the 2012 Christmas Special. I have received my DVD set, ordered on this page, and it has parts 1 - 9 of Season 3, plus &quot;A Journey to the Highlands&quot; and 8 Special Features.<br /><br />DISC 1:<br />Disc 1 has parts 1, 2, and 3 of Season 3 and 1 extra. English subtitles are available.<br />Special Features:<br />1. &quot;Behind the Drama&quot; (60 minutes) This is an fabulous overview of the first two seasons, with clips from the two seasons, interviews and rehearsal scenes. What I particularly liked is that it's not just a rehash of the plot lines, it includes why a plot line or character development was important or undertaken. Per the narrator, before WWI, there were 1.4 million people &quot;in service&quot; in England. Highclere Castle, &quot;with more than 50 bedrooms, there was plenty to do.&quot; And plenty of rules, and the hierarchy below stairs was even stricter than above stairs.<br />When a scene takes place upstairs, they are really filmed at Highclere Castle. When below stairs, though, they were filmed on sets at Ealing Studios. That's because though the magnificent upstairs is much the same (except for bathrooms!) now as it was before WWI, the kitchens and downstairs have been modernized.<br />Remember the scene where &quot;The Turk&quot; enters Lady Mary's bedroom and she says, &quot;You and my parents have something in common. You think I am much more of a rebel than I am.&quot; (Which is pretty humorous in itself, given that Mary is most tradition-hide-bound of the sisters.) Julian Fellowes tells us that the whole dead Turkish lover is based on a true story. A friend of his, who owns a Big House, &quot;came upon a diary of one of his great-aunts, and this whole incident is recorded&quot;.<br />The commentators also touch on the Spanish Flu epidemic, which may have killed up to 50,000,000 people world wide. Most flus are most lethal to the very young and the elderly. I've read that the Spanish Flu, however, was most lethal to healthy adults. It made your immune system go wild, attacking your body as well as the virus. So the healthier your immune system was, the more likely it was going to kill you.<br /><br />DISC 2:<br />Disc 2 has parts 4. 5. 6. and 7 of Season 3. English subtitles are available. There are no special features on this disc.<br /><br />DISC 3:<br />Disc 3 has parts 8 &amp; 9 of Season 3, as well as &quot;A Journey to the Highlands&quot; (the 2012 Christmas special) and 7 Special Features. English subtitles are available.<br />Special Features:<br />1. &quot;Downton in 1920&quot; (20 minutes) Commentators include Julian Fellowes (writer and creator), Brian Percival (director, episodes 1 &amp; 2), Magi Vaughan (make up &amp; hair designer), Caroline McCall (costume designer), Charmain Adams (production designer), Elizabeth McGovern (plays Cora, Countess of Grantham), Michelle Dockery (plays Lady Mary), Laura Carmichael (plays Lady Edith), Alastair Bruce (historical advisor), Jim Carter (plays Mr. Carson the butler), Lesley Nichol (plays Mrs. Patmore, the cook), Jessica Brown Finlay (plays Lady Sybil), Sophie McShera (plays Daisy Mason, cook assistant), Allen Leech (plays Tom Branson, the chauffeur), Brendan Coyle (plays John Bates), Gareth Neame (executive producer), Shirley MacLaine (plays Martha Levinson, Cora's American mother), Dan Stevens (plays Matthew Crawley), and Pete Gaine (from Motorhouse Hire Ltd, who supplied Matthew's marvelous 1920 car).<br />In Season 3, it's 1920. When we think 1920, we think &quot;The Roaring Twenties&quot;. But, as Caroline McCall points out, &quot;I think people's perception of the 20's is very different from 1920.&quot;  Julian Fellowes points out that the Charleston dance craze didn't happen until 1926. The hair and costume designers had to show fashions changing gradually, because it's not as if everyone started dressing like flappers in 1920.<br />The rigid laced-up corsets of before the war, give way to bandeau corsets and breast-flattening bras. Even the men show subtle changes in their suit jackets, etc. Except for Mr. Carson, of course, who continues to wear exactly the same suit he always has.<br />It wasn't just clothing that was changing. As Alastair Bruce says, &quot;We see this great imperial family gradually alter, as moral conscience takes us on a different path.&quot; Very much the way the Imperial British Empire was altering.<br />2. &quot;The Wedding of Lady Mary&quot; (18 minutes) Commentators include many from extra #1, with new ones: Victoria Brooks (head of publicity for &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;), Liz Turbridge (producer), Matthew 'Sparky' Ellis (location manager), Charmain Adams (production designer), Maggie Harris (resident of Bampton, where the wedding was filmed), Rev. David Lloyd (Vicar of Bampton), Timothy Word (crowd assistant director), Danielle Bennett (second assistant director), Rupert Steggle (crowd costume assistant), Hugh Bonneville (plays Robert, Lord Grantham), Rob James-Collier (plays Thomas Barrow, footman and troublemaker), Chris Croucher (first assistant director), Stephen Sorby (from Above the Line Security) and Joanne Froggatt (plays Anna Bates).<br />Victoria Brooks says, &quot;It's almost the next royal wedding, dare we say it!&quot; There were 209 total crew &amp; cast, including the extras, and the paparazzi was wild to get a photo of &quot;Mary&quot; in her wedding dress.<br />3. &quot;The Wedding of Lady Edith&quot; (25 minutes) Commentators include many who also appear in the first 2 extras, as well as Robert Bathurst (plays Sir Anthony Strallan), Denis Maguire (supporting artist, plays the photographer at the church), David Holt (special effects technician) and Damian Butlin (standby propman).<br />Poor Edith - how many of us think that? Julian Fellowes says, &quot;Her self-rebuilding will become another part of the story.... The subliminal message, I think, is we must get behind the wheels of our own lives.&quot;<br />We should take a poll. Did Sir Anthony act out of misguided honor or is he just a jerk? And if we don't think he's a jerk, how about Lord Robert's part in this?<br />4. &quot;The Men of Downton Abbey&quot; (12 minutes) Commentators appear in the first 3 specials. This focuses on how WWI was the changemaker, whether you were above stairs or below stairs. Hugh Bonneville says, &quot;After the turmoil of the war, Robert thinks, in a way, that life will return to the way it was before the way. And, of course, it never will.&quot;<br />Alastair Bruce adds, &quot;People have survived something [in WWI], and they are never going to forget what they've gone through.... It changes their view of what they expect from the world.&quot;<br />5. &quot;Shirley MacLaine at Downton&quot; (16 minutes) MacLaine hadn't been watching &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; herself, but she had friends who were addicts. It's a sign of how good the show is that it could get a Shirley MacLaine to be in it. Sophie McShera groans, &quot;I didn't get to meet Shirley MacLaine and I'm so jealous.&quot;<br />Rob James-Collier is excited just talking about the meeting of Shirley Maclaine and Dame Maggie Smith on the show. &quot;They are going to be epic, they really are. Two actual legends on screen, battling it out. The only thing I can liken it to is DeNiro vs Pacino in &quot;Heat&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Heat&quot; is an American 1995 movie.)<br />6. &quot;Behind the Scenes: The Cricket Match&quot; (10 minutes) Many commentators appear before. New ones are Eddie Williams (3rd assistant director), Adam Ghillam (camera operator), Kevin Doyle (plays Molesley, the butler for Mrs. Crawley, Matthew's mother), Ed Speleers (plays Jimmy Kent, new footman), Cora Theobold (plays Ivy Stuart, new kitchen maid), David Evans (director episodes 7 &amp; 8) and Matt Milne (plays Alfred Nugent, footman).<br />The match took three days to shoot. Mr. Carson takes part, and Jim Carter says, &quot;It's lovely for Carson to be out in his cricket gear. First time in three years I've had a change of clothes.&quot; Only one cast member taking part in the match actually knew how to play cricket. Thanks to stand-ins and clever camera work, you wouldn't know it.<br />7. &quot;Behind the Scenes: A Journey to the Highlands&quot; Many familiar commentators, with these new ones: Lily James (plays Lady Rose MacClare), Andy Goddard (director for this episode) and Diana Scrivener (choreographer). For this 2012 Christmas special, cast and crew traveled, for filming, to Inveraray Castle, Scotland, seat of the real Duke of Argyll. Incredibly beautiful scenery, but everybody complains about the outdoor scenes where they were attacked by hordes of midges.<br />For the show, Inveraray stands in for Duneagle Castle, home of Sir Robert's cousin, Hugh 'Shrimpy' MacClare. His 18 year-old daughter, Rose, will, according to Julian Fellowes become a prominent character going forward. The staff that stays home at Downton Abbey aren't forgotten, and the episode shifts back and forth between Scotland and Downton. New romance is in the air for more than one character. Lesley Nichol says she asked Fellowes to give Mrs. Patmore a love interest, and he complied. Lesley says, &quot;Mr. Tufton has taken over our local shop. He's a bit of a flirty ponce, which shocks her [Mrs. Patmore] sideways, really, because I don't think people flirt with Mrs. Patmore.&quot;<br /><br />Season 4 of &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; starts filming in late February 2013. I can't wait to see it!<br /><br />Happy Readerot; There were 209 total crew &amp; cast, including the extras, and the paparazzi was wild to get a photo of &quot;Mary&quot; in her wedding dress.<br />3. &quot;The Wedding of Lady Edith&quot; (25 minutes) Commentators include many who also appear in the first 2 extras, as well as Robert Bathurst (plays Sir Anthony Strallan), Denis Maguire (supporting artist, plays the photographer at the church), David Holt (special effects technician) and Damian Butlin (standby propman).<br />Poor Edith - how many of us think that?

0374533571|5.0|I LOVED this book! I honestly didn't know what to expect going into it apart from the commercials I spotted for the movie on TV. I really wanted to see the movie but never got the chance to, and then my friend lent me the book instead! As I figure it's always better to read the book before the movie, anyway, now I'll really have the chance to compare the two! (Though I do love Jennifer Lawrence, so that might be a little biased. xD)<br /><br />Having Pat tell the story was amazing. He was such an unpredictable, unreliable narrator that I never knew what was coming next. He never did, either, as he something has mood swings as a result of something that he can't remember. He's telling the story because he's writing it all down so he can tell his wife about what he did while she was gone from him, in their \\"apart time\\". But he writes in even the bad parts because he's determined now to be a good husband and that means not lying about that kind of thing anymore. Because Pat can't understand himself, it takes the reader the whole novel to figure out what he's really like, too.<br /><br />Tiffany was also a great character. Actually, all of the characters are great, though I don't know if that simply comes from Pat's blunt, to-the-point narrative. The writing style was spectacular enough to make me not mind that not much was happening for some of it. I don't really enjoy watching football but Pat is obsessed with it. He made me care, too, with what he had to say about it and the effect it had on the people around him. If a book, or a narrator, can do something like that, I think it's fantastic.<br /><br />Pat thinks of his life in a movie, so my favorite part was definitely the montage. I loved reading about what parts he thought would be most important, what should be included in full and what needed to be breezed over. I can't wait to see how this all fits into the actual movie!<br /><br />I give The Silver Linings Playbook 5/5 stars. Pat has a great philosophy in life; he thinks that everything can have a happy ending, if you only look hard enough for the silver lining. I think that everyone could use some thoughts like that, and you might even fall in love with this book as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it has zombies and creepers that Chase you and spiders don't you think it is a fun game?

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive,fun,challenging.  Can be very aggravating.  Lots of power ups to get, have friends join and beat them, hard to put down
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really like it. Very light, easy and quite sexy. Good read for a cold winter days. I would recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book even better than the first one! Can't wait to dig into the third book, though it would be very tough to top this one.
0375869026|5.0|I have so many good things to say about this book that I do not know where to begin! The characters in this book and their personal stories made me laugh and cry while always leaving me delighted and moved! It is such a great story about that reveals human strength, courage, love, friendship and compassion. I am in love with this book and cannot wait to read it to my children one day.
076115678X|5.0|My hairdresser told me about this book and I had a read of it whilst I was getting my hair cut.  It is brilliant, I have had curly hair since I was 15 years old, I am now 41 and now finally now know how to look after my hair properly and feel good about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an excellent game. The both of my kids are highly addicted to this game, even me and there dad are too. In my opinion, subway surfers is better than the temple run games.
B005LAII8A|5.0|This movie was amazing on all boundaries. It had an immense story line and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love having this app on my kindle fire! Once in a while ot is slow to load but overall works well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoy books most when I feel like I know the characters personally.. Although I certainly cannot relate to Katniss, I found myself cheering her own from the start! Very well written!
B004GYY714|4.0|I love that I can get local radio stations. Also,  able to listen to other stations and talks shows. Nice
B000069HJN|4.0|This was Supertramp's first album without Roger Hodgson, and it's the last really good record the band produced (sadly). Like a lot of really successful partnerships, Supertramp really was greater than the sum of its parts. While this album was good (as was Roger's \\"In The Eye Of The Storm\\", released around the same time) it wasn't quite as good as \\"[[ASIN:B000VX3FGC Famous Last Words]]\\", their final album together. In fact, the first thing I did when this album came out (May, 1985) was make a mix-tape of it with \\"In The Eye Of The Storm\\" (Dec, 1984), inter-cutting Rick and Roger's songs as if it were a Supertramp album. It nearly worked. \\"Cannonball\\" is a great song, right up there with Supertramp's best songs; it's a really driving, high-energy song very much in the mold of Rick's Ray-Charles-inspired bluesy songs like 'Goodbye Stranger' or 'Ain't Nobody But Me' (it actually reminds me a little of 'Another Man's Woman', with it's freight-train rhythm guitar) -- and the slap-bass line that propels it is killer. I'm surprised it wasn't sampled to death by every hip-hopper since (maybe it has, I don't really know). The title track is a 16 minute, side-long (back in the days when albums had sides) song about the cold war, and, honestly, it's a bit of a mess. It starts strong -- once you get past the sort of pretentious Orwellian/faux newsreel FX in the opening (I mean, come on - \\"relations between the Kremlin and the Vatican...\\"? Even at the height of the Cold War I don't recall the relationship between the Kremlin and that Vatican being of particularly significance) -- that Fats-Domino-inspired rolling piano line kicks in and the song really ignites. Until the middle. There's this mind-blowing David Gilmour solo and then the song kind of descends into this music-concrète, Stockhausan inspired flabby middle -- more FX, Rick flailing around on the piano -- before the band finds the thread again and leads us out with goose-stepping synthesizer solo leading to a typically killer Gilmour fade-out solo.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|great book, if you saw the movie, definatly check out where it started!!!  would definatly recomend this book to anyone!!
B000069HJI|5.0|This record gets unfairly overlooked simply because it wasn't Breakfast in America. But, seriously, talk about a tough act to follow! This record might not have been the hit-stuffed package everyone wanted in the Wake of \\"Breakfast\\", but it was a fine record all on it's own. Every song on this record stands up well against the best songs in the Supertramp catalog (except, IMO, \\"It's Raining Again\\". A lot of people liked it, but it was too cutesy for my taste). But \\"Crazy\\", \\"Bonnie\\", \\"C'est Le Bon\\", \\"Know Who You Are\\", and (my favorite song on the record) \\"Waiting So Long\\" are right up there with other Supertramp gems like \\"Goodbye Stranger\\", \\"Fools Overture\\" and \\"Crime of the Century\\".<br /><br />A word of warning: the version of \\"Bonnie\\" on this remastered CD has a flaw -- the opening 3 seconds have a weird \\"cut-and-paste\\" causing a weird, stuttering repeat (listen to this compared to the 1982 CD version). Unfortunately, since the 2002 remastering, this seems to be the \\"definitive\\" version of this song (both Amazon digital and iTunes, for example, use this version) My solution was was to dig out my old 1982 CD, re-rip the song, and boost the volume using AACGain to match the increased volume of the remaster.<br /><br />That flaw aside, still a great record for any fan of this band, or late-70s progressive style rock.
B00APAENUI|4.0|Flag in Exile is well written story that is a depature from the usual storys in the series. Weber does a good job of fleshing out the people in this one, and demonstrates some additional depth in Honor as well.
B002P79KAC|5.0|These are great, I'm new to BBT.  The actors are all very good and the writing is hilarious.  It's nice to watch it without all the commercials on live TV.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game it is amazing. There are many worlds that I have created. But I really want them to update it to 0.6.0. I hope it has good equipment.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|This trilogy is fantastic.  It will keep you riveted to the end.  I can't remember when I found a book like this so intriguing.  The story moves well, the writing is good and I liked everything about this book.  Also read the other two in the trilogy and they were just as good.  You will want to read all three.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book is a good read -- not complicated in plot or characters so easily put down for a day or so and then pick up again and get right back into the story.  It was a little predictable but good nonetheless.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update came for my brother but won't come for me. I think that the updates come for Apple first.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game you should buy it. It is just like temple run. I give it 5 stars.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is one of the best FAOTDs I've tried! The concept of drawing your way through an interactive adventure is pretty unique, the levels all have little challenges built in, and there's great replay value as you try to unlock all the achievements.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It exceded my exspectattions ! The quality was good and very good and very entertaining. I will recomnd Amazon to all.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|LPS is lots of fun. The only problem I have is once you get certain friends, I try to tap on them to visit them and it says there is no Internet connection and to try again. for these friends I have never been able to visit them. But over all its a fun game. My daughter loves it. If my kindle is not locked she can purchase and I don't like that.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever but 0.6.0 is not getting the update I waited forever for it but its not working why wont it work?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I got the sample of the first book &everyone i was addicted the sexual scenes are a little much at times. But the storyline is one of the best ive read in a very ling time.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|It showed a more difficult manner of publishing a ebook to the internet.  I wanted up to date [2012-2013] information on how to obtain this goal.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a fantastic game for everyone! Changes from time to time, inserts often new characters and hoverboards... Everyone should play it at least once, and it's totally free if you decide to not purchase anything :)
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am so addicted to this show and I love how convenient the show pass is by automatically downloading it to my video library when a new episode is avaliable! I own a Smart TV and have an Amazon app so even better!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is what all of you app people have been looking for. it will get your hart racing its the best its in my top fav group like draw something it is the best I love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addictive. Great graphics which change every week or so.<br />The game gets better the more you play. Different characters and subways make it a winner.<br />Thank you
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I went to the theatre to experience, \\"SAMSARA\\" in late 2012. I remember seeing a good movie and thinking, \\"Well...I liked BARAKA better.\\" The theatre said they showed the film in 4k, but I suspect it was actually a 2k (ooohh, whatever.)<br /><br />I ordered the Blu-Ray of SAMSARA last week and on Tuesday of this week I watched it on my home-theatre setup. I LOVED it, and was engulfed in the images and music in a new, more intimate way. SAMSARA is completely different from BARAKA. Some of the themes are similar, but the way this film unfolds is dynamically unique. I especially enjoyed the way the music carried me away when they transition between the African Woman staring at the camera (which caused me to cry in the movie theatre) to the highway shots and night shots of the Los Angeles highways. These shots of the lights of LA at night are the most stunning and awe-inspiring images I have ever seen in my entire life, and it was becuase they were revealed to me on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I watched the film again the next day. I just could not get it off my mind. Please, give this film a new, fresh set of expectant eyes. You will not be dissapointed. And I still love BARAKA, too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever even thow this game is a cope of temple run I think it is gunner than temple run 1 and 2
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a very fun game but I will warn you it's also very addictive!! You can compete for the highest score with your friends or just play for fun. Happy Subway Surfing!! :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is out of this world the game just kills the hours in no time at all and the game is a real test of your game skills to get the items you need to be number one
B00335EQ0E|5.0|How can you go wrong with Alice in Wonderland.  You can't.  Take the time to buy it for someone you love.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wheres the update 0.6.0?? Come on Amazon why does it take so long the 0.6.0 already came out on the appstore! But also download this game its amazing!!
B004G600A4|5.0|What a wonderful movie to watch with your child or grandchild.  We had popcorn and tea while watching this.  This is a movie to enjoy together.
B001O80G60|5.0|I'm pretty sure that I will ever get tired of this album. Definitely one of pantera's best pieces of work.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Movies like this are worth buying.  It is a good movie that is clean. keeps your interest and sends us all a good message.  Those whom have good husbands and fathers it reminds us to take time to thank God.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It definitely plays like a knock off of Bioshock, but I LOVED Bioshock, so.... In any case, great story and setting, good graphics, and interesting puzzles. I think the puzzles were the weakest part, but all in all a great game and worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Wish there was easier was to earn gems and energy.  I enjoy it. Its fun for all ages. I recommended it for all ages
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very fun. I wish the ending had been a little more fleshed out, but good graphics and story. The puzzles were fun, and I loved the addition of Miles.
B00181JGI2|5.0|funny movie. good to watch for a good laugh. kept me on my toes, actually! excessive bad language, though. Some really funny lines to remember from this movie.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|I love this dvd with its jazzy/bluesy music.  It's a basic sort of Disney story--poor girl in a bad situation being mistreated by an evil person--then she finds a solution and wins out in the end, also (of course) finding a guy to love.  But the music is catchy, the voices are engaging--overall a really nice Disney movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this app is a lot like those facebook games you can play (castletown, farmville, etc.) except with the ponies. got it mostly for babysitting my younger relatives, but i've found myself spending a half hour or so here or there on the silly thing. my one problem is the same as it normally is with these: forced social networking (though this one is less crippling than most in that regard). that however is a flaw of the genre and not the app, so 5 stars for good mindless fun.
0307388921|1.0|This was not the type of book that I read.  I wanted to read a book called &#34;Choke&#34; that was about professional athletes not performing well.
030759565X|4.0|Like other reviewers, I find the format a huge disappointment.  Flipping pages  (because the ingredients are on the opposite side of the page from directions) with batter on my hands is not cool.  It is frustrating to use a cookbook with no index of recipes.  I am being generous in giving 4 stars, however, because as in the Smitten Kitchen blog, the recipes are awesome (even though as another reviewer mentioned, I would also like to see a greater proportion of entree recipes than breakfasts and desserts).  I highly recommend Harvest Chicken as well as Wild Rice Gratin. I can not wait for Ms. Perlman's next cookbook. I I know she will make sure her next publisher knows how to format a cookbook for cooks.  I am still a fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have played a lot of games in my life but none are better than temple run 2. It's packed with action and adventure that will entertain you for hours.
B000025D7S|5.0|My daughter had this CD and I had to have one of my own.  Love the variety of talent singing those fabulous songs!
1616550414|5.0|Just got it today! I'm a fan of the game so it will be forever treasured :) I just wish it didn't have small dents on the side of the book :( Really good for price listed!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Awesomely funny at many points, but also very poignant and heart-rending at times.<br /><br />Do not watch it with kids as it would require explanations you're prolly not ready to provide.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This subway game rocks it is really fun to play. It's fun earning the coins and spending it the way you want.
B00817V670|2.0|This book was purchased as a Christmas present for a family member.  It is not something which I would read
B007V65R54|3.0|It was repetitive but not great.  A few key points were valid but I wouldn't recommend the book to others.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Finished it in 3 days.. only because I had to work, otherwise it probably would have been done in 1. :)
B008NF45S2|1.0|Did not work with my kindle fire.  It was able to locate my network printer but it did not have it listed in their program in order to install it. Amazon fire users beware. A total waste of $$
1400067820|4.0|To look from another and unusual point of view it is always a very good beginning to all of us.
034580404X|3.0|This was a good story to follow and lose yourself in, but I wasn't particularly fond of the way-too-frequent detail of the physical encounters. But to each his own.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|timeless classic , a must see must have DVD for the collection of any who enjoy a great thriller now and then
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read almost everything Stephen King wrote and found this to be my favorite.  The story of Kennedy's murder has always been of great interest to me.  King's jaunt into the past was fascinating.  I could not put the book down.  My favorite book ever!
B008XG1X18|5.0|pintrest is great to use. I have fun and use it for hours. following lots of boards. this app makes it easy.
B008PU8SR4|5.0|A truly moving book: cleverly and realistically told through the eyes of a fifteen-year-old Asperger's boy, Christopher. The first half of the story revolves around Christopher's search for the murderer of Wellington, his neighbour's poodle, who's been done in with a pitchfork. Christopher, a great Sherlock Holmes fan (hence the title of the novel) can't help investigating. This ingenious plot device serves not only as an interesting whodunnit for the reader, but also allows us to step inside Christopher's mind. We begin to understand why he hates certain colours and foods, refuses to speak on certain days, hates being touched or any change to his routine; and why he responds so violently when his parameters are crossed.<br />The crime is solved half way through the book, and the story then becomes what I believe it is really about all the time. For although the action is only seen through Christopher's eyes, the story I read was about the strains and frustrations of living with an autistic, talented child, totally unaware of his challenging behaviour. To me, this was the story of Christopher's parents: their struggles and their failures, but more than anything, their overwhelming love for their child. A worthy winner of its many prizes.<br />One warning - it does contain a fair amount of very strong language.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00ESIVR3O Jane Hetherington's Adventures in Detection Omnibus (Books 1-3)]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00MDSM1PY The Magpie Murders - Omnibus Edition]]
B004J1XYJA|4.0|If you liked the departed you'll the town.  Affleck is great as an actor and director. one two three four
B003F3FJQO|4.0|It was very good but got boring in some places. But all in all a good way to end the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Glichy but great. Wish they had more free items but over it is very good. Anyone wanna buy me something that's would be nice.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game very cool and is much different than the first game. It is also a lot like the first same characters different grahpics.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Suspenseful and exciting! A great way to get an education on that era without even realizing it. I am able to forget all of the stresses of today's times and escape to a family that I feel a part of!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This case is ok.  it is protective and secure.  My only complaint is it does not stand up very well. I like to prop up my kindle so I can read at lunch. This cover slides unless it is at an angle that is not comfortable for me. I thought it would stay up at any angle. Oh well. It is still a nice cover.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! it has great graphics! I do wish that you didn't have to have energy but I guess it makes it more challenging and keeps the game interesting.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Easy to play. The first levels take about 10-15 seconds each. Jumped up to the max and you have to think on those a bit so figure 30-60 seconds.  Went through all 30 on the first level in about 5 minutes.  I made sure to turn off the function on my tablet that allows in-game purchases as according to several reviews, this app will try to charge you for help with no consent.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great characters -takes you to the time and place.  I do not even own a TV, but Downton is worth the watch!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is the best totally worth 7bucks Now listen to me carefully IF U R DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY THIS GAME DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE WHO SAY IT IS NOT A GOOD GAME BECAUSE THEY ARE N<br />WRONG INSTEAD LISTEN TO ME AND Buy THE GAME.!!!--!!!!!!&iexcl;&iexcl;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game in the whole world because its a mix between jetpack joyride and temple run so have fun playing
B000FBJHZS|5.0|It'll keep you seated and compel you to keep on turning the pages!!!<br /><br /> Dnt believ me thn try it!!!!! You wont regret it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. It is definitely great for horse lover's and people that like to play lifelike games. I can't stop playing. Recommend for children too!
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Superb cast and acting talent here! Lots of action and drama in this one. Enjoy it, I did as well!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Requires watching a couple of times, you need to pay attention.  Can be a bit slow in parts, but good for a rental.
B001AJ09JW|4.0|Again, this is a great movie. I like scary so this was one for the books as well! Enjoy! :)
B008B92U32|4.0|Face Swap is lots of Fun when you Swap Faces within your pictures and get Hilarious Results.  It does exactly what they say and the PROCESS IS VERY SIMPLE.  Easier than you would think.  Original Photo needs to have faces that are not blocked, shadowed or turned too far to get best results.<br />LIKES:<br />Controls and Options work well and Final Photo can be Saved and Shared if you like.<br />Stretch, Rotate and Mirror effects make fine tunung your swapped picture fairly easy.<br />Instructions are helpful and you can select how many faces you want to swap for each photo.<br />Safe Permissions, No Ads or Intrusions and App size is very Small.<br /><br />Unfortunately it has No UNDO Button so you have to start all over if you make a mistake.<br />Sometimes Resizing your Selected area gets Distorted or Snaps to very narrow view easily.<br />These issues are minor and hopefully the Developer will improve with future Updates.<br />I like this app because it is Safe and Creative Fun to experiment with.
B001AITH50|5.0|The cast in this has surpassed themselves. Fantastic movie to watch. I loved it and so will most others!<br />:)
B001NN4162|5.0|Watching this movie, was like watching it in the theater.  I love Blu ray and so do my grandkids. I am so glad Disney is reissuing these movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Easy to learn, exhilarating to master, and incredibly addicting. The power ups are fun and creative, and the levels continue to challenge (and at times frustrate, but in a good way!). Can't wait to unlock some of the other characters!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is an awesome game u should get it because I just finished all of the levels in one day
B00936A2SM|3.0|Very disappointed.  Listened to a few snippets of music before purchasing, sounded good.  The CD, however, seems to have no real direction or feel for the music.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. Can't wait to read the next.<br /><br />I hope it's as good, if not better then book one. Thanks.
B005VT42BS|5.0|I like that app very much, very easy to use and works as well as the ipod version. With a tablet and the bigger screen it is easier to see the mac addresses of what's really on any network.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The authors paint a pretty accurate picture of the struggles of many IT shops and the application of manufacturing principles to IT management has great promise for resolving these challenges.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It has almost become a cult movie already.  My daughter had to go out and buy it after a rental.  Her and her friends are constantly watching it.  Great for tweens and teens.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I had a palm centro with the best calander/ note pad ever. Well I switched to an android phone and lost my best friend. This product is so close to what I had and is so easy to add notes and appointments to that sink with my other tablets and desktop. I use it everyday for my schedule.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Flawless details, words that just take your breath away and force you to cover an eye because of what may happen next. Worth every cent, almost leaves you in a state of shock wondering just how much the mind and body can withstand.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|My 2 & 3 year old boys just love this movie. The first night we got it, they watched it 4 times.<br />Now we just play the title chapter over an over again. Playing &#34;This is Halloween&#34;.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I find it a really great game and really fun, and it is the most addictive game ever! I highly recommend it!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Overall it was a good read. I think the characters needed a bit more development. I just couldn't seem to connect with many of them.
B008B92U32|4.0|For a free app of the day it is worth a download for some quick laughs of cutting and pasting faces on otver people. However if you are going to pay it might not be worth it because sometimes the cutting and pasting looks really rough and cheap. So for free app of the day which is whay I got i give it 4 stars if i had paid 2.
0316113506|4.0|As a mental health professional I have always pushed exercise (when appropriate) and the author takes the establishment to task for their underutilization of this powerful tool.  Would be nice to have some cautions about &#34;overtraining&#34; and exercise addiction but a very good read and a great message.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|if you love the first one, then you 'll be thrilled with this sequel. the only glitches that bugs me is the game will periodically close out when I attempt to use the gem life save. it will close and then all my progress in that run will be lost. please fix this glitch! its frustrating, especially when I've gotten a new high score.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Amazing book so funny I loved it Jeff Kinney is an amazing author and writes amazing books I've read every diary of a wimpy kid book best books ever
B00A9V2JSG|1.0|If you enjoy a good action packed book with awesome romance this book is NOT for you! It moves way to slow and the characters take forever to develop. The story doesn't advance till the last quarter of the book. Along with very lengthy descriptions it takes forever just to get to the point. The book is beautifully written and the ending broke my heart but it wasn't till the end that I like this book at all. It took this whole book just to develop the main character over all of wasn't my cup of tea but I'm more interested in action pack Books and I became bored continually reading and being lead to think something exciting was going to happen. But the ending was amazing and now I'm debating weather or not to buy the second book because I want to know what happens next because the story just got good but I don't want to be let down by the pacing and slowness and end up not liking it. But if you love a good love story this is for you
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome book although I disliked the books ending. Rick riordan creates another amazing book can't wait for the next one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love this game, it keeps your attention, and has many levels. A great way to spend a boring evening or time away from home.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I think that it's really stupid that I paid $2.99 for this game and all of a sudden, all of these stinking ads come in. I'm not wasting a PENNY on Rovio until they stop ripping me off!!!!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Omg, love it!!!<br />Can't believe it's a free app, (shh, best kept secret lol)!<br />Great graphics and you can tell the creators put thought and time into it.<br />Go for it, download and enjoy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a awesome game you will LOVE IT·<br />it is so much fun to play·Get it from your kindle or iPod·
B0030DHPGQ|2.0|Book started off great with a clear message.  As I read it seemed the author had to write so many words to fill up pages that the concept was lost.  could done as a essay rather than a book.
B0083Z614S|4.0|I read this book  The Secret Garden by F H Burnett as a child it was good to read again and see the positive influence of retraining your mind. Yes it was around even when this book was written!!!!!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Story and all the acting is good, especially seeing lots of them stars makings hints of their earlier movies. Great
0765365278|5.0|This, ladies and gentlemen, is why I read.<br /><br />I am going to do my best to explain why this one made it into my favorites list which is not easy to do given the total number of books I've read. First, I will say that I am a relative newcomer to Sanderson's work. I read the Mistborn Trilogy Boxed Set last year and Elantris earlier this year. I knew after just reading that first Mistborn book that Sanderson would be one of my must-read authors and by the end of that trilogy I had vowed to read everything he writes, even if it means traversing the entire Wheel of Time series by Robert Jordan just to get to those final volumes by Sanderson.<br /><br />I had not actually intended on reading Way of Kings next, mostly because of the sheer size of it. Size, in and of itself, doesn't bother me and I've read numerous \\"doorstoppers\\" before. But they can sometimes seem too drawn out and slow moving and I was simply worried that the same might happen to my beloved Sanderson.<br /><br />But no, it was not to be. Sanderson has written the near perfect novel here. His world building, as incredible as always, is beyond my ability to describe adequately. While complicated, the cultural, religious, and political systems upon which the plot is developed makes sense and yet still does not divert the reader from where his/her attention should be focused: upon the plot and the characters. Same goes for the magic system that we get to explore with the characters, discovering its nuances at the same time as the characters.<br /><br />And speaking of characters, many other lengthy books or series in the fantasy genre that I've read suffer from too many characters, too many points-of-view. And there are a lot of characters here as well, but Sanderson chooses to focus on a select few so that we readers don't get bogged down, flipping back pages to try and remember who so-and-so is. And each of his focus characters is intriguing in their own ways. They have complex backgrounds and motivations and none of them are all good or all bad. They are real. And each time a new chapter opened and returned me to that particular character, I would instantly sink into their part of the story.<br /><br />And the plot. I won't rehash that here; I could never do it justice. Suffice it to say that all the elements of good story-telling are here: intrigue, peril, action, romance, noble honor, dastardly betrayal...I could go on and on. But to put it all together and make it soooo enjoyable requires the genius of Brandon Sanderson. Usually when I read a long work such as this, I churn through the final hundred pages or so to get that feeling of finally conquering that mountain of pages. But with this one I found myself stalling, not wanting it to end, despite its page length. As I write this I actually am feeling a little in withdrawal about the whole thing. And this is the beginning of what is reportedly a 10-book series? I don't know how I will wait until the next volume is out.<br /><br />I know this sounds like total fanboy gushing but reading this novel really did effect me more than 99% of the novels I read. And I'm the type of reader who likes most of what he reads. So if you haven't discovered Sanderson yet, I suggest you still start out with Mistborn: The Final Empire and work your way through from there. For me, I still have several of his other books that I still get to enjoy and by then, hopefully, Book 2 of this series will be ready.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendation!tions and none of them are all good or all bad.

B008JAGZDE|5.0|This movie is really funny, script follows the previous movies and you'll get good laughs.<br />I will definitely watch again.
B00ARN0XGG|2.0|I'm one that really loves these movies. I find them a blast to watch. I enjoy how creepy and scary they are if you just go with the flow. I enjoy them so much that I was ecstatic when I got the Blu-Ray box of the first three for Christmas.<br /><br />I was very much looking forward to this, the forth movie in the series despite people's disappointment.<br /><br />Well, there isn't much to say. I was completely let down. There is no story, no plot, no dialogue, no tension, and.....no scares. None at all. I could barely hold my eyes open. I looked to see how much longer of the movie was left and I was one hour and twelve minutes in and NOTHING had happened at all...except excruciating boredom. And I still had 24 minutes to go. The wonderful Katie Featherston looked like she had nothing to do, nothing to say in her few moments on screen. She seemed to be there for no reason except to kill a couple of people. I think Katie is probably tired of these movies, though they have made her fairly famous now. She is quite talented and very pretty.<br /><br />So, the movie came to an end that by now didn't even matter. The ending had a couple of moments, but the endurance of waiting this brief couple of moments out was painful. And as I said, I truly love these movies. But I will not purchase this one to own. I'm only out the rental cost. Oh, the bonus featurette was just as bad. Just a repeat of a couple of scenes.<br /><br />I understand part 5 is in the bag. I think they have run out of ideas and story lines. Perhaps it is time to call it a day on a decent film franchise.<br /><br />But, that's only my opinion.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The trailer showed most of the good jokes in the movie, which are just a few. Mark Whalberg and Mila Kunis are great in this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is an amazing game. It is like temple run without leaning and turning. I think this game is worth every second.  You should definitely buy this game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game and all horse lovers will love it. My daughter really enjoys having her own pony at her fingertips.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I'm a skeptic.  But Alexander's story did make me a little less skeptical.  The book is engaging and well-written.  There's no question that it's the best work, so far, in the &#34;afterlife&#34; genre.  As an agnostic, I am open to all views on the topic.  Many of his specifics are new and worthy of pondering.<br /><br />This is an easy read and I've already recommended it to several friends and family members.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such an inspiring story. You won't be disappointed! A great love story, with a hint of danger, and a surprising twist.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I like this game, but sometimes it sucks! I'll get like 5 million and then it freezes and won't save my score
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this was one of the best games I have purchased. Had both hidden objects and puzzles. Worth the price as the game was very long and had an interesting story.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|very good game. like it .play it every night .beauty views ,nick character! you will like it<br />the most important is it's free
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have to admit that I loved this book. You have to come into this book with an open mind and be willing to accept a dysfunctional romance. That was my mentality and I really loved this book to the point that I finished it in one day and reread it again. I love the relationships in this book and I just thought the romance was adorable. There were laugh out loud moments because I love the dialogue of the characters and there were moments where I can't believe how the characters can be so stupid. This book definitely brings you on a rollercoaster of emotions and I really liked that. I don't think the story is believable or that the background of the characters make sense to me, but it was just a fun book. I would recommend it to my friends if they want to read a book about the perfect bad boy because thats what I think Travis.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|The show has a lot of suspense, but I found it to be very slow-moving at times, with the plot taking forever to unfold.  The last couple of episodes had me on the edge of my seat, but it shouldn't have taken to so long to get to that point.  I will, however, order season 2 when it comes out, as I have to know what happens next!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS BOOK! I came into reading this book knowing that I would be crying my eyes off and that is what I did exactly. I always warn my friends before they read this book that it will get very emotional. At the end of each chapter I was always in tears, but not only because the story is sad, but that John Green wrote in a way that made me feel like I was reading a friend's journey through cancer. I thought the characters were beautifully written as well as the entire book. I had multiple moments where I laughed out loud because the main characters were so witty and love-able. They felt like real people when John Green wrote about them and that made me love this book even more because although I am not going through the same thing as they were, I felt relatable to them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it has definitely become one of my all time favorite books. One of the few books I have read that made me really appreciate life.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|High entertainment value here, and some good educational value as well.  I'm about one fourth the way through, and I might actually finish this book :)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|love the game but sometimes when I go to use a gem to save myself it freezes and puts me with negative gems.
B005LAII6C|5.0|A wonderful movie about love!!! PARANORMAN it is a good movie anhd have a wonderful work. Watch it!!! Watch it!!!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|this is a great movie and a great continuation of the original.  it left me wanting more.  it is was a great price
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I watched this twice to see if I had missed some crucial plot point which could clarify a very convoluted story line.<br />Nope! Maybe the director was missing some script pages or the editor had a vendetta against the producer...<br />The story weaves its way without any apparent purpose and simply became a waste of time. Yeah, I know, movies are supposed to entertain and not necessarily enlighten. This just makes me wish for a graphic novel version (second millennium-speak for what had been known as a comic book. Similar to calling a motorized scooter a personal, green energy, low carbon footprint, transportation device.).<br />Bottom line, not going to add this to my batman DVD collection.<br />The story line was so weak that when last seen, our hero is flying a nuclear device out over a bay, we see the timer clicking down to 4,3,2 seconds, pan to hero's face, then wide shot of a detonation. Of course all characters observing the detonation do not suffer any retinal damage so probably will not have any flash burns or subsequent radiation sickness either. Probably a low carbon footprint, green energy, nuclear device?<br />But wait! Following a graveside scene observing Bruce Wayne's death, the scene shifts to Alfred sitting in a European cafe where he spots, you guessed it! Our hero sitting with a woman, who also doesn't seem to be suffering from radiation poisoning...<br />Awww! C'mon!
0307730697|5.0|How often do you think about your freedom?  How often do you think to yourself, I'm free, because of someone elses actions?  How often do you realize, that someone has died..many people have died, so that you could stand free, in your home, on your street, in your car, in your own backyard.<br /><br />In Fearless, Eric Blehm writes:<br />When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan--but he was ready: In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote, \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.\\"<br /><br />You realize, you're not invicible.  When this happens in life, you change your stance, and sometimes, your beliefs.  This book has made me think, to the point that I've changed some of my own beliefs.  We all know that soldiers fight for us, on a daily basis.  Some of us do what we can, sending packages overseas, thanking soldiers we see on the street, etc.  But often times, it's days, months, and sometimes years pass between... and then you read something like this.  You realize, that they're doing more than putting their lives on the line for us.  They're dying for us.<br />This book made me appreciate life.  It made me appreciate my freedom.  My children's freedom.  YOUR freedom.<br /><br />I am the first to say that I take my life and freedom for granted.  It's always been there.  There are people who can say different.  My husband, is 58.  He remembers different times.  He lived in the South.  The stories he could tell...<br />My husband's father just turned 87.  He lived through what most of us only read about in textbooks, only heard about in stories, and only learned about in school.<br />Our children come home telling stories of Martin Luther King Jr, and often, they've learned more than we forgot.<br />We take these for granted.  We take school for granted.  We take driving in our cars, for granted.<br /><br />I bet, if you read this book.  You'd not take so much for granted.<br /><br />A heroic story of one man, but the life of many.  Adam Brown was a hero.  Those in Seal Team SIX, are heros.  We owe a lot more than gratitude to them.<br /><br />*my blog, Sandling All Day, recieved a copy of this book in exchange for writing a review.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I Love It it better than temple run and temple run brave it not better than subway surfers Everybody Buy Temple Run 2
B007M45PMU|4.0|Had to buy the album and not disappointed. I hate that I missed them live but I'm hoping they'll be back around my area.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great story being told by Joey the horse. I wanted to read this because I saw the broadway play and the movie.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The twists that CM has are great. I love this series. The writers get it. They keep you on edge and brain busy with trying to figure out who the criminal is and how the arrest will play out. It's FANTASTIC ;)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Good alarm clock! Very useful!! I use it for everything, loud, I love the math problem snooze or dismiss options. Also like the music option.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book started off extremely slow to me and didn't pick up until chapter 11.  Consequently, once  that happened the book was on a roll with the drama, suspense,shock, horror, love and non stop action. Each page was a treat to my senses and expansion of my mind. I can't wait to read the second book!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable works great. It fits the charger and Kindle well and is long enough you can use your Kindle while it is charging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is quite amazing and adventurous. I am in love with it and helps me show my parents that I am responsible. Yet the most amazing parts of the graphics which I just can't get enough of especially since I adore horses. Thank you very much whoever created this game.
B0058YPGP2|5.0|Someone told me about the series some time ago but I never got around to watching it.  I recently purchased it then let it sit around for a while.  Got it out a couple of days ago then couldn't stop watching until I'd watched the whole thing.  Very good series.  I love all the characters and especially his young friend.  Very well-written series and the characters are all perfect together.  I really don't see anything I would change about the show.  I would recommend the show to anyone who is interested in these types of programs (I love them and am always looking for something new).  I don't like a lot of the movies of this type, in fact, I just watched a movie that I kept seeing at the stores and it was so dumb that I didn't really want to watch the whole thing but I did and now I know for sure that I never want to purchase it. This series is one that I will want to watch SEVERAL times.  I'd never recommend it if I didn't think someone else would enjoy it as much as I did.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I love it!  Don't know what else to tell you on this one except buy it!  Good music; great artist and the shipping was fast!  :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would read another book of her's . Once I started reading I didn't want to put it down. Love it
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Once you get started, you have to know what's going to happen next.  If you started watching this series midway through, I highly recommend going back and getting caught up from the beginning.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|This app is great for individuals that are currently exercising but ma not have time to create their own program design.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I really like puzzle adventure games. This company is normally very solid. These games are consistently great.  Keep them coming!
B004EPYZU8|5.0|This is a great fantasy-escape movie with a phenomenal soundtrack. Don't let anyone tell you it is &#34;too unrealistic&#34; because they clearly missed the point of the film. Sit back and enjoy!<br />The movie arrived in a timely manner and is in brand new condition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can be played for hours.  Challenging but easy to play.  I recommend to anyone for a simple but engrossing game.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I was very impressed with the package it came in and of course I love Indiana Jones. Sometimes I run all the movies back to back.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun if you complete the missions and sigh up with facebook you will love it completing with your friends to get the high score!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i bought this for my 10 year old and she loves it in my own words its just faboo even for me
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome! It's a lot harder though, but all the better. I enjoy challenges. : ) I've been playing it every day since I got it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really love this game.....lots of fast action....very fun and to play...find myself playing it for hours...really passes the time....more practice will get you places
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love minecraft, but I feel neglected because android and ios were updated a couple of days ago to version 0.6.0 and we are still waiting
B004TI5N38|4.0|This was a very different Baldacci book.  Well written as usual but a different kind of a story.  The West Virginia setting added an unusual twist to the plot.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I like the game but it makes you really tiring. the thing i dont like is you cant buy characters if you dont have a wifi connection
0345803507|3.0|This entire series lost my interest after the middle of the first book. It's so redundant that I can predict what is going to happen next. Barnes and nobles over charged for this book, and I only bought it because everyone was talking about how great this book was. The sex scenes were slghtly vivid but not really interesting. When you first read this book the events are surprising, then towards the middle of the first book you get bored and you begin to hate the main character
B009ZE27US|3.0|the age scanner is okay.I thought it would actually tell my real age. i just use it for pranks on my family
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This helps me sleep at night, it's SO soothing! I love the mixture of the orchestra, campfire, winds, butterfly, ocean, and river. If you're afraid of the dark, if you want to relax in the tub or soaking your feet, or if you just like soothing sounds, this is the app for you! :)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like temple run 2 alot you can do more on this one than the first one.you can ride in mine carts and jump over Niagria falls.the only thing i dont like is you cant buy the other characters. but i like both of them

B00A8SPNYW|3.0|This isn't something I would recommend. This game is not worth a penny, It was free when I downloaded it. It's not addictive and it's rather boring actually. a better game is &#34;Where's My Water&#34;. That game is worth money, but this is just a game when you have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO.
B0089BSLUS|5.0|Grand yet intimate performance with a lush symphonic accompaniment. Antony at his best with some interesting spoken introductions. Great recording quality and new interpretations of recent songs.

B002LVUKIS|5.0|So, it's 2013... and no game has yet to ever touch Thief I or II. I've tried, I really honestly have, to like other games... to find another game series I could always follow and wait with baited-breath for the next to come out, but, I have decided it's completely hopeless. Looking Glass achieved perfection - nothing else will ever compare.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of complaints from people over the years saying these games are difficult. I don't get it, honestly. I suppose this stems from lots of people having no patience and just wanting to run around like maniacs, shooting everything. Well, you don't have and never will get any guns :p And your sword, well, you're better off without that thing (OK, except for haunts - though you really SHOULD be sneaking past them, too - but, hey, to each his own playstyle. I'm never against piling all the unconscious Bafford guards in his pool, after all :p).<br /><br />Unlike so many PC games of today, Thief I & II feel very solid. You do not feel like some obese person skating around like so many of the console ports of today feel (is it just me? :p).<br /><br />The gameplay is extremely un-linear, and exploration & paying attention are rewarded. I could play through these games endlessly (and have... and will some more).<br /><br />Not only is the replayability high for the games as they come, but if you tack on the insane amount of fan missions made by us crazy Thief fanatics, you have hours upon hours of gameplay at your disposal. And it's not just some hacky garbage or crappy \\"maps\\" from wannabe-devs either - the fan missions are often pure genius... testing the boundaries of the dark engine & doing unimaginably beautiful things with it!<br /><br />So, yeah, then there's \\"Thief Deadly Shadows.\\" No, it's not Thief III in my book, but it's an interesting game in its own right. The Cradle level is the most creeped out I think I have ever been & made the whole game for me. You do feel fat and skate-y in this one... though everyone else in the city could apparently use a good burger or 10 (the excessively skinny models look pretty ridiculous). The shadows in this game enthralled me when I first played (the day it came out, of course) - nowadays probably not too impressive, but they were something then. The physics was also quite amusing... though everyone's also used to this now. I was/am also endlessly amused with oil making npcs slip and lighting it on fire... maybe I'm just childish, but whatever.<br /><br />The price on this collection is great, no matter where you find it - here or Steam. I've purchased it quite a few times - even though I have all my boxes and CDs from long ago. I would gladly pay today prices for it if I didn't own it already (and would not pay the $60 for lots of today's games because they're mostly crap).<br /><br />If someone has somehow gotten through their life enjoying PC gaming & hasn't touched this, I highly recommend it. The graphics may not be much to look at in terms of resolution & realness compared to those of today, but you don't NEED them to be anything more than they are... because the game is perfect at gameplay.everyone else in the city could apparently use a good burger or 10 (the excessively skinny models look pretty ridiculous).

0312548079|4.0|I totally like the story but it does take a long time to get truly into the book. About half way I was hooked and spent 4 hours finishing the book.<br /><br />... Read Something Borrowed first is my recommendation. If you didn't like Darcy from Something Borrowed this isn't the book for you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Simple, addictive, good regular updates. Mission for upgrades are[[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]] achievable..not only am I addicted but daughter is too
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Don't get me wrong, love the game, possibly even an addict (I'm in the top 1 &amp; 2 percent for each category). Biggest aggravation is about 40 percent of the time when I try to use  &quot;save me&quot; the program quits. Not only do I not get credit for my points, distance and coins gained up to that point, but I lose any jewels earned AND the jewels I've used are still gone. This means I frequently restart the application and find I have a negative amount of jewels. Bad news.
B0050XFY4O|2.0|First off great subject, but I am not used to a movie with out tragedy or action. Mellow drama if there was any drama. Could have been better with more disastrous twists and turns. I was hoping one would die or commit suicide to make it real heart breaking, but it ended happily ever after.
B00797MB0O|5.0|Wow. Maybe it depends on if you know someone like the lead character or not, but I sure do -  the movie is hysterical! It's very, very subtle though. It's perfect \\"irritainment\\", how noxious the main character is. Then later on lots of great metaphors, like the heart shaped mirror mentioned in the love scene. I disagree that the main character is completely unloveable though. She's trajic.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am a sci-fi fan and after the loss of the X-Files, Firefly, and Battlestar I am thrilled that this show has staying power... I love the mythology surrounding the family and the play on history and mythology keeps the stories interesting.  Season seven is great and cant wait to watch season eight...
B005LAIH2C|4.0|Once again critics have just under estimated this film. Yes i know this film is not great but its pretty darn good. I admit walking into the theater i had low expectations about this film i really did sadly. I mean it did not look great from the trailers but i went in and came out happy that i skipped The Last Stand to see this.There were problems with the film i have to say but not many. I don't get how critics came down wand said this film is one star worthy and horrible crap. This film looks like Van Helsing and Abraham Lincoln : Vampire Hunter wait that sounds interesting hum the title is way similar to Hansel and Gretel : Witch Hunters. The problem is i hated Abraham Lincoln so now you see why i came in thinking this film was going to be bad. Yup. This is the first 2013 i have seen this year, and thank god the first film i saw was good. OK now onto the few bad stuff i had with this film. The few things were well the cheap look of the film, language, character development , the open scene, and the length. Ok so this film had a look i didn't like this film just looked cheap like a cheesy B movie which it was not but it just looked like it sadly which kinda took away the class and that with the film. Maybe if they spent more time with detail stuff would look less cheap and better like the candy house and the troll. The language in this film was unnecessary. I mean characters (mostly Hansel) says the F - Word as a joke i mean whats with that how can that be funny. He is all like F this and F that and F F F . It was not needed to make this film good it just was not. It made the film seem stupid like that it was just not needed. This films characters were under developed i mean we needed much more scenes with Edward the troll he was not in enough of the film so we don't learn a lot about him and the same goes for Hansel's love interest Mina plus the teen boy Ben. There was just not a lot of those three and sadly one of them we will never see again in upcoming sequelswhich i expect will happen due to a decent box office gross. If they don't make sequels we will never know what each of their stories are. But this film was made to set the stage for the oncoming films in the series which it did well enough. The opening scene which had the young Hansel and Gretel coming to the ginger bread house and burning the witch. Well the thing with this was it was just not right. I mean why would the kids just walk on into a strangers house, this part i think should have been at least 7 or 8 minutes longer to better set the stage for the older Hansel and Gretel. The opening was poorly written with little lines spoken and the witch could barely speak English it was just a poor opening. Onto the last thing i did not like which was the length of the film. This film was just too short for this story. this film is an hour and a half which is not enough. Maybe adding an extra half an hour would have been way better so they could extend the opening, add more scenes with Edward the troll, more scenes with Mina and Hansel together, and finally more scenes with Gretel and Ben together (not as a couple but you know what i mean) and well more scenes with Gretel period, sadly she was over shadowed by Hansel due to such a popular actor they had. So naturally she was left out in the rewrites. Ok now on to the good things which include the acting, cast, visuals, action, entertainment, plot, characters, and gore (R- rating) . Ok lets begin with the acting. This film was well acted including new talented actors which are Gemma Arterton , Famke Janssen , and Thomas Mann. Everyone acted excellent in this film you can tell everyone was having a great time doing this film. Which caused the acting to be really good, which surprised me actually. Everyone acted as if it were real and it made me feel like wow is this actually happening. The cast was really good. Everyone looked like their characters mostly the young Hansel and Gretel which really did look like the older versions of the characters. Which really got me thinking wow these people look just like the people in the book. Wow. That was very interesting. The visual effects are not award winning by no means but for only a budget of 50 million i think they did quite well with what they had actually. Which was very good. Like the troll looked cool and that and the flying bullet was cool and well detailed. The action is very good and well paced out we have story then action story then action then more action and story it is just interestingly fun and entering my next subject entertaining. This film is just a dumb fun entertaining film that will keep you at the edge of your seats screaming in excitement as Hansel and Gretel fight witches and that its just so much fun which is rare in a January film actually. The plot i hear has not received good reviews which i don't get whats so wrong with it, yes its simple but its all the same good , am i right even when i took my dad to see this he said the script was weak. Why? Its pretty good to me. The characters are good they are very interesting and they make you want to know more about them. They are characters that if they died you would cry, i am not lying these are good characters. The gore in this film is good, i know i usually go for less gore and a PG- 13 rating but i actually believe that the R Rating for this film made the film better then expected it really did i say so anyway. All an All critics under estimated this films potential. While this film is not a award winner it is still a really really good film. So check ti out in theater if you want to be entertained on a cold January day. B+ This review is by James A Pasierbowicz

1610454812|5.0|Fearless is the story of Adam Brown, a Navy SEAL Team Six Operator whose military story is one of courage and patriotism. But the surprise of the book is that his personal story is just as amazing as his military one. I was immediately drawn into the life of Adam Brown; initially because he grew up in Arkansas, just 100 miles from my grandparents. I spent many a day in their small town Arkansas, so I could easily imagine the setting in which Adam grew up.<br /><br />As I read further, I became absorbed in the life of this young man who was reared with strong family support and had a natural propensity for protecting the underdog. I grieved as he followed a girl he loved into a dark world far from that of his upbringing. My heart was broken with his parents as I imagined how they must have felt they were losing their son. But while many a life has been cut short by these same imprudent decisions, this was just the beginning of Adam Brown's story.<br /><br />Fearless is an amazing story of a prodigal returned, of bondage liberated, of addiction battled and of ultimate patriotism. Perhaps the life of Adam Brown can be summarized by his own words,<br /> \\"The truly courageous and powerful never have to prove it. It is always shown in their actions.\\"
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|It is written in a similar way to 'The Goal' by Eliyahu Goldratt, i.e. as a non technical novel.<br />It is great to read and explains the concept very well by putting it in the same chain as Toyota production system, Lean manufacturing, Agile development, etc.<br /><br />This book is must for anyone in Operations but also very important for developers; they will understand better what's going on with their software after they release it.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|I have absolutely loved all the books he has ever written - my favorite author, and my favorite book is Pillars of the Earth.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|These really make the history come alive.  Too bad so much death has happened in the name of 'religion' and 'God.'
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Cool+I think it should have a mode where you are the inspecter.and more caricters.and more day's. for the world tour.and pick where the world tour is.I think there shoud be a jet pack for the whole time. And I think there shoud be cool inspecters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addictive and so much fun.  I play every chance I get. My husband and friends all play love this game
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Brilliant! Keeps you guessing, involved, and racing to the next page. Can't wait for the next one (:  Keep them coming.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After watching the movie twice at the theater, I bought this book and stayed up the whole night reading it. I've since watched it again twice on PPV!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surf this is the best game ever. Just keep more coming up with more mission.. one thing make the people faster
B00632HWOG|2.0|It would be better if I could switch between email accounts. I find it will occassionaly lock up and no matter which sccount is selected, will only show account first opened in app.<br /><br />Since leaving above review I have noticed I can now switch between accounts.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you are an aspiring author, like me, and want to publish an e-book, this guide will walk you through on what you need to do!
B000MX7V5M|5.0|What a wonderful movie.  One of my all-time favorites.  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are amazing.  Even my children like this &#34;old&#34; movie.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This is the third movie I've detected in this line, the first being Jack Nicholson's &#34;About Schmidt&#34;;  It seems DeNiro was in another one more recently---old men taking road trips to get together with their kids after the Wife dies.  In this send up, the Wife is still very much kicking.  Meryl Streep, our leading chameleon, is now about as frowsy a housewife as could be, and still be respectable.  She's well worn, yet smarter than her perpetually cheerful demeanor would seem to indicate, and she wants a marriage, or more specifically Her Marriage, back.  Her curmudgeon of a husband, perfectly played by Tommy Lee Jones, has the occasional fantasy---apparently featuring a neighbor--but no interest in his wife, whatsoever.  So she books a flight to Maine, to see a renowned relationship counsellor, for them both, and takes off without him, having given her husband the Ultimatum.<br /><br />It's not an adventurous film, aside from having older actors, no nudity, sex, violence or special effects (apart from Ms. Streeps makeup).  It's funny, touching, and sometimes a bit sad, by turns.  It'd make a great afternoon film.  Of a similar vein, one could go to the radio program &#34;This American Life&#34;, to it's archives (a few years back now), and look up the title &#34;Someone To Watch Over Me&#34;, where the second show in that program features a retired SF Bay Area cop and his wife, in the rut of ruts, until she decides to go to Mexico with her girl friend.  Now that was hilarious.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|Great if you are a teen, maybe college person.  Not really for me.  Singing was good but was expecting more laughs from the reviews.  Slightly disappointed.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|SciFi?  This is a Matt Damon film, which means it strives to be a thinking mans Hollywood entertainment.  That translates to giving what is essentially God, and the Angels, new corporate working titles, like The Chairman, and The Adjustment Bureau.  And they wear retro-cool clothes out of \\"Men In Black\\", no robes and sandals.  No wings, either, but they've got doors.<br /><br />So God, I mean the Chairman, has a plan.  The Plan.  But the Plan changes every now and then, no one knows why, and apparently Damon and Blunt were to have met and fallen in love, but now the Plan has changed and that isn't in the works.  One of Angels, I mean the Adjusters, is still on Suburban time though, and doesn't get his butt where it's supposed to be, so when Damon spills his coffee, it's on Blunt, not in Washington Square.<br /><br />Now it turns out, when this sort of thing happens, the Angels, I mean Adjusters, come in and basically clean it up by wiping out everyone's memory, no harm done.  Except when someone like Damon's character comes along, and sees too much, and then they simply confess and warn him about what will happen if he doesn't get with the program.<br /><br />Of course, Damon's character does not get with the program, and it turns out that if you can reach God, I mean the Chairman...<br /><br />Terry Gilliam and much of Monty Python did a low-brow (and low budget) version of this back in the eighties with \\"Time Bandits\\" where a marauding group of also-not-called-angels, with God's Plan, drop through its holes and loot history, from Napoleon to the sinking Titanic, with, as it turns out, God following them to fix the holes.  Hired hackers as we'd call them today.<br /><br />Both are entertaining films, I think I'd prefer \\"Time Bandits\\" as it doesn't go to quite the pretense of not being able to say what it's characters are, but then again, look at how many folks saw this film as SciFi.  Lotta KoolAid going 'round...
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|Got into this after it came out - it was a Thanksgiving day marathon - unplanned.  Great series and the characters / writing is great.  There are some flat spots, to be expected for this type of series, but not many.  For the most part, the episodes, start calm but end excited which brings you back for the next episode.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a good game but it constantly crashes I reached 4 million and it crashed; took all of my gems and did not save my score.. This needs to be fixed.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Me and my grandkids love this movie, you should add it to your library!  The more I watch it, the more I like it.
B0013TO3HS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. Some people read to much in it, and think it is anti Christian. To me it is a fantasy, well thought out and delivered. Pity they did not make more movies.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|It was cute, i expected a lil more, but over all a good movie.  My grandkids seemed to love it.
B000OLV97I|5.0|Another fantastic fantasy movie, that did not get enough positive reviews. The books are a great read, pity only one movie made. Loved it, and would have liked more. Film makers, should realize, there are more fantasy and scifi lovers out here than they think.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Good app. Works wonders on me falling asleep. Wish there were a few more sound options like rain without birds or another clock. Other than that It's great.
B0060D0S12|5.0|Fantastic, enjoyable movie. Great for kids, and adults alike. New twist on a classic theme. Would recommend it to all scifi lovers old or young.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the first game i buy every time i get a new electronic even though it costs 2.00$ more every time i buy it its Worth it and to the creators add red stone plz
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ive been looking around and tried a few app for horse care and stuff...this is the best one and i love the graphics. As soon as i saw the horse walking towards me my mouth dropped at the way the horses physical muscles movements. Simply amazing...As if i were standing there...Thanks for an amazing app guys.
B008K9UZY4|2.0|Past:  As a kid, I actually owned the original game on my Sega CD way back when.  Beat it.  Finished.  Loved it.  Great memories.<br /><br />Present:  Bought this on impulse on Amazon.  Didn't read any reviews first because I thought I knew what I was getting and it couldn't possibly be a letdown.  When I tried to install the game on my tablet with 512mb RAM total, it would not install due to insufficient free space.  So if you have a cheap generic Android tablet like me with low internal memory then don't expect this to install.  It requires LOTS of space apparently and as fun as I know it can be, I'm not willing to take everything else off just to play Sonic.<br /><br />Future:  Some day when I upgrade to a new Android device I may be able to enjoy this.  For now it remains an unused purchase.<br /><br />For now, 2 stars.  1 for being ussless to me as is.  2 for actually being a decent game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not the typical Stephen King novel, but this book was awesome! Even though it was typical Stephen King LONG, I couldn't put it down!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Unfortunately i am stuck and the hint button is not helping.  Good graphics<br /> and sound . Hopefully  i will figure  it out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the best story I have read in recent memory. I read the first free book and then I was hooked. If in doubt try the free first book.  If you like it go ahead and buy the omnibus because it only gets better.  Great story with excellent believable characters.  Highly recommended!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved it from start to finish. Travis will steal you heart!  He is the perfect bad boy! Abby will make you smile & Scream. She is a sweetheart but has an edge. Their story will take you to he'll and back. You won't be able to stop reading. It is now one of my favorite books. You have to read it.......
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie, cool concept, lots of action. Great if you like action/ sci-fi. Try not not to get into a philosophical debate with your friends and family, hahaha!
007174889X|5.0|This item fulfils absolutely ma expectation. I´m an physician in primary healthcare and therefore I need this outstanding handbook as the work of reference for my profession. I can only recommend it to all physician either in primary care or in hospital. According my opinion is \\"Harrison´s Principles ...\\" one of the best book for internal medicine.
B000I186FW|5.0|An amazing movie! Worth every penny! Great movie and very entertaining and enlightening! Your government should be afraid of it's people!
B009IEXKXI|3.0|Filled with great wit and moves at a good pace. Reads like a geek-engineer's dream.  Endless details about how a lone astronaut solves problems with brains and duct tape.  As another reviewer has already noted, it has a \\"MacGiver\\" feel to it. However, the duct tape stories dominate most of the book and it gets old.  Surprised by the number of typos still left in the text.  Thought they would have all been fixed by now.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Considering this and the north part of a dance with dragons, was supposed to be a 150 page prologue, I am so happy he decided to play out these events.  This books sets up further books so well and masterfully depicts the notions and plots of major characters.  The detail that was given I'm sure will benefit down the road.
B008B92U32|4.0|This app is really well done and fun to mess around with. All that's missing is the option to use two photos, and having an undo option for when you make a mistake. I will increase rating to 5 Stars if those are rectified.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I had lost all faith in Hollywood's ability to produce decent animated films after the let down of Wreck-It Ralph, Cars 2, and Brave. But Rise of the Guardians made me feel like a kid again. This is just one of those movies you want to watch over and over again because it just puts a big 'ole smile on your face and makes you believe all over again. I am extremely disappointed it didn't even get nominated for an Oscar but oh well, it is still the best family movie of 2012. A must watch!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great time passer have loved playing it on my android tablet. Is not hard to learn very easy to keep playing.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks delivered again.  It was a suspenseful exciting book filled with great description.  This was on my to read list, but when I saw that they had made it into a movie, I ran out and grabbed a copy.  An enjoyable read for sure.
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|Service from the merchant was excellent, but the series was marginal and left off with an &#34;up in the air&#34; finale.  Seems all the cast did was fight with one another, and the &#34;Ancient's Super Ship&#34; should have been capable of so much more, as the series should have been.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Sick at home I thought I'd watch an episode and then just jump in when the season starts again. I ended up buying all available episodes in Season 3 and can't wait til February 10th! Man, this show is good.
B0092G1O8A|3.0|Get blasted in the ass by the Hunger Games.  Your friends will bewilder you by how much of an ass blast they will feed your butt.
0345803507|5.0|I like reading the books.  The price was good, the book was in excellent condition, very happy with the purchase.
B005HSL626|4.0|Nothing bad about it. I dont play it that often. but it is good.  If you want a game to waste some time on get it. :)
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Loved the movie the first time at the theater, and still enjoy watching it.  Good price for it.  love it.
B009E9QOEO|3.0|Considering the band member's ages...it was amazing. I thought JP Jones' bass playing and sound was flawless. Jason Bonham's playing was great but not nearly as good as his father. Towards the end of the set, he was off...a little too slow. Plant's vocals were so/so...some songs came across as strong, others weak...but he gave it his all and was excellent considering his age. I love Jimmy Page...huge fan! His playing is solid and better than most if not all guitarists out there today...but his guitar sound was not rich with texture...just loud and and too heavy...too much distortion and high pitched electronic noises throughout. Jimmy gave it his all...the band gave it their all. However, it's sad to listen to...it pales in comparison to Zeppelin's greatness heard in The Song Remains The Same or the Led Zeppelin DVD set. What was missing were the long trademark improvisations by Page. But overall it was a solid performance that I'll listen to every now and then. I prefer to listen and remember the Zeppelin from the 1970's NOT the 2000's. It would have been better to not put out a dvd or cd of this show in my opinion.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever. You Can build tons of things. All they need is bigger maps and it would be the best.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I don't usually watch TV. I'm a reader. BUT from the time I started watching the first episode until I finished Season 3, I didn't even pick up a book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|couldn't put the book down - read it in one day.<br />the characters were believeable real.<br />loved the ending.<br />recommend highly.
0345803485|1.0|qQthis is for a young teenage girl.  very poorly written.  thought my IQ was dropping as I listening to the audio. glad I was able to check it out from the library instead of wasting any money on it.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I cannot get the update to install on my kindle. I do not appear to be the only one. Wish I could cancel the update, but it won't let me.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Depicts life and the turns it takes raising a child and finding out that you really don't know him ....life seems set and then ....it effects the past, present and future.
B0086700CM|4.0|This is a fun easy game to learn and play. Worth having on your device. Would highly recommend it to young and old gamers
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I chose this product for the price. I'm pleased with the product and received it in a timely manner. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it.
B000002HH9|4.0|it seemed to fake itself. as if robert was trying to bring the zing of kiss me back. yet it had the gloom of wish..kinda wierd
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This has to be one of the all time great movies about cowboys and the life and hardships they endured in the settling of the west.  This movie really has it all from the toughness of the life style to the love and tender moments they also endured. A bit long but worth every minute spent watching it.
B000TNQCPU|4.0|roberts most eccentric work. it captures something he could never catch again. maby 1987 was the last good ol american year
B004K4IZ54|5.0|Good sci-fi movie with great special effects.  I have the 3D version and it is awesome compared to the DVD version
B000002H2Z|4.0|a wonder the first half and a complete run down the second. these guys got lazy habits at times. kewl;
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Just had to have this to go with the series I have. Came in with very little waiting period, very satisfied with all of amazons orders. So far no regrets.
B000002UTT|5.0|shes a lttle bit dangerous. shes got the moves and of course the look. a must listen in your repituour
B00742GBDM|5.0|I have watched Mansfield Park more than once! It is not for a lack of an excellent selection of movies, but truly the ability to see something different and interesting everytime I view it. The plot is so rich and unfolds so elequently that I am in awe of the manner in which the English lifestyle was lived. In it there is a scene where the main character finally shows his true feelings -it is truly lovely.  Purchasing this dvd should be one of those movies you add to a great collection. The only other movie I compare it to is Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. Both are keepers!
B0034KZE9U|5.0|My first pair of crocs! After getting a heel spur in Dec decided i would try anything- well i did... nothing comes close  to the almost instant relief i get from my crocs - i just ordered the white and the alice work little black shoe and i am sold!!! by relief, comfort, light weight, easy to clean...
B00008WT5C|5.0|I love this CD, the outside case was a little worn, but all in all no skips on the CD itself, which is what counts.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is so fun. I can't put it down after playing. The graphics are great and the whole concept behind this game is awesome.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|We just love this movie so much!  It never gets old we could watch it over and over.  Which says a lot we don't watch most of our movies anymore. Every time it played on hbo before we bought the bluray we always had to stop there and watch it no matter how far it was into it.<br /><br />You punched me in the boob!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All you is smart 20 20 eyes remiber to left and right and up and down how many times you jump and slide move quickly or you crash if get hit but if and you going better get quickly on your feet remover out to the left really close you have a good idea to git throw than don't come in 1st or past people than get 1st put you got to be smart.
B0046MOVD0|2.0|I think extinction was the last good resident evil movie. This one they played into the 3D too much. It just feels really cheesy. As much as I love Milla Jovovich I think this is the last resident evil I'll buy. They just feel so cheesy now.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely hate reading books, but this book was recommended to me by my teacher... I read it in a full day. It was hard to put this book down and live my life today. It is so amazingly written and very shocking as well appealing. Thank you for being a great author and letting me know there is a such thing as a wonderful book.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|For the price of the Plantronics headset this case should be included with. I use it for when i have to travel with it in my bag or packed. It's not thing so great but it does protect the headset when not wearing it. The price was good! But should come with the headset.. Good buy on here!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I play it all day I love I recommend it to anyone! Please get this game for your enjoyment
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I got hooked on the first book,  the second was a little better.  This one far outshines the previous two.  I hope the rest of the series is as good.
B00992CF6W|2.0|I love this game but i recently found out that i have been missing out on the UPDATES please fix this Amazon appstore.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Everyone needs to read this amazing book! I would recommend it to anyone that questions life like I do. Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app,it's so fun and interesting. If you love horse apps,then this is the perfect app for you !!!
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Got it for the kids but they say it's too hard and opt for the other Angry Birds apps.  Maybe in the future.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My kids begged me for this game.  They are hooked on it.  Play it every chance they get.  Love to watch them play and have even been known to launch a few birds myself.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Haven't had it long but my husband checks this every morning along with many weather sites.  Says this one is really good.  I check the weather for family members all over the US.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I found this third part in the modern &#34;Dark Knight&#34; movie series really disappointing and much too predictable.  The portrayal of a bothered and beaten super-hero was carried out too long and depressing.  The violence tried to make up for the slow-moving part in the first third or first half of the movie.  I enjoyed the first two in the &#34;Dark Knight&#34; series far, far better in terms of their story lines and action than this third installment.  Anne Hathaway is a wonderful &#34;eye candy&#34; but her role (not acting) is weak.  Marion Cotillard's smoldering beauty is absolutely stunning.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I have always loved Clint Eastwood movies, Now in his later years Clint is still acerbic as ever, but with a soft side the viewers are permitted to enjoy.  This is just one of those feel good movies after all that combines my favorite kind of sports-related theme with letting the bad guys eat their own dirt in the end.  Appropriate for all viewers except maybe very young children.
B001AG52AG|4.0|I read the whole trilogy and thought they did a good job of capturing Pullman's books.Too bad the Magisteria put enough pressure on the studio to not do the other books.However,the cgi would have been major for the other books.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this version of Angry Birds.  It gives the back story and is just fun.  The only problem I see is it would be better if the screen was...bigger.
0316228532|3.0|I want to like this book. I really do. It is well written, and the device of killing off the most important character as a way to open the book is brilliant, but I don't like or care about these characters and can't maintain enough interest in the story to finish the book, despite multiple starts.
0525958002|4.0|This is a easy breezy quick read so Taylor does know how to write. His story is pretty fascinating given he was in one of the iconic bands of the '80s--Duran Duran--and he lived that sex,drugs and rock 'n' roll lifestyle. Just don't expect lurid tales of his conquests. It's not that kind of book. It's more about who he was then and who he is now.<br /><br />It's pretty wild to learn about how early on he could have bucketloads of money yet still be living at home because he, frankly, was on the road or recording so much he never really had time to find his own place until a bit further along in life than many of us. His frank discussion of his father's post traumatic WWII  generation and how having a churchgoing Catholic mother shaped him is very sympathetic and he doesn't play the blame-the-parents game for his drug abuse.<br /><br />All in all you get the feeling Taylor was never full of himself thanks to those working class roots and even if you weren't into the fashion or music of Duran Duran you cannot read this and helped by be admired at how bloody hard they worked at their \\"jobs\\" and see why they became such a success globally.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the most funnest game ever! It is llike Temple Run but your on the subway and there are different places you can go on like Rio or New York. Try It!!
B0004Z33EG|5.0|I am reviewing [[ASIN:B0004Z33EG First Blood]] and [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]] in a man-fest film appreciation double-feature.<br /><br />Released soon after the third installment of the Rocky franchise, this first Rambo film is by far the best of the lot, absent the heavy jingoism of the sequels. Casting Stallone in the familiar David-against-Goliath role works well here, particularly with the Jerry Goldsmith score. Whatever people may say about Sly and his limited range, he has always played the underdog well. Strong cast, especially Brian Dennehy and Richard Crenna.<br /><br />The film steers clear of killing Rambo; the book's ending was clearly not made-for-Hollywood. Rest assured, the final monologue here packs plenty of figurative punch. Relevant social commentary on Vietnam, too, a scant eight years after the U.S. withdrawal.<br /><br />The previous ([[ASIN:B0000640S1 Special Edition]]) release from Artisan is the one with author David Morrell's scholarly commentary. This Ultimate Edition makes do with an excellent track from Stallone--particularly enjoyed when he called Dennehy a \\"crazy circus bear\\"--as well as a couple deleted scenes.<br /><br />Predator is a better movie, First Blood is a better film. Does that make sense? Who cares, watch both.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the best game. The world tour is so fun for my daughter she beggs to play it is fun action packed great.
B000244EMO|5.0|I am reviewing [[ASIN:B0004Z33EG First Blood]] and [[ASIN:B000244EMO Predator]] in a man-fest film appreciation double-feature.<br /><br />Possibly the pinnacle of Arnold's non-Terminator film career, Predator was a 1987 steroidal action adventure. This has everything you could want in a period action flick: guns, helicopters, guns, explosive explosions, guns, massive muscles, guns, and more guns. It also has plenty of classic one-liners: \\"I ain't got time to bleed!\\" \\"Get to the choppa!\\"<br /><br />Predator also boasts Stan Winston's special effects, which garnered an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. Augmenting the classic FX were new optical effects; the Predator's camouflage and its thermal imaging are still captivating. Suspenseful pacing aided by the Alan Silvestri score keeps things moving, and the film is just plain fun, even if it's completely unbelievable. Arnold was right when he said, \\"I liked the idea of starting out with an action-adventure, but then coming in with some horror and science fiction.\\"<br /><br />Lots of bonus features on this 2-disc Collector's Edition, including a not overly great Director's Commentary.<br /><br />Predator is a better movie, First Blood is a better film. Does that make sense? Who cares, watch both.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and highly recomanded for horse lover's fun game nothing bad about it its fun I love to race and enter compintions
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is one of my favorite games I play it all of the time and I hope they add more updates (P.S. it is worth the $7 and I would gladly pay $20 for the game.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is a great book and would recommend it to anyone else looking for an easy read to get lost in!
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Well written, but a little too detailed and lengthy.  Still, I enjoyed learning so much about the period and would recommend it to any history buff (as I am).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! Its very kid friendly and has super cute characters. My brother and I adore this game!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Excellent.  Kept my attention and ended on a high note.  Sparks books get better and better, each time I read them.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Game of thrones book series, and as all book fans, was very nervous to see the TV adaptation. That being said, HBO did an amazing job on this series! True die hards will be disappointed as there are some plot/character changes, but I was expecting that and found it could have been a lot worse. The casting is excellent. George Martin had major input on this series, and it really shows. I would recommend viewers to read the books before you watch the show. It will make sense if you have never read the books, but I felt that I understood SO much more because I had read them. Just small things that wouldn't mean anything to someone just watching the show have great meaning to people who have read the books. This series is not for the faint of heart, as there is lots of violence and nudity (it is HBO after all). As long as you are cool with that this is a must watch!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This is a great series and was purchased for a low price.  It is nice to take your mind of all of life's troubles and watch is series.
030758836X|4.0|This book is one that will keep you guessing. No spoilers here, but even when I thought I had it figured out (in the last few pages) the author still managed to shock me. The chapters alternate between the two main characters, so fair warning to people who like their books in one voice. I would qualify this as an easy read, yet it still surprised me. Gillian Flynn puts you in a troubled marriage and gives you the point of views of the husband and wife at different time periods, views that seriously conflict each other. Good read that will get the wheels in your head turning!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|A real family fun movie.  Has a great story line which does not disappoint.  It is a fresh idea on all classic monsters and their families spending time together, just one added twist was a human entering this group of monsters.  Love the line up of actors in this movie.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I would recommend this product to any one who loves magic and fantasy.  The movie is excellent for adults and children.  I loved it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played I wish I coud always get games like this trust me if I love it you would to I am like a personal game tester
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this app. I prefer this to Temple Run. Can't say that I like Rio as much as the original, but still a blast.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like it, but after playing it a few times, it keeps crashing on my kindle fire and won't come back up!!
B009ZABU7S|5.0|Out of all the apps I tried, this is the best one. Easy to use and very nice and proffesionally made.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|I enjoyed the original DVD although quality was terrible. This one is dyanmic and high definition. I enjoy the sound too.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My grandson downloaded this app so he could play it on a road trip.....but when I asked him to remove it, he said &#34;Grammy, you'd LOVE it, so I'll show you how to delete it if you want, but also am going to show you how to play it!&#34;.....and he did. And I do. And Papa does too! There are several game types, several levels in each game, of course, you can't go to the next level til you get the one before it!! And as the levels get higher in #, they get harder!! But passes the time for me when I want fun. Silly kid's game, but addictive to adults too!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Great game, but it seldom loads for me. Plus there are too many random ads. That's all I got to say about that.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my title explanes it ALL. I LOVED THIS GAME CAUSE IT IS SO LIFE LIKE DOWNLOAD IT NOW. I AM ADDICTIDE TOBTHE GAME!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app can be so awesome at tomes but then he gs stuck and doesn't let you know when it needs to be updated. It also erased your score trophies and other things when you get to a certain level. Needs to managed better!
B005JZBP8W|2.0|Very poor quality, having problems viewing the DVD. Towards the end of the DVD the image stayd still on several ocasions...
B000001FT2|5.0|This is an album that perfectly captures the dark, delicious, decadent feel of a great night of bar-hopping and dancing, including the 4 A.M. hangover afterwards. And the music? Fantastic! You gotta love the percussion and rhythmic touches in these tracks, which are innovative and anything but standard issue. It's a classic album of its time. I saw her perform once live at a gay bar, and after her performance she came right out on the dancefloor and danced among us (with one of her blonde hunk boyfriends, and she could attract them in droves!)  We were young, and a guy I'd been dancing with dared me to go out and \\"touch\\" her, so I did, and she just smiled and laughed,a very unpretentious lady. It struck me that she was a romantic sort of woman, not just the ultra-eccentric, cool as ice tough-chick that's all part of her act. We loved her! And this album, which includes the great \\"Pull Up to the Bumper\\" and the moody \\"Walking in the Rain\\" is my favorite of all that she has done; it's brilliant, in fact.
B00008WT5E|3.0|I bought this CD for the song Sin City. I'm a huge Bon Scott era AC/DC fan but after listening to the album I realized that Sin City was the best song on there and only a couple others came close. For die hard Bon Scott-AC/DC fans it's worth it to add this album to your collection but it's definitely one of the weaker albums this lineup released.
B004ZN9RWK|5.0|A masterpiece probably needs no review. This is, to me, the most brilliant rock album ever made. It manages to expresses everything a spirit in the material world needs expressed in one album. I totally get those who would disagree: the Stones, the Beatles, Led Zep; I'm a fan of them all, but no single album makes my skin ripple and tingle like this one. Listen carefully to the most brilliant introduction to an album ever made. We all know there is such a thing as rock art; here is its pinnacle, an immortal album that expresses the scope of human feeling, melancholia, and angst with awesome, transcendent power. It will never leave the Billboard charts, or any other charts: it is timeless.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Loved it f f d.  D.  S h sorry had to have more words h h h h h h
B0082FPIY8|5.0|i could not put down this book.a true epic story of a brave woman on a great journey[s}.If you like adventure and long distance trails this book is for you.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|.The quality is just as good as seeing it on tv's Masterpiece Theater. The case is easy to use,and DVDS are clearly labeled.<br />I would recomend it to all my friends. I found nothing to dislike about the product. The Masterpiece: Downton Abbey Seacon 2 comes with three DVDS and they are all in one easy to open and easy to store case.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game. It is really addictive. The reason I gave it 3 stars is the fact that it will not open on my kindle fire. When it does open it takes forever to load the game. I recommend this game because it is really fun but it does have some compilations.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I won't buy extras but I still like it better than the other games I have played like this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun because its for people all ages and size and I like it because I got to the score 29283
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The reason why I am doing this is because its awesome and relly fun actually its so fun that I actually think I'm addicted to it. So I am actually love this game
0316228532|4.0|I had a hard time rating this book (three stars and a half) because many parts are worth 5 stars and it's wonderfully written, but, for some weird reason, overall it lacks the magic (pun intended) and tension of Harry Potter. I enjoyed the writing but didn't care much about the story or the characters. The structure is such that there are no main heroes, it's a well done human fresco of the people of a small British city, featuring many 'small characters'. I imagine the author wanted to show/prove that she can write an excellent serious book, in a different style, with different heroes, and she fully achieved her aims. You need to have time and patience for this book, and although you'll savor it in small doses for the great insights into various types of people - J K Rawlings is an astute observer of human nature - you'll struggle a bit to finish it. It's a book you won't lovem but you'll highly appreciate.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|Light reading and reminder how habits are formed and become part of our<br />daily reactions to situations.  Very worth while.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|what is its problem now it wont open and now I cant play it n it wont delete it just get stuck there. it sucked my god.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book helps to fill in the blanks in my reading about Lincoln.  The information is<br />written in a logical manner.  Well worth reading.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse takes  you on a magical adventure filled with lessons of virtue, selflessness and nurture. you will enjoy taking care of these majestic thoroughbreds as though they were your own. great game if you enjoy taking care of animals.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I enjoy her humor and it is fun to read her writings.  I like being able to pick up<br />her book and read it when I want some lightness in my day.  Thanks.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Does not work anymore. Not sure what happened. Type in search field and it crashes. Pain in the buns. Paid for it and used all the time. Now it is useless. Expensive too.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I enjoy the ease in watching the series on my own terms.  I have been very pleased<br />with the recordings and enjoy the absence of commercials.  Thanks.
B0052BZ6X8|5.0|It lends itself to a sequel. I hope one will be fourth coming. Really enjoyed the story line. Would recommend it.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|I've watched this movie many times over the years and I never tire of it. Each scene is a masterpiece of film-making. I've recommended this movie to people in their twenties who had never seen it-and they were after seeing it, simply, astonished. Certainly, films of this quality nowadays are far and few between.
0307593525|5.0|All the cooking tips and shortcuts are great.  I have learned so much...who knew dicing onions could be so easy??  I recommend this set for those who love to cook, and those who don't.  There is something for everyone here.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I finally reached a my high score at 2 million then it just went to the main menu I am a little disappointed but I still like the game :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is my most favorite book that I have in a long long time. 5 stars hip hip hooray best book EVER!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love that i can wake up to my own songs from my playlist or use a preselected tone. i also like that i can control the backlight of the screen
B006BDHAX0|4.0|It's pretty good. The re-shuffles frustrate me, but besides that fun game :) I haven't had th  shut down issues others have had.
0812550706|5.0|This is the second best sci-fi book I've ever read. The protaganist who carries the burden of saving the world ranges in age from 6-11 during the course of the book. Reminds me of my favorite sci book - The Psychic Golfer - where the protagonist who is the last hope to save humanity is a teenager. The concept for this book is unique and the writing is as good as it gets. I couldn't put the book down and then revelations late in the book just totally blew me away.I had to run around and tell people about the Wows I was experiencing. The character development of so many great characters is astounding. The author certainly knew how a child's mind works. He also knows how the various strings of character built into a child grow and play out in the flawed adults they become as rulers of the world. This has been a classic for a long time, but if you're like me and just recently heard about it, it's a sure bet, you'll love it. Tons of talent in this writer.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I am obsessed with Suits. If you have not watched it yet, you are missing out! My favorite show, hands down.
0767812387|5.0|I love all listed, but will not continue if you insist on more for each OK???? I am tired period

B009UX2YAC|4.0|Okay I'm so addicted to this game I'm fifteen and I think it's an awesome gamer for everyone I bought it for free and I can not step playing it. The kids o baybydsit for love to play it too
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is such a awesome game its ferry appropriate its perfect for five year old s I would hog let two year old s thou ferry cool
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Graphics are clean, bright and fun. Controls are super responsive. Gameplay is dead on and addictive. Only issue is how long it takes to accrue coins, even with the $5 bonus.
B008B92U32|1.0|Just like a lot of other reviews said, &quot;It doesn't work!&quot;. Trying to pick a picture just makes the screen blink than go back to the main screen with 2 options. Nothing happens. Doesn't work on OG Evo 4G. Think some of these reviews were made by the dev as it's been done on so many other apps. Glad I didn't pay for it. Uninstalling!!!
0062011847|3.0|Having been an avid reader and collector of the Discworld novels over many, many years, I was very excited when this novel came out. However, it really isn't one of the better ones. The characters are a little bit flatter than I've been used to over the years, and the storyline seems to drag. In some places, it almost seems a little contrived: something I've never really found with his other books, no matter how farfetched the plot.<br /><br />It's still an enjoyable book to read, and I wouldn't skip it for the world, but's probably more a factor of my loyalty to the series than this particular book. It was one of the only ones I took several weeks to read, rather than devouring in a single night, which is perhaps more a testament to his other works than a particular deficit of this one.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I am a huge fan of this collection!  Will soon be buying the 2 parts of breaking dawn as well!!!!
B002SYXCVK|5.0|I loved the tone of this album, it was beautiful and took the listener on a journey though the songs. I bought it because of Christmas, but it's not really a Christmas album: more of a winter album, which is great.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Play this. So addicting. Just like yeah yeah why yeah yeah baby come on me and play a fiddle. Hmmmm baby umm oh yeHahh
B006LSZECO|5.0|Engrossing, edge of your seat, stay up all night reading.... An amazing portrayal of a marriage, a family, a town...<br /><br />nick and Amy have a perfect, golden existence until the recession and his mother's illness upended their world. Does disappointment and bitterness turn charming and likable Nick into a killer?<br /><br />You will be gripped by the prose, the plot, the characters. At the end I immediately felt the need to re read this incredible book.<br /><br />Don't buy this unless you are prepared to neglect your life until you are done reading!,
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|If you're a fan of Bujold's SF works (by far her best), then Captain Vorpatril's Alliance represents another successful part of the work. If you're not? Well, go buy The Warrior's Apprentice or the Young Miles omnibus and give it a shot. The characterization, world-building, balance of technology, and exploration of how humans react to technological and social innovation is second to none in the Vorkosigan series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really like this show.  I love the writing and the acting.  Very addictive. Can't stay away from watching it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game I have this on my kindle fire and my phone I highly reccomend this game for all ages

031236198X|5.0|This is an awesome book of fun-filled learning about leadership.  How could penguins teach about leadership, you ask?  Well, read and find out what they can teach us.  The book is a fun and easy read and is highly recommended.
0515142247|4.0|Love Jack Reacher novels.  This was one of Lee Child's best.<br />Want to see the movie Jack Reacher although I can't see Tom Cruise as Jack.<br />Sorry Tom Cruise.  Maybe I'll change my mind when I see it.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Interesting animal training behaviors described and explained in an unusual story of a shipwreck ; tiger and boy survive at sea.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun. It is the game that I play the most. You can bye characters,money,boards,power ups, and lots of other things! You can try to save  up money and bye really expensive things or bye UN- expensive things!!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this entire production!!  So emotional, glorious voices, beautiful music accompaniment.  I can not recommend it enough.  It is a classic you will never tire of.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is one the best science fiction books I've read in a long time. I couldn't put the book down. The idea of the story is very original. The book is extremely well written and the characters are well developed. I can't wait to read more in the Ender series of books.
B001NBEWN6|5.0|This was a gorgeous book. I loved and was moved by the story. But this was a case of the Kindle version having so many typos that it was distracting and interfered with my enjoyment of reading. At one point, after introducing a character called &#34;Chacko&#34;, I found another character called &#34;Ghacko.&#34; I spent a bit of time re-reading to convince myself that this was also a typo. Read the book, but not the Kindle version.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I see a lot of negative opinions about this game but I love it. Yes it's not completely free but it seems like the people who don't like this have no patience. I earn coins fairly quickly so that's not a problem. Unlike some people say you don't have to pay diamonds to open a room you find certain objects and it opens. If you have patience you will find ways to love this game. I love it and I haven't spent any real money. Some people just don't have the patience to wait. And yes you look for same objects but they rearrange them. Try it I love it. If you don't like it delete it. It's
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game on the kindle fire Hd. The scene keeps changing which makes it more fun I love this game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Plays great and is a ah some show it is always going to be a must watch on my list of things to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All my friends have this app and they all love it. Some people say it's a rip off of temple run, but it's not! But don't delete this off of your device unless you want to delete all your progress. Otherwise it's a great game and I play it all the time!!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Good app. It lets me get to the site without having to go to the computer. I would use it often.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A most interesting and emotionally fulfilling wartime aviation docu-story from WWII. Extremely engaging.  Replete with very little known, often sad, facts from the German side.  Perhaps the best and most impactful book on WWII aviation history I have ever come across.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|The author is amazing! Great series so far - would recommend to all my friends ( which I have =) )
B003MC5AV2|3.0|Penny Lane and her friends find clever ways to deal with teenage boys and narrow minded school administrators.  It was fun to read.  Life can be really tough at that age.
B004XMMSZG|3.0|For years I've been using a Belkin 30 pin car adapter cable for an older 2nd gen iPod.  This car adapter plugs into the cigarette lighter for power and has a 3.5mm audio jack on the cigarette lighter portion of the cable to connect the stereo to via a 3.5mm male connection.  That audio connection is how I get the signal to the back of a stock Chevy stereo system.  I would connect my iPod to the Belkin cable and it would charge and route audio to my system.<br /><br />With the purchase of an iPhone 5 with Lightning connection my setup wouldn't work.  Unfortunately, Belkin hasn't made a new car cable with Lightning.  I was fortunate to find the Dockboss Air.  I simply attached the DB Air to the end of my Belkin cable and I'm able to enjoy music from my iPhone 5 using Bluetooth.  The setup looks no different than mounting the DB Air to the 30 pin connector on an iHome stereo dock.<br /><br />Pairing was very easy and took maybe a minute to complete.  The sound quality is fantastic, no different than the direct wire connection.<br /><br />My only issue is with reconnecting upon getting back into my vehicle.  I read that it should auto pair/connect when getting into range of the DB Air, this is not the case.  I was hoping it would work like my Bluetooth headset...turn it on and it connects.  In my set up the vehicle does supply constant 12v to the Belkin cable which means the DB Air should always have power, similar to a in home Bose or iHome appliance. Without the auto connect I have to go into Settings/Bluetooth on the iPhone and choose DB Air to get it to connect.  It's kind of inconvenient to go into settings every time I step into my vehicle and want to listen to music.<br /><br />I've been working with Cablejive on the issue and they sent me another one thinking their was an issue with my DB Air.  I just got it last night and tested it out.  Unfortunately, it's doing the same thing.<br /><br />I then decided to test with my son's iHome alarm clock/speaker system, it did the same thing and the audio was crap, it kept cutting out.  I then plugged in the DB Air into a 30 pin dock connected to my home stereo.  I repaired and the audio sounded great but the bluetooth connection issue remained.  To test it I powered down the iPhone and powered back up.  The iPhone should have connected to the DB Air but it did the same thing as in my vehicle...nothing.  I had to go back into Settings/Bluetooth and click the DB Air to get it to connect.<br /><br />Overall the product is good and the sound quality is great.  If you don't mind having to reconnect each time then get it.  I'd give it 5 stars if Cablejive can come up with a fix.  A one click app to connect the Bluetooth would even be an option, better than the current 3 step process.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I ordered this movie through Amazon instant video and the 'playing' of this movie was TERRIBLE.  The movie stopped and restarted 5 times.....the movie should have taken 1.5 hours to play .....with all the stops and starts it took over 3 hours. This doesn't happen with other amazon prime movies/tv shows or on netflix.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book displays such amazing writing almost without flaw. I simply cannot believe how good a writer she is. Twists and turns at every corner
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Teens are expected to do something insane and still look good doing it.  Intertwined in the story are the normal identity questions teens face along with the need to stay alive and kill opponents.  In another way this story is a warning that when the state has assumed so much power it can make evil look normal,even good.  Scary given the power grab this administration is doing today.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is so much fun and it is better than the original TR. But it is a bit buggy which is irritating. For example when you are in the fast-running mode and jump on the rope, it keeps you going fast but it doesn't auto-steer for you anymore so you tend to die.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|This game has a good deal of challenge to it.  I always bring it up when I only have a minute or two to play a game - and out is fun enough for that.  Some levels are silly hard, and it should give you more lives, but it keeps me coming back.
1616550414|5.0|Hyrule Historia is absolutely brilliant! Every page is filled with so much Zelda goodness. All the art shown on each page really makes you appreciate each Zelda game all the more, and the way they connect each game and put together the history is just awesome. I really enjoy looking through each page and reading about every little piece of information this book contains, everything from the official timeline of the series to how characters changed during development of the games. It's such a great book, every Zelda fan will absolutely love it! And the Skyward Sword manga in the back of the book is a real treat, too!
8866130923|5.0|Love the size, color, and creamy paper of my Moleskine. Plus it makes for easy planning with the week on one side and a blank page on the other for future goals.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|This dictionary wasn't as good as I thought it would be and I didn't get what I needed to learn
B003O86FMW|3.0|I don't think it was s good as book #1, However, it does advance the story and I'm looking forward to reading book #3.
B00846TTDG|5.0|I recommend this movie to any one looking for adventure and action.  Besides the horrors of war, it's a clean movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great Read ;)<br />Did not want to put it down. Can't wait for the movie to compare the them :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is the most amazing games since temple run. But why does everything have to cost money I mean like really.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really cool and it makes you very competitive and even though it can stress you out when you don't beat your friends score but when you do beat your friend you can brag to them about it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really awesome!!! if u like temple run 1 or 2 you should like this!!! kiloo games are awesome!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hooked on this book and couldn't wait to pick it up each day. It's the fastest I've ever read a book!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I saw this last night and was blown away.  As a Foo Fighters fan, I expected to enjoy this, but it was even better than I expected.  So much musical history about Sound City Studios, and then the second part, where they invite people back to make new tracks with them, was even better.  Loved watching Trent Reznor, Josh Homme, Rick Springfield, and Paul McCartney create music!  Left me wanting more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I think is much better than Temple Run 1 and a little bit better than Temple Run 2 overall this game is awesome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is so well produced that one can't help but like it.  I am not sure how accurate the interaction between the \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" is, but one gets some idea of how life of the English nobility played out.  The costumes are extraordinary, especially the dresses worn by the ladies.  The acting, in my opinion, is superb.  We find it enjoyable and interesting.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Please mojang  Will you please make it to we're kindle people can get the updates without having to buy the game over
B00AREIAI8|4.0|When I saw this app, I was skeptical of the quality and promises of this game. But in fact, it is definitely one of the best free game apps out there. It is also one of the better virtual pet games I have played, too. You can get pretty far and have a lot of fun without spending a dime on it. There were a few minor annoyances with the interface, but it's really good. Especially for a free app.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is very informative and well written. I believe medical personel should read this. I think it would help us to be more compassionate and caring to our patients, and treat them as if they don't really understand what they are trying to relate to us.<br /><br />I am now rereading the book to see what I may have missed on the first go round.
B008J34466|5.0|PINK is by far an amazing and talented singer. Great CD and I never get bored with her or her music!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book was whity and kept me laughing each time i opened it! Very practical work/life balance advice presented from a down to earth, realistic point of view. No matter if you're looking for advice or a laugh, this book provides both and is a great read for everyone!
B000VM9Z8K|5.0|I Loved this book!  Fast read!  Cute story line! I Couldn't put it down. I Would definitely recommend to others!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved temple run, now there's temple run two! This sequel is more challenging but fun. In this one you go on pipelines,ride in carts in mines, and dogs cliffs! It's awesome.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is VERY fun to play! With all the twists and turns, and a GIANT rabid monstrous monkey chasing after you, it's a really good game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game and I play it like every day like for real it's so cute!!!!! I wish the horses weren't as expensive though :((
1603427244|5.0|Paid for itself the first time I used it! Great illustrations and easy to follow instructions. Will refer to it often.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I really did enjoy this book a lot. Didn't want to ever put it down. Can't wait to finish the series.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good trilogy to the hunger games series but so dark and sad. It was a good read and not what I was expecting from the end of the hunger games. The book was really sad and i thought the ending was a little rushed and could of used more detail.
B00992CF6W|5.0|im waiting for the update but it has not came out yet but it is still fun.<br />in the mean time i shall hold my turf from creepers.
B006YC74E8|4.0|In looking for a photo tool for my new Kindle Fire HD, I checked what others had done and downloaded the Phot Editor. It is easy to use and has more editing features than I expected. I don't know that I will make tremendous or frequent use of this tool, given the better camera quality on my smart phone, but it is good to have it for those times I want to take a picture with my Kindle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. if your into solitare while waiting for something or don't have a book app . Colors are bright, can select different colors for your cards and background. Would recimmend it for anyone. 5 stars from me.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|The main reason why I watched this movie was because of the GORGEOUS lead actress - Jessica Chastain. 5/5 stars for her acting skills! She deserves an Oscar! ;-)<br /><br />How is this movie different from \\"Seal Team Six\\" or \\"Codename: Geronimo\\"? The latter have a personalized focus on the soldiers' lives.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" focuses mainly on the lead female CIA analyst who through years of her tenacity and persistence, manages to secure enough manpower to hunt down Osama bin Laden (aka. Usama bin Laden).<br /><br />If you're residing outside the USA, buy a Region 1 DVD. Maybe, there isn't any censorship in Region 1 DVDs. DVDs sold in Islamic countries and suck-up countries like Singapore often CENSORS everything of a political and religious nature.<br /><br />A related movie is:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00A34LX2M Seal Team Six: The Raid On Osama Bin Laden]]
B0067LXQAW|5.0|Its the Cranberries need I say more.  First album in over ten years a must have for any die hard fan.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|I like it when a director makes some spiritual truisms come to life in artistic, visual settings. At the very least, the script-writers and story-writers spent some time to do a small PART of their homework! I applaud 97% of the points raised in this wonderful movie of motherly love from beyond the grave!<br /><br />First of all, here's 1 scene I did NOT like about this movie: some people in the writing team obviously have an anti-Catholic bias. If they had spent their time reading up on their own Protestant American history (America was never colonised by Catholics but by genocidal Prots who massacred the native American Indians - who, in turn, returned the favour by cursing them!), they would know for a fact that Prots used the violence of state to rip native American Indian children from their parents and forced to live miserably in Protestant boarding &#34;schools&#34; which were no better than Communist re-education slave labour camps. WHY does this movie show a Catholic nun being murdered and have men dressed as priests, along with a sheriff, chase an innocent mother through the woods and force her to take her own life? The writers and director could have easily used a SECULAR STATE orphanage in this movie, but no, they just couldn't resist dressing those actors and actresses up as &#34;Catholics&#34;! IF not for scenes of those pretended Catholic characters, I would have given this movie 5/5 stars!<br /><br />IF the writers of this movie had the common sense to even pick up a Catholic book and the read the history of exorcisms in the Catholic Church, then common sense would tell you that NO real, Catholic clergy would EVER allow such a tragic death of a mother to be conveniently ignored as this movie suggests! The violent hauntings as seen in this movie would NEVER happen IF the dead mother was laid to rest according to Roman Rites! But, of course, who can read the mind of anti-Catholic movie writers? FYI, blame the Prots for today's hauntings in the country. The lead actress' exclamation sums up the broken Prot society of today's America: &#34;Thank god (sic) I'm NOT pregnant!&#34; Take a look at scene 1 of this movie on the breakup of the family and the murders - all very Protestant traits from an atheistic Prot American society - lovers of guns, violence and family breakups!<br /><br />OK.... Now's here's what I like about this movie:<br /><br />(1)<br /><br />The &#34;grounding&#34; technique used by Annabel the surrogate mother with her youngest adopted child is 100% right. This brief scene reflects reality. The technique will ground and still a Sensitive person who has an over-exposure to the spirit world. When performed by someone who radiates love and care, the technique works in bringing the afflicted person's spirit back into her own natural earthly body.<br /><br />(2)<br /><br />Yes, the Mama character does exists in reality! But, they're very rare on this earth. Don't go finding them out of curiosity. If you display aggression, you the human will be attacked. This is true.<br /><br />(3)<br /><br />Mama is NOT a malicious demon as some would rashly judge her to be. A demon from Hell CANNOT empathise or love a human, much less a human child, let alone raise a child in human chronological time.<br /><br />Mama was / is a human spirit who, in reality, would come back with OTHER entities who in turn would probably do much more damage to living humans.<br /><br />(4)<br /><br />This is a tale of a mother's undying love for her child.<br /><br />The last scene of this movie is most beautifully crafted! I love it!<br /><br />The final fusion and transformation of the characters is totally beautiful and reflects a spiritual reality that cannot be usually expressed in ordinary human words! The writings of Catholic mystics could give you a glimpse of this fusion principle, and to experience it while retaining your own individuality and human Will is not easily describable in ordinary human language. The last scene inthis movie reflects a spiritual reality and I absolutely love it! At least, the director got this one spiritual reflection correct!<br /><br />The profoundly AWESOME ending that had sections of the cinema audience APPLAUD in grateful thanks!

0736092269|5.0|Very thorough drawings of which muscles are worked in each exercise.<br />The 3rd edition includes special sections to avoid injury on certain exercises.<br />This is not a weight training program guide so it is best used together with another book or a class.<br />Highly recommended!
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I just love watching Gemma Atherton in tight pants! ;-P<br /><br />Better editing is needed for this movie, especially those fast fight scenes. Try those John Woo freezing shots sometime.<br /><br />Nice story.<br /><br />Watch it.<br /><br />Hope to see sequels of this movie!
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Such a beautiful album! Creative and clever arrangements highlight rich harmonies and soaring solo vocals. This group, who won last year's The Sing Off competition, is by far the best in their current genre, which is difficult to define. It is a cappella in that only voices are used with no other instruments, but those voices produce sounds much like drums, guitars, and various special effects—behind tight vocal harmonies. What really stands out to me is that only five voices can produce such a huge, full, deep, complex sound.
B000ENC5YW|5.0|Sean Connery was at his usual top drawer performance and fortunate as always to have a good writer. My real interest and pleasure was to see Xeta-Jones make the whole scheme a winner. She a keen actress without getting too verbal about her glamourous beauty. She's one of my best five and right near the top. I'll save the other four for some other time. I liked the comparative love for one another and this was not her first time to beautifully handle age gaps. This is my favorite of several others I have at home but I still give them 5 stars for mostly the same reasons given to her. All that health stuff is mostly edge of the gutter overwritten for the waste basket IMO. She's going to be OK as long as she stays clean and that I full expect.<br /><br />The story is tight, has some humor and imagination with something of an unexpected ending that I prefer. As far as I'm concerned a dash of romance fits SiFI, family feud, comedy, military, and even some of the high end series during the last 2/3 years. If you choose to check this impression -- take a look at one of other four I mentioned when she's close to Dr Who and only gets as far as like kiss after a pause that's tempting.<br /><br />Well----enough or more than enough said. Worth the time and money/ Where's the wrong side of the coin to call it a<br />4-star General?<br />jkp
B008KNUKVI|5.0|What a great first album! This group, who won last year's The Sing Off competition, is by far the best in their current genre, which is difficult to define. It is a cappella in that only voices are used with no other instruments, but those voice produce sounds much like drums, guitars, and various special effects—behind soaring vocal harmonies. Pentatonix ranks right up there with Rockapella and the Nylons in my book. What really stands out to me is that only five voices can produce such a huge, full, deep, complex sound. I'm already looking forward to their next album!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a nice looking game...but its hard as .....!!!!  I am wondering if I will be able to get past the first level.
B008PZ69RU|2.0|Billed as a modern remake of the wonderful 1950 French film. La Ronde, 360 turns out to simply be another in a long line of Six-Degrees-Of-Separation-type films (or perhaps, considering its global span, another in a long line of Babel-type films). Unfortunately, there is really no development of story or character, so all that is left of any interest in watching how the lives of the characters randomly intersect on an international scale. The cast is good, with the stand-outs being Ben Foster and Anthony Hopkins (who in a rather small role ironically does his best work in years), but at the end one is left with a big \\"So What?\\"
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Bought this for the wife and it was read in no time. After reading this she wanted the second one too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. It's super fun and so entertaining. May have a few glitches, but I still love it!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game it is the best creative game you could have..... is Herobrine real on pocket addition?!?!?!<br />lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun and very addicting.  At first I thought it would just be a game for my grandkids but I really love it!
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Do you ever think of having a ski Safari right in front of you. You can, this app I got is great fo
B0012Q732O|5.0|The moral message in this movie was that,love for somebody is worth dying for. Shows how people can come together in a time of sorrow,and work with each other,to fight against tyranny. I loved this movie!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway suffers is some times a little slow and sketchy and messes me up sometimesbut otherwise its great but the limited time characters and boards are a little too much money.
B007M45PMU|4.0|If you are fan of Mumford and Sons you will enjoy The Lumineers. They bring a folk music blend of alternative music to the listener.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun and exciting but it does have some falls but I pay like all the time it's amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a super fun game! I play it on my Kindle For while listening to one direction:) I really like the Rio version. IN FACT that's what I play Yuri ing right before I wrote this!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|cool I love it ..... this is awesome ....  if u love srategy well this is your game. .... I love this game
B008673ZAQ|4.0|It's a smooth reading, the story captures you and it's impossible to stop reading until you know the end of it. Better written than 50 shades
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is easy to play and takes my mind off of work when I play at lunch.  The Rio landscape is a nice change.  I like that I can skip a mission if I want to.  Graphics are great.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun energetic game. Anyone could play this game. I highly recommend that you get it. And since it's a world tour, you travel the world!
0446554995|3.0|Part of enjoying this series is putting aside logic and being swept up in the authors' imaginations.  And this I've done for the entire Pendergast series.  However, this book challenges even the most dedicate fans.  The final resolution of the Helen thread really goes too far, from Nazis, mutant armies, and auto sales scams to convenient volcanos. It's just too much to allow.  The book unsucessfuly tries to interveave three separate stories, but only succeeds in jumpy progress.  The writing also seems uneven. In parts it's slowly paced and typically description and in others hurried as though the authors wished to end it. Once again the author's must demonstrate that they have a larger vocabulary than the readers.<br /><br />I will continue to be a reader and fan.  It's obvious that one of characters than disappears in the work will return sometime in the future.  However, I simply don't have the patience for another trilogy like the Helen books.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|Finally someone has the courage to reveal the truth behind cats. There were many nights I would wake-up to find my cat either sleeping on my face or kneading his sharp claws into my neck. Sure he stopped the moment I woke- up, but in the morning I could feel his evil green eyes staring at me while I ate my breakfast. Probably hoping I choked on my eggs. Now I'm prepared. But if you don't here from me after this comment, it's probably because he finally got me.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I was testing this out before getting ready for bed and there is only ten second loops on the sounds....<br /><br />I like the lite version so back to that I go.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I had a very hard time getting into the story.  There are so many characters to keep straight that it's confusing in the beginning.  I think it dragged on a little bit too much in general.  I kind of lost interest about half way through the book.  It did pick up at the end and had a pretty realistic ending.  Don't pay full price for this book.  It was a bit of a disappointment after reading the Harry Potter series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is so epic but itouch has new 0.6.0 version. gggg Yggdrasil gggv gggg hhggvb. hhhhh. Koo Koo kok Koo koiok nhjjh
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Very smooth about writing this. I enjoyed the fact of the mystery behind it all. Very well done. Lee Child always does a good job.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie is fun for the whole family, adults will love the humor while kids will love the whole thing.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|One of the best fantasy series available if you don't expect all your main characters to survive. Believable world but you need to concentrate to follow all the characters and subplots. Definitely not a light read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Saw the movie after reading this, Catnip is my heroine, I sure hope the world doesn't end up like this
0446554995|5.0|Two Graves moves as swiftly as their previous novels, and engages the reader from the first chapter.  Preston and Child still know how to break out the surprise twists.  You won't be disappointed and will see a new side of Agent Pendergast.  Can't wait for the next installment.  Would like to see Pendergast in the movies, but not sure who could possibly play him.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|not that well written, and certainly a subject I was not to aware of in my life, not something I would try either.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Incredibly addicting game I can't stop playing it.  The graphics take some getting used to but overall, a very fun game
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Well written, not what I expected, held my attention through out the book.  Pretty heart wrenching story and totally unexpected
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun, but I'm getting confused a lot from the guy and about what I'm supposed to be doing.
B000000OU0|4.0|This is a out-take from the DVD and is missing a few songs and is in a different order than the DVD.  Otherwise it's very good.
B00005QJDG|5.0|One of the 3 discs had a small imperfection that won't allow me to burn a copy of two songs on that one CD, but they play just fine, so I loved the purchase which I rated 5 STARS all the way! It's a great compilation and any DT fan should own it!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Great characters, excellent plots. The picture quality is almost Blue Ray quality and the sound it great.  The extras are nice too.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Why did I rate this purchase 5 STARS?<br /><br />1. Price! The lowest I found for a brand-new, current release disc.<br />2. I'm an old Rush fan and this is one of their better releases in the past 10 years.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|very good just too much Helen Hunt nudity not necessary for the story line in my opinion but a good movie
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I think it is an awesome game because, its updates are so cool plus the birds are awesome but do you know what would be (way more)cool a level creator
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wonderfully written and impossible to put down. Excellent! You feel like you are there with the Navy SEALS! Buy it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is an amazing game. It is really amusing both children and adults and is worth down loading if you haven't already. I'm only fourteen and pretty much only use my dad's kindle for subway surf. I have the same game on my iPod but I think it's better to play on the kindle. I RECOMMEND YOU DOWN LOAD THIS FANTASTIC GAME IMMEDIATELY
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Downloaded a week ago, played for few hours, now it wont load! pissing me off cuz I was doing well! please fix!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|And the third was the best one.  Oh, I don't know, all three was great.  The author really had an imagination.  Really enjoyed this series.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I have never in my life played a game like this. I took a gamble and bought it, though. It took about thirty minutes to get the gist. You have to watch the brief video tutorials. Anyway, after getting the gist it took a couple hours to really get all the many parts of the game. It was fun learning and adding additional features a bit at a time. Now I love it and can not stop playing. Trust me. It is in no way too difficult to figure this game out. And it is so worth it when you get into it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldn't wait to get to this book and it was great also.  Waiting for the movie.  Great read and would recommend this everybody.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a good game, its easy and fun to play. But there are a lot if pop up ads that is not a good thing.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a read!!  My hat is off to the author who had to do so much research for this book.  The story flowed really well and it was easy to keep up with the characters as the story grew.  I would recommend this to anyone, no matter what type of books you read.  It will give you a fuzzy all over.
B00B5ACNRM|5.0|Back in late September I got my hands on the first part of this two film DCAU project. I had nothing but good things to say after seeing just how close to the original source 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 1' was. Patience has definitely been a virtue because 'The Dark Knight Returns Pt. 2' is amazing.<br /><br />All I could say was 'they did it' while they did change a few things around for the purpose of cinematic value, they did not hold anything back with transitioning the final two parts from page to film. The final battle between Batman & The Joker is not a child friendly fight. The film captures all the intensity and violence and with a brilliant choosing of Michael Emerson to voice the Clown Prince, I was left speechless. Of course the final part has a true clash of the titans with The Dark Knight against The Man of Steel. Still, with a fight that is stand still on the pages of the book the film fills in the gaps between frames adding more to the fight and making it so much more dramatic and such a great scene. The voice cast is great, the story is great and now that all 4 parts of this landmark story are now on DVD & Blu Ray it is a must see for DC comic readers, DCAU fans but more importantly those who are true film and animation appreciators.<br /><br />The only thing that upset me was, this two part film was big screen worthy. Even though, Bruce Timm tried that back in 1993 with 'Batman: Mask of the Phantasm' 'The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1 & 2' would have been an excellent comeback. The fans were so ready and I would have been in the front row.<br /><br />This project is now a major mark in the DCAU film library, I am wondering where it will go and what stories we will see. What I am truly hoping for is a possibility of more of these 2 part projects, because there are so many more amazing stories to tell.<br /><br />End of Book 3
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read and one of the first books that I have read and a few days later went to the theater and watched it.  The book was better.  I recommend reading the book even if you have seen the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|In my opinion,  I think that this game is great, but one thing,  I ended up getting every temple run there is and now I only play this one and I paid money for one (which is temple run brave) so I don't know what to do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Love the app. Did not give it 5 stars, because there is always room for improvement. Local weather is great and very accurate.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Here we go again, the same old &#34; billion bullets flying and only the bad guys fall routine &#34;.  The magically appearing I'M BACK and TEXAS RANGER with too much beard make-up added nothing to this sad little attempt at movie-making. Hollywierd is running out of ideas and even an all-star cast of has-been's could not save the day.<br />You'd be better off with Mary Poppins!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book! Love reading it on my kindle fire!!!!<br />I can' wait for the movie!!! Nicholas Sparks is the best!
B006CC0YB0|2.0|This album is not impressive.  Whereas Bubblegum was fresh, a \\"holy s***Lanegan is on point\\", this is an \\"oh well, Lanegan made an album\\"  The electro drum machine action is stale, and uninspired.  Really weak 80s pop style production.  Complete letdown, maximum production fail.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|soooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!! addicted<br />I can't stop playing it when I get home from school it's so awesome and I love the updates
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a true to life depiction of the trials everyone goes through to fit in and figure out the world during one's teenage years.
1584282584|5.0|maybe I can use a faster shutter speed and eliminate more motion blur.  This is a great book for understanding on-camera flash techniques.  I don't have great indoor lighting, but do have a speedlight and am always afraid to use it because of the harsh shadows I often get that are pain to edit out in post.  This has helped me feel more confident about using it and I'm now looking forward to my next indoor shoot.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|An amazing broadcast!  Become Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman's biggest fans immediately!<br /><br />This BBC production is a definite must have.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well written, scientifically detailed and easy to understand. Everyone will enjoy this book; believers and non believers, there will be less non believers after reading this book.
B000060MMI|4.0|Shipped right on time and the songs are good. I've been listening to them for some time now. Still a great band!
140525355X|5.0|I loved this books as a child.<br />And now i have the opportunity to read it to my son,<br />I'm so happy :)<br /><br /> -Good topics to read about.<br />- Short stories, great content<br />- A drawing in every page, this makes easier to keep focus
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app. Id never played minecraft but this was easy to control<br /><br />Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome
B003O86FMW|4.0|As good if not better than the first. Looking forward to the last,<br />When you read the book first the movie is always disappointing. We' 'll see about this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|My wife works odd hours sometimes and we use our AccuWeather to find out what  the evening will be like in case she has to work over.We recommend this app highly.
B002NHGG92|5.0|What can I say? I count down the hours until new episodes on Thursdays... Forget your age - this is pure, lusty, mystical fun!  The writing is actually quite good, the people are ridiculously beautiful, and there's never a dull moment.  What more could you want?!
1843104954|5.0|This book arrived in excellent condition and early. This book is a must read for anyone who has a friend or loved one with a diagnosis of Aspergers or HFA(high functioning autism). It is easy to understand and has sooo many helpful suggestions for managing the condition.  It is valuable for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game provides much entertainment to me. I love this game so much. Its awesome!!! Its bring me so much joy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|The book was great I never read a book better than this one I hope he writes at least one more book.  Great job Jeff kinney
032147404X|5.0|it isn't hype, the book really is a no nonsense approach to taking better photographs. And you don't need to have a dslr to benefit from this book either. In fact the book actually helps you to understand what it is that set's dslr cameras from simpler cameras.<br />I bought books 2 and  4 too but haven't started them yet. but if they have a similar approach to the subject, I'm sure they'll be well worth reading and going back to when needed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting, If you love temple run or temple run 2 you will definitely love this game every one should get this game. Its a must
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is well worth your time. This isn't a quick game to pass, you have to play it whenever you have a good amount of free time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love the game but a new recent update came out Wednesday and I don't know how to update it and it doesn't  even ask if I want to update! How do I get it to update?
1616550414|5.0|To start, this book is absolutely beautiful. From the artwork inside the book to the cover of it! Darkhorse did a fantastic job! If your a Zelda fan, this is a must because there are many explanations on how things came to be within the series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome its awesome how it changes themes every month........I got Tony from last month and he is awesome this game rocks and if u don't have it download it!!!
B008GXHOFW|2.0|My 6 year old found it a bit difficult.  He enjoys playing it, but gets a little bored trying to figure it all out...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing. I especially love the Rio version. I love the new trains and the new character Carmin. She is bery pretty.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I loved it, it was soothing and I listened to it every day going into<br />work.  It was a sad day in history, but the music and the love story<br />was great.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Fast paced, fun filled game. . exciting to try to beat your last score and try to go to next level. I always enjoyed PacMan
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unbelievable!!  I took a chance with this one and loved it!!!  You will not be disappointed with this one.  Fast Read.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I'm am 11 years old have read every single book by rick Riordan but this is great and i recomend it
B00013RC8O|5.0|anyone who loves driving and dreams of muscle cars must own or at least watch this movie, else they aren't really a fan of said cars.
B008UTV43K|5.0|You know there are some reviews here that are rather negative ... to be honest I was not familier with Diana Krall before I bought the CD, I am here to buy the ALBUM today ... Do not know why I did not know her, lots of music out there.  I have to say I love this music, this artist. I live in Florida so here on 2/2/13 I was in the spa part of our pool hoping to read a bit but had this CD on in the background ... could not read a thing just sort of floated there glued to the music!  It was wonderful.  Going to send my son one today, he is in Michigan, cold there!!!! I know he will love it.  Slow, quite, NOT MORNFUL ... I was not morning ... or what ever word experts used.<br /><br />Look this is a very entertaining album, my wife really liked it ... wants it on her IPOD ... We are old, Beatle gereration, I still listen to the Beatles every day ... that might impact your interest in my view ... ; > )<br /><br />I do not try to go on and on, seeming to be some sort of real audiophile (spell that???) or expert, though I do prefer vinyl..  LOL!!!  I just know what I like and I love this music.  Wonderful... TODAY and YESTERDAY combined to me ... Hope this helps you and you like it too.  Jerry  (nothing wrong with that cover either .. is there .. WOW  .. no honey ... I did not mention the cover!!!!)
0553103547|5.0|one of my favorite series, i had read it before i bought it but wanted to own it so i could read it anytime i wanted.  hopefully the series is finished by the original author unlike the wheel of time
0345803485|5.0|This book opens up a whole new world that I love. Only uptight housewives or holy rollers wouldn't like this book LMAO.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I normally don't watch TV series but every once in a while one comes along that is worthy of my attention. For the last few years it has been Downton Abbey. The acting, costumes, and production are all top notch, the story lines are excellently written as well. I wish American TV could come up with something this compelling.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't believe how addicting this book was. I truly couldn't put it down. Beautifully written and genuine, this story will speak and should speak to anyone and everyone that reads it. Happy I found it!
B004478GNI|3.0|I bought this for my nephews.  I helped them put it together.  We did have fun working together on that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  Although it has the same gameplay as the original the challenges feel new and now there are two games that I'm addicted to
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved it! Everything you expect it to be and more. I laughed and cried, and can't wait to watch it again!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very User friendly but can be hard to move around with.some directions aren't clear but mostly it is easy to use and a great distraction.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I got tired of waking up to the radio. It's very convenient and easy to use. A very calming way to start the morning.
B000002HB4|5.0|\\"Keep Your Hands to Yourself\\" positioned this band for 1 hit wonder status, but the truth is they were a real band, with songs like \\"Don't Pass me By\\" \\"Open All Night\\" and \\"Hard Luck Boy\\" showcasing Dan Baird's considerable songwriting skills - something he also brings to the Yayhoos.  The suprise best song here is \\"Battleship Chains\\" written and sung by the band's lead guitarist.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great story with many twist and turns.  I can't read at home so one day I stayed over at work because I couldn't put the book down.  Not sure if it is based on a true story but you will think that it was.  The truth always more interesting then fiction and its hard for fiction to capture the random twists and turns that we experience in life.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play this game just about everyday its very addictive! I could never stop playing it by far my favorite game!
B00B2EWNWG|1.0|made it about 30 minutes in before I turned it off. Going to send amazon a refund request now. Just that awful of a movie. Think hip-hop meets worst kung fu ever on a tight budget with a guy in charge that knows nothing about movies.
B005EHILV4|5.0|I just needed a way to hook up my condenser mic to my PC and this works very well with a few additional features that are usually on higher priced models..shipping speed was phenomenal..came literally 2 days later tops..
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Very nice. Great to help baby sleep. Nice interface<br />. Selection a  a a a a a a a a
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was wonderful very will written and I recommend this book for all ages!!!;)  it's sort of like the original except it has some cool twists...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Straight addicted to this game. Love it. It is sure to cure the boredness in your life. Love it. Love it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|excellent it is very entertaining you have to think and follow clues. you have to solve problems. i<br />loved. the story linear
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If you're into love stories, this is a good one. Not too short but a pretty quick read. I would love to read more by this author.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Cut the Rope is a very good, addictive game! Once you start playing, you'll never want to stop! When I started playing it, I didn't stop playing for three hours, I loved it so much! Get the app and see what I mean!!!! ;-)
B0063IH60K|4.0|Who does not like a classic game? This games helps me pass the time, especially when I am in carpool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game! It'll keep you occupied for hours on end!!! The best thing about it is that every few weeks there is a new update which brings new scenery. For example, when I got it, it started in new York, then I got the update a few days ago and it went to Rio!!!!!!! It's an awesome game all my friends have it! In my opinion it almost beats temple run 2 in the best app game competition!!! B-)
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like to play Mahjong. I find the tiles are rather small on screen. I recommend it for passing the time, especially in carpool.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. A great game for everybody. A game for people who are looking to waste time with a fun game
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Sometimes it takes too long to find a random player.  Also, some of the players just write the word on the screen instead of drawing. The game is DRAW SOMETHING!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its okay but the games arnt<br /> that easy but then again that's my opinion try it if you want.... Okay....!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|My 13 year old son loves to play this game. I recommend it for passing the time, especially in carpool.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The character development in this series is excellent. In addition, the historical representations are accurate and interesting. I learn new things about the era with nearly every episode.
B008US4PBY|1.0|You cannot use a WIRELESS 360 controller with our PS3 until you connect a WIRED 360 controller to the device for configuration purposes. If you're like me and don't have a wired controller, I hope you have a friend with one or this ends up being about a $130 package. I don't even care if it works great, this is too much of a deception to let go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME! I love it! The best is that you can connect to Facebook and play against all your school friends that play this game. I love. Monthly the theme changes. I was in NYC last week. Now I'm in Rio! Buy it <3
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really cool you should download this it's only for android and help Fresh,Jake and tricky from the inspector
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my go-to game when I have a few minutes to kill. My favorite part is that I can choosing a &quot;winning deal.&quot; If I don't solve it, I know I've done something wrong.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was a great book that gave me some knowledge of Greek's mythology. The story was fascinating and I can't wait to read the second book of this series.<br />The man characters are very peculiar, funny and unique. It's not the kind of book you can find anywhere and that's what makes it even better.<br />As a young reader, exactly 13 years old, I really enjoyed the story and got hooked on it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is one of the best games that I have ever played, I was addicted to it the first day I got it. There is only one problem, sometimes the &quot;save me&quot; button would cause it to force close,  but still,  best. game. ever.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Cool have to get Rio version also best app for any device  and even better then temple run 2 fun / awsome
B005ISZRES|5.0|This book is great I think that little women should actually read this book and find who they are from the inside
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It Needs actually meanings and<br />It's awesomeness really identical twins with other books lol and the other hand and the
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. I'm addicted and its so funny. I keep working until I get to the top of the list of high scores for my Facebook friends. I'm in 6th place. :( but other than that, no negative thoughts.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I just could not put the book down.  I really loved the twists and turns it too.  Extremely well written.
B00ATU5JRA|1.0|Very bad prank app.<br /><br />Adds a search icon to your home page.<br /><br />Adds a browser searh as your home page to your broser.<br /><br />Adds a bookmark to your broser.<br /><br />After all that it require you to install Ministo services from a 3rd party web site in order for this app to work.<br /><br />Ministro looks to be a system wide Qt shared libraries installer/provider service.<br /><br />Then it came up and said that Wifi hacker needed additional libraries downloaded in order to run called Qt core and plugins.<br /><br />If you accually get to start it up it will only show bogus wifi connections.<br /><br />Again don't download. Would give negative stars if I could
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|But, this show was outstanding. Everything about it was well done. The characters were well-developed, and quite likeable without being sappy. Cinematography was equeally well done. A Warning: This show is very addicting!
B009AMALLM|5.0|I have all of the Paranormal Activity movies and so far this one is the best. I don't know why people hated this movie because I thought this movie was scary especially at the end. The last 5-10 mins in these movies are always the scariest but the ending in the 4th movie was indeed the scariest of them all. I'm 30 and I was like \\"Oh F***ing s***!\\" I had to watch Friends on Nike at Nite before going to sleep to get my mind off that scary s***. lol So, if you love the other Paranormal Activity movies, then you will love the 4th one. If you haven't seen any of the previous ones then you should rent it first. It's also a good idea not to watch this right before you go to bed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Fix it. fix it. fix it. fix it. Oh...fix it. then once you are done with that i might use it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i love this game so much and i will never delete this game because i love it it is harder thsn the first one but in s good way. i hope you like it
B00B99U5VK|5.0|I almost never be dispointed by this TV show. Every time I bought it, I think the money was so well spent.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book series was amazing. I couldn't put them down. I also read hopeless. Also amazing! Looking forward to what colleen hoover has up her sleeve next!
B006LSZECO|1.0|Read this last month and cannot remember much other than it wa predictable and nothing new. Sorry folks, I'd like to come away from a read a bit more intelligent or entertained.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always sparks has come thru with a wonderful book . I'm so excited that it ended the way it did
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing!! I love having a new challenge Every day. Its kinda like temple run,but better!! There is an add that keeps popping up before the game. Then when u click x it will go away but sometimes it says force close but click wait and in 2 seconds you'll be playing the game again.
B009VLX8FS|3.0|The  best songs on this album are the ones she sings with guest singers. I bought this during a $1.99 deal, so I can't complain. It's exactly what you'd expect from a Taylor Swift album; songs about boys, girl power, and love gone wrong.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game.  great game for adults and kids me and my<br /><br />jsjsjsn shah b b b n n j b b b b j b b b n b b b h b j h b b. b h.v
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I purchased this album during the New Year's sale for $1.99, which was a bargain. I wasn't a huge Ellie Goulding fan before listening to the album, but after listening to it, I have a newfound respect for her as an artist. This album is diverse and very enjoyable - great to have on your playlist when working out or just hanging around the house.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Now this is my kind of music!  I missed an opportunity to see The Lumineers perform in a record shop in Houston, and now they're getting so well-known that I'll probably never get to see them in an intimate setting.  At least I can enjoy their wonderful music in the comfort of my own home!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This movie is worth a watch. It wasn't as funny as I was expecting, so I'm glad I rented it instead of bought it.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|The acting is very good! However, it was hard to watch a man belittle his wife and was so negative. I guess I am a sucker for happy stories that make me feel good.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was a great price for the DVD/Blu-ray set. The movie is cute with great graphics and everything you'd expect from a Disney/Pixar flick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good idea to play the game and I think the only thing that is good is this game.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Great series, great price. I gave this DVD set as a gift and the recipient was delighted, so I couldn't be happier. I am also a fan of the show, so I know it is well-written and well-acted. Very enjoyable and I'd highly recommend it to fans of fantasy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so so so so fun I recommend this to people who like temple run 2<br />This game is really fun
B00B2V66VS|4.0|its fun but somtimes hard fa la la I do not know what to write. hay temple run 2 is great.
B009CCBCU4|3.0|The story was good, but the different tribes names and places took me awhile to get straight.<br />Once I got into the book I did enjoy the characters and the story.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another wonderful game by g5!  I have been very impressed by a lot of thirty other games and this one is well worth the extra money to get the extras!
B0042EJD8A|1.0|I live in Pa and was shocked by this video. Anyone who watches this video also needs to watch FrackNation too before making up their mind about fracking.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|This was a great app, when it worked. It would freeze or not allow certain tiles to be selected. I wanted to like it, but it has been deleted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|ALL MY FRIENDS HAVE IT ON THIER DIVICES AND THEY LLLLLOOOOOVVVVVEEEEE IT SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH<br /><br />ITS SO AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME<br />YOULL Love IT
B005HSL626|3.0|This is kind of hard and not that fun but passes time i guess. would not let me get to level two so it has some issues.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is the best book in the world!<br />It is because I like it and it was mysterious in some parts and welcoming in others.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My kids and i love this game! Definitely would recommend it to everyone. So addictive and fun. Getting other versions when i complete this one :) My kids have the others and love them.
1401938906|5.0|Heard Pam on an interview on Hay House Radio and went straight to Amazon to order it that evening.  Received it two days later and couldn't put it down. I did the Dalmation Experiment first and it WORKED!!! So excited to read the rest and check out her other books. It's a great easy read, uplifting and have already recommended it to several friends.
141659521X|5.0|All of Vince Flynn's are great, I've read all of them.  The book arrived at the time promised, great shape!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfer is the most awesomeous game .It is a very skillful game that really makes you concentrate about whether you are moving in the correct order.I guess I'm speechless  about this tremendous game that I have ever experience before.Who ever is reading this I hope you feel the same way too.<br /><br />P.S.Hope you have a great time with this awesomeous app.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All that needs to be said is that it's awesome. Addictive, better graphics, power ups, and levels I'm in love. Giant monkey.
B00992CF6W|5.0|hi my name is Berkeley and I love mindcraft rat far gunny yummy there the thy Jsandye. bye hi fatty
B007THA4FI|5.0|I loved that Rowling gave two sides to every character - good and bad and you could choose whether to like them or not.  Rowling also is so gifted at creating a setting so that you can clearly see it in your own mind's eye and feel you are there.  Like the Harry Potter books, I enjoyed every moment I spent reading this book, not just for the story but for the pleasure of the way she puts words together.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I love this Emma with Gwyneth Paltrow, shes a perfect Emma. It's a charming sweet love story. You just feel good after watching it. No other Emma measures up to this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is the bomb.If complete levels and stuff you level up . And go different place.for example I'm on Rio this game is really good bye.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app to have on your electronic device. It's easy to use and the wide variety of sounds makes it interesting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|oh my gosh all u peoples out there will LOVE THIS APP GO SUBWAY SUFERS and it is sssssooooooo addictin u will love it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game !! At first when i first saw it, im going to be honest... thought it looked stupid. But after my first time i was hooked! GREAT game. (:
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|It is fun to watch my books come to life with the accents and scenery and clothes and the stuffiness.
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Five  star. LOVERS OF A GOOD SUSPENSEFUL STORY WILL  BE CAPTIVATED BY THE TANGLED WEB  Of  THE PERSONALITIES  INVOLVED WITH HARRY BOSCH.PPL
1401201911|5.0|&#34;Superman: Red Son&#34;. Unusual. Historic. Good example. Nice print. I overlooked the book, decided to take.<br />Thank you!  Arkady R.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The movie is very, very good. I have watched a lot of Vampire movies, but I will have to say that this one is one of the very best. We received the movie sooner than promised and that made us very happy!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a great game I play it all the time so fun download it now and its free witch is great
B005DA63EY|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I have had the opportunity to watch. Matthew McConaughey was teriffic  as usual.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl  was not a great read and really slow and a little far fetched would not recommend it as a summer book
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Johnny Depp was excellent in this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My whole family, including friends and coworkers are all addicted to this show!! It is such great writing and what a stellar cast! Wow! I highly recommend this show.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVE temple run so much! And I hope you will love it to! Get it right now! Love it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, and was so sad when it was done.  I have to say now Im looking forward to the movie!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game cause I love it it is the best game I have ever haughty on my kindle.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great<br />series I recommend for some entertainment.  It is a fast read.  Cute love story, a similar feel to Twilight series.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I can't wait until the movie hits theaters. This book will keep you intrigued and guessing the whole time. And you begin to fall in love with ender as you go through an epic journey with him
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series!  Could not put it down!  Very entertaining.  I would recommend for a light hearted read.  A quick page turner too!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is a lot better than the first temple run keep making these games and try to make a kid friendly game of this since I'm a mother
B00991TCOG|5.0|Lindsey has a unique style and talent. Her music is easily played in the car to zip to work or in the studio to sling paint to canvas. the music has its own methodical style that draws you in. The songs have a ebb and flow with a slick back beat in the back ground which compliments her fluid style of violin. I really enjoyed her latest work and look forward to her next endeavor.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have never played this type of game before and I find it very interesting.  Definitely worth the 99 cents.
B008476HBM|5.0|Love the times this was written in, romance, etiquette, loyalty, less stress with slower pace of life, and family commitment.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A truly interesting psychological crime novel.  Our book club decided that Jacob had done it.  However,  we thought some of the plot was improbable, such as:  why was Andy allowed to second-chair defense,  why was the police work not more exacting, and why wasn't the character of Laurie more fully drawn so that the ending of the book was not as startling.<br />JLW
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it is the best game ever you should get this game there's even awesome characters there rare ones too and when you upgrade it it turns into different themes so you should get this game it is free too

B00947N6UG|5.0|Director:  Peter Ramsay<br /><br />Writers:  David Lindsay Abaire (screenplay) William Joyce (book)<br /><br />Cast:  (voiced by)<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Alec Baldwin, Isla Fisher<br /><br />An evil spirit named Pitch plans to destroy the hopes and dreams of children. For the first time, the Guardians (Santa, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy, The Sandman and their newest member, Jack Frost) must work together to save themselves and the future of the world.<br /><br />2012 was a banner year for animation. ParaNorman, Hotel Transylvania, Frankenweenie, Brave, just to name a few. Rise of the Guardians, which is based on William Joyce's multi-book young adult series, is one of the best. I can't say that I have every kid's anime film made, but my movie collection includes plenty and I've been known to watch them on Saturday mornings instead of the cartoon fare.<br /><br />Casting was well done. The voices fit their characters and it's obvious the actors were into their roles. Animation brought life to the screen. I saw this film in the theaters and immediately went searching for a pre-order. I've actually started reading the books as well. I'm so fond of Rise of the Guardians, I'm adding the film to my annual Christmas viewing.<br /><br />Overall, I seriously hope to see more films from this franchise in the future.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, February 2013
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Super cute kids movie! Was a great laugh for everyone. Will defiantly buy this to own at home instead of renting!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Somewhere along the way Patricia Cornwell has lost her way. I keep saying I'm done reading her stuff, but keep buying books. Out of her last 7 or 8 this is one of the better ones but in no way compares with her original work. BTW the ending pretty much seemed to come from nowhere.
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|What a hilarious comedy! I loved it so much. Can't wait to watch it again and again! Great plot and great ending!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Simply works the way you need it to. mBackup app on the pc can even help restore data transfered from iphone version to android version.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Excellent - challenging - fun!  Definitely requires some creative thinking to achieve three stars on all.  The theme adds to the enjoyment.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and watched it raptly, but I do not see myself watching it again for several years.  There were certainly great parts but overall there were weak areas and cliches.  And Bane? A strong character who just whimpered away.  About time to hand over the baton.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I enjoy his character development of Harry Bosch. Keep em coming. I almost wish I had some of the jazz music playing when I read this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun playing this familiar game.  I challenge myself each time I play and hope to be able to get all the cards to come oout - in other words - win!
B004XZR63M|3.0|It was a good read, but I wonder if it was just a tool to help sell his RDPD programs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game that is fun for all ages! Takes time to get the hang of the swipes but once you do its good!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This classic is so beautifully written and we are lucky to have the opportunity to have it for free. Kindle books are great but Les Miserables is outstanding. Thank you very much for this lovely gift.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|This &#34;Webster,&#34; for my Android is perfect. I use it at least once per day. It's easy to use and<br />naturally, my confidence in the &#34;Webster,&#34; over all other dictionaries remains unsurpassed!
B0001AVZA8|5.0|My twin sister and I first saw this movie in the cabin on a Caribbean cruist.  At first we thought, what is this old Jack Nicolson hitting on young girls, oh brother.  But things shifted, and we found ourselves laughing and loving charming ole Jack and energetic Diane Keaton.  We watched the movie over and over during the two week cruise and laughed each time.<br /><br />After a recent cancer scare and surgery, my great sister came over to take care of me.  I surprised her and purchased this movie and one other favorite.  At a time when we could be stressed or sad, we laughed and laughed.  I am better.<br /><br />This will be a movie I keep on my shelf forever.  Nothing like a few laughs with a great sister.
B00005JJX8|5.0|What a beautiful couple they make, lol.  Loved the movie. One of my favorites of all times.  Highly recommend it.  Thanks for the prompt and courteous service.  Looking forward to future purchaes.
6305428387|5.0|It is so nice to watch an entertaining and funny movie with my nephew that's not full of violence or nasty language.  Cool Runnings keeps your attention from beginning to end.  Thank you Walt Disney.  Even though my nephew is 21 now, we still find this movie entertaining.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|OMG! what a thriller!  Love Denzel in this..Also loved him in The Taking of Pelham 123.  Highly recommend it. Thank you for the prompt and courteous service.  Looking forward to future purchases.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Downloaded for the Kindle Fire (old one), and there are many problems on it. My brother has the Kindle Fire HD.. he had the same problems, such as:<br />- Lags at points, which may lead to you missing a swipe and dying. Annoying but could deal with it.<br />- Randomly after dying the game will freeze and shut down, losing all of your accomplishments/coins/gems collected in that game. VERY ANNOYING & FRUSTRATING WHEN TRYING TO BEAT ACCOMPLISHMENTS SUCH AS SCORE 5,000,000 POINTS. On 3 occasions I beat this challenge and the game froze upon my death.<br /><br />@ Imangi Studios: I was a loyal fan of the first game, but will not play that game anymore, or any game to be developed by Imangi Studios. I may only be one customer, but I guarantee others feel as I do as well. YOUR FOCUS SHOULD BE ON DELIVERING A QUALITY PRODUCT THAT SATISFIES THE END USER... NOT RUSHING TO RELEASE A DEFECTIVE GAME. You guys really dropped the ball on this one.. very disappointed.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|This is a wonderful addtion of Christmas Carol, the illustrations make it a keeper to be re-read each year at Christmas

1616550414|5.0|The first Zelda game I ever played was The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the N64. Zelda made me a gamer. Since then I have bought every Zelda game (except Seasons/Ages). I even have the limited edition Collector's edition Zelda for GameCube and plan to buy Zelda Wind Waker Wii U.<br /><br />Now let's talk about the book. Since most people have given lengthy reviews, my review will be short. I must say the artwork is beautiful and I love teaching the history of Zelda to my girlfriend. If I could teach a class on Zelda, this would be the textbook. Why can't Zelda History 101 be a class? lol<br /><br />I also liked reading about the connections between each game and I really loved the comic book at the very back of the book. Reading right to left was very interesting. The one thing Didn't like was that the comic started off in color and then changed to black and white. Why? The comic really added more background to the series which was nice.<br /><br />Best of all I liked looking at concept drawings that didn't make the games. For example, I loved the Tingle train, boat train, and fairy train that never made Spirt Tracks. And I really loved seeing concept art of islands that never made it into The Wind Waker. There is one cool island that never made it into the game. Something cool happened every time you revisit it, but I won't spoil it. Go read the book.<br /><br />Most of all it was nice to finally see a timeline. Now every Zelda fan must ponder where the next Zelda Wii U and 3DS titles will fit into the timeline.Will it continue on one of the branches? Will it be like DC comics Superman and have an Earth 2 (Hyrule 2)? Will we ever know? I'm 100% happy with my purchase.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Absolutely loved this book! Wish their was more! Wasn't sure how it was going to turn out, Jamie keeps you guessing and begging for more. Literally couldn't put this down until I finished it!!

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Please read this book! It is a really good book and make sure you have a box of tissues close. I hope the movie is just as good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|With the tap feature I can be listening to a book at the same time as playing spider. I do have the settings set for horizontal so the cards are larger and easier to see..<br />ITS A GREAT GAME.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I originally gave the seller a neutral review because even with the sound turned up all the way on 3 different TVs I could barely hear the dialogue of this movine.  The seller contacted me and offered a replacement, which I received yeserday.  What a difference!!!  The sound is perfect with no problems whatsoever.  Very gracious seller.  Great company to do business with.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and I'm enjoying the movie right now!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|Although somewhat depressing, the story was well written and delivered a strong message.  I bought this book by mistake, but I am glad I read it.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This book was a good read, but it was not his best book that I have read.  It was well worth the purchase.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|It has a good plot and idea. There were some things I found awkward, mostly the pacing, but it held my interest and I enjoyed reading it to the very end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this product has many different places we can visit why play the game  because most people don't like to stay in one place through the entire game that would just be boring.

1442362901|5.0|Published by Simon and Schuster Audio in 2012<br />Read by Bob Walter<br />Duration: 22 hours, 1 minute<br />Unabridged<br /><br />Nancy Gibbs and Michael Duffy, both editors at Time, have delivered a very listenable, fascinating look at each American president from Harry Truman to Barack Obama. No matter their political persuasion, their life experiences or their qualities as a human being, all 12 of these men share one thing: they were once President. This is an exclusive club and it seems that just about every president has looked to a former president for a shoulder to lean on, advice or even as a personal envoy sent to convey a sense of urgency to the message.<br /><br />The story is told in a rough chronological order starting with Truman. When Truman was President there was only one other member of the Presidents Club: Herbert Hoover. Yes, the same Hoover that Truman and FDR disparaged for 12 years. However, to his credit, Truman sent out feelers and discovered that Hoover was still willing and able to help. Together, they set up the ground rules for this \\"club.\\" Hoover was tapped by Truman to help re-organize the Executive Branch and to get food to Europe at the end of World War II (Hoover did this at the end of World War I as well) and to help re-organize the Executive Branch.<br /><br />Gibbs and Duffy discuss how each President interacted with his predecessor and his successor and even other presidents (for example, Nixon interacted with every President from Truman to Clinton. Gerald Ford had a similar lengthy history. They also discuss how the \\"Club\\" grew and shrank over the years. During Bill Clinton's presidency, there were as many as six members (Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush41 and Clinton). At one point in the Nixon years, there was only Nixon.<br /><br />If you are a political junkie or a fan of modern American history, this anecdote-filled book is a must-read. It gives a different feel for the men, their personalities and their legacies. For example, I was surprised at how often Johnson reached out to Eisenhower for advice and reassurance concerning the Vietnam War.  I was even more surprised at how often Johnson was out hustled politically by Richard Nixon. I know Johnson was a world class politician, but Nixon maneuvered him and manipulated him throughout 1968. Johnson fared no better in his post-Presidential years.<br /><br />Nixon comes off as talented but very deeply flawed. The authors quote longtime advisor to multiple presidents Brent Scowcroft calling Nixon a \\"s***\\" and former President George H. W. Bush (Bush41) referred to him as \\"a first-rate intellect but also a third-rate person.\\" However, you do have to admire how Nixon calculates how to get to the forefront of American politics again and again and again. Reagan comes off surprisingly cold. Carter, as an enigma. Gerald Ford comes off as principled and maybe even heroic for his decision to pardon Nixon and destroy any chance he had to be elected. The Clinton-Bush41 friendship was a joy to learn about and the source of some of the best stories.<br /><br />Leadership lessons abound in this book. Every president had his own style in office and some even managed to exert a large influence long after they left office. Some Presidents chart the general path and expect their subordinates to follow it. Others are intimately involved in so many decisions that they are spread too thin. Some are charmers. Some intimidate. Some scheme and plan every move. No matter the president, Gibbs and Duffy take the reader behind the scenes and give a sense of the times and the way their administrations worked.<br /><br />I found this audiobook to be thoroughly enjoyable. Bob Walter's narration was excellent. He varied his rate, read with a lot of emphasis and made a 22 hour long audiobook fly by. I particularly enjoyed his very slight inflections he put in his quotes. For example, his LBJ quotes had a small amount of Texas twang and his Reagan quotes had his characteristic tone to them (If you were alive during the Reagan Administration, think about his famed \\"Well...\\").<br /><br />I rate this audiobook an enthusiastic 5 stars out of 5ration, think about his famed \\"Well...\\").    I rate this audiobook an enthusiastic 5 stars out of 5
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this is an excellent game it's never boring it upgrade every month to a new place I just love it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was having problems with the Weather Channel app failing to update current weather readings at times. I downloaded the AccuWeather app for comparison to the Weather Channel. After using AccuWeather for a couple of weeks, I subsequently ditched Weather Channel altogether.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is fun because well you get chased buy the train guy but I think  that subway surfer has helped me get organized and to save up money because you guys always make a special person so that we can buy and they are around $95000 this game is really special this so much
B0031TZAHU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It touched a lot of my reader's &#34;buttons&#34;.  How a great book lingers on and when you've reached the end, starting a new book - there is the lingering effect - makes it hard to shift gears into a possibly mediocre book - but such is the lot of us avid readers out there....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game ever. Finally there's a game that's awesome and free!! I couldn't ask for a better game, it's also very time consuming!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It Almost seems as though  a teenager wrote this and the style becomes tedious after a very short time.  There could be a little more substance to this book.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Based on the reviews and ratings we had seen, my wife and I expected to enjoy &#34;Hansel & Gretel,&#34; but we actually loved the movie. It's a violent film, but you have to expect that when the two witch hunters go after some of the most malevolent supernatural beings on Earth. Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton were perfect as Hansel and Gretel, but the supporting cast was also excellent, with Famke Jannsen looking alternately gorgeous and grotesquely evil, Pihla Viitala playing the luscious Mina who seduces Hansel, and Thomas Mann as Ben, the young wannabe witch hunter.<br /><br />The film doesn't pretend to take itself seriously, and that was a big part of the charm. The tone of the film reminded me of the 1960s steampunk TV series &#34;The Wild Wild West,&#34; with its use of inventive weaponry far more advanced than existed at the time. There was plenty of violence and gore, but nothing too gruesome or realistic for my weak stomach.<br /><br />After the wild and wooly climax, the last scene left no doubt that a sequel is planned. Based on my enjoyment of the first film, it should be a good one.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was a regular watcher of the Godfather movies on cable, because they are great films and I did not own them. The first time I saw the Blue Ray edition of Godfather was when AMC (I think) showed it on cable when the Blue Ray came out. I remember watching it and thinking, \\"Wow, is this the same movie?\\" This reaction was even though I have a HD tv but don't subscribe to HD content. Even then I could see the difference.<br /><br />The Blue Ray Coppola Restoration is a wonderful visual feast, and much better audio quality. The restoration is so much clearer, it's almost like seeing the movies for the first time. The audio on The Godfather was good, but the audio punch of machine gun fire into Michael's bedroom near the start of the second movie, actually caused me to turn it down but then turn the volume up a bit and kept at that volume. The audio is MUCH better than previous movies I've seen on cable.<br /><br />If you like or love these movies, you will not be disappointed if you have the player and TV to accomodate Blue Ray.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Who are these people that give mine craft one star?!!<br />mine craft is a five out of five stars and you know it.
B003I55BIA|5.0|This book has been on my TBR list for months and I finally worked my way to it and now I'm thinking what the hell took me so long, I should've read this book when I found it. It's the classic story of bad boy falls for good girl, but with a little twist. The good girl, Brittany Ellis has her own issues, her life isn't as perfect as she makes it out to be. I give it 5/5 stars. Alex Fuentes is YUMMY!! Definitely book boyfriend material.<br />Brittany Ellis tries to be perfect. Perfect hair, perfect clothes, perfect grades, perfect family, perfect EVERYTHING! That's what everyone HAS to see, there can be no cracks in the facade. Her mom stays on her case about everything! She is excited to start the first day of senior year, to see her boyfriend that was away over the summer, until she gets to school and the BAD BOY Alex Fuentes comes raining on her parade. They have a run in at the beginning of the day and she stands up to him being a bully, then she gets to chemistry and finds out that he is her new lab partner... UGH REALLY!!! Can her day get any worse!<br />Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fuentes is a member of the Latino Bloods, not by choice but as a way to survive, a way to make sure his family is safe and taken care of. Everyone at school has labeled him a bad ass and not one to be messed with. Now he has little miss perfect Brittany Ellis as his lab partner and they have a project to work on outside of school together, not to mention that her boyfriend hates him and the feeling is mutual. The more Brittany and Alex work together outside of school the more they realize they have more in common than they thought. Alex isn't the hard ass trouble maker that everyone thinks he is and Brittany isn't really a stuck up princess. As they start having feelings for each other, Alex knows that Brittany doesn't fit into his world of gang life, he knows he will never go to college and leaving the Bloods is not an option. Brittany likes Alex, but is it enough to give up her perfect life?
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I mostly bought this because of Journey and because it's a good deal. If you have yet to experience Journey I urge you to try it. I love games with a compelling story and interesting characters it's one of the reasons the Mass Effect series is my favorite game series ever. I'd read that Journey had no actual dialogue and that it was multiplayer and those two things were not good at all in my opinion but there were so many good reviews on it that I decided to go for it. I can honestly say that Journey is really and adventure worthy of anyones time. From the beautifully rendered art style to the musical score that fits every moment perfectly to the experience of joining with a companion and communicating with only a musical note. Their is a certain emotional attachment you can't help but make with your nameless traveler and companion, if you are lucky to find one. I was lucky enough to find a companion who sought me as much as I sought them and thus we made it to the end together. At the end I felt happy to have bought this collection and even more thrilled that there are game companies out there willing to try something new and different. I've played Flower as well and loved it as well but not nearly as much as I love Journey. Do yourself a favor and try it out. You won't regret it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|At first I wasn't sure about this game because it promised so much but it was free... but I was pleasantly surprised to find it a lot of fun! The only thing is that I wish is that things were easier to get without paying real money(:
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Told in her own words, with excerpts from journals she kept while in captivity, this book held my interest and pulled on my heartstrings throughout.
B003UYV08E|4.0|I am a big fan of &#34;good&#34; superhero movies...and I really like the Iron Man series.  Robert Downey brings it with his sarcasism.  It good to see him in this movie.<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of that Sherlock Holmes movie he did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game that I have in my kindle bcs its fun entertaining and its so cool to compete with your friends for the best score I love that every once in a while they change the locations that make it always different

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I am so sad to be at the end of this series!!!!!!!  I'm going to start at the beginning and read them all over again!!!!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|Obviously the movie has been around for 30 years, but it was very interesting to see it with my teenage children.  They loved it.  I didn't remember the language being so bad, but then everything was sketchy in the 80's.  So folks, the R rating is for fowl languange more than anything.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an exciting book I wasn't expecting that. Wow. I love it! It was amazing and suspenseful. Read it
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I have seen this movie and enjoyed it. So I thought I would try the book. Loved it. Much better than the movie, which books usually are. The kids are adorable without being mushy. Even though I knew the outcome, I found myself not able to put the book down so I could see how they were getting out of the different predicaments they got themselves into. I will read more of these series. Highly recommend to read to kids, too.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I Kai-Lyn Davis the famous critic say this game is extraordinary.  The graphics are great.I loved it. I usually hate tablet apps but I have to give this one 2thumbs up.

B005KQVDH8|5.0|It's a good movie that has elements of adventure, little thrill and comedy. It surely deserves to be transferred to Blu-Ray! Let's just say, Finally it is on Blu-Ray! As for the movie, it's pretty cool and I loved it!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After a slow start and thinking that this book wasn't nearly as good as the first two - I was pleasantly surprised by that wonderful \\"edge of my seat , can't put it down\\" writing style. This book grabbed me and wouldn't let go! Gripping and wonderful until the very last word!  A MUST read for any Hunger Games fan!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. I can just sit and play this game all day. I love trying to reach the daily goals.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|If you like the movie, you'll like the soundtrack. Quality, condition, format, setup, delivery all great. Just wish it was longer. I put it on repeat.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love horse. I love playing this game. I have never owned a horse but I want one. a black horse
B002VWNID6|3.0|The movie and dvd quality is fine, but be aware that it comes in 2-discs, with half the movie on one and half the movie on the other. You physically have to swap them out to finish the movie. Quite an annoyance. Everything else was fine.
B0086700CM|5.0|&quot;I really love this game&quot; says brayden draper... I love baylee wright... she is so beautiful ... I love my mom so much ...
B00006RIO7|5.0|Great soundtrack! Phenomenal Music! Love the jazz and broadway elements all coming together to form an incredible film score! I love it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a great game for my kindle fire but... WHERE ARE THE ANIMALS? WHERE ARE THE ZOMBIES? WHY DOSENT NIGHT COME? WHY DOSENTVTHE CRAFTING TABLES AND CHESTS WORK?!?!!!?!?
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I don't think I have ever listened to an album so many times on repeat as I have this one!  I own all of their music and have liked every one, however, this one is my favorite because it is so out of the box from some of their older albums.  They have been working little by little on the last two albums and being featured on other artists songs, to get to this point.  The change to a more pop sound was a great choice.  I am loving the theme of this album the most.  It is about crushing on someone, finding love, losing love, and the anger after you lost the love.  BRILLIANT WORK GIRLS! LOVE IT SO MUCH!    **Also, the video for \\"closer\\" is so good! I love how you include people from a variety of sexualities in it. Everyone can relate to their teen years and how we felt crushing on someone.  :)    Watch the video here:  [...]
B0085TKAW6|4.0|This is a good sequel to 'Fall of Giants' which I thought was the better book. Interesting to follow up the families introduced in 'Fall of Giants'.
074350917X|5.0|I love this book because it is written in a plain English with life examples from a new managers' perspective. It is all about one minute actions.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Great choices for running the roads. Songs are written to take advantage of the voice strengths of these two woman.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is super cute. I just wish that less items cost real money. I would also likenit if you could name your first horse yourself.
B0063GORYU|5.0|passes time when I am waiting  waiting  waiting!  fun fast .<br /> I like that presents tougher challenges as we move ahead
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think its great and i love the world tour but if you play it alot it gets a bit boring
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Excellent writing, very engaging and emotional.  I highly recommend this book to anyone fan or not of Apple and Steve.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is great, it tells you what it was like for people in the 1800's area.I like how much detail is in book about how people lived, religon, government back then when my grandparents were alive. I now understand all the things my great grandparents told me about, now that the movie is out I decided to read the book before going to watch the movie to see the movie is as good as the book.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I loved playing this game it was so fun. So I decided to save money for a new character (5000 coins to get it) I was saving my money and I was excited because I had 5326 coins so I thought to myself &quot;okay I'll get a little more before I buy anything&quot; . I did NOTHING at all and suddenly I had lost 4000 coins for no reason.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Friends show as friends but when you click on them it says that they are not on the same program so you can get no help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Bought this game for my little grandson and he loves it. I find myself playiang it a lot too. Great for all ages. Highly recommend.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|My 5 and 8 year old boys were scared and ran out within the first 5 minutes and me and my 13 year old daughter ended watching it and did not enjoy the movie.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 6 year old grandson love this game and while playing this game I can see that he really gets into it and is actually really good at it.
1451624468|4.0|Seven years after &#34;Fear of Physics&#34; what would you expect?<br />While more and more questions are being ticked-off and the pace accelerating it does seem inevitable that this latest offering would go to a reduced readership.<br />Fear not, as the writer occasionally reminds one, there's not a lot we can do about it but....by inference however, better that you  are at least aware.<br /><br />Ray HF
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice and easy game to learn and past the time. I have played this game alot and really enjoy it
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is straight to the point and tells us what we downloaded this for: it gives us the status of our battery. You have the option of looking at the battery status chart or just the battery symbol with the percentage. It also tells you how much time you have to watch videos, tlisten to music, webcam, etc. Very handy! Sometimes my battery symbol on the top does not indicate green that it is charging, so this helps me confirm if the device is indeed charging. You can change settings to have both battery indicators show if the device is charging, or just the battery app...its up to you. You also have the option of changing the animated battery color too if you wish. Great app!
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My 6 year old grandson loves this game because it gives him a challenge and he will not give up until he beat each level
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is a great convenience to check whats going on in ebay. You can sign into your account to give feedback and/or see what you have purchased or want, or just browse around the website. There is not much complicated about it and you wont have to go to your browser to get into ebay, just  press your ebay app button.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|We have a family of five kids ranging from 2-11. They all enjoy watching Tangled time and again!  We highly recommend this to anyone...even those without kids.
0425263916|5.0|i loved this book. ive read it 3 times already and cant wait for the next installment. i love godeon eva. i can already picture who could play gideon in the movie version. the only downside is there are only 3 books to the series. my sister doesnt like romance novels,but loved these. cant wait for the 3rd book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love ss it is the best game eva!!! Download now you have to trust me it won't be a waste of space
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I really enoy how Jack Reacher solves problems.  His logic inspires me.  Once I start reading a Jack Reacher book it is very difficult to put it down.  I had never heard of Lee Child until my son-in-law gave me the book One Shot acouple of weeks ago and, since then, I am now reading my 4th Jack Reacher book.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is a great movie. I watched it years ago as a child. I could watch it over and over.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The game itself is great.  I haven't completed it yet, but I have played for hours already.  Good graphics, smooth game play.  It's a little hidden item, a little problem solving and a little spooky with the music and creepy people you meet.  You can turn the music off, and it has a handy hint button.<br /><br />The download was brutal!  After purchasing the game it would download to about 70%, then fail out.  Starting all over I would try again.  After attempting to download several times and on different wifi hotspots I contacted Amazon.  The Rep said I needed to reformat my kindle to original factory settings.  Grrr!  I did and ...surprise!  It still wouldn't download.  Spent the next several hours putting my kindle back together again.  Just for kick, right before I was going to ask for my money back, clicked the download button.  It worked! Yes, it took about 10 minutes to download, but it worked.<br /><br />So after all that, I still gave enigmats 4 stars, taking off one for installation issues.  Lots of game for the money.  I would purchase it again, however I would NOT reformat, (super pain in the rump).
B009D0LBRO|1.0|I am 13 and I got this app for $2.99. I played it for 10 minutes because at first, I thought it was boring and I played it a little more to see if it gets better. It didn't. For starters, I had to wait 10 minutes for it to load. I do not reccomend this app.
0345803493|5.0|I gave this book as a Christmas gift for my mom, and she has told me she has really enjoyed it.  I can always find the books I want on Amazon and get them at a good price.
B00136Q342|4.0|I bought this because my son enjoys Johnny Cash. He is nine. We play it for him while he falls asleep. So I purchased this to have &#34;just in case&#34; to play on my Amazon MP3 on my Galaxy SIII if we were staying away from home. Thing is I enjoy it too. Reminds me of growing up and the music my father listened to.
0345803485|5.0|I bought the whole set for my mom for Christmas.  She has read this one and stated it was very good.  Every year there is a set of books that she is interested in and I get it for her through Amazon.  They always have it and at an inexspensive cost.
B00A4GXJD0|5.0|You can't go wrong purchasing this new album by Kid Rock. Every album amazes me at his tallent! I bought this a couple of months ago and it is still on my frequent play list.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I can't wait for the next one.  I couldn't put the story down.  I hope the follow up is as good.  Travis and Abby will frustrate you and then make you laugh.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We really like this game. The game really plays well on a 7 inch tablet. Age span for us is 8-12.
0316228532|5.0|The thing about this book is that the pages turn slowly.<br /><br />That's not a knock, but I would find myself engrossed in it for an hour and realize I'd only read a fraction of the pages I usually did.  Like the Potter books, each paragraph is filled with details, word play and dark humor--there is no skimming (which is my usual M.O., but I didn't want to here).  But here there are no wizards to entertain, only a mundane village at a particularly un-mundane moment.  With chips on their shoulders and such a trivial subject as everyday people, this rich density is, I suspect, why so many people couldn't get into it.<br /><br />Had any number of British authors written this book, it would have been praised.  Don't be mistaken, it is very British; again, no wizards are about to bridge the gap for Americans.  It is clever, and I found myself wanting to read it whenever I was doing something else.  Like her other work, I wanted to know what happened.<br /><br />There are number of reasons Rowling got knocked about, many of them you read about or could guess.  But if you read the Potter books because of the writing, you'll like this book, too.  I hope people get past her earlier work (which I also enjoy) and that this gets a second look when the paperback comes out.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|i am enjoying the game.  thanks a bunch!  looking forward to a sequel.....great graphics and interesting story...nice combination of mystery and hidden object game.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|this is an amazing story..... somehow i feel cheated not knowing aboutt him until now....  i hope many find this artist!
B00AW8UK0K|1.0|The 5:2 diet is an increasingly popular diet plan with a flowery of newspaper articles and books being published on it in the last few years.<br />The diet first reached wide popularity via a BBC Horizon documentary called \\"Eat, Fast and Live Longer\\", broadcast in August 2012 and authored by Michael Mosley.<br />The 5:2 diet is based on a principle known as intermittent fasting (IF-ADF) - where you eat normally at certain days and then fast during other days.<br />The 5:2 diet is relatively straightforward - you eat normally five days a week, and near-fast on the other two days eating only 500 to 600 Kcal.<br />The method has proved to be quite effective in its original format.<br />The problem here is the revised format suggested by authors which consits of two/three split meals in the \\"fasting\\" days thus translating an alternate-day-fasting protocol into a two-days-a-week-restricted-calorie protocol. It's like changing princes into frogs. Besides there are no clinical trials at the moment supporting this method.<br />IF-ADF (alternate fasting day) protocols works (and gives their healthy benefits) because they extends the nightly fasting window up to 20 hrs. This pattern is broken if you eat twice (every eight-twelve hours as suggested here) during the fasting days.<br />I'm a doctor in medicine currently researching on the effects of intermittent fasting and my professional opinion is that if you follow the regimen suggested here you might as well lose some fat but you'll also lose half the benefits IF can offer, thus minimizing its impact on your health.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Very clear, pretty tiles and ease of use<br />I play this game a lot and this a better version than a lot of them.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|I gave the first book 5 stars, I think the only reason I gave this a 4, is because Alex is missing. Still a great book and I am buying the 3 rd as soon as I am done writing this review.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun you can unlock  prizes and the game is a blast. I just got the game and already am addicted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting it is endless fun the upgrades are amazing and you can compete against friends. i recomend it to every one
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app!!!I have been waiting for this app to come out on the kindle.I like that you can adjust the visual quality
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Must have I play this where ever I go I'm addicted, Its for all ages & it's something to pass time I play when I am at work on the bus while watching television
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I found the story well written, but very predictable and ho hum. I ended up skimming the last 25% just to get it over with, hoping that some cool twist would redeem the time I spent reading it, there wasn't one. I didn't connect with the main characters and the twist concerning one of the secondary characters was lame.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|A couple of the dvds stop in the middle in a few spots so I need to retract them. Otherwise, good. Reasonable. Son loves them.<br />Selller good. Prompt communication and delivery. Nice to have a complete set.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Colleen Hoover's book Hopeless is an amazing story. It's a drama, mystery and a romance story. Great depth of the main and secondary characters. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, it was hard to put down. I liked it even more than her other book Slammed.<br />Fabulous story, extremely well written, highly recommended.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy's best book since The Bear and the Dragon. While I don't like that one of my favorite authors is using a second author, this combo really delivered here and now I have to go buy the proceeding book to find out some very important back story on everyone's favorite ex-Seal.
B008X9Z3UC|1.0|This item says it will fit the kindle 7\\". It really is not a good fit. My son never uses it. Waste of money. Cheap item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very very addictive. Most fun I've had playing a game in a long time.  I play more than my 6 year old grandson.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think Mystery Manor requires a lot of brain and skill. And it is also a lot of fun.<br />Because there are other things to do.
0140177396|5.0|Steinbeck at his best in this novel, should be required reading in schools. I was surprised it was still in print.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought this was excellent. The only thing that I had trouble with was all the scientific terminology and medical terms.But I did feel the heart of it and the perpose. There is proof of heaven here.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I just ordered this.  I saw it on Netflix 3x when it was instant when it first came out and I just had to have the entire season to watch whenever I want.  This happens to be my favorite season!  Gory and sexy!  I like this story better than the others as well.  The story keeps moving along, whereas the others keep you in the same spot knowing that nothing would ever change no matter how much we, the audience, wanted it to.<br /><br />I also love Gaia's role in this season, better than the annoying Elythia in the others seasons, even though Viva Bianca plays her role very well.<br /><br />In addition, the suspense of Gannicus & Melita's love affair keeps you on your feet and you really will not know what happens next.  My favorite!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Having heard so much about this game, I got it for my son for christmas and he was normally into other games - assassins creed, borderlands etc... but he told me that this ranked up there in his top 5. All 3 in one package was phenomenal.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Well told story, perfect ending. Deep truths. Inspiring story about life and our path through it. In my top 3!
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|To hear this icon of rock live again (although 5 years after the concert originally was held) took me back. Robert Plant still enchants the audience. Jimmy Page &#34;The maestro&#34; sweeps us into the tune. John Paul Jones, underrated but shouldnt be - fluid. No Bonzo but his son more than adequate to fill his shoes.<br /><br />The whole experience is/was epic and organic at the same time. May they decide to get back together and tour, i am one person who will be on line for the show.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The first game I got i enjoy playing in order to waste time perfect for when u need a distraction and such
B0085A9HXS|4.0|The action was great, better most so-called martial arts movies, but it had definite flaws in the story. I did enjoy it but expected more.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Love the music and the DVD.  Terrific concert!<br />Recommend to other music lovers and it makes a good introduction to a talented singer.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Being a Marvel Fan, i understood, unlike others, that this was only telling the beginning of the story. I liked it and looking forward to the next one.
B008D28HYS|4.0|Much like the original.  Hours of fun brain teasing.  The drawback is that the number of color combo cause the clue rows to be too long to show in pull down mode, so there is lots of scrolling.  I know that this doesn't make sense to new users, but fans of the original should understand.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This remake sucks more than the \\"Total Recall\\" remake, and I didn't think that was possible!!! . Are all the creative people gone in Hollywood, WTF !!!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This was a very engaging read. The story line kept me turning the pages and was hard to leave even for a short time.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|At the end of season 6, I was a bit skeptical about how they were going to start Season 7 since Deb finally caught Dexter in the act. The writers do a fine job with this new brother/sister conflict that has emerged. There are bits of seasons 1 - 6 that are tied into this season very accurately. Remember the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\" and \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\"? The beautiful Aimee Garcia is superb as Dexter's new love interest. I believe I had never seen her acting before and she is great here. Very real and convincing! A fine, fine season indeed! Season 8 cannot start soon enough. The cliff hanger to end this season was shocking and I can't wait for more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok  I found out about this game through my friends and it rocks! It's the best free game I have ever played a matter of fact it is better than payed games I definitely wanna recommend this game it is the bomb ...... what do you do in the game? You run away from a police officer and dodge trains and collect coins sometime you get powers that either allow you to fly on a jet pack or get bouncy shoes that allow you to jump on to moving trains! There are also some ramps that allow you to run on top of trains to . Anyway, you should get this game and if you get it and don't like it you have a problem!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A well written story with lots of technical information to fill your mind with the \\"necessary\\" information about everything involved in each situation. Although too much information for many, it's not too much for everyone.
B0011TNVLY|4.0|The Polar Express has had it's fair share of criticism, but it can be a wonderful movie to own if you just take it for what it is.  Frankly, we bought it because my son is obsessed with trains, and this movie has the best CGI train I can find.  We skipped to the scene where that huge chunk of iron is screaming across the ice because that part took our breath away.  We laughed and gasped as if we were on a carnival ride.  (Put your kid on your lap and lurch to the side now and then...it's awesome while watching this scene!)  After a while, my son wanted to see more of it, so the songs and dances became a bonus, and he loved the action at the end with Santa's sleigh taking off and the kids sliding around on factory equipment.  It is a little long, so if your kids are young, show it to them in two or three parts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are amazing its realistic the only thing I find annoying is that all the good stuff costs real money like diamonds but otherwise the game is great.(:
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very good game to follow-up the first Temple Run and made new things like ziplines,minecarts and emeralds I like it
B00865P3AS|5.0|Great album. I love that they took their concept a step further to make it even cooler than I ever would have imagined. Plus, the Muse cover as a single, WITH NAYA RIVERA, is hotter than hot. Love it! [...]
B003Y059EK|4.0|I saw this movie with my children back in the 80's.  While not as &#34;hollywood&#34; as the MGM production, I really enjoyed it.  It is about the further adventures that Dorothy has in Oz.  She is still a child, rather that a teen, and is more convincing as one who would fall into the Oz fantasy.  Her new friends are interesting and fun.  It has plenty of drama and enough humor to lighten the intensity, and the villains are evil enough to satisfy that appetite in any kid.  Graphics are certainly outdated by now, but at least, parents needn't worry that it is too graphic.  Would probably be too &#34;campy&#34; for a teen, but an elementary age child should enjoy it.  Topics to note, for parents of very young children:  The dancing girls in Oz have had their heads removed, and the villainess uses the heads to change out on herself; the evil gnome king intends to eat his victims alive, & the scene in the mental institution with the electroshock therapy is startlingly realistic and frightening, for early 20th century.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This was a real waste of a movie. While I understand it is a remake, nothing about this movie was original or unique. Every element of the plot, the technology and \\"sci-fi\\" elements are all from many movies before it. Regular 9mm guns from CSI? Really I want to watch them shoot the same guns as real life from the 70's? That is not sci-fi. Pretty boring I can't recommend watching it especially if you have to pay for it. The sci-fi scenery makes for about 20 minutes of interesting viewing, but that is the only plus side to the movie.
B005LAII80|4.0|Dredd was one of the most underrated action movies of 2012,It fired on both cylinders in terms of action and entertainment,one the better ideas in Hollywood to remake a previous \\" heaping pile \\" into a great action flick . Actor Karl Urban stayed into character as Judge Dredd , the scenery, special effects,weaponry and soundtrack most of all the violence was put to good use.It reminded you of the RAID only a little bit in terms of going from floor to floor and facing opposition from criminals and traps.A very good action movie that has gruesome and brutal images of violence at times,don't let that stop you from being entertained.
B004KA9MQO|2.0|Jennifer knows how to sing but she didn't do well with this cd. I barely listen to it it's just not what you look for in an artist.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|After years of giving his fans and movie lovers lackluster and forgettable movies,Finally Denzel Washington gets to perform his most complex-ed characters  to date,a bravura piece of acting,in which he portrays a man who loses his dignity due to self gratification and how he struggles to get his honor and sanity back.How the story is told and the supporting cast lifts an ordinary story into extraordinary tale filled with reality, humor and sadness,there is not a lot to get into detail about this movie, it is a performance driven piece,tailored made for one of America's best actor working today,Denzel Washington gift is on display and he deliver the goods in this film,kudos to John Goodman,for taking a risk in making us laugh at a not so funny subject matter,his comic relief was necessary at times.A well told story with a lot of heart.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Another book from George Martin that I couldn't put down. Definitely a story I will read again. Can't wait for the final books in the series to be released.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An amazing book I loved it so much. This is just one if those books that right In the middle you stop reading it because you don't want it to end. A book of true feelings and life giving the book true character,if you don't read this book you are missing an asset to life. ( it was that good)
B007HACDLK|5.0|One of his best books, hard to put down! Mitch Rapp doing what he does best in the Middle East.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is very fun! The graphics are better than Temple Run 2! If you want an action packed, amusing, and fun game.....then download this app!!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This video game is the best game ever because the game has great features and great speed so the game should keep multiplying for the rest of the generation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i think this game is so fun. i am so addicted to i, its not even funny. i give this game five stars.
B00B7G3Y4U|3.0|I've liked the series. Even though it kinda flip flops around. Still some good scares. So if you've liked the rest, you'll like this too.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|Not only did this give me true insight into Jewish life in hiding, it gave  me a better understanding of life. I found that I could understand her. It seems that the internal struggles she went through as a teenage girl is what I struggle with too.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|My grandson loves Star Wars Legos.  He has been wanting this kit so we splurged and got it for his recent birthday.  It has been worth every penny to see how much he is enjoying putting it together.  He usually is able to put a kit together in a day or two but this one is giving him a bit of a challenge....LOVE it!  He likes the challenge and can't wait to see the completed model.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffer is the most fun I've had in my entire life.It's so much better than the greatest game of all time.Especially temple run 2
B0061NCTHC|4.0|Great Vocalist; good music, the production of the actual concert was not what I expected; more so when compared to David Bisbal's DVD en El Teatro Madrid. DVD was notwhat I expected.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Awesome. Always enjoy following Harry Bosch on his journey to solving a crime.  So realistic, felt like I was part of the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an epic adventure one day there's this and the next day there's that. I'm tying to beat my friends high score but it's well hard.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The new update will not install. Says there ifs already a package with the same name.  Please fix and I will give a higher rating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be one if my very favorite games in the whole world! I love to play it on my kindle.I absolutely love how it changes the settings and themes. I think the whole thing is just really fun and a great idea! I am so addicted to it.I never stop playing! :)
0979019710|5.0|The Miracle Morning has captured the best of every growth strategy suggestion I have ever read.  And I've read them all!  This easy read book gave me simple instructions and time frames to apply these strategies to my schedule.  My schedule can get crazy busy and I appreciated that Hal gave suggestions on how to consolidate the Miracle Morning process into a shorter time frame.  This is an amazing book and I recommend it to everyone!  Hal, you nailed it!
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|The actual game in itself was awesome. Almost exactly like minecraft, but on the demo, they only let you play for like five min on each section. No fair.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Pendergast takes us on one of his darkest journeys and keeps us guessing every step of the way. The authors do it again with another great quest for our resilient agent. Loved it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Best game ever! I used to have it on my iPod touch, and now I have it on my kindle. Super addicting and fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the. New temple run 2 it's so much more fun than 1 if you bid in 1 you out but  in 2 you collect Monet and dimoands  and with diomanin if. You die you can come back
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I already have 10 books and starting another it really is a Must buy Of course you have to get it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first because of the way the chapters go, but then I got right into it.  Great storyline and good ending.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|If you look on your home screen go to photos look at the top right there is a camera. Don't waste yo cash.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|I loved this book, and I couldn't stop reading it. Th  suspense was killing me!!! I highly recommend this book to all readers.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome, and what surprise  me was the world tour part. First new york, and now RIO! Five stars
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It seems like I  sit down to play a game and end up playing three or four.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the new update with all the bright colors from Rio! My kids play this game and its a great way to pass the time while waiting for appointments and such.tree
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is interesting and has a good storyline. The puzzles are challenging but not frustrating. The monkey companion is a nice extra touch.
0345803485|3.0|The writing wasn't that bad but why did the story have to be told from Ana's POV? Ana was childish and emotionally inmature and totally inmature in her outlook on life I don't care what her degree was! She was to awkward and had little confidence. This series could have been \\"Fifty Shades\\" better had the writer not written from Ana's POV and Mr. Gary's voice be heard!  He has depth and personality that Ana lacks.  I read the entire trilogy and even recommended it to others dispite my annoyance with various parts of the books.
1416905014|5.0|If you have a princess lover she will not be disappointed with this pop-up book  Awsome art with beautiful scenes.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is my third book in Ms. Gabaldon's &#34;Outlander&#34; series and I love it.  I'm only about 2/3 through with it and will jump on the next one right before I finish.<br />Since there are several more to come, I'm guessing that this saga will go on for another generation or so and ready to all the way with them.<br />By the way, I'm glad I'm reading this on my Kindle Fire since It is more than 1200 pages long and my arms would get very tired holding it up.
0439882826|5.0|Brings Star Wars to life with some outstanding artwork in pop-ups.  Any Star Wars fan will cherish this book for sure.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book! Really easy read and great story line, couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see the movie
B00AA0U05A|2.0|This CD definitely reminds me of my mom listening to her old records while we were cleaning the house. They definitely have chose the perfect name for this CD. It personally pulls at my heart strings because of the memories that it stirs within me. Can I say, I'd like to listen to this CD on a regular bases?? No. It is not my type of music on a regular bases. On Sentimental Journey, the multi-talented actress and singer brings her stellar voice to songs popularized by some of the most beloved artists of the last century.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  This country should be forever grateful for his service and the service of all of the other members of our military.
0525953728|5.0|I ordered this book for my husband. He loved it. He read it in a matter of days. The book arrived quickly, and was a good price. I would recommend both the seller and the product to others!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I bought the game cause of the reviews. I beat the game second time I tried so not really much if any gameplay. Just find papers and that's it no story. I just don't get it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so amazing that me and my sister can't get enough of it. My sister usealy hates temple run but now she likes it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|What a great game really was surprising how addictive it is!! I'm not into dragons but hooked on this game.
B00B04NJLW|3.0|I love horror anthologies but &#34;The ABC's Of Death&#34; is doing a little too much. Its hard to find satisfaction in 26 different 5 minute (or shorter) horror shorts especially some that are as bizarre as this bunch, I definitely would have liked some of them more had they been longer and I'm sorry to say but allot of the shorts are down right stupid and I mean stupid.<br /><br />I really don't want to give away any of the shorts since they are only 5 minutes a piece but I will give you a few I thought were really below the mark!<br /><br />&#34;F is for Fart&#34; was so weird it almost made me stop watching, the whole concept was horrible and downright.....I don't have a word to explain, its bad.<br /><br />&#34;G is For Gravity&#34; was another straight out dumb short, someone drives to the beach with a surf board and backpack full of bricks, goes out into the ocean and I guess drowns? Probably the plainest short of the bunch.<br /><br />&#34;Z is for ???&#34; I don't even know how to spell the word given let alone explain what the short was about! All I know is that some Japanese girl had a huge penis which had a blade that came out of the tip, it is by far the weirdest short of the bunch!<br /><br />Those are a few examples of bad shorts, others I felt were horrible were &#34;E&#34;, &#34;F&#34;, &#34;G&#34;, &#34;H&#34;, &#34;K&#34;, &#34;M&#34; and &#34;O&#34; but I won't spoil them for any potential viewers as I'm sure there's probably a few that could find them to their liking.<br /><br />There were three shorts that really stood out in my mind as the best of the bunch, I loved the torture concept for &#34;L is for Libido&#34; which I think is the most touchy and twisted short of the group due in part to a young boy rape scene you don't actually see, &#34;V is for Vagitus&#34; which was the only sci-fi short and &#34;X is for XXL&#34; which dealt with an overweight woman who's tormented by skinny people. Those three were my absolute favorite, hell I would love &#34;L&#34; and &#34;V&#34; as full length features if they could be done right!<br /><br />I did however find enjoyment or something to like in &#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;, &#34;D&#34;, &#34;N&#34;, &#34;Q&#34;, &#34;S&#34; & &#34;T&#34;. Any other letter was just whatever to me, somewhere in between the good and the horrible.<br /><br />I wanted to love this film so much but found myself making puzzled faces throughout most of the film, I would definitely recommend you see this just for the experience of it all but be prepared to see some of the weirdest stuff you've might ever seen in your life. I would recommend you rent this first, I thought about buying it when available but I'm not to sure just yet If the good really outweighs enough of the bad.they could be done right!

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I Love that this book is very realistic in how both Parents differ in how they view loyalty and love for the same person. Reading this book I couldn't help asking myself which Parent would I be?  Which one is wrong? The truth is that love, honesty and loyalty can never be wrong, but can sometimes have very tragic consequence.<br />I applaud the Author for it's rare to read such a moving and thought provoking book.
B008476HBM|5.0|Very good book. Understand why it has stood the test of time and movies have been made of this classic.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|The only positive thing about this book is that I was able to borrow it rather than waste money paying for it.  I don't understand how people can think this is a good read.  If you used this book as toilet paper it would be just as irritating and painful as reading it.  Having read it, I kinda wish I would have picked the other option.<br />Subtract what you like about Follet, multiply what you dislike about Follet and you've got this pile.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|This is a great movie!!!!!!. The whole family will love, sure to be a classic. If you like to laugh this movie is for you.
B009XY97VC|5.0|This album makes me feel like I'm living in a movie.  It is my new soundtrack of life.  I am ready to buy more.  I even looked these guys up on their website and they are awesome.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|Had a lot of the music that I used to listen to..  The cast did a decent job on the songs.
0553801503|5.0|The song of ice and fire continues with a relentless pace for a thrilling fourth time, are you ready for more blood and honor?
B009G78EE2|4.0|Top to bottom an outstanding album.  Deep issues are dealt with in a very relatable way. \\"Starting Over\\" is my personal favorite but not a bad song to be found throughout.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been addicted to subway surfed since I started playing . I love the fast pace and the anticipation of winning prizes. Strongly reccommend. Very addictive.
0691130272|5.0|This is a new edition of 'Galactic Dynamics'. Lots of sections were updated.<br />The book is excellent. I use it for graduate class, which I teach, and<br />I use it for reference.
B00915G6NK|5.0|NCIS-Los Angeles returns for a fourth season, featuring more action-filled episodes.  Fans of the series are likely to enjoy the storylines and the dynamics of a terrific cast.<br /><br />At the end of Season Three, the NCIS-LA team was left in a bad place, after botching the exchange of a particularly nasty terrorist.  Special Agent G. Callen (Chris O'Donnell) was in polic custody for murder, mysterious Operations Manager Hettie Lange (Linda Hunt) had been forced into retirement, and the rest of the team was in disgrace.  The clever season opener will reveal how the team survived.<br /><br />A two part episode later in the season offers a peek into the personal life of Sam Hanna (LL Cool J), when an old comrade turns up dead after investigating an alleged Soviet sleeper cell, which just might have smuggled nuclear weapons into the U.S.  An outstanding Christmas episode has the team conducting an investigation on board a Navy ship.  Fans will get to see Hanna and Kensi Blye (Daniela Ruah) in uniform and the rest of the cast at sea, including LAPD detective Marty Deeks (Eric Christian Olsen).  The complicated undercover lives of Callen and Lange will come back to haunt the team more than once in the new season, along with everyone's unfavorite NCIS assistant director Owen Granger (Miguel Ferrar).<br /><br />Marty Deeks and Kensi Blye will continue the delicate (and humorous)dance of their partnership, which keeps threatening to turn into something else.  Computer geek Nell Jones (Renee Smith) will use unique persuasion to get fellow geek Eric Beale (Barrett Foa) to dress as an elf for a Christmas party.  Peter Cambor will return as Dr. Nate Getz for a difficult episode involving the battle death of a Marine.  Callen and Hanna will continue to set a high standard for risk-taking during an operation.  \\"NCIS-LA: The Fourth Season\\" is highly recommended to its fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once you master the moves this is a cool game.  I kill a lot of time trying to keep from running into trains and beat my high score!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Got this for my 8.9 inch kindle and it never lags, the graphics are great (as far as minecraft goes) and the controls are intuitive. Portable addictive minecraft, the only downside isthere are a lotof items missing, but I'm sure that will be taken care of. A bit pricy, but worth, the the lite before you spend seven dollars on an app.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I like temple run 2 but it freezes up on me and it also does not work most of the time. And I have a Kindle Fire so that makes no sense not to work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game especially going different places around the world I love it I am in Rio at the moment I have already been to new York

B0001L3MI0|5.0|Great movie where you just forget about life for awhile and get absorbed in big story. Will Smith is a favorite!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy trying to figure every puzzle out :) I recommend it for anyone! go for it everyone!!!!!!! but warning it can get hard to figure out
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Will Smith is so much fun to watch! Such a crazy idea for a story line but they made it work. Throw 3D in the mix and it's a great night at the movies!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much I want to play all the time and look forword to playing Everest I love it

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game I have so much fun playing with it and it makes it even better because I can play with my family and friends
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once I started reading the first book I was hooked.<br />It was an enjoyable read.  Now I know what all<br />the excitement was about!
B00005BF9Z|5.0|It was instant love listening to Manu Chao's &#34;Esperanza&#34; in front of a fire  in a cottage overlooking the wild bay of the Sheepshead peninsula.  My friend and I asked our innkeepers if they could find us a bite to eat so we didn't have to drive a half hour up a narrow dirt road in the rain to a pub.  They agreed and we lit a fire and found this CD in their collection and all was cozy.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think that this game is so cute.You get little pets to take care of. I have at least 30 pets now. I really enjoy this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would refer this to a marry couple or anyone that is intimate with each other. Great book to read.
1616550414|5.0|After receiving mine and enjoying it, I ordered 3 more as gifts. It covers each game in sequence in relation to the story line.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game so much! It was so dang awesome! This game is better than temple run one & two!
B002BY62A0|5.0|This is a must-read book.  I have purchased several copies for friends and family. If you watched Forks Over Knives, this is more of the same, just more in-depth.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This dictionary was very helpful in the fact that I could find almost all the words I was looking for, but I could not find all of them. I could not find the word \\"cryptid,\\" meaning beings that may or may not exist. Other than that, I found this dictionary was very helpful.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and I love taking turns with this game and trying to beat each others score.  Easy play and requires quick reflexes.  Lots of laughs and uh ohs!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome and so fun to play with especially the different types of it like New York and Rio
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is a super historical based adventure.  One of the best mini series ever produced for television.  A two thumbs up rating. Enjoy.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Love this author, and his books keep you on edge till the end, not quite knowing who has done what,<br />Recommend this book.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|After I went to Doodle God`s main menu, I clicked on the options tab. It brought up all of the regular stuff like sound, but there was a kid safety option. I clicked on it, and it brought up several pictures of Doodle God art. I started pressing the buttons at random. I soon realized that I locked myself out of some Doodle God content. (Beer and alcohol) I can't figure out how to figure out my unlock that content. :/<br />But those of you who want to purchase this game, and don't want your kids to see the word \\"sex\\", go ahead. You can set a password for them.<br />Doodle God is actually kind of fun. It helps pass time faster. So yeah.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome temple run 2 is an awesome game to play swinging on vines to kicking but always play every day. and win!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game on kindles it is fantastic and is way better than temple run one and two I like the world tour thing a lot too
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I thought that it was an amazing book. I understood the whole book and I'm only 14. And btw  loved the book.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|I was 100% satisfied. This superb game kept me entertained for days. I would recommend this to people who like Temple run.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|The movie had some fun action in it, which actually got a little repetitive. The acting was mediocre at best. I wish I'd read the book first. I am sure it was much better.
1451695195|5.0|The author shares his experience in a very open and inspiring way, but also focuses on his experience from a scientific point of view using his background as a neurosurgeon. All the questions that a critical listener might ask, the author asks himself and explains the answers he came up with. I would recommend this book to anyone who (such as I) has recently lost a loved one and finds themselves faced with the need the find out more on this subject. Unfortunately in our culture we tend to turn our back on anything to do with death. Having worked in the medical field myself for twelve years now I learned that approaching the subject as a natural process makes more sense. Taking it from there everyone has to find their own way and answers. I found this book very helpful in that aspect and well written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great for my kids they love it but we have not gotten the new updates that their friends they play with have!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love being able to get books on the road.  It's perfect for my Samsung tablet and my Droid phone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Outstanding series with top notch script and acting.<br />It is creative and fresh and truly enjoyable to watch. Love it.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|A bit too graphic for my taste.  A lot of blood and a lot of sex.  Will suit others, just not me.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|It is a great comedy.  Not vulgar. Spicy but good family movie  Even little kids.  Love it as well as adults.  Susan Sarandon is awesome and the characters are great !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is highly entertaining. A little advanced for young kids but still a lot of fun for adults and older kids.
B004LUS390|4.0|I'm still sampling what's out there.  This is a fairly complex app, even though it's not Sketchbook Pro, which I assume is moreso.  There's definitely a learning curve.  However, if you take the time to familiarize yourself with the navigation and to explore the possibilities offered by the interesting and very adjustable brushes.  It's especially worthwhile if you invest in a stylus (I use a Sensu Brush on my Nexus 7) so you can do more precise work.  Two warnings: first, you should save your work often because it's too easy to hit the wrong icon and lose your image forever--there's no automatic save.  And second, I can't find any documentation or instruction manual for this program!  It came with sort of YouTube video, which didn't work, and was for Sketchbook Pro anyway.  Have looked on line with no luck.  So you're on your own learning this app.  But I still think it's worth the time and effort.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Both my children, (under 12) enjoy creating new dragons. I have enjoyed the &#34;wall/messages&#34; by this I mean everybody, and I mean everybody,has offer  informative advice in the quest of building a Dragon Story.

B009AP2G26|5.0|The writing is intelligent and never dumbs down. The musical numbers remind me of the Golden Age of Musical Theatre. The performers are all star quality and the characters they play have depth. I rarely watch TV anymore, and am pleased that I can get it on the Internet!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very addicting<br />It makes you want to play it again<br />To me it is better than temple run<br />You should play it
0783231032|5.0|This movie is a classic! A light hearted take on the psyche of the American citizens in the days after Japan bombed Pearl Harbor; when patriotism was tested and American pride had been bruised, the folks on the home front were determined to defend our country at any cost. Slim Pickens is hysterically funny; Ned Beatty is great as the typical 40's patriarch keeping the wolves away from two beautiful young USO newbie daughters mobbed by lonely military guys; while his two younger sons engage in typical adventures of their young imagination fueled by the unrest in the world. Ned is the guy who would have been in uniform if he were eligible to serve, and jumps at the chance to serve his country from his own backyard. His naive wife is scared silly with the usual war propaganda and wants all guns out of her house, which inspires Ned to prove he has the courage to do whatever it takes to repell the invaders, even if that means all he owns is blown to smithereens once he remembers the sequence the Army guy told him to &#34;never&#34; initiate with the canon installation left in his backyard to defend the California coast! As his wife frantically runs from room to room gathering knickknacks and photos, each time she looks toward a window, she can see Ned swinging the muzzle of the cannon in the front yard through the windows in the front of the house to the windows in the back to get a good shot at a Jap sub just off shore. Classically funny, a must see!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely love this game, it's fab, so addictive, can't stop playing :) it runs smoothly, just frustrating I can't beat friends scores lol.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I love my CD! It delivered very fast, love John Mayer's music, this was the first Cd of his that I ever purchased and it sounds great and you can't beat the Amazon prices&#34;
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Makes a good airline movie. I needed a light movie and decided n this one. Not disappointed - just entertaining, that's about it :)
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I love super Mario Mario world etc. as a kid that was my fave game. thisnis the same premise. so if ur a Mario fan you'll love this game. I do!  its fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game. Really addictive and you can link up with your friends by connecting up with your facebook details so its really good to see what your competitive side is like!  I really reccomend it.
B005LAIGLE|2.0|My foolish baboon of a bride Bessie has always had a thing for Marky Mark.  He's usually pretty good when he's not singing and he's decent in this movie as he does a good job as the duped reformed criminal gone good gone bad gone good to support the Mask lookalike baby brother of the stupidly blonde (and everhot) Kate Beckinsale.  Boom boom boom, but no matter.  The movie is too darn long, too unbelievable, and there is nowhere near enough Kate to make up for the 107 minutes of stupidity and boredom.  Not recommended.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded about a week ago and have been enjoying it. No glitches so far, card movements are smooth. Curently one of my favorite games!
B006YTTVHO|2.0|Very simple tips and techniques that seem like common sense. For example, keep eye contact, stay positive, stay interested in the other person.. also has conversation starters that are pretty lame and I wouldn't advise anyone to use most of them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very fun game to play on your down time .it get to the point where you want to see how fast the game can get. Get this game it's free anyway :)
B00136RYXG|5.0|I love this album. Pink turned it out on her debut album. Classic. One of the best debut albums ever.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I will always love this story.  I have seen many movies about this story.  It was fascinating to read the story and visualize the characters in my own mind.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its very fun I will go and play it in my closet befor I go to bed and play it subway surfur awesome
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Nice charger for a decent price. I've used it a couple times and it seems the charge the phone fairly quickly.  Only down side is a VERY snug fit in the car's power outlet. Tough to put in and tough to take it back out. But overall it has a very solid feel to it and seems like it should last.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I am amazed at the popularity of the &#34;Les Mis&#34; play and movie, because after the 1st 32 pages of character exposition of just one character, I wondered what the hype is about. Then another 10 pages to describe his house. I've never seen the musical, or films, so maybe that's my problem? No wonder the book is so long. Nowadays editors say &#34;show the readers, don't tell them&#34; but I guess in Victor Hugo's time you could just tell them, and tell them, and tell them. A gazillion people love the musical so I guess there's a story in there somewhere, about D-------, or M----------, or whatever. I'll keep looking but if I pass 100 pages and still no plot I might just give up.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's great fun and funny with a bunch of things you can buy without real money but some things it makes you buy with real money well just coins but it gets kinda boring after a while
B007YNBOJM|5.0|I love this headset.<br />the ears are not incredibly realistic but they are soft, good quality, and interchangeable. XD<br />Also, the technology is amazing and watching the ears move is fun (and very distracting) after a while the ears seem to get \\"used\\" to you and react more accurately to your emotion, one of mine (the right) even twitches when I'm mildly annoyed. a stock of batteries (preferably rechargeable) are a MUST!
B005HSL626|4.0|It's fun and very addicting but the only thing bad is that it gets kinda boring for some. I would get it!
B00632HWOG|4.0|Easy access 2 my emails & a good SPAM filter saves me a lot of time; however, when I delete an email from my Kindle Fire, it is still there when I access Yahoo through my laptop.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it's great it has much better graphics and has great things to do. I WOULD GET THIS GAME!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Can you play online with this one? But I really like the game! But comment if you do know how.
B002ZG980U|3.0|it arrived new, but the case was broken at the top  straight out of the package. probably the mail service at fault
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Read it in less than 5 days· It will keep you sucked into the games- you never know who's gonna die or what's gonna happen. The suspense is very well written! A must read for sure!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of this fantasy and wished it would never end.  I hope the author writes more stories along these lines.  Thank you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Best sequel I've read! You'll love this if you read the first book; The Hunger Games
0765325950|5.0|It was a very fitting and thrilling conclusion to a story that has been part of my life for the past 21 years.  I was very excited to read it and now that it is done I'm sad that there is no more and that, for all intents and purposes, that chapter of my life is over.  Here's hoping Brandon Sanderson can keep up the great work with is Stormlight books.  I've certainly become a of his as well!  Maybe they'll keep me busy for the next 20 years.  I certainly hope so!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Energy needs to be unlimited but other than that it is more fun than frontiersville. good details and graphics. wish it could have unlimited energy and I could do a lot more
B00AREIAI8|5.0|really great graphics. pretty simple game to play but takes time to earn money and health points.<br />asdfgghh jkkjgvg hhjbjjj
B0065GC0BA|5.0|A read that will stay with you long after you have read the last page, is possibly one of the most thought-provoking books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good story line. Enjoyable performance by Clint Eastwood and cast. I would recommend this movie for a lazy night at home.
B001BR5NN0|1.0|I never actually got to watch the movie.  Playback was unable to occur because apparently I didn't have the most recent version of Flash to play the movie.  So I uninstalled and then re-installed my flash (it is the most recent version of Adobe Flash available), and tried again .  Same message.  So there was some sort of error with Amazon's playback service.  Bottom line, I never got to see the movie.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|On the Kindle Fire...once you get to 2,500 coins or more, it does 1 of 2 things. Either completely erases your coins or the game closes and restarts on its own. Either way you can never advance or use your coins towards anything. Please fix and I'll change my rating.
0547564651|3.0|I was attracted by the title of the book and thought I would pick up some important parenting skills. I was disappointed for this purpose.<br /><br />The book's main point is that intelligence is the not the most important factor for a child to succeed in life, but character/grit/willpower. And character is malleable and children learn better when focusing on learning from mistakes. In addition, secure attachment in early childhood years has long-term impact for life. The author gave many examples of inner city kids and their challenge and efforts,with the help from teachers and different programs, to build a successful life. The book reads more like an descriptive journal article on education reform. It is an interesting read, but the book tells more about WHAT makes a child successful rather than HOW to do it. This is not a parenting book with many techniques.<br /><br />BTW: as another reviewer pointed it out, the title mentioned Curiosity, but there is nothing on curiosity in the book.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Best book ever! The best thing since microwave pizza!The best one in the series!love the end of this book!  Thanks
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|I started watching this movie thinking it would be a funny lighthearted movie.  Guess it got me on an emotional night.  I found this movie very sad at parts, and really touched my heart.  Great story, great movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really fun game I really love to play it I usually play it all the time when I can because it is so fun I would most certainly recommend this game to other people it AWESOME!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so easy and fun I play it all the time I like horses  and it's like having a real horse
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is the best game in the entire world I love it so much so fun too get it for me
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Helps me pass the time away. I really dont like posting reviews. But offer me free stuff for it. Why the hell not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think now I know what \\"all the fuss was about\\"with the fifty shades. I think the books are well written and leave you wanting more. They are more than just erotica they have a story line and leave you wondering what will happen next!! I have read the 1st two and have started the third!!!

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This rates right up there with all of Tom Clancy's books.  Very interesting and I don't want to put it down.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Great TV from HBO.  Have really enjoyed the first season of GoT....did not catch it during it's run on HBO so I am playing catch up now.  Can't wait for season 2 to see how Daenerys raises her &#34;babies&#34; and how the Lannisters fare against the rest of the kingdoms.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Wonderful book to read!  Very comforting to know of this first hand experience and love how he has presented it.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|This is a good book to bring you up to speed on the HTML5 features. Book is an easy read with pretty good detail.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfer is a very addicting game with lots of excitement.Always something to do unlock new characters and earn more money.If you're a adult with kids it's a perfect game for both of you.Also it a free and not a scam game.Hope you will.enjoy it too.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The Sessions is a remarkable life story crafted with empathy, compassion, and wit.  It was not what I was expecting which made the lives in focus feel more heartfelt and soul searching... what are we on earth for, if not for each other?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was blissful romance, and a heartbreaking mystery entwined in one emotional story.<br /><br />Sky has spent her teenage years kissing on boys without feeling much of anything. She has no idea why she feels nothing but numbness and wonders if they're something wrong with her. Sky and her best friend, Six, go through boys, having fun, but never keeping one around for very long. This all changes when Sky meets Holder, the intense boy who thrills and scares her at the same time. Holden insists that Sky give him her name, but then seems disappointed when he finds it out. She can't get him out of her mind, since he's the only guy to have stirred feelings of attraction and lust. It doesn't help that Sky starts seeing him everywhere she turns, at school and on her daily runs.<br /><br />After reading mysteries for most of my life, it's hard to surprise me. While I did suspect some of what was going on here, I was pleasantly surprised when everything unraveled, at what I hadn't figured out. When I did finally find out all that was secret, my heart hurt for everyone involved. The very sad truth of this fictional story is that it happens all too often in real life.<br /><br />The romance is sure to please, packed with delicious amounts of tension filled scenes that sent shivers through my body just reading them! Here's a sample:<br /><br />He laughs, then drops his weight onto one arm, still hovering over me. He lowers his mouth to the side of my head and presses his lips to my ear. \\"You're a liar,\\" he whispers. \\"You're a whole lot attracted to me and I'm about to prove it.\\" I close my eyes and gasp the second his lips meet my neck. He kisses me lightly, right below the ear, and it feels like the whole room just turned into a tilt-a-whirl. He slowly moves his lips back to my ear and whispers, \\"Did you feel that?\\"<br /><br />I know I did!<br /><br />The relationship was more than sizzling attraction, this is a sweet romance that'll fill your heart with joy. Holder wasjust beyond amazing. Although, I wasn't sure of him at first, because some of the intense and passionate responses he had. My heart went to Sky even if I was puzzled by her actions in the beginning. She was easy to relate to once you gained a little more insight, and I just wanted to wrap my arms around her in a tight bear hug. Fortunately, she had Holder for that!<br /><br />I loved Slammed and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover so I was a little nervous going into this story that it wouldn't live up to my expectations. I shouldn't have worried because I loved this story as well. Don't let this self-published gem pass you by.
0439023491|4.0|If you enjoyed the Hunger Games first book, you will enjoy this second installment in the trilogy.  It is another quick read with captivating characters.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I recommend the entire series of 3. The reaves pretty fast, because you just have to know what is going to happen<br /><br />Suzanne Windows out at the end though, on 2 pages to tie it up. Katniss and Peeta he served much more face time. I hope she writes another so we fans can fin  our mod..about everybody . Especially Haymitch.....does he still live...etc? Needless to say the ending is bad, but the book is great all 3 of them.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My kids love , love, love this game.  This should be a 5 star but  the update for Fire Kindle is not available yet.....
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE this show, the costumes and drama, the players and storylines.<br />My only complaint, (in trying to catch up to the crowd and watch all of the past shows), is Amazon charges for the current season.  What gives Amazon??  You know we can watch it for FREE with On Demand, right??
B000HF6XV8|5.0|This is a really good movie.. My girls watched it for the first time and wanted to watch it all the time....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and the new Rio and NYC were awesome next you guys should make Africa that would be kool two thumbs up ,good graphics , and awesome boards and characters
B00B0NDF26|5.0|If you didn't listen to the words, you'd be transported back to the eighties where synthesizer pop dominated the school dances with lyrics that eschewed the highs of teen love.  Listen to the words and you will relive all the raw feelings of the dark side of teen love.  The words belie the cheerfulness of the synthesizers yet you can't stop listening because you have experienced every emotion Tegan and Sara manage to convey.  The music seduces you into allowing the lyrics to fill in the cracks of your brain and suddenly you are on all the romantic roller coaster rides of past relationships.  You'll find yourself replaying the catchy lyrics non-stop in your brain and you won't care to stop when you do realize it.  Every song has merit.  It is possibly the best album yet by the two sisters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|GREAT GAME CAN'T PUT IT DOWN.<br /><br />I HAVE SHARED THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS.  WOULD LOVE HAVE MORE GAMES LIKE THIS ONE.
B005R32L66|4.0|Occasional connection problems which we are not sure are due to the software or hardware. But it is great to use when traveling.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the new Temple Run 2. I don't however like that u lose your points when it reaches aboit 2000.  You can't upgrade to things that are over 2000 points. I hope that it gets fixed soon. My son loves to play it also. I may uninstall it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfer!! It is a really fun game and I love playing it with my friends :)<br />I think they should make one that is San Francisco version. That would be cool :)

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you read one you want to read the other two.  Couldn't put the book down.  Great book for when you can't leep.
B00ABO573A|3.0|Nothing special or riveting about this movie.  Lukewarm.  I gave a 3 star because if you have nothing better to do and are bored, then this movie is alright to watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I waited a long time to read this.  Didn't want it to end. I have never read a book tis fast.  Read all three in a month.  Normaly it would take me almost 2-3 months to fiis one bok.  The author is good.  Hope there will be more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Dear people,<br />  I think this game is really awesome and instead of 1coin that equals 1 cent, it should be 1 coin that equals 2 coins!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|It's a fun game and everything but it won't let mii go to my allies bases at all except the Sargent's. But other wise a gud game to play so if there's a way to go tell mii .

B000W15BW4|5.0|You won't be disappointed if you get this album. From the powerful, hard rocking title track to other gems such as \\"Awful\\" and \\"Boys on the Radio\\", this album gives a sort of skewed pop vibe that's sure to please fans of power pop and college rock. It's simply fantastic.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|completely unpredictable, silly, and endlessly imaginative. but most of all, just plain funny &#34;Where did they get &#34;Bleah, bleah? I never say that!&#34;? good job to the animators and the scriptwriters: keep up the good work!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|A stirring storyline that creates suspense and thrills that had me reading, digesting and envisioning the action described by a veteran action writer!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|i consider this a must have for your kindle fire hd!! the silk that comes with it is very restricting and i couldn't access sites i need so i figured how to get this to be my browser! just have to do a little research :)
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|While I'm familiar with and like the songs Andrea sings, I'm disappointed that there were no new canta.  The album is like songs of his best hits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a total upgrade featuring :<br />ziplines<br />bridges<br />a bigger beast<br />cool turns<br />nice backround<br />even the &quot;I&quot; at the beginning is an upgrade<br />and so much more
