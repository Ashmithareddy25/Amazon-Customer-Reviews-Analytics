B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I have fallen in love with this artist!!! Her lyrics are haunting and beautiful, yet fun and witty. I like almost every track and even the ones I didn't like in the beginning grew on me quickly. I love the fact that her music doesn't fit a label. It is all her own.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|I did not like it neither did my grandchildren, please I would Like credit for the game I purchased. I have removed it from my kindel
B008476HBM|5.0|Some books truly can fight against time. Still one of the best books i have ever read. Love story that always inspires.
1401941893|4.0|I rated &#34;Treasure Yourself: Power Thoughts for My Generation&#34; 4 shares because I did and still am enjoying reading Miranda's book. I am familiar with Louise Hay among many other teachers that speak about the power of your thoughts and how affirmations may change your life. Although many of the books concepts are not new ideas, I did enjoy the easy to follow layout and pretty overall feeling of this book, lined with flowers and her favorite insights.<br /><br />Small books hold value too... There isn't much content to the book, the first section has ideas, tips and reflection questions, while the center contains a few photos of her. The remainder of the book has affirmations, one per page. One of my favorite is, &#34;All is well in my world, I trust that whatever happens to me, happens for my highest good, every breathe I take creates my world, a world I appreciate and cherish.&#34; I still enjoy it, a small package made with love straight for us by Miranda!<br /><br />I found her suggestions on dreaming your way to success very relevant in my life. I've struggled with nightmares for over two decades and was pleased to see how to use power thoughts while I'm asleep. It sort of like meditating over a power thought. As your falling asleep, keep repeating this power thought as many times as you can. When you wake up, the very first thing is to repeat the power thought.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good book.I have enjoyed reading this book and will refer back to it. Miranda is honest and I like her thought process, &#34;I still have a lot of life experiences ahead of me and I'm sure I will come across more challenges along the way. Life is a continuous journey and there will always be more lessons to learn, more journeys to take, and more people who will impact my life in various ways.&#34;
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|It does change the sounds and such, but TBH I didnt really notice a huge difference outside of using my head phones. I hooked my tablet up to my surround sound and it does KINDDA change the quality, but not by a huge margin. Not enough for me to leave it on and burn more battery anyways.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|Like most books about the historical jesus i have read -  this really brings nothing new or shocking, at least not for me. It teases that it will reveal something but in the end it just says what you believe about jesus is faith and what we know about jesus is lost to history.  You might as well just pick up a free copy of the bible and go to a free church service and draw your own conclusions.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Works just like the product description indicated.  I read some mixed reviews prior to purchasing, but I thought I would give it a try.  I'm very pleased with the product!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Truely awesome picture! Great characters, very true to the book. One of my all-time favorites! Can't wait for the sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really enjoy playing this it keeps me busy when I'm bored. I stayed up all night playing this game and I like how it's like subway surfers buy better.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I swear by this brand of thermal paste. I believe that it is superior to other brands. Some of that belief has to do with data I've looked at, but much of it is because this is the product that seems to be preferred in the computer repair field. I use it on a regular basis to replace or do maintenance on processors and it always seems to perform quite well.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Fast shipping, brand new CD. Now I must fill space to tell you how happy I am. I'm f''ing happy!!!  :)
0679735259|4.0|This is mostly a worm's-eye view, told by a facile writer who travelled with the worms, but who was a correspondent and who got to deal with the colonels as well.  It is the Vietnam War described in vignettes and anecdotes -- factually and realistically, but sometimes metaphorically and impressionistically, and it adds up to a beautiful book.  It's many clear memories of war, not sequentially connected as a history, but vivid for being important for some personal reason.  All of them are interesting.<br />  Only three or four times was I unsure of what Herr meant when he got into an indirect, novelistic, way of explaining his reaction to an event.
1581804849|5.0|It explains everything very well. The pictures are very helpful. I can understand all the instructions. The step by step instructions make it easy to follow.
B00AYQNOU8|1.0|Weird...didn't realize it was a religion-based film<br />Weird...didn't realize it was a religion-based film<br />Amazon ended up selling me 2 copies of this when I only ordered 1.
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I rented this movie solely on the cast. I was not disappointed. It was funny as hell and the bloopers at the end were great.
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Works OK. The USB power and battery are nice. However, the actual amplification is not very sigificant, maybe 1.5 at best.
B003QSLW0K|5.0|I love this movie! I used to watch it all the time when I was little and I watched it again recently and it's so cute!
B00EDF43MY|1.0|So my barely two-year-old daughter loves the Dr. Panda Daycare, and one day while she was playing it, she somehow bought this airport app, despite my parental controls. I wasn't upset because I'd wanted to get her another one and as we'd been on a lot of planes the last couple of months, this seemed ideal. Like the other app, this one is a lot of fun for her. There is only one problem that makes me hate this app. Every time she clicks on one of the activities, a plane on a runway appears for no reason. It just sits there no matter how many times she clicks on it and then finally, when it gets in the mood, it takes off and she is finally directed to the activities. After a really fun activity, she clicks to get out and guess what? That's right. We go back to the stupid screen with the airplane and it has to take off again before she is allowed back to the main screen to pick another activity. This is NOT like the Panda Daycare. There we click on something and boom, you go in. The plane sitting around waiting on the tarmac is boring and my daughter gets frustrated because it seems so pointless. I honestly would give this app 5 stars if that screen didn't exist, but as it is, I cringe every time she choses to play it. It's just too LOOOOOONG to get to anything fun. Developers, if you take out that screen, I will happily update my review. But if you are a buyer and are looking for another app like the daycare, don't buy this one.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|it was a very great movie; enjoyed it tremendously and i would recommend highly to everyone who enjoy this type of movies
B0053TMP24|5.0|read all of the books enjlyed them I have even seen the movies when they come out to the theater
B0038NN3B4|4.0|Easily understood. I wish the book had contained more encouragement for participants to move through the phases so they would learn what their tolerance was for carbs to both continue to lose weight and more importantly remain at a healthy weight without further loss or gain. More concerns with the Plan than with the book.  Again, the book was well organized and informative.  One comment about unjust criticism of the plan by competing diets - Atkins is cited as the plan that eliminates carbs, which is not true.  Fact is, it allows you to determine how many carbs an individual can tolerate and that could be a large number, depending on the individual.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is a magnificently researched and written book.  Taking a scary real life nuclear disaster as storytelling thread, this book gives us a fascinating history of the development of nuclear weapons going back to the Manhattan Project, all told from the point of view of how safe and secure were all of these unbelievably powerful weapons.  This is a history not told before which spans many decades and many US Presidents.  As complicated and technical as the material might seem to be, the author makes it readable and easily understood.  The writing is careful and extremely good.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|What a beautiful cd.  The music is wonderful and just what can you say about Andrea Bocelli.  Heaven and more.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I wasnt expecting this movie to be so good so much action i was very impressed if you love action flicks go ahead and watch this.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|as with the first 3, it's hard to quit watching. it really grabs your attention & doesn't let go! awesome
B001KQZ7I8|4.0|Amazing story of human self-preservation.  It is one thing to read history books about atrocities and quite another to read about it from the perspective of the person who experienced it.  It broke my heart to read of his ordeal.  I cannot imagine having the perseverance to survive something this heinous.  The book caused me to pause to reflect on whether I am living my life to its greatest extent and benefit to the human race.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I had my own problems with Nolan's trilogy, I liked the action sequences, the complex storywriting and most of the acting very much, but I didn't like many of the \\"good\\"-side characters, mainly that of Batmans.<br />For the most part Bruce Wayne and Batman act out of selfish, boyish reasons through the whole trilogy, I didn't have the feeling that he really cares about the people of Gotham, not even that he really is able to do that. Revenge, love, his own image, that were the motivations for Nolan's Batman. He neither was really clever nor intelligent, only seldom did he foresee events, which would be another trademark of Batman, as I know and like him. Most of the time he was surprised and overwhelmed by the situations he got into. Of course, somehow he always found some hectic, accidental solution, mostly.<br />There are also some inconsistencies, at least for me. On the one side Rachel says in the end of Batman Begins, that Bruce never came back, and that his \\"real\\" face would be only a mask. With which Wayne agrees. Where on the other side Batman says he wears his (Batman-)mask to protect his beloved ones. It doesn't fit for me.<br />Alfred as the father figure, always lecturing Wayne, like he was a boy (which he IS in this trilogy) was another decision from the makers I didn't like. It might be forgivable in Batman Begins but not in the two Dark Knight sequels. Batman should be highly intelligent and mature for me, that is, what Batman is about.<br />And then the romances... Batman always in love or falling in love with somebody and always loosing his mind and reasoning because of it... That's almost the opposite of Batman, as I knew him. He even looses Rachel because of his carelessness! Caring is always also about thinking and keeping a calm mind, as well! To avoid hurting his beloved and himself. But Hollywood thinks a bit differently about this matter.<br />So that were my reasons, why I didn't like Nolan's trilogy, especially Dark Knight Rises. But 2 stars for the great action and decent storywriting (in the technical sense), the things I enjoyed in this movie and movies.
B008JFUO72|4.0|That was so good that I think I'll watch it again, right away! This is Iron Man at his best.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|As a 70 year old guy, before I saw it, I thought it was something for the ladies.  Got hooked after the first episode, and really enjoying it.  It is an upbeat, positive series.  Nice to have entertainment where with  rich guys aren't the bad guys!
1452113432|4.0|Little Paris Kitchen is very charming with tons of style and great recipes.  My only complaint is that my copy arrived with a very wrinkled dust cover.  Very disappointing. Books are expensive and I really want any copy I buy to be close to pristine.  I can buy shopworn books off the shelf at the bookstore.
B000NGTJTY|3.0|The theaters seemed to be filled with mediocre films either needing better acting, story line or cuts.  Whats happened to the film industry....or is it the watchers expectations?
B007MDB71O|5.0|I love the ERB series. The reboot of Princess of Mars in this film is decent for a Disney film. I recommend the film.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Best series I've seen since The Wire.<br />People will go to strange lengths to take care of their family.  The wire educated me on drugs and street life and Breaking Bad gave me a glimpse into the world of Meth - and by the way, what is a &#34;teenth&#34;?
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really liked this game when I started playing years ago, BUT, now that there are so many bingo and slots rooms to play, I find that the game either lags, freezes, or doesn't credit rewards and awards as it should. I have spent quite a bit of money on this game, and have submitted complaints about these issues, but not even once has my missing credits or rewards/awards been restored or replaced. I quit playing for a long time because of that, and now that I have started playing again, I find that the same glitches exist.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|This is a movie with one movie capability.  The the second was so bad I could not stand it.  To watch part 3 I would be an idiot.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I love the movie and I think it is better than the first one..This is a good value since the stores are charging more.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|I was all set to hate this game based on other user reviews and when i played it... i found it fun and entertaining. I dislike joystick games so having to tilt my kindle fire isn't a problem for me like for other users. You eat other fish and earn coins for upgrades, sounds simple until your dodging angler fish around a tank while trying to collect power ups and coins without being eaten. Fun game.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I love that when I couldn't find my hard copy of Emma and wanting to re-read it desperately I could always just turn to kindle book store!! And get it for free! Love it!
B002VE5472|3.0|Its entertainment.  Timothy did his usual decent job.  The movie was not a smoker but entertainment.  Will rent him again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very entertaining, keeps you coming back for more. Share and develop friends by trading gifts is wonderful feature. Most highly recommend this game, played others and they pale in comparison!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I lost many hours of sleep because I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. My children and husband had to deal with a mom who cooked, cleaned, did laundry, worked, and everything else (except driving, just read at stop lights) while lost in the excitement and suspense of this book.
0385743564|5.0|I consider this to have the greatest probability of any Brandon Sanderson book yet to get optioned for a movie. For example, the plot moves quickly, from a beginning that is as much a flashback as anything else, to a conclusion that makes sense and that you just didn't quite anticipate. At no point, however, does it take place at an uncomfortable speed. There is romance, action, daring schemes, danger, a man's dreams, and mystery.<br /><br />In addition, the characters have arcs that promote development, but all of it can still be crammed into a 2 hour 10 minute movie. Delightfully, there are actual discussions of the ramifications of wiping out megalomaniacal dictators and the resultant power vacuum that may ensue, both practical and philosophical. Pleasantly, the discussions are present, but do not bog down the otherwise healthy speed of the book. By the end of the book, many characters are not who they were at the beginning, and you can envision them as real people, with real issues and real lives.<br /><br />For those worried that this is a fantasy novel (Brandon Sanderson? He's the guy who writes about elves, right?), this is refreshingly urban. It's not quite science fiction (no space opera here, no aliens to speak of, no fantastical technology...mostly) and it's pretty far from mainstream fantasy (with the exception of the unexplained super powers exhibited by the Epics). This is some other brand of speculative fiction, and it deserves its own niche.<br /><br />That means that there are plenty of special effects that are readily doable. Even better, you get the cachet of a reputable fantasy author (capitalizing on the fantasy crowd) with a superhero twist (capturing the summer tentpole audience) and a well-crafted story (which helps parents and older children have some common ground). This is a movie waiting for a chance to be made, and if it is done right, it will be almost as good as the book. Because let's face it...unless the book is pretty bad, the movieis always worse. And this book is GOOD.<br /><br />I am consistently impressed with Brandon Sanderson for a variety of reasons. Most tellingly, he manages to put out a variety of books that are targeted to audiences of different age groups (Alcatraz for kids, The Rithmatist for middle-schoolers, this for YA, Mistborn for older teens, and The Stormlight Archive for adults) and the books always feel like they are on target for the age group that he's writing for. They don't feel like they're talking down to kids, they don't feel like they are oversimplified for adults. It's amazing. And I intend to keep reading every Brandon Sanderson book that I can get my hands on until one of us dies.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Ended early. Honestly just trying to get back to my homepage on Kindle and it's making me write a review
B004MPEFBE|5.0|I never get tired of this series.  It seems impossible to do the book (as involved as the Harry Potter series is) justice with the time constraints of a movie.  However the movie is fantastic.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I received the 10th season of NCIS promptly.  I now have all the seasons on DVD and can watch them any time I wish.  Love this show!
B0027MJU00|1.0|. Rambles forever. Ending is totally unbelievable. Don't waste your money or time.  I don't recommend this book to anyone.
B00F2362IE|2.0|I like the turtles, but not this game.  before you download it says you can play any of the turtles, NOT.  you have to pay extra in the in app purchases to play more than one character.  the turtle runs full  speed from left to right, you have to avoid obstacles, you can't slow down or go backwards to fight the bad guys only run through them or jump over them.
B005UG53NS|5.0|I hate waiting for series books and movies.  There is always that suspense.  I enjoy the Harry Potter series of books and movies.  Watching the young cast grow up is a lot of fun, and the fact that they are all together for all those years makes the movies that much better. I hated to see the series end and this movie did it justice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am trying to read this book again but Amazon is being a huge pain.  Apparently I have to submit this review.  What the hell is that?
B000JKA1MS|5.0|Schleich toys are among the best.  They are highly detailed, durable, a great size for both play and display, and encourage imaginative play.  We recently added this knight to our growing collection.  The boys and girls in my house BOTH enjoy playing with the knights whether they are playing at fairy tales or battles.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Looks great, works great too. Just what I have been looking for. I love the blue collar and the fact that the alarm works even in sleep mode on my kindle fire.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this series! Highly recommend reading all three from beginning to end...DOES NOT DISAPPOINT!!!  Hoping that Sylvia Day continues the great writing.
0486275590|4.0|Treasure island is a great book. I just love how they use pirate 'slang' like nigh & rum.<br />My favorite part is when Ben Gunn loses his share of the treasure in 19 days.<br />I do not like how the book is in the british form of spelling. My favorite character is Ben Gunn.<br />He is both hilarious and has a good heart at the same time. I wish there was a sequel.<br /> I would call it ' the Return to Treasure Island'.<br />In it Long John Silver would return and a new character is the Ghost of Captain Flint.<br />I think the age group is 10 to 12 years old.
B00C1040TO|2.0|my daughter bought this and is having her band directors help her figure out how to use this program.  Not Suitable for beginners/intermediate students.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It was very well written & an excellent insight as to how horrible the prison system is.  I hope this book helps others who will be faced with a similar situation.
B00BU18U82|4.0|I think that having farm simulator on my kindle is an awesome idea, but if you haven't seen it, it's much better on pc.
B00DI75SWM|4.0|This app works great, but you're limited in the logos you can use.  There are a lot of them, but I was hoping to use one of my own, but it's not available. If you don't have anything specific in mind, this app is perfect and I'd defeinitely recommend it.
0385347774|1.0|i really wanted to like Gone Girl, had heard so much about it.  By the 10th page I was annoyed by the constant interruption of needless flippant dialogue, description, chatter.  It was beginning to read like one of those silly cop movies where the two characters make quips while they're running through traffic.  By the 15th page the constant interruption to the plot moving forward was making me angry and by the 25th page I gave up in disgust.  The author decided that \\"cutesy\\" insights would substitute for the reader's intuition and that a leaner character development was undoable.  Where was a good editor?  Sadly, I put the book down and will never read it.  I hope the movie is better...should be, it's written like that was the end goal.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Totally addictive.  I changed from Candy  Crash Saga to this.  I got too tired of waiting between plays when I missed a level.
B001N4OX82|4.0|They say if a movie doesn't catch your attention in the first 5-10 minutes, it probably won't.  I'll just say that by minute 8, I was sold! Hint: A man's choices on the battlefield can say a lot about him.
1439190275|5.0|It works!!  Tried it and am still on it suggest this diet to everyone who tells me they wan to loose weight and can't.
B00133KHCY|5.0|From the first time I saw this movie, I knew it was destined to be on my all time favorite list!
0321928482|4.0|It would have been better for me with a larger chapter on the &#34;Develop Module&#34;. The description of the adjustment brush is now out of  date.
B001TH44VY|5.0|Regardless of the historically accuracies (or lack thereof), this is one of the most compelling movies of our time.  The music, the characters, the scenery, the costumes.  A must see!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|We were told to read these books by my sister and brother-in law as they know our reading preferences.  We started with book one, of course, and are speeding through them voraciously.  It is good to have a series to read, even though they could be read out of sequence.  They are woven together in the character, Jack Reacher.  Phenomenal, engrossing, good read!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|If there was ever a movie about the life of Christ that should move any and every true believer, this has to be it!
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I can remember my high school English teacher's favourite word was \\"transcendent\\", which is exactly how I would sum up this book (as pretentious as that word is).<br />Looking past the fact that Childhood's End is now 50 years old and much of the technology and world perspectives are dated (though the predictions of the future are sometimes eerily accurate!), the themes are as timeless, but in a broad, worldly (literally universal) sense, rather than the nitty gritty of traditional character plots/motivations in most other novels.<br />The characters here are fairly dull, being products of their new environment, but that is partly the point. It works, and they remain relatable on a \\"rooting for the home team\\" level.<br />I'm sure like all great novels many people will have different opinions, to be endlessly discussed!<br />I found it a tiny bit slow in the middle section, but it is a fairly short novel so the plot flowed quick enough for me to pick it up again without any trouble after putting it aside for a couple of days.<br />Otherwise, this is a beautifully written classic which everyone should read (just don't try to adapt it for the screen unless you're Stanley Kubrick!)<br />-Peter Laurent, Author of [[ASIN:B00B95YRQ8 The Covert Academy]]
B0035JNTA6|5.0|Laughed from beginning to end.  I don't know how many times I've seen this. Ben Stiller and Will Farrell together.  Genius!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My what a book! A very easy, steamy read. Very well written, the details had me thinking that Christian Grey actually exists.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|i have watched most all of the stargate and loved them all thanks so much. what more should i say.
B003BVFZ4Q|5.0|Required reading for aspiring and veteran authors alike. King fuses part autobiography and part creative writing lesson into one dense yet easy to digest book.<br />Some of the advice, specifically about authors looking to break into the industry, is a little out of date with the current advantages of indie publishing online. But the tips and insights into the nitty-gritty of writing are invaluable and entertaining. They will never become obsolete.<br />I wish I'd read this long ago!<br />-Peter Laurent, Author of [[ASIN:B00B95YRQ8 The Covert Academy]]
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|Ok, in my opinion, add a teen, this book is awful! If you are a college professor or a person over 57 you will maybe enjoy this book! DO NOT READ
1589944607|5.0|Rules heavy, but a great thematic game. Every action you take can help or ruin the humans, and as a cylon you must mask your actual intentions. As a human you must gain the trust of your crew, and sort out who is who. This game has come down to the wire some many times, and losing feels deadly, but sweet sweet victory is priceless.
B003MS7V8G|4.0|it was not great but it was a good movie and did enjoy it would watch it again. good bye
B000SEIK2S|4.0|A refreshing twist on the Starship Troopers/Ender's Game formula, where the elderly are offered a new life as space marines when they hit 75.<br />The main character is endearing though few others, if any, are as well. The pace moves along briskly, perhaps too much, but the story kept me engaged at least.<br />The prose felt a little bit clinical sometimes (such as the opening lines of several chapters).<br />A few coincidences for the sake of the plot can be easily overlooked when you're powering through the book.<br />Overall, recommended to anyone looking for a plenty of well-written action scenes and cool sci-fi concepts.<br />-Peter Laurent, Author of [[ASIN:B00B95YRQ8 The Covert Academy]]
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Author used proper English and good rules of the written language which has declined over the last twenty or so years.  I personally dislike the subject is using as the plot for the story.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Got this for my i7 processor because the intel fan was not cutting it.  Idle temps were well over 50 Degrees Celcius and topped out at over 90 Degrees Celsius when playing games like Battlefield 3 and Bioshock Infinite.  Now my idle speeds are 30-40 Degrees, and NEVER GOES OVER 60!  Easy to install and can be mounted a number of ways.  Great Cooler!
B000IZ7YMY|5.0|i saw this movie years ago, and purchased it in VHS format,now ordering it in dvd format.  the movie is excellent, not corny or swarmy, but well written and acted, and very moving.  very few movies will show friendship among men without it being taken as &#34;gay&#34; friendships...this is about pure friendship, sacrifice and the meaning of a friendship that will last a life time.  Can't say enough about ALL characters involved, excellent!
B004DM1ZQY|2.0|This game has nice graphics, five (supposed) levels of play, and convenient player cues when  making moves.<br /><br />What it does NOT have is an AI which knows anything about basic backgammon strategy. That makes the five levels of difficulty not really be five levels of difficulty, because the game plays the same flawed strategies at each of the five levels.<br /><br />In fact, I've played several computer backgammon games over the last 25 or so years, and this is unquestionably the worst AI I've yet seen.<br /><br />In particular, it doesn't have a clue how to best run to the inner table or how to roll off. Two games in a row when I was hopelessly out-pipped (as the AI had already rolled more doubles than odds make credible) the AI simply chose the least efficient method of filling the inner table and then rolling off. At times it will move up men on the inner table when rolling off instead of taking two men off of lower points.<br /><br />It will \\"arrange\\" the inner table when there are still men to bring there. In one game at the \\"highest\\" difficulty, the AI had all but two men in the inner table, and needed 12 pips to bring those to the inner table. I had three men outside the inner table and needed more than 20 pips. On two turns in a row it \\"arranged the inner table\\" instead of advancing the last two men. In the meantime I brought all three of my men to the inner table, and actually rolled off my first pair before it brought in its last two.<br /><br />In another game both the AI and I had all our men in the inner table, and his array was much more balanced, as I was piled up on 5 and 6. On a few turns the AI moved men up from its 5 and 6 instead of taking men off of 2 and 3. When it later rolled 5s and 6s they were wasted. I won that game without doubles, and I should have needed both double 5s and double 6s to win.<br /><br />This game, as do most computer backgammon games I've played, seems to roll doubles for itself at an unlikely high rate. Also, be prepared that most useful game opening rolls are going to be \\"won\\" by the AI. LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs.

LOL But the AI is so clueless that it doesn't really do it any good. Note that the game will also at times accept hopeless doubles, but that is not uncommon for backgammon AIs.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A friend recommended this show and I am very glad she did. I was hooked from the start. The inner relationships of the characters are so good it keeps you coming back for more. Cant wait for the new season.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|Definitely not my favorite movie it's not so bad that you want to turn it off but you definitely never probably want to see it again it's too bad because the music itself was good but they could've done a lot better with the story
B005SCSL56|4.0|Read it aloud to my 8 year old daughter. We both loved it! It became part of our bedtime routine.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game as a leisurely activity when I can get in a couple minutes of free time. The graphics are great and the game usually moves fluently. I wish however there were ways to earn more gems without paying for them. The &quot;free gems&quot; option never works for me.
B00CFYAT6O|5.0|Had been waiting for the new cd for some time and it didn't disappoint.  Susan has such a great voice paired with Derek's guitar.  The whole band is extremely talented and make music that touches the soul.  It's been on a loop playing since I bought it.  Pairs well with Revelator!
B004FRX0MY|1.0|First I had the Amazon downloader for mp3 and that worked fine. Then Amazon came out with the cloud player and I downloaded the app. The music downloaded into itunes fine but it would download each song into windows media player twice. Each time I bought an album I would have to go to the windows media player and delete songs because they would be two of every song. Then last week the app suddenly stopped connection to the internet. That is just after I purchase two albums. So now my music is in the cloud and not on my computer. So in effect I own two albums that I cannot listen to. This is over a week now and Amazon still has not solved the problem. So the Amazon cloud player gets a big fat F.

B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is my favorite of the Outlander series! Jamie and Claire's reunion and adventures can be read over and over and still does not get old!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|love this series sooo much...  can't wait for the 3rd season ,  just sad that they won't release it until next year...and of course i am ordering from amazon!!!
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This is not your typical zombie movie. It keeps the hair on your neck standing for the entire movie! Well done!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a very well made game. You can see they put a lot of work in to this game, and the best part is that its free!!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was never a book reader. The reason I tried this is because I like movies and Ender's Game movie is coming out soon. I heard how Hunger Games was so good but when I watch the movie, I think it was just so-so, not that great. I think part of it was that the movie are not as well made compare to the book. So, I wanted to give the book a try. After reading this, I am positive that Ender's Game movie will not be as good as the book. I like the book so much and it got me to like reading. I hope that other book is as good as this.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great development of Kirk into a captain that respects the chair! And Spock rocks, but talking to future Spock is kinda cheating. Very human of you Spock.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really like this game. It is very cute and its very easy so it's a great recipe for fun... I like it so much more than my 5 year old
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Hi,<br />This game is a lot of fun, certainly a simple concept but easy to play.<br />But this game crashes my tablet and causes it to reboot.<br />i have a PendoPad 9.7&#34; PNDPP4MT9G3<br />so i will have to delete this game.

B000O8OTNC|1.0|I bought one and its a price of crap! Does not sharpen ANY of my kinves. From my cheap ones to my $250 Benchmade. Matter of fact I had to reace my blade.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I have about a billion (give or take) 35mm slides from over the last 40 years.  I've just begun scanning.<br /><br />The package was much lighter weight than I was expecting, so it had me worried that it might fall apart.  But it seems to be working just fine!  Simple insertion of one slide at a time into the slot. It shows up on the screen (which is smaller than I imagined), and you can flip the image or get a mirror image if you put it in the wrong way.  However, you cannot rotate the image if it's sideways and you cannot put the slide in the slot sideways.  You have to rotate those with your software once they're on the computer.<br /><br />I'm using a MacBook Pro, and iPhoto opens right up when the scanner is connected and it begins the import options, just like with any camera or phone.
B00280LYIM|4.0|I am a lover of Greek mythology and this book is a brand new twist on it that really is a roller coaster ride
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun you should try it! Very good time waster for all ages and it is so cute. the graphics really good too.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I think this app is great for texting! It has group chat unlimited amount of texting keys and its great for everyone! Its free and you oont have to memorize a number or password. Just create an awesome user name and get started!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When I ordered Chromcast is worked with thrid party applications. Between the time I ordered and I recieved my order Google blocked thrid party apps. Seems Google has adopted the proprietary Apple model. There is no Kindel app for Chrome cast. I cannot view photos on my laptop with Windows 7 OS. I cannot view Amazon Prime content with the Chromecast. Most content cannot be viewed on the Chromecast outside the United States, so forget using Chromcast when traveling international. What I thought I ordered was a very useful and flexable gadget for view content from my laptop and Kindel Fire.  After Google blocked the thrid party apps, what I ended up with is an expensive, very limited use gadget.

B0053TWVDC|5.0|Its a great movie. I think it probably the best of its time. But the others are not what I would consider ever watching.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this app. A little annoying to see an add each time you open it up but you can skip right to the game and considering it's free, it's kind of expected to see some ads.
006178480X|5.0|As always, I really enjoyed this page turner!  If you're not familiar with the SIgma Force series, I suggest you start at the beginning and follow its members to the present.  Not that this book can't stand alone, I just feel that knowing a lot of background information lets the reader enjoy this book at a deeper level.  I can't wait for the next in the series!
B00C061I3K|5.0|In brief;<br />1) High quality recording...sounds great on a good system.<br />2) Fantastic songs<br /><br />This is not my normal choice in music.  Was refered to this album.  Listened to the samples and thought, strange but interesting.  Waited a few days and listened again and thought I'd better give this a try.  Glad I did as this album is really good.

B001OL4TR4|4.0|I read the book first many years ago before going to the movie.  I must tell you this is one of the few movies<br />that was right on with the story line.  The sceans are great and so is the story line.  It is about two lovers who<br />were curesed, one lived int he form of a Hawke during the day, the other lived as a wolf during the night.  Each guarding<br />each other.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this game. The graphics are really good and its fun to collect the tokens and jump on the trains before you get caught.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Only Lee can spin a story that way, I could not put the book down, again another Thriller.  Looking forward to another Book

B0042X9L6A|4.0|Main reason for purchase is for lighter weight and less bulk while shooting forensics with a wide lens. I do have to over power compared to the SB-900 and 910's on some shots due to lower guide number. I find it is similar enough to other Nikon models that I don't get lost shuffling flash units or when using SU system. I would recommend this for all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a very good book and cleverly written. It keeps you engaged with the characters until the very end.
B005FDW7AI|5.0|I have long felt that actors seldom ruin a movie, it is usual the script, editing or directing that makes or breaks the movie, and it is always the actors who get the blame.<br />o<br />When you watch the Harry Potter movies, you can tell kid-like acting for what it is, and the lack of concern of the movie's makers in making the movie more of what it could be.<br /><br />In this version of \\"A Little Princess\\" you see what quality workmanship in movies can do... here you have a child actress who does not come off as some rank ameture like the Harry Potter child actors did. True there were qirky moments (like in the enactment of the story that Sara tells) but they fit the movie, providing complementations rather than breaking the story. The script was simplistic and even a little sappy but the acting was supperb even then on all performer's parts. Thus the performances were fantasitc, and the editing was on the mark.<br /><br />All in all, what I thought would be a \\"girl-child\\" movie turned out to be a movie that ALL audiences could get into, and stay with from the beginning to the end. That is what makes this a movie worth watching, because getting such a well done movie to watch is so rare out of Hollywood these days.
B002ZKGYHQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much and would add it to my privet movie list.  It is a great movie
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It works well, I don't  have a problem with .And I really love the  points idea. I'm hoping it's legit.
B00BGI08GG|5.0|I was one that did not have high expectations for the series, but am very impressed at how it has turned out so far.  The character (and overall storyline) is very dark.  Much darker even than version of the Green Arrow played by Justin Heartly on Smallville.  This version of the character made that one look like a boy scout.  To say he is morally ambiguous is an understatement.<br /><br />The series starts with Oliver Queen being rescued from an island he had been marooned on for 5 years.  The show actually tells two stories.  In flashbacks we learn what happened after the shipwreck and the events that unfold on the island.  In the present we see his transformation into \\"The Hood\\" a vigilante on a mission to take down the criminal elite in Starling City.  He is also re-integrating into \\"normal\\" life, reconnecting with his friends and family, while having to lead a double life to protect those he cares about.  Throughout the first season they introduce many of the DC comic characters along the way<br /><br />The key to the series is the wonderful acting.  There are really no \\"A list\\" actors in the group, but many of them are recognizable from other shows.  Stephen Amell does a great job playing the brooding role, and yet having to incorporate some of Oliver's past playboy attitude.  All of the supporting actors, both series regulars and recurring, bring a lot to the show, and the writers do a good job of giving good stories to all the characters, so it is not just about Arrow out chasing down bad guys.  Some of the stories in the first season get resolved, others are left open.  So there is a lot to work with going into season 2.<br /><br />As far as this set goes, it comes both on Blu Ray and for some reason DVD.  There are 4 blu ray discs and 5 DVDs.  The show looks and sounds great on blu ray as you would expect.  My only complaint about the blu rays is there there is no season mode.  So even if you use the play all option, if you stop in the middle of an episodeit does not pick back up where you stopped it.  As far as extras go, there are commentary tracks on select episodes, deleted scenes for many of the episodes, a 30 min \\"making of\\" feature, an 18 min feature on the stunts, a panel discussion and gag reel.  Definitely enough to keep those who like the bonus material happy.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was rather entertaining and I wasn't expecting the ending but over all I well enjoyed this movieand a great cast to boot.
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|The only original character from the first movie is Channing Tatum and he is in it for a short time, really disappointed in this movie.  No real development of characters and their connections.
B008JFUO4U|1.0|This movie was so boring my husband fell asleep my daughter left them room and about half way through I said why am I torturing myself waiting for something to happen.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  On a scale with the old 50's space creature movies this is modern, up-to-date and full of fun and adventure.  Buckle up it a fun ride.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Entertaining and great graphics! My daughter and I have had fun playing this game.It is almost like having a real horse. :)
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I loved the movie and with the added special features it is well worth the value. My boy loves the Titanic story and everything about the ship.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This book held my interest which doesn't happen very often. It kept me wanting to read more and more. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys being submerged into a fantasy story.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Simple lives from an earlier period of English life. The characters and stories are simple by nature and reflected how people lived and behaved in those days. Relaxing and enjoyable.
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Great old school rpg. The only complaint is that it has a tendency to crash on you, but that's the only negative I have for this game. I'm looking forward to a sequel.
B006Z21ZEW|5.0|I have become a 'new' Maiden fan recently.  I used to dislike the prog rock songs Maiden would make way back when.  I always liked the straight ahead rockers more.  Recently, that has begun to change.  I like the stuff from Brave New World and onward.  I don't know what changed for me, but I enjoy it.<br />In regards to this DVD, if you like the newer Maiden this is a good show.  I don't find the split screen as annoying as other reviewers.  I think it makes the DVD more enjoyable to watch more than once.  Each time I see something I didn't see before due to the split screens.  I think the sound quality and mixing is excellent.<br />The second disc is enjoyable.  Behind the Beast is fun to watch if you liked the Flight 666 thing.  I enjoyed the making of the video piece as well.  All in all, buy if you like newer Maiden.  If not, maybe this would be a good introduction.
B001BANK32|5.0|I was twelve the last time I read &#34;The Shining.&#34;  The larger themes were somewhat evident to me then, whispers really, but reading it as an adult is a revelation.  There are so many ways this book is a reflection of its time while also being timeless, but for baby boomers and their children specifically, this story stands as an incredible metaphor for two generations of emotionally abandoned children.  Mr. King captures the minutiae of 20th century childhood better than anyone I've ever read, and this is true across his body of work.  I will echo what many have said here--read the book.  The movie is brilliant but flawed and largely without nuance, and it does not compare to the book itself.
B00F8H0LM2|1.0|Highly intrusive app...just because it's \\"angry birds\\" doesn't make it safe. Read the privacy policy and permissions. Make sure you know what the permissions are before you install.
B00ECU1A6C|5.0|Seven day rental and that's what I've been watching for seven days. Daughter loves the music and it has a nice story.
B0000AFX64|3.0|I remember watching this when it first aired on TV.  I bought this DVD to see if it was still as I remembered.  Yep, it is.<br />Some parts are cool, some parts not so much.  Space Disco?!?  I've always had mixed feelings about the original series.<br />Still, this is a review of this particular DVD.  The packaging is OK.  You get just the movie and for a good price.  If you like the old series and don't want to pop for the big box set, this is a viable alternative.  If you are a big BSG fan you might want to pony up the cash for the box set and pass this one up, as the pilot movie (this film) is in that.  Maybe this DVD is best for casual fans like myself.
0375851569|5.0|Typical Dr Seuss books we have grown up with.  Promotes beginner reading with repetition in an entertainig whimsical way for children.
0345803485|5.0|Ordered this book and was super happy that it was in such great condition. Was expecting something a little more used but it looked near perfect.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is the fist book l ever read by L. Moriarty. Enjoyed every page and did not want it to end. Could not put it down. I look forward to reading some of her other books. You will not be disappointed with his book.
B001W63DX2|5.0|Great, great, great.  I think that about sums it up.  This is essentially a World Slavery Tour concert done with today's band and crew.  Plus, you get to see them fly from show to show and tag along on their days off.  And the second disc is just the concert and no documentary.  You can see the show either way.  You can't go wrong buying this, unless you just don't like classic Iron Maiden.  In this case, WTF is wrong with you?
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like the the look of the app easy to read and understand don't have multiple screens to look at background is nice to look at I recommend getting it
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Instead of fumbling around for the snooze button, i have all of the proper information to wake up to plus this app is easy to use and well worth it!
B00008DDXL|5.0|As with all the Harry Potter films,and books, this one is enjoyable for fans of all ages. I adore Dobby, he's a loveable rogue with an odd idea of how to 'protect' Harry - a boy who has become his hero.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Just have to be in the mood for it, I guess.  Haven't listened to it for a while, have been listening to newer Pop music lately.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|Works great. Down side is the kindle fire itself. That won't hold a charge no matter what we do to it
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD and the friends I've recommended it to have loved it as well. She keeps changing things up, so it doesn't get super boring (in fact, the workout goes by pretty quickly). There are 3 different workouts included and they vary by experience level, so it's much less intimidating. Even though the workouts are only 20 minutes (plan for 30 minutes though with warm up and cool down) you actually feel like you've really done something.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Lots of photos with clear explanation of how to do exercises. Also, precisely how and when to advance to the next level. Easy to do anywhere!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|If you are not familiar with the story (be it either by the play or the book), it can be difficult to follow as the movie jumps right into the story. Character names are not offered up like in other movies. However, the movie invokes a lot of emotions, even if you are not familiar with the situation. This is one of my favorite movies and I would recommend this to everyone.
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|First this movie is outstanding, I actually think it better than the originally three lord of the rings. But what I have a problem with is the adversities of this when they knowingly want to milk you the consumer for money, the upgraded version is coming out for christmas AND here is the kicker if you have any Apple product and want to watch this on it DO NO BUY, this DOES NOT INCLUDE A DIGITAL COPY, unless you willing to have another set of digital locker.  When you buy Ultraviolet your rights are taken away from you. Why would WB do this to such a magnificent movie? This is just as bad as the music industry trying to collar people.<br /><br />For the movie, I was blow away at how much more slick and professional this movie was. For a three our movie time just seem to fly for me. I was pretty shocked.
B000FBFN0Q|2.0|superficial and painful to see her make such dumb financial mistakes. the story line wasn't deep enough and i didn't feel like i learned anything from the book
B00AHG9KYE|2.0|As a reader of science fiction since the early 1950s, some of my first contacts with the genre were the early works of Clarke. I have to acknowledge that he was a major factor in my birth and growth as a SF aficionado, and I thank him for that. It took me many years to realize this iconic writer was not very good at plotting novel-length stories. With only a few exceptions -- City and the Stars, for one -- Clarke's novels tend to be highly episodic, with very thin, if any, sophisticated plot elements connecting the episodes. This failing (if such it be!) dominates 3001: The Final Odyssey. Nothing resembling a plot emerges until halfway through the book, the first half being a series of vignettes of frozen astronaut Frank Poole's introduction to the 30th century. It could have been so much better if a possible connection between Poole and vanished astronaut Dave Bowman had been introduced early on and developed along with Poole's assimilation into the world, or I guess \\"worlds\\" is a better word, of 3001. This is a \\"must read\\" for Clarke fans and anyone who is familiar with the 2001 franchise, but, unfortunately, I think most will find it a disappointing conclusion.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I love this book and can honestly say it is one of my favorites. It provokes a lot of emotions and thought within the reader. It can be a bit of a difficult read at certain spots, but it is a fantastic read.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|What really got me to purchase this mouse was first, the high rating in reviews, but mainly because there are essentially 5 buttons to customize not including the left+right+mousewheel button as well as the DPI changer, which really helps when you have a game where you need to micro spell/item hotkeys and whatnot. It may seem that the plastic buttons are flimsy and won't keep up, however I've been using and transporting this mouse for at least 3 months and no wear/tear has shown up, everything works perfectly. The mouse itself when you hold it is very comfortable and my favorite type of design ergonomically when playing a video game.<br /><br />The color scheme (blue) for the mouse is cool, but the \\"color changer\\" is misleading because you only are able to change the logo color on the mouse (which your hand covers when using the mouse anyway). Also my computer is close to my bed so I usually have to unplug the mouse because it's simply too bright even on \\"Low\\" brightness setting. All in all, this mouse is a lot better (and cheaper) than a Razer mouse, I'd get this instead any day. Include weight cartridges on top of that, and this is truly the go-to \\"Budget Gamer's Mouse\\" in terms of customization, feel, and reliability.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the story & it was beautifully written story that I hated to see come to an end. Bought 2 more of Kate Morton's books.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love Thrift Shop, but ended up loving this entire album.  What I love most is that his songs tell stories; you also can't help but love the beat.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I bought this movie after reading the book, and because I had not made it to the theater to see it. As one of my favorite books, I had high expectations. The movie delivered.
B00F8H0LM2|3.0|Maybe its me, but im having a hard time figuring out what each of the birds actually does. Theres no legend or place where it tells you so its trial by fire. Other than that its ok. I think i like seasons better
B00D7NWTSI|4.0|\\"Old days, never thought they'd come back to bit me. Why would they?\\" After the events of The Avengers, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) has changed. He has become more obsessed with his work and by throwing everything he has into it he thinks he won't have to deal with those events. After a terrorist attack effects one of his closest friends he goes one step further and tells the man behind the attacks to \\"bring it on.\\" That off the cuff remark changes everything and effects everyone around him. I have never been a huge comic book movie fan. My main reason is because they are mainly nothing but how many explosions can we have. The Iron Man movies started a change where the acting and story become front and center. While the other Iron Man's were fun and comical this one was more dark and interesting. It is hard to make a movie like this realistic. The fact that they made this movie about terrorism really helped root the movie in reality even with all the comic book elements going on. There are a lot of little things in this I did have problems with but for the most part I was very entertained and that is what is important in a movie. Also just as a heads up you do need to watch both Iron Man and The Avengers movie in order to get everything that is going on. Overall, little things that bothered me didn't take away from the enjoyment. I give it a B+.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|It isn't critically acclaimed and the plot is a little odd, but I was entertained (although it did have some plot issues).
0060555661|4.0|This is an excellent book but it is large and wordy.  I am inclined to like books that come to the point quickly and are less wordy.<br />That said, this book is one that should be in every investment library.
B00A285OOW|3.0|It wasn't nearly as good as the rest of the Cousins' War books.  I've never heard anywhere that Henry was quite that nuts.  I have to agree with the review that stated it was unnecessary to repeat on each page that he was a whiny mama's boy and didn't trust his wife.  We got it pretty early on.  The book just seems out of character with the other things I've read AND it just seemed to kind of stop in the middle of the story.  Maybe there'll be another book that finishes her story?  Not sure I'd read it if there was though.
B00ET2ODU8|4.0|\\"I spent exactly 17 days in the pornography industry and somehow these 17 days are supposed to define who I am for the rest of my life, but I hope that people can see me for who I really am.\\" Linda Boreman (Seyfried) is a normal teenager in the sixties. She is a little naive and sheltered but nothing too extreme. When she meets a man named Chuck Traynor (Saragaard) he promises to take care of her and give her what she wants. Happy to be out of her parents house she gets married and things are looking up. When Chuck gets her a job she thinks its going to be fantastic. Little by little her life is taken away from her, then one day she fights back. This is first and foremost NOT a movie about pornography. This is a movie about a woman who becomes manipulated and controlled by a man she trusted and her fight to get someone to help her. While Seyfried does a good job in this it's nothing Oscar worthy but she does play it in a way that makes the movie very depressing and you really feel for her and want her to make it out. I could keep going on about this and many people won't watch just because they think it's something it isn't, but this is worth watching and a real women's lib type movie. Overall, if you liked Boogie Nights you will like this. I give it a B.

B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Jake Bugg's moptop haircut and sultry pout give him a McCartney-esque look, which accurately reflects his retro ethos. Listening to him, you can simply absorb his deliberately lo-fi sound as it is, or you can identify the influences that color his music: Bob Dylan comes across in tracks like \\"Trouble Town,\\" which could have come off \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" while \\"Country Song\\" sounds like Nick Drake's great lost track. For us classix-loving hippies, it's a treasure trove.<br /><br />Bugg's ballads of working-class aspiration update the old Hank Williams tradition, putting bouncy singalong beats behind crushingly bleak lyrics. Though clearly rock-based, Bugg's music cherry-picks whatever influences hold his attention. Songs like \\"Trouble Town\\" suggest a distinct fondness for British \\"electric folk\\" acts like Steeleye Span, without merely mimicking his influences. The tube-amp buzz underlying most of his songs (there's probably software for that today) gives him an intimate coffee house feel.<br /><br />The range of Bugg's dynamism belies his youth (I've owned cars older than this kid). \\"Someone Told Me,\\" a solo acoustic heartbreaker, transitions smoothly into the lush \\"Note to Self,\\" which almost wants to cheer up the prior song. Not that any songs are triumphs of arrangement; only one song involves more than three instrumentalists, and most involve only one or two. Bugg mixes instrumental austerity with muscular playing, making small ensembles sound huge.<br /><br />This album launches with its advance single, the ballsy Merseyside-ish rocker \\"Lightning Bolt,\\" and if you've enjoyed it on the radio or the dozens of commercials and TV shows it's appeared in, it's an accurate sample of what this album sounds like. But be aware that not everything makes you want to dance. The closing track, \\"Fire,\\" with its scratchy-old-record sound and Charley Patton simplicity, leaves listeners feeling like they've finished a long, important journey.<br /><br />Despite his youth, JakeBugg definitely positions himself within a much older tradition, trying to make himself sound grizzled and world-weary (as you do when you're young). Yet his retro sound wouldn't have the same impact, and the same contemporary urgency, if he weren't still a kid. And as he stands to perfect his craft with age, he's positioned himself perfectly to evolve with grace and style. Well done, Jake Bugg. This could be the start of a beautiful musicianship.
0756405890|5.0|I had no real expectations going in to this book.  Didn't know who Rothfuss was, just heard good things about this particular book.  It is long for sure, and sometimes the story kind of strays on seemingly unnecessary tangents (and for a good while in some cases).  But here's the thing, Rothfuss is clearly a very skilled writer to the extent that I didn't mind these big tangents at all.  The main character, Kvothe, is strong and interesting.  You care about what happens to him and the story kept me anticipating what was to come throughout which is saying a lot considering how big it is.  I would definitely recommend this book if you enjoy fantasy/adventure type stories, it is simply brilliant.  Not a thriller by any means but an epic story which I personally prefer over the former.
140006922X|4.0|Reading it is like a trip back in history as spectator, with a very skillful guide.<br />I've not read a book quite like it.<br />There's not much time for reading in my life so every page brings a sense of the depth of Azlans knowledge.<br />Information of this type on Jesus, especially the &#34; Zealot&#34; aspect of his life is new to me.<br />History buffs and people for whom Jesus holds a fascination will enjoy this book
B00BI745AA|2.0|I know that this is a critically acclaimed movie, but it just was't for me.  The singing was ok and the story line -- I'm sorry to say -- is very distressing and unpleasant to watch (yes, I know that is the plot!).  This just wasn't me.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I bought this bag to hold my wife's Canon EOS M.  It is small, seems durable and holds everything that she needs.  For the price this can't be beat.
0765348276|5.0|This is one of those books that is just so easy to read.  It is pretty short and is definitely a page turner.  You'll burn through it pretty quickly.  That being said, it is awesome.  Scalzi has a knack for creating a very believable and interesting futuristic setting.  The characters are not terribly deep but captivating enough in their own right.  The story, most importantly, is just cool.  I don't really know how else to explain it but it's just a neat concept that I did not see coming.  It's action packed and emotionally driven (at times) which, on top of being such an easy and enjoyable read, makes for an exceptional book.  Read it. You won't regret it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love love. I love how emotional I got. It brought out a different side of me.  I Love when  a book makes you cry with real tears
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Very different from the book.  It is an \\"okay\\" movie, but not a stand out.  Brad Pitt is good, but I feel Mirielle Enos should have been given more to do.  She is so talented that I think they wasted a great opportunity.
B005CYLSW8|5.0|I thought, who needs another Beethoven cycle. Well, guess what I did. I think that this is an incredible contribution to the interpretation of Beethoven's work. I do not agree with the reviewer who said that the production is too fast. Chailly creates a refreshing sense of excitement in these works. I think that the dynamic range of the orchestra is well demonstrated and not only that, the range appears greater than that in other notable recordings of the cycle. Put together with the fact that the recording itself is of first class quality ( a good stereo system will really show of this orchestra) I recommend that you take the plunge and buy this. To audiophiles, I would say, rather than downloading 256kbps digital versions, buy the CDs and rip them in lossless format to your server. What little that you can squeeze out in terms of dynamics will be well worth it.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|can't wait to start watching season 5! keep it coming! i am finally caught up and can start watching in real time.
B00F2362IE|1.0|This game needs to be fixed immediately, as it is unplayable in its current state.<br />I have no clue how it managed to receive approval, and someone needs to be fired over this.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I had read the reviews ahead of time so I knew this was not going to be anything like the Potter series but I love JK Rowling so much that I was willing to give this one a try anyway, and I'm glad I did. It was a little slow on action but the characters are well developed and definitely intriguing. I found myself not wanting to put it down. Not nearly as exciting as Harry's adventures but still worth reading.
0064400557|5.0|My 6-year old daughter read this book several times and it remains one of her favorites! This book is classic, the story is kind, funny, and gentle. Very recommend for 1-4 graders!!!

1781162646|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am a huge Stephen King fan.  That being said, I don't like every book he's ever written just because he's written it.  I didn't read Joyland right away...well because my expectations from the cover and from it being a \\"Hard Case Crime\\" book is that it would be a thriller, hard boiled, full of suspense.  That is what I expected.  What I got is what Stephen King is best at, great characterizations and a wonderful sense of place and time.  There is a ghost, a psychic kid and an old murder with the murderer on the loose, but this is all secondary to the coming of age story of Devin Jones. I'm not going to write more on the plot, you can discover that for yourself.  This isn't a can't put it down nail biter.  Its a short, sweet read, with some good old Stephen King writing.  It's not scary but its good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never read a book so deserving of a single star. I'd say the only redeeming feature it has is to serve as a bad example. It's a warning to all writers--Kids, don't write like this. Or \\"Friends don't let friends write books like Fifty Shades of Grey.\\"<br /><br />This book could have used a good editor. The same words and phrases are used over and over and over (and over and over) again. It's maddening. Like using \\"murmur (and mutter, breathe & mumble) instead of \\"said.\\" Ana says \\"Holy crap!\\" and \\"Holy `word beginning with s that means the same thing as crap'\\" on just about every page.<br /><br />The plot: Ana, who's sweet 21 and never been kissed, finds herself the object of drop-dead gorgeous billionaire Christian Gray's affections. Trouble is, the only way she can get close to him is to willingly take part in his bondage and sado-masochistic games. \\"He wants to tie me up and beat me! That's so scary. But it's so hot! Holy crap!\\"<br /><br />Probably the biggest disappointment here is that Ana and Christian talk way more about the BDSM lifestyle than they actually do it. Forget what you heard. It's mostly Ana going on and on about how hot she thinks Christian is and how much she wants him, but his terms are unacceptable, even though she accepts them (more or less).<br /><br />Honestly, I can't see what makes Ana so special that a drop dead gorgeous billionaire would find her so fascinating. She's like your best friend's annoying little sister. You want to tell her to go to her room and read her Twilight books.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Gray is a very, very bad book, and it deserves to be punished. Refuse to read it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a fun game but with a few glitches. Sometimes it won't open unless you just keep trying. It does seem to work better on my iPad rather than my android phone. However it takes long for the tiles to shuffle in on the iPad. They appear all at once on the android which I prefer.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is not a bad app at all.  Challenging and fun; entertaining; personally, I can do it only for a short time period, so I use it as a fill-in for a few minutes here and there.
B006H3MJ7G|5.0|Several cuts on this are tried and true bachatas for dancing.  Stand by me is one of the best, but all of them are beautifully done.
B0070Z97LG|1.0|This has to have been one of the worst thrillers I have seen in years.  I guessed whodunnit in the first ten minutes.  What a waste of really good talent.  There were so many plot holes to this film.  The hired killer gets the wrong house???  The ending was absolutely atrocious.  The bad guy shoots his partner in crime but not the others???  Do not waste your time or money.
0547258305|1.0|Wow is this book bad. I am just writing this review to add solidarity to the one star reviews on amazon, which I read for support, because I was in such disbelief that this book was so highly rated. UGH. Terrible book!!
B0013UIUBC|4.0|Didn't see the original, but this version is simply a well-acted, feel good film. The little girl played the part beautifully and the two leads found great romantic chemistry.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|easy to play and unlike oregon trail you don't have to wait to complete all task.  don't get me wrong Oregon trail is very addictive
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Love it I did find myself a bit bored with too many trips up and down the stairs. Besides that it was a good read
1250029465|5.0|I loved this book and have shared it with many friends. A truly heartwarming story. Will make you laugh and cry
B001TH16DI|5.0|I miss when movies had to depend on good actors and not special effects or cgi to make a good film.
B003JTHXN6|5.0|This book was quite unique in how it presented its motivating factor.<br />Highly recommend for someone looking for some inspiration or guidance in work or even in life.<br />Easy read as well.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I just downloaded this app for my 4 year old, it's so easy to use! He is just going to love having his own ALARM clock.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everyone should see this program, so get it on Amazon if you can. When you order it you get it within a couple days.<br /><br />Why such a big box for a little DVD? You could save some money and just use a padded envelope. Just a thought!
1452110581|5.0|This book is funny and very entertaining.  Not really worth the money though;  you can read the whole thing in one day.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It's like Jason Bourne in Stepford.  A cool story that just keeps giving.  There are hints all the way through that something''s not right.  Then it's confirmed.
140006922X|5.0|well written and interesting history to read.  good, ok, great, swell, nice, fine, english, history, time well spent, good book.
B004F88I6G|3.0|Full of continuity errors and deviations from the original story line. as a finish to the TV series, not bad, but not good either.
067144901X|5.0|This is my neice's favorite Sandra Boynton book.  She loves making the animal sounds and turning the thick cardboard pages herself.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse has the most options for the money you can find anywhere.  I love having the ability to customize all the buttons, led color, and the actual weight of the mouse with the included weight set.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Even though this was a used set, each movie played flawlessly and the packaging is in excellent condition. It was neat watching the progression with the movies.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I bought the app before heading to Europe. I wanted something soothing and relaxing to listen to on the international flight. I've not been disappointed. I use this app practically every night for meditation. I have an elderly dog who has trouble sleeping, and this app helps calm her also. I listen to various tones when painting and writing poetry. I can't recommend it enough.
1449410243|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Very funny and entertaining, you can read the whole thing in one or two days.
B005KMX866|5.0|Wonderful recording of several songs from the rockabilly age of music.  I grew up listening to this music and Chris Isaak is one talented guy.  He and his band are great in a live concert also!
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|This was almost a great movie.  The plot went a little trite at times, but by lad who plays Willow is brilliant and Kilmer was excellent.  It's a fun movie and belongs in any family collection.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Very pretty!! Easy to apply to the wall! Looks absolutely beautiful in our little girl's princess bedroom.Would definitely recommend to give that princess touch!
0920668372|5.0|This is such a good book, a real tearjerker!  It is a classic that kids and parents can both enjoy for years and years.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|This film is predictable and violent. It's also very cartoonish. Spend your time watching something that will make you think!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This movie does a very good job of following the novel within the limits of special effects, etc.  Jennifer Lawrence was brilliant and should have won the Oscar,  What a great movie!  I'm sure the second movie will be good, I'm iffy about the third.
B001EX81ZI|5.0|This is a Very good product.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  They are Great for traveling with bottles.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This is a great DVD package.  There is tons of amazing footage, so much I haven't seen despite years of Pearl Jam devotion.  A must have for any fan!
B001NLL93W|5.0|loved the series!!! Became obsessed with reading it to see what happened next. Loved the chemistry in the characters that was forbidden
B002ZG9846|4.0|This was an entertaining run at a comic (oops, graphic novel) based movie.  I enjoyed it and am looking forward to Kick-Ass 2.
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|I am almost 64 years old, and I am a life-long movie fan. I studied film and film history in college eons ago, in the '60's, and I have watched maybe 10,000 movies in my life. But I don't consider myself an expert. If I was, I'd probably have been a director or critic, and I'd definitely be more informed on world cinema (specifically, movies not made in the English-speaking world). I looked forward to Mark Cousins' The Story of Film: An Odyssey, but I have to admit that at this point--due to time constraints--I have watched only the first episode. However, I will definitely watch the entire series. Seems to me that people are making too much out of a couple of things, and collectively, these 'things' are precluding them from deriving any enjoyment or benefit from their experience.<br /><br />Firstly, the Irish commentator. Geez, get over it, will you? Personally I enjoy the different dialect. I would throw out this idea (and I may be wrong): perhaps people who are most put off by his speech are the same folks who have a problem reading subtitles? If you have a problem with reading subtitles, you better get over it, IF you wiah to watch any movies not dubbed or not made in English, or for that matter, the majority of the films Cousins cites in his series! Martin Scorsese narrated his own wonderful homage to Italian cinema, My Voyage to Italy. He has a herky-jerky, frenetic, New York-style of speech, very far removed from 'The King's English', or typical American Midwestern, but that is OK. However, we know Scorsese....he made a lot of great movies, he is American. People who say things like, \\"I know what I like, and I don't like that\\" usually mean \\"I like what I know, and I don't know that\\".<br /><br />Secondly, people seem outraged that Cousins has opinions which differ from the standard film history approach shared by many critics and historians (most often, American critics). I say that there is room for more than one opinion. He is sharing his own views, his discoveries, and his knowledge with us, and don't forget, this is a monumental series (15 episodes totalling 900 minutes!). Cousins has a love of film, the background, and the ability to write a literate sentence, which is really all you need if you wish to come up with your own film history! I applaud Cousins' achievement, and I am eager to hear what he has to say. He doesn't fall down in worship of Griffith and Hitchcock--a repatriated Brit who made his greatest films here in the US--and Welles? Fine, let's see who/what he does think. Howard Zinn wrote a socialist, alternative American history called The Peoples' History of the United States, which was far, far removed from the standard stuff people of my generation were taught in elementary school. Personally, in school I did not learn any American history from either an African American or a Native American perspective; I've had to research that on my own. My point is that we all benefit from each others' different opinions, experience and knowledge. Perhaps it is a reflection of the uncompromising, polarized political viewpoints in this country: \\"I am right, you are wrong, so the hell with you!\\" Instead of \\"we differ, but perhaps we can learn from each other.\\"<br /><br />Thirdly, the perceived bashing of American cinema and Hollywood. I tend to agree with Cousins on this point. The Jewish immigrants who started and ran American cinema in the early 20th century were primarily concerned with one thing and one thing only: making money. Hollywood became the mecca for American film mainly because the weather was so dependable, and a smorgasbord of outdoor scenery--desert, water, mountains, cityscapes--was close at hand. Thus, many movies could be made and could be made quickly and cheaply, which meant, a greater return on investment. The Hollywood studio system--and I am greatly oversimplifying here--was essentially a glorified slave trade where contract workers provided the labor, and the owners of production--the studio heads--reaped the major spoils. There was a constant battle of philosophies: entertainment (getting the most asses in the seats, i.e., $$) vs. art (creating the most meaningful and/or groundbreaking and critically acclaimed films). As judged by the critics, Citizen Kane has been for years one of the top ten 'greatest' American movies, but ask the average American who's seen it, and they will say something like \\"I didn't understand it\\", or \\"it was amazing, but I did not like the Kane character.\\" Steven Spielberg's great achievement is that he is probably the American director who has been the most successful at creating films which strike a balance between art and entertainment, but Cousins is not going to bend over backwards in praising Spielberg. I believe Cousins is interested in other, lesser known films and directors. What is wrong with that?<br /><br />Why do people see movies anyway? Many simply go to do something, to get out of the house, either literally or figuratively, to escape, to be entertained on an immediate level. If that is your main reason, OK, nothing wrong with that. You do not want to have to think or work or do anything other than sit there and enjoy it....like being on a rollercoaster. I would suggest that this series is not for you. On the other hand, if you do wish to learn something, to be transported to another place, to see how other people live, to experience, if only for an hour or two, what other people who are not like you have experienced, then, you are open-minded enough to enjoy this series.<br /><br />Lastly, the 'mistakes' and errors in Cousins' series. I honestly don't know enough about the particular movies to tell if Cousins was actually screwing up. It would be interesting to hear what he himself would say on this matter, and it would perhaps be informative to determine if some of his statements were inaccurate. I guess it is possible that he made some mistakes. But my reaction to this is: don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. If he does make a mistake, or he does ramble, or he does make odd statements, hey, that is OK, he has the microphone. I think that that true value of this series is that it is enlightening and transcendental: he cites a film he found to be significant, which we've never heard of, and he leads us across the bridge into uncharted territory, IF we allow ourselves to follow him, see the film and be moved by it. That in itself makes us smarter and better informed.<br /><br />I eagerly look forward to watching the rest of this interesting series.io heads--reaped the major spoils.

0316044695|1.0|These guys come off as punks with and attitude, sorry presentation and you have to read almost half the book to get to the actual battle,  You can learn to kill and still be a punk, that doesn't make a man or a person of character and the way these guys are represented doesn't begin to compare with the character that past War Heroes had. Its not all there fault its partly due to the society we live in. It may be the way the book was written, maybe they were looking for something that just didn't resonate with me.  I am sorry but I have to speak the truth.  Just for a small illustration , Marcus describes a seen where he said that's when he knew there was a God, man he hasn't got a clue, two paragraphs later he taking God's name in vain ( in writing, so he's even had time to think about.)  There is so much wrong with this book, no excesses and it saddens me to see how the people who read this book are entertained by it or amazed.  Perplexing!  I appreciate the sacrifice these guys and many more like them made, but am very disappointed in the character content portrayed in this book.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Adding another book to my favorites is Slammed by Colleen Hoover. I am surprised I haven't heard of this before I even read it. I was so interested in reading it I bought it right away since I loved the characters and the plot which captured my heart. This is my first Colleen Hoover book which is not going to be my last since I am hooked to her writing. From the moment you finish you have to pick up Point of Retreat (sequel), you will need it since I did finish Slammed in one day. It was beautiful, romantic, calm and full of inspiration after reading.<br /><br />Within a few chapters were shocking and sad. The main character Layken (Lake) are just moving to Michigan after losing her father. Kel her little brother and mother then find friends in their neighbors across the street. The older brother Will, catches Lake's eye. These two characters were created beautifully and you got to know the person while reading it. Colleen Hoover did a great job of writing about the characters.<br /><br />This book was fantastic and the fact that its a contemporary romance, I fell in love with it. The date scene was an adorable date because you got to see a different side of Will. The poetry made me cry and laugh. Slamming is very inspirational because that how many people can express how they feel. The moment Lake does find out that Will works and she was not able to continue their relationships, and it broke my heart! Julia, Lake's mom also is a major character because she as well goes through so many things. She is very cool and respects Will.<br /><br />The romance was controlled and I thought it was beautiful how everything worked together to find the one person who inspires you to be yourself. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author who can create this book that everyone can love. I loved how the book ended and I am glad to have already read the other two in this series. In this New Adult it has made it one of my go-to reads. This is one book everyone must read!

B004I8WD6E|5.0|perfect, i cant complain at all. it was exactly what i needed to make my case and it was on time!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I was really shocked at how much I liked 'Bared To You'. Being a great fan of the Fifty Shades series, I was sure I wouldn't like this series, because of all the reviews that said this was a copy of Fifty Shades. Well I disagree somewhat. Their are a few similarity's and the books are in the same genre. However, the actual story is different and they don't read the same. The characters Ana an Eva are as different as night and day. Gideon is one hot sexy gorgeous overbearing alpha male.  The secondary characters are very diverse in this story and I really enjoyed  reading about them. Cary Eva's bisexual roommate is just on point and funny, sexy and handsome. The Mother oh my!! she is a mother stalker and very overprotective of Eva .  I am very glad I finally read 'Bared to you'. I suggest if you are on the fence about reading it, that you give it a try. I am ready to read book 2 Reflected in You. I highly recommend 'Bared To You'!!
1576754227|5.0|this book has very simple and direct information about how to order your priorities and accomplish the things that are most important to you. l believe that anyone can find something useful to their own situations. l would recommend it to anyone wanting more order and better control of their lives.

0553382179|5.0|this is a simple and effective way to gain control over your life in small and easy steps everyday. lt is a progressive program because it allows for what ever state your home/life is in at the present moment and as you follow the routines provided it they take care of any problem areas and then you are able to continue expanding in those same simple basic steps to refine and then to live the routines that you had developed to create the kind of life that you desire. lt is a very uplifting and accepting format, recognizing that we are all different and have different ways of doing the same things to achieve our own ideals. l signed up for the online program and found it helpful if not a bit commercial in its offerings of the perfect tools needed to do the job. lt is easy to ignore them if you choose to do so. So to sum it up;  it is a loosely structured routine that allows for anyone to be successful in clearing away clutter and to become organized in their own space without requiring you to &#34;fit into anyone else's box&#34; or vision of the perfect home. it works for me.

B0019IIPXQ|4.0|As the title says, a simple and fun movie. A little light on the action until the latter portions of the movie, but still a good one in my opinion.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|We originally bought an Exersaucer for my daughter, but it was so big and bulky that she had trouble reaching all the \\"stuff\\" on it and it was stiff enough that she really couldn't bounce much at all.  My daughter is small for 8 months, around 15 lbs, so that may be a factor.  This one is PERFECT!  She can reach everything and bounce even on the smallest baby setting, but there's plenty of room to grow by adjusting the cords on the sides.  She likes all the toys thus far still after several weeks.  I don't bother folding it up normally, but it's a nice option for when we are having guests and want our house to look more like a home and less like BabiesRUs!  This is nice though because it's a LOT lighter weight than the Exersaucer, which was so darn heavy I pretty much had to leave it in one place.  This one is light enough that it's not a chore to carry it from room to room, so we're able to get a lot more use out of it!
B004UID2LC|3.0|I see that to some people that it was like a virus. I downloaded it on my kindle fire several months ago. Surprisingly it was working perfect, until it starting being weird. Like when I played song's the bar at the bottom disappeared so I couldn't fast forward or skip to a different song. It's a very complicated app. All in all I enjoy it, I have downloaded over 200 videos/music and even anime!! :D

B0091REZMW|4.0|Very interesting game. I have spent quite a few hours on it an have only had it for a week.
B000002OTL|4.0|I received the CD about the same time as the DVD. The CD follows the movie and there is some dialogue from it. You can hear John Travolta and others on the CD. Explicit language and violence are included in the CD and I would not allow my son who loves to upload my music to his ipod to listen to. (He has Autism). If you don't mind what is included in the CD, then you can enjoy the music that is on it. Music from the 60's from other singers are in it, and I thought I would enjoy it more without the interference of the movie. But, since the movie dialogue is on it, then I was slightly disappointed.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is a super fast texting app that works well I highly recommend it because most texting apps really suck
B009YP9L7U|4.0|When I saw the word Harlequin I almost passed over the book. I remember too well my aunt and her ratty old Harlequin romance books. Glad to see things have changed. The subject matter here is not new at all. What is unique here is the writers treatment of an age old story line. Connor is determined to make the marriage work and convinced she's the woman for him. She is determined to show him she is not, but agrees to a three month trial marriage.<br /><br />The humor is a little dry, but a lot of people like that kind of humor. The characters are sort of believable but shallow. I think the author could have created a deeper tale here but the story was just too short to give it much depth. It is a fast read and if you're looking for a quick escape into fantasy this might just fit the bill.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Roddenberry was all about space opera - brave social commentary and controversy explored in the context of some pretty cheesy special effects. The original series had melodramatic acting, but it was rescued by comedic timing and genuine chemistry between the characters.<br /><br />In contrast, \\"Into Darkness\\" says nothing. It has a boring plot, predictable timing, console-gaming battle scenes, huge holes and puzzlers in the plot (why, exactly, was it necessary for the Enterprise to be under water than in orbit in order to stay out of sight?), and only a few little Easter eggs for fans. The sly nods to the original series were fun - for example, the scene of Kirk dying of radiation poisoning instead of Spock, and Spock being the one to yell \\"Khaaaaaaaan!\\" - but these were scattered and few. In the Kirk-resurrection scene, I wish we would have seen the tribble pop into two pieces and after a camera cutaway, a glimpse of the table being full of tribbles and a couple of them falling off. That would've been great.<br /><br />Some commentators have dissed the wooden acting, but how much of that is because these actors have to have a resemblance to the characters in the original series? They are constrained by the styles of a different set of actors, so I can give them some latitude.<br /><br />Simon Pegg as Scotty is a delicious little amuse-bouche in the middle of this boring smorgasbord of stitched-together action sequences.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|Everything in this game is set up to get you to buy more credits. Their customer service sucks!! They will not give you back anything that was mistakenly removed from your account or any goof ups on their part. Say for instance your computer froze right after winning that hard to get item. When u come back, it will not be there. I have sent several request for help and all you get in return is an automated response or someone wanting your facebook i.d.#. After your reply you dont hear from them again. Or you may get a ''if you paid for your credits we will refund''. If you used free daily credits or won credits, you r out of luck! Other than that i love the game.
0307341577|3.0|This book drew me in like a moth to a light after I read _Sharp Objects_. It is a good book in its own right, but not nearly as compelling as Gillian Flynn's debut.<br /><br />One of its major flaws was also a minor flaw in _S.O._: character dialogue can be very weak. The same energy and focus with which Ms. Flynn wrote Camile Preaker is evident in Libby Day, who stands out as a real-as-flesh-and-blood kind of character. But something goes amiss every time she interacts with anyone else in the book- conversation grows stale, inevitably. This left me begging for more pages filled with Libby's psyche. The exception to this would be the climax (no spoilers), in which the suspense and tension glides through the dialogue unseen until an appropriately timed dramatic crescendo. Small things about Libby's interiority, however, also seem a bit trite in comparison to Camile's (for example, Libby's mental `dark place,' from which the book draws its name, could be something from a hollywood hack movie).<br /><br />Minor characters throughout the novel have distinct personalities in themselves, especially the members of the Kill Club and Diondre. These are the kind of people you love to hate, and the disgust readers are bound to have for them sustains the novel even during its slower moments. Ben's character was a huge snag for me. Relative to the others in Ms. Flynn's fictional repertoire, he is singularly unremarkable. The device which Flynn uses to rotate between Libby's present day perspective and isolating past events through Ben's eyes is interesting in itself, but could be more so if he weren't so flat in his modern-day persona. In his 80s perspective, Flynn gets angry youth down pat, but he seems wispy and insubstantial beyond that.<br /><br />Flynn sticks with the psychological themes she writes so well, emphasizing family and sexual norms. Ben has a father-axiety alongside the frustrations of sharing a small home with an entirely female clan, and her vision of the a day in the life of an American teenager subverts usual ideas on how teens `should' behave (much more realistic, obviously, or at least a realistic narrative that doesn't always fit well with how we sometimes 'think' they 'should' go). Like most of her characters, Ben and the Days experience is far from the safe Mom-and-Pop 50s suburbia.<br /><br />As a present day character, he is more of an annoyance than anything else. His refusal to tell Libby what happened the fateful night of the novel's crux has no energy behind it (again, it feels like Libby could be talking to a manikin). In sum, he feels like a passive plot device, whose actions have their only motive in that the author needed things to go this way for the rest of the book's sake. Although the climax is well done (and ties in very nicely with the cover art), the revelation of Ben's big secret and the resolution of how everything connects at the end of this mystery feels somewhat contrived (again, it's as if some of these details could've come from a lower budget horror film).<br /><br />I don't mean to say that there are genuine surprises at the end which have no logical grounding in the rest of the book, only that something feels incomplete after the entire journey. Having said that, those events aren't entirely contrived, and contribute to the novel's themes regarding class and gender in America. As she did in Sharp Objects, Flynn does character development and psychological writing very well, but _Dark Places_ is still an inferior follow-up to its predecessor. It's not a bad read by any means- just not as good.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me and she was right. I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it. Fascinating read!
0307341550|5.0|So, up front, these are usually the kings of novels I try to avoid. You know the type: cool, flashy covers with unique designs, stacked up high, in plain view, right when you walk in the bookstore because the pushy publishers can't wait for you to hop on the bandwagon. They wind up reading like episodes of `Law & Order' inevitably (I was a literature major, unfortunately, not only for obvious regrets but also because it made me a real book snob). That being said, I was desperate for a good, distracting read, so I picked up _Sharp Objects_ on a whim. And I have not regretted that since.<br /><br />  Ms. Flynn is very clearly a writer with superb gifts for creating atmosphere by the means of character interiority: the resignation, depression, grit and grime of a blue collar reality have great expression in Camille Preaker. Fans of film noir and hard-boiled detective fiction will love this about the book. The juxtaposition between classes (dingy, backwoods and low income Missourians and a suburbia awash with cash) contributes to this atmospheric angst. Her choice of having a main character revisit her past in an old Victorian house also gives the novel a gothic feel, as do themes such as family abnormalities, childhood innocence (or lack thereof), and sexual deviancy. She incorporates these generic expectations with appropriate degrees of verisimilitude and imaginative reinvention. Along with atmosphere, Flynn has a great gift for subtlety and understatement, which are both especially necessary so the novel retains elements of humor (even at its darkest moments).<br /><br />  Flynn spends a great deal of space in the novel by taking readers down the rabbit hole of Camile's psyche, not only by limiting readers' involvement in the story to her perspective but also by reliving her childhood traumas and elaborating on her fragmented selfhood (this, it seems to me, is VERY easy to overdo, and goes back to the author's gift for subtlety). Uncanny events and personalities, including her half-sister's covert devilry and her mother's obscure but unmistakable derangement, are reminiscient of Freud (hence why I call the book a psycho-thriller).<br /><br />  The ending may seem a bit cliche, and some readers may see it coming from a mile away (going back to the Law & Order anxiety). But the plot is definitely complete, without any feelings of convolution, and the craft with which is was written made it a completely enjoyable read for me. Some of its biggest flaws come in character dialogue- although Flynn writes her main character expertly well, her conversations with minor characters seem stilted by comparison. Overall, an enjoyable novel with substance.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone.  It so keenly illustrates that all of us have insecurities, and self doubts that can keep us isolated and hold us back from our greatest achievements. What a WONDERful way to teach empathy and kindness!  I read the book so that my 9 year old grandson and I could have book discussions about it.  I always let him give his review and insight first.  The book is working its WONDERS on him.
B00DXP7L88|1.0|As a fan of Dexter from season one, this final chapter was profoundly disappointing. It's not like the warning signs weren't there; from the fifth season this show has been in a nosedive in terms of writing and execution (if you'll forgive the pun). The subtlety and nuance started giving way to clunky expository dialogue, with characters being written in and out so quickly they built no sense of danger or threat.<br /><br />I had hoped season eight may have put an end to the suffering inflicted on viewers in recent years. Finally, here was the writers' moment to shine; what thrilling episodes could we look forward to? Since the very beginning, the show has flirted with the notion that Dexter would one day be exposed and if not caught then certainly on the run. Doakes was the finest example of that, and who could forget Trinity showing up unannounced at Miami Metro? The two questions fans have had for years are: when will Deb find out, and when will Dexter's secret become known?<br /><br />The first question was already answered, and I naturally assumed that this final chapter would be the story that answers the second. Things seemed to be heading in that direction with a new super-detective, and episode one was whetting my appetite. What happened next and throughout the season was inexplicable. Dexter is not exposed and doesn't need to evade anyone. Instead, we get a bizarre background story and then a series of characters who are written in and killed off with absolutely no consequence whatsoever.<br /><br />Harry the expository ghost is drafted in to spoon feed the audience what a better show would leave for the audience to put together themselves. Then we get Dexter's inner narrative, which by now has become a unintended comedy element for the frankly insulting way it's used to state the obvious or explain the story like we're incapable of figuring it out. Such repetitive tedium speaks only of the disdain the writers must have for the show and the viewers.<br /><br />The plot is absurd, and mostly pointless, and by the end of the show we're in almost the same place we were several episodes previously, such is the way in which nothing that happens has an effect. Screen time is wasted on dull side-stories involving secondary characters which aimlessly bore the viewer until they're dropped with no resolution at all.<br /><br />The final episode is particularly excruciating. Story lines are simply abandoned or resolved with childlike dialogue to the extent I was half expecting Harrison to have a credit as a co-writer. The episode gracelessly lurches from one necessary plot point to another, which boils down to how many times the same characters can attempt the same journey. Ultimately, the story ends with the option almost nobody wanted to see. The show's finest actor (Jennifer Carpenter) is written out with what's essentially an off-screen death by way of a button flick, all secondary characters simply never appear again, and in one especially painful scene, Hannah comes to learn of Dexter's fate on her tablet, and doesn't seem especially bothered. At the very end, Dexter breaks the fourth wall in a way that would be more effective if that's what he hadn't been doing in every opening credit sequence since the show began.<br /><br />This final chapter is the empty husk that remains after the soul of what was once magnificent television has been removed over the course of four long years before our very eyes. It's a shell of its former self, and the feeling this dog's dinner of a conclusion leaves you with more than anything is sadness; sadness that the writers didn't even have it in them to give the characters the send off they deserved. This review is for the FINAL season of this show, not the show as a whole, which would get a 4.5 stars if it ended half way through it's lifespan but deserves 3 because of what it became. This season should be grateful for the single star it deserves.br />The plot is absurd, and mostly pointless, and by the end of the show we're in almost the same place we were several episodes previously, such is the way in which nothing that happens has an effect.

B007SGM084|2.0|I was wondering why the books were the best seller so I gave it a chance.<br />I must say it's just a waste of time and money.<br />I know there would not be any knowledge you would learn from the book but I was just curious how well she used the expression words on the romantic or erotic scene.<br />Not much I could learn, really???<br />All I can say, whoever published these series definitely knew how to do the great marketing....good job!!
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|I feel like there is more to explore in this future possibility.  I have the highest rating because Atwood writes brilliantly again.  I recommend this book to those who appreciate her style.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I have read all of Kate Morton's work and feel that it had the same theme as the others. Much easier read than the Distant Hours.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|This was great movie but it is not a classic zombie movie so if you a looking to see 2 hours of the undead devouring people then this is not your movie. Although nothing in the movie is over the top great, it managed to not have any flaws in execution. It didn't make any false claims about being a typical zombie movie and I don't understand the criticism of this movie. It either comes from people wanting a zombie horror film and not getting one or from the one obvious thing in this movie. This movie is accurate in its portrayal of Israel and therefore offensive to some who are plainly anti-Semitic and want Jews unjustly portrayed as evil....for what reason I can not figure out.

B00EYAMEX8|4.0|Well, I know about Zendaya because I am forced to watch Shake it Up whenever my nieces come over. It's one of the few Disney shows I can tolerate (actually I enjoy it). It's nice to see a Disney star not \\"twerking\\" or behaving badly. Keep it up, Zendaya!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story was enthralling and each new chapter had me hoping for that happy ending, that fairy tale ending where the characters live happily ever after. Instead what I found was a very moving story of struggle, bravery, endurance and hope.<br /><br />Also, reading this book has been a real eye opener and has given me a better understanding of what life was, or is, like in Afghanistan.

B003U53GK8|4.0|It took me awhile to finally decide to watch Lost and I got caught up in the hype pretty quickly.  I liked the story as a whole and was told by many people that I would hate the ending, but I did not!  The only problem, imo, with the last season is I got the impression that you could actually pinpoint the time they decided (or was told) there would not be another season and the story line felt rushed towards the end.  But i never got really confused and was pretty ok with how it all wrapped up in the end.  Also, I adore Hurley.

B005TKD6NY|3.0|I had previously read `A Wild Sheep Chase' by Haruki Murakami and found it one of the most original books I had read in a long time. So after reading the reviews of `Norwegian Wood' and seeing that it is his most popular novel I immediately placed it on my reading list. I must say that I did find this book a little disappointing. The story line was not as imaginative as I expected and I found there were whole sections which were drawn out with far too much detail. It's my view that the book would have been better had it had forty to fifty pages edited out. However, that said, the translation was excellent and the main characters and the interplay between them was convincing. It also has to be said that this is a novel concerning a young student coming of age and his relationships between two girls, Naoko, the girlfriend of his best friend and Midori, an interesting young woman who is introduced later in the novel: In view of this readers in the age group between seventeen and thirty may be able to relate to the book a little better than someone who's age far exceeds thirty years old.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I purchased this after reading all the great reviews and although I knew it had limited apps., the ability to stream wireless from my laptop to the TV was top priority. Should have read the comments re: Chrome having it's own DNS address. I subscribe to streaming services, but living in Canada, had hoped to be able to access some American content, which is far superior to ours. Chrome does not allow blockers. This was a disappointment.Also the video quality was not a good as expected. What played on my laptop and what was projected on my TV was much lower quality. Had I known, would have invested, the extra money on Roku or other similar systems which at least gave me more programs.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|This season was the best so far. After each episode I was dying to know what happened next and most often went directly to the next episode becasue the endings were such cliff hangers. I hope season 9 is equally brilliant.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I bought this for my husband.  We recorded this on the DVR when it was on TV, and I was afraid it would get deleted by mistake, so I searched around until I found it here. We really like it & especially like the third Concert DVD that came with the set.<br />I would recommend this to anyone that likes good music with a little explanation about the writers & the singers.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I like it! It works like a charm.... You scribble a formula with your finger, the app coverts it into numbers and... calculates. No more pushing buttons. There is a learning curve using it but not a lot. The app is pretty accurate to recognize your handwriting. Must have it!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great series. I would highly recommend reading all three. I can't say much without giving away anything, but I was not disappointed in the end of the series.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love this series, great characters, good story line, good clean viewing!  The British know how to make series and keep viewers entertained!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|\\"Wool\\" is a science fiction / dystopian / survival story that takes place at some time in Earths future.  It's my understanding that this story was originally released as several shorter books, but I read the Omnibus edition - which contains the complete story in one edition.  The basic premise of the book is that through some unexplained disaster in the planet's past, the atmosphere of Earth was contaminated to the point of becoming toxic and uninhabitable.  Mankind now lives under the ground in massive structures called Silos.  Inside each silo are over a hundred levels of people.  Each person is assigned to a particular department and each department must work together in concert to maintain the survivability of the silo.  There are about fifty of these silos.  But here's the trick....each silo thinks they are the only one.  Only a few people in each location are trusted with the truth that they are not alone.  The rest of the population is lied to, manipulated, and scared into conformance.  Anyone who questions the powers of the silo's leadership is sent to \\"cleaning\\" - which basically means they are sent outside - where they die within minutes.<br /><br />This book is brilliant in its premise and deserves to stand beside the works of Bradbury and Orwell as a classic of dystopian literature.  Towards the end of the story (during the war inside the silo) there are some sections that drag on a little bit, and there are some characters that aren't as compelling as the primary core of Juliette and Lukas (or Jahns and Marnes from earlier in the story).  I also think the book would have been slightly less \\"jarring\\" if I had read it as the separate books it was originally released, instead of reading the entire collection together at one time as I did.  Those things aside, this is a great story that's well written and will be enjoyed by any science fiction fan.  Very well done.  4 out of 5.
B00866JL96|5.0|As a Zac Efron fan, of course we loved this movie.  It was yet another movie to show his acting ability.  The storyline was good and it left you with a good feeling at the end.

B00DQVSTCG|1.0|My wife and I are huge Madonna fans but this release is not as good as her Sticky and Sweet Blu-ray concert, sorry. The artistic achievement of the Buenos Aries show will remain her peak moment, arguably the highest moment in culture in 2009 and since.<br /><br />The audio is not right either, I want a refund.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Everybody can play if they have quick fingers. I thought the game should be 5stars not just 3 and a half I even have really short fingers and I can play better than anyone you probably know.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|After watching this movie in theaters my wife and I both wanted to buy it, one of the reasons is that we wanted to support a \\"scarey\\" movie that went for a PG13 rating and didnt have blood shooting out everywhere. We both liked the movie - I would give it 4 stars - but the BLU RAY only has the new bloodier unrated version on it.  To watch the theatrical version you have to watch it on DVD. The new gore your forced to watch isnt as bad as newer R rated movies but more like an R rated movie in the early 90's. It looks very fake and in my  opinion doesnt look right.  Thats mostly because its computer generated. They apparantly hired some one to draw fake looking blood spraying everywhere. Thats fine if thats what you wanted to buy but we wanted the version we fell in love with in theaters and yes we can watch it on the DVD but I wanted the version I saw in theaters with out the fake gore on the Blu ray I paid for.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|As a kid I loved musicals but with theworld changing so much I didn't know about this musical I'm so glad nexflix suggested for me to watch it was a really good movie and musical about the young people today.I thought i wasn'tgoing to likeit because I am so into old school musicals but i ended up loving this movie I love the singing and all the songs was very entertaining which I saw it atthe show on the big screen i love this movie so much I watchit every week

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This is a book that offers great insights, now to just apply it's lessons! I would recommend this to anyone.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I am sure this is already popular.  Everyone knows that this game is so addictive.  It is so bad I started to find myself neglecting other things in order to play.  If you download this game be ready get occupied with destroying them little pig like creatures for hours.

B00CF34B2I|3.0|I understand the complaints about installing this game and I also caution you to think twice about trying unless you're ready to do battle with your Kindle. My recommendation would be to free up at least 4GB of space on your Kindle before trying to update or install it. I never could figure out how space the game actually requires to both load/update and then run, but the 1.5mb indicated here on the site seems way underestimated.<br /><br />If you try to update and install without enought space, your Kindle WILL get into a scary, unfun, seemingly unsolveable loop of trying to install, failing to install, and hogging all resources until you clear more space. The problem is that once you start the update process you can't back out because the program is technically not \\"running\\" so you can stop it (at least I couldn't) in the apps area. Eventually, I was able to uninstall enough other things to get enough space to finish the process, open it for the first time, and finish installation. (My first thought was to instantly UNinstall it and never look back.)<br /><br />It was also a good lesson to see just how little my 16mb kindle (really only about 12mb after systems software and other unremoveables) can fit. I ended up deleting some magazines to the \\"cloud\\" and realized just how much space one WIRED magazine takes up.<br /><br />Also, it was instructive to realize that really, I should let most apps I don't use live happily in the cloud and realy only put them on my Kindle when I need them. I hate not having instant access to everything, but at least stuff seems to be there in the cloud when I want it. So, in the end, it's probably too big a game to have permanently taking up space on your Kindle unless you plan to play it a lot. It eats up roughtly the resources that four full-length movies would.<br /><br />What I don't understand is 1) why, after installation, it needs to add ANOTHER 1.5gb of resources the first time you play and 2) why the publisers don't have LOTS of warnings about freeing up enough space (with an accurate estimate) before trying to install. I didn't find the program as buggy as others, but there is clearly room for improvement on a number of fronts.<br /><br />Having said all of that, the game's graphically stunning and a real good simulation of actual gameplay, especially if you're like me and this is pretty much the only way you can play it. I think the game can be enjoyed without paying for additional content, but I have hit kind of a wall of enjoyment, go that I've defeated the prearranged fights. I guess I better figure out the rest of the features that seem to be there for more advanced play.of warnings about freeing up enough space (with an accurate estimate) before trying to install.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good memory exercise. I like the puzzles. Could be harder but its better time spent than on candy crush.  decent.
B00AJLHTT0|5.0|The music itself seems to have been covered well, so my review is simply about the vinyl pressing.  As the title says, it is outstanding.  Right out of the sleeve, no pops, crackles, nothing, it is as near perfect sound as my ears and system can detect.  I'm only commenting on this because it simply isn't true of many of the new records I buy, regardless of 180g, marketed quality etc.  I put this on my Rega, lay down the needle and.. silence.  Then the music started.  If only everything could come this way!
B002VPDOFK|5.0|Alicia intermingling the classical with soul and pop. This is a highly creative, innovative CD. Every song is carefully written and crafter by a highly talented, innovative artist. I highly recommend it for Alicia Fans or those on their way to becoming ones!

B0000DD7LC|5.0|If you are an Alicia Keys fan you will not want to miss this excellent CD. Her music is timeless and appealing. She mixes a little bit of classical with soul. If you want to experience and highly talented, great artist, you will not want to miss this CD! Alicia at her best!
B000002IWH|5.0|This album will not disappoint you. It has very good selections of songs, including Nine inch nails. It is shame that this movie capsulates what could have been a promising acting career for Brandon Lee. Like his father who is legend 'Bruce Lee', Brandon's performance in this movie can not be emulated or forgotten.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Alicia keeps on challenging herself and experimenting with new music. This CD will not disappoint. It is different than her others but she keeps her high level intact. There is the trademark classical/intro and outro like in her others. We are lucky to have such a classy, great artist in Alicia!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this app! What people do not understand is that they have to open it for it to fully install. Thank you once again Wizards of the Coast!
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|This is one of the best Donna Summer Collections. If you are a Donna Summer fan you will love all of her career hits. This is the collection to buy!. She also has a later CD called &#34;Crayons&#34; that features some comeback experimentation with Donna. too bad we lost her to lung cancer, but her legacy and talent lives on!
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|A tiny bit to big, but it is for gaming. Most of your best mouses are on the huge - discomfort side of things. But this mouse speeds up the DPI just nicely for those slow and sometimes awkwardly slow pointer style games. You can speed up the reaction of the pointer to just what you need with a press of a button. If you read the instructions, you should be just fine. I love it. Takes some getting use to, but once you get a handle on it.... your off and running. I think other gamer's may like this to.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Good app with lots of functionality, like deadlines, notes for your tasks, importance, etc. But the widget doesn't refresh automatically. If it did, it'd be perfect
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read it! This boom is a great follow up and has so much more story than the first book in the series.
B00BG0RSJ4|4.0|Okay, this is funny, classic, and a good story. I watch it with my family and we just laugh over the characters and lines, or we grip ourselves over what might happen next!

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A thoroughly compelling read. Ordinary people living in a twilight zone of truth and consequences. Don't start this book unless you have time to finish it quickly.

140053271X|5.0|This is my first reader and after a month of using it, I'm still very happy with it. It's easy to use, easy (for the eyes) to read, and has a very reliable battery-life. It's also light and offers a good hand grip with its rubber back cover. I got it delivered very quickly. The only surprise I had, but then it explains why this model is a lot less expensive compared to the others is that this one is the first generation of Nook. It has only a few hundred Mb of internal memory and does not have back-lid screen to allow you to read  in the dark. But, since it has a slot for a 32Gb external microSD, and I don't use it in the dark, it is a perfect quality-priced for me.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Ok, we didn't read the book.  But in terms of zombie movies, it was worth a second viewing with our rental.  The tension was palpable, the action tight, the acting right on.  Personally, I really appreciated not seeing guts and varied body parts littering the scenes, and it wasn't essential to the plot in any way.  Enos is a powerhouse of an actress and she played her role perfectly - Pitt was really believable in the role of the father/husband/protector - really smart about survival but still very sensitive.  The actors were terrific and truly well cast - it was a wild ride for a couple of hours.  Don't fall for the low scores - this is a super movie!

B00DLKXF3A|5.0|Like many, i've been awaiting this album since Nightmare released almost 3 years ago. The album takes a lot of inspiration from old school metal and rock bands and adds their own style on top for a kick @$$ album. This album in particular is a great example of what a fan-driven band can really pull off! Ever since The Rev passed away before Nightmare came out, they have been pushing on and keeping themselves busy. A few tributes here and there and a song \\"Carry On\\" featured in the latest Call Of Duty game, which to some doesn't mean much. To me it was a reassurance that they would do exactly what the song title says, and \\"carry on\\" with the band. They did a great job of keeping this album a secret until the last 2 months, and allowed us to stream it a week before release which was key in regaining attention. This album is definitely one you would want to listen to if you like any Avenged song(s)

The mound of Pictsies (who are NOT pixies!) with whom Tiff is most familiar, feels threatened, with some reason, by the change.  And The Cunning Man is spreading harmful lies & feelings about witches.  A good book!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|This is the second CD from Bruno Mars.  Two years later and he just continues to get better.  I love the mix of music on this CD.  He is so talented and his voice is so clear and beautiful.  I love listening to him and am constantly and very pleasantly surprised by the arrangements on all his records.  He offers ballads, pop, rock and reggae on this CD.  It's rapidly become one of my favorites.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I love the button count and placement, appreciate the weight adjustment, like how the mouse remembers all its settings when transported, including up to 4 independent X Y axis dpi settings per each of 2 profiles for acceleration, report rate and lighting. I do wish the lowest led option was dimmer, though that might have just been because I scratched off the logo.<br /><br />The one place where they appeared to have skimped out on quality is the glossy untextured plastic which manages to contact the palm of your thumb and anywhere you put your ring and pinky finger; you'll probably want some duct tape for those regions.<br /><br />I'd also consider this a mouse for large hands. The width of the mouse is as wide as my whole hand, which means the only way I'm palming this thing comfortably is with 3 fingers on top.

B003YFIUW8|4.0|About half-way through this book, I began devouring the pages like I'd been on a hunger strike--I could not find out fast enough how a particular scene was going to play out.  Now that is good, suspenseful story-telling.<br /><br />However, as much as I enjoyed this book, I can't help but think that I would have enjoyed it more had it not been told exclusively through the eyes of a five year old boy.  Although the author is largely successful, using clever literary devices, and inference to describe the state of mind of the adult characters, the reader's POV remains restricted to a child's eyes (and perhaps this is the whole point) --But it did leave me wanting more.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|We loved this movie, recommended by our son.  It was not listed among the more well known movies with Tom Hanks.  We wondered why.  Even though the Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock were the important names, the talented young boy carried the story and should have been nominated for Oscar.  We pass on the recommendation to any who have not yet seen this wonderful movie.

B0019NG73G|5.0|Recommended to watch before you plan a trip to Gettysburg to try and understand the events that happened at this great battle if you are unfamiliar with the battle itself.<br />Bewarned it is a long movie as it tries to condense 3 days of the battle into a couple of hours. It is a good movie as tries to expose the characters to the viewer as it may have occured 150 years ago.<br />Of course as time marches on new insights occur that may render the movies depiction of events as historically inaccurate but given the information the directors had at the time of shooting this film it is well presented and well acted with an astonishing cast of well known actors.

B00ARF93AQ|5.0|My kind of movie. Lots of action and some pretty good acting. It kept me watching non stop. Good actors.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This case is great, perfect size and color. I recommend it for anyone looking for a mid to low-market option. I just wanted mine to keep my Kindle safe during travel and while it is in my bag. This won't protect against heavy wear and tear (kids), but it does a great job for the purpose I intended it for.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|This album somehow gets a bad rap.  Now my review and experience pertains only to the 2004 re-master which apparently had some significant changes included in the mixing and production.  Fine, if this is the version Dave wants as the official record, then that is what we should consider.  And the first two songs alone will blow away your pre-conceived notions. \\"Prince of Darkness\\" has some of the grittiest, darkest sounds in the Megadeth canon. Bottom line: there is no such thing as a bad Megadeth album.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|There were times that I couldn't put it down !  A good story .  I couldn't figure out why there was such a 'fuss' about it...after all , it's JUST a story !!!!!  (lol)

B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|For the last book of the series this installment felt unfinished. The final relationship that Sookie ends up in seems like a cop out and you're left wondering what's happened to all our favorite vampires. I usually thoroughly enjoy these novels but this time round, knowing it's the last one in the series - it was just a let down.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great writing, character development & smart storylines. Why can't they make more programs like this that keep raunch, violence & horrible language in check?
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book. Very interesting loosely based historical references. I liked the characters, they were well developed and hooked you from the beginning of the book. I also loved that the book went back and forth from modern times to the fictional past. Would read this book over again. A definite recommend!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|No idea where I was while this show was airing on TV, but I am sooooo glad, I've stumbled across it on amazon Prime. My wife and I are always looking for good shows that have likeable characters (or bad characters that we really can't stand), and when we've started watching Suits, we had a good variety of nice-tricky-mean, nice-but-sassy, smart-and-introspective, pretty-smart-and-in-charge characters . . . plus many more.<br /><br />The best part, in our humble opinion is that each series actually has a plot! Each episode is put together quite smartly. Just when you think a likeable character screwed up, everything gets balanced out in the end and actually makes sense. How often does that happen on TV?<br /><br />We are looking forward to many, many more episodes. This is relatively light fare, at first glance, but once you figure out the back story of each character, wow, it's amazing how well this show has been produced and executed.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book as it made me feel as if I was right there with this young immigrant girl as the circumstances led up to when she had to board the train and all the heartbreaking experiences afterwards.  But then the author would jettison the reader to today and another, more modern version of the orphan train experience exists with our other main character, Molly.  I loved the back and forth from past to present and I loved the resolution!  This novel also allowed me to reminisce about my beloved grandmother who lived to 99, and like Vivian, was sharp as a tack, telling me many stories of her growing up.<br />I read this for a book club and am so happy it was chosen.  Anyone should love this novel!

B002WV5A9G|3.0|It's like all the re-invisioned stuff that's been put out lately. Instead of coming up with their own visions of different stories,<br /><br />the &#34;investment people&#34;  are coming out with movie &#34;re-mixes&#34; of more classic material.
B008VBYN80|5.0|great game no pressure on spending real money ... great pass time it also works great on my kindle fire.. so with that thanks to the boys at gameloft keep up ylthe good work.

B008I34ZFW|4.0|The zannyness of the NAZIs cannot be over reported and their weird endevores have been a source of plot material for more than half a century. This campy romp is not as good as it should have been but it is fun and there is always plenty of speculation on NAZI anti gravity devices, hidden bases and alien tech.<br /><br />If you found Star Ship Troopers amusing , which the author would have hated, you will find some of this ditty to be fun too.

1250030951|4.0|Fangirl comes across as a fluffy, stereotyped romance meant for fangirls and fanboys who know fandom personally. So much so that they are closed off from reality, and find stability within an online community that their in-life, personal time in the real world does not provide. This book doesn't deal with that kind of fannish introversion.<br /><br />It does offer an inside look into social anxiety bred of years of having your own sibling be your best friend, a fandom that's always welcoming and allows you to escape the hang-ups of the mental incapacities of dysfunctional parents and the lack of practice of being friends with people in your space all the time.<br /><br />Cath, knows she'd like to escape life, escape being someone that's a physical entity within a world where her sister, twin sister is pulling away from her now that they're going off to college, a father who is losing it now that he doesn't have his two daughters helping him cope and a mother trying to revive a long-dead relationship that was killed when she abandoned their family long ago.<br /><br />But Cath is strong. She is so strong, stronger than she knows, smarter than she thinks and more genuinely real than she can ever imagine. And the people who she meets, befriends along the way try their hardest to convince her all of this is true. And it takes work, and fighting, and snarkiness and a whole lot of pain, but Cath comes to realize it. She understands that it's a daily battle sometimes too, to believe anyone could survive all that the world throws at you, but with friends and family to rely on, she discovers it does get easier.<br /><br />If you're thinking the above is overly emotional and drama-filled, then you're missing out on a lovely story. Fangirl covers all of these fears, and no matter who you are, at sometime in your life, you will face these same insecurities. This book isn't just for the fannish community, it's for anyone struggling to believe they have what it takes to make it in real life.<br /><br />Each one of the characters, from Cath to Wren to Cath's dad and Levi, her boyfriend... They all develop into real people, and become more than secondary characters pushing the plot along. You feel for all of them, understanding their roles in Cath's story but loving them because they are their own persons who have struggled and worked just as hard as Cath to become fully-realized individuals in their own rights.<br /><br />There's something very enduringly genuine about Rainbow Rowell's words, her stories that leave you feeling you've been an eyewitness to every scene in her books. You experience the emotions along with the characters. They all feel like friends you need to co-miserate with, to cheer, to cry along with and feel protective about. Sometimes even cry along with.<br /><br />Truly this book resonates with a whole lot more people than just the fans, you just have to give it a chance!
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My Granddaughter loved this one. She has outgrown Annie now so it is perfect for 4-10 year old little ones.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Truly enjoyed the creativity in characterization...Walt is such an unlikely candidate for meth &#34;cook&#34; and Jessie plays his role perfectly!
0156012197|5.0|It was cute and would be a good book to read to young children.  Its a good reminder for adults on how to look at life.
B000008JI1|4.0|If all you know about Poison is Look What the Cat Dragged in and Open up and say ahh, you really should check this record out.  This is so far removed from those records that you would swear that it's a different group.  This is more of a hard blues record than the hair metal that they are most known for.  It's more of a continuation of their third record and it's very good.  At times, Ritchie Kotzen sounds like Stevie Ray Vaughn.  This is really quite good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game.enjoy the challenge and its funny! it works well on the kindlefire to! I would recommend this game to anyone!
1612183956|3.0|I enjoyed the beginning of the book very much, but it quickly lost my attention, or allowed me to believe in the storyline.  Like other reviewers, it was a huge turn-off to read about the extent of Ethan's injuries and that he kept going, repeatedly.  Without saying too much, I found the towns' people chase to be unbelievable and it added nothing to the story except frustration.  The repeated chase scenes grew tiresome and I don't think Ethan was particularly likable.  Also, the timing was off and confusing and although it was addressed in the finale, it made a confusing read while it was happening.  Also, I found the \\"abbies\\" to be completely unnecessary and again, how were the towns folk protected from them.  It just became far too far-fetched for me.  I didn't hate it because I kept turning the page, but I was very unsatisfied by the last half of the book and the conclusion.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief grabs you from the very beginning. It's powerful, poignant and lingers long after you finish reading. It brings the reader a strong sense of what happened in a small town in one of the most tragic times of all.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|It started by glancing over an interesting book cover and I didn't realise when I was drawn into this emotional roller coaster. I lived a fair amount of personal challenges while reading this book. I know it's fiction but somewhere it made me a protagonist of my own story. What an intense and churning read! I am glad I took this journey along with Harold Fry. Thank you Ms. Joyce...

B00EMJD6TC|1.0|People will say the book would be hard to film, but its no excuse for the sad representation this movie was. There is absolutely nothing in common with the book, just another big budget action flick. The slow zombies of the book are more terrifying, as the create such unstoppable force, showing how ineffective our combat methods would be. Hopefully someone else will see fit to redo it right.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this if you love horses you will love it by all means this is my favroit game please get it
B00F91RYL8|2.0|This was mediocre .. A bit slow for me. I won't watch again... Hmmm.. 6 more words... Do not waste... Oh I'm done..
B008XBHIEY|5.0|My kids love to watch this oldy but goody. They think it is so funny how bad graphics<br />and special effects were back in the 70's.  love to have this on my kindle when kids get<br />bored in car...
B00008O31H|5.0|I absolutely love the heavy rawness thatf this blues-like Rock brings!  I love the other ones, but this surpasses them all.
B00E00OGE2|4.0|It came out around the same time as Planes, had much less publicity, yet I think it was way better than the Cars-related sequel. It did not get enough deserved attention and was overshadowed by the Planes flying overhead. I'm not saying it was the movie of the year but it was very enjoyable. It was funny, cute, and the music was great. I love how he turned Turbo. You will want to cheer for the underdog. In this case, a lowly taco stand guy and a snail. Not to mention Ryan Reynolds (the voice actor) is super fast and that snail is super cute. Wait, reverse that. ;)
B00BN1QV0S|5.0|As a conductor I have been a fan of Abbado for many years.  He inspires me to work harder and know my scores better than ever.  It is an exceptional joy that I experience when listening to these performances of his.  Get it now and wallow in great music making.
B00E0SX118|3.0|Seeing as how this movie has received four and five stars for the most part, I feel it my responsibility to give my differing opinion. This was not one of the best cartoons of the year, which to me, five stars would imply. I did not like the Ice Age movies very much. That being said, I think this was equal or slightly better than those movies. It wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable enough. My kids didn't love it either. The main girl wasn't super likeable in my opinion. It's not a good thing when you prefer the supporting characters. And whenever a producer attempts a long journey throughout the movie, they risk the viewer getting antsy and even bored. So it did drag out for me a bit. But it still had a bit of comedy and even heart with these barbaric humans. The Croods was a, \\"meh\\" movie for me. But you may love it.
B000002L61|3.0|Great CD, good production, but no lyrics, pics (these things we like to the fans).<br />Powerfull voice of Ronnie, killer guitar solos. However does not reach overcome: Holy Diver.<br />The Price is a BARGAIN buy this you dont regreat
B008JFUQ16|4.0|Minion in a maid costume. Lol. Classic...<br /><br />The first Despicable Me was one of the best cartoons I had seen in a long time. Hilarious and enjoyable for both children and adults, alike. That being said, I think that is the reason I went in with such high expectations for the second. If you put your expectations up so high, you're only setting up for failure. So that's my own fault. Had I gone in expecting this movie to downright suck, I would have been pleasantly surprised. As I sat in the theatre, I found myself wanting so much to like it, forcing laughs even. It was still good, definitely not awful. It had really cute and funny moments but there was something missing. They were clearly trying to hard imo, and you could feel it in some of the jokes. The first movie was effortless. My kids did like this one but not nearly as much as the original; that's often expected with sequels. This was enjoyable, and heck, I'll still own it, but it fell short, on it's purple minion face.(: Bo-boo-beep Bo-boo-beep. You can't help but love those minions!
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Not great, but not horrid. Maybe not worth the $5.00 rental fee though. wait for it on netflix and save some money.
159463176X|3.0|Overall, it was an entertaining read.  Well written as always, but easily &#34;put down-able.&#34;  I never felt the need to stay up late or push off what I was doing to keep reading this book.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|The best for kids i read it over and over to my kids hope you enjoy the book and your kids enjoy it too
B00933JL0A|5.0|Oh, this game is terribly addictive. If you like town SIM games, especially ones such as the old PC game \\"Stronghold\\", you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of Townsmen. While I wish the challenges you face were more varied and had a greater effect on gameplay, it's still a wonderful little game that will be hard to put down.
0307742997|5.0|Great book - couldn't stop reading it.  Want to read more of Nesbo's books.  Would recommend it -  intriguing and compelling.
1476733953|4.0|Excellent world crafting. You really felt submersed in the environments. My only criticism is that the main character, Jules, is the was less likable than the rest of the cast. I didnt feel a strong connection to her but the story was original enough to keep me reeled in. I'm fairly certain I will read Shift now to see how it all started, so I suppose it made an impression! I can see great potential for film adaptation.

B00BMT9SQA|4.0|Barbara is the quintessential loving, concerned, and supportive mother who embarks on a road trip with the hope of helping her overly anxious, condescending, and narcissistic son overcome his self inflicted solitude.<br /><br />Joyce (Barbara's character) loves life and she is a people person whereas her reserved son is a withdrawn and conservative chemist who loves his mother.<br /><br />This is a charming film that every parent should watch with their teenage and or adult child.  Though Andrew and Joyce (Mom) seem to be completly opposite in their sensibilities, they are actually more alike than they think. They not only form a partnership, but they form an incredible new parent child bond.<br /><br />The dialogue is common place for parental interaction, but Barbara adds oomph to the script.  Her delivery is impeccable.<br /><br />Joyce (Barbara) meets a really hot cowboy guy Ben Graw.  Love this line--Andrew (son): Why do you want to feed me all the time?  Food is love.  Andy seems to open up and come alive as the movie progresses.<br /><br />The movie held my interest and my attention.  The characters became so real to me that I forgot I was watching a movie.  It didn't insult my intelligence, and nor was it typical or boring.  I laughed, worried, and felt empathy for the characters. Charming and lovely movie.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this charming and light hearted comedy as much as I did.  I tried not to give away too much of the movie.
B001IYCMNA|4.0|This product was great and was exactly what I ordered. The delivery was great and on time. The only thing was only had one Ethernet port connection but everything else was great.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|This was an extremely well directed and well done film.  It wasn't your typical boring cinema-bio.  Meryl nails the accent in a subtle, gentle, classy, and dignified manner. Loved the historical references and historic events that shaped Great Britain.<br /><br />Initially, Thatcher's husband, Dennis, was obviously an extremely confident man who certainly didn't feel threatened by his wife's brilliance and spunk. He appeared to revel in it.<br /><br />Love these lines from the movie--Margaret Thatcher:  \\"Ones life must matter.  Ones life must mean more than that.  People don't think anymore.  They only have feelings.  What we think we become.\\"<br /><br />For all her errors, this woman was awesome.  The longest serving Priminister (president) in history.  She made history.  Just shows how history can be tainted by the phallic political agenda.  Thatcher's legacy should be studied in American history classes and universities.<br /><br />Thatcher certainly held her own and stood firm in a career inflated by much testosterone driven ego--parliament.  She appeared to speak for the common woman and man, i.e., jobs, unions, IRA bombings, unemployment, economic health, industrialism, economics, assassination attempts.  Her country appeared to be at war with itself.<br /><br />What an awesome speech, \\"It's time to put the great back in Great Britain.\\"<br /><br />I loved the scene when her assistant drapes her in a classic set of double strand 8-9 mm white pearls--what a lady.  I have always hated those Texas-size and country Barbara Bush pearls.  We may have won the war but it took us centuries to catch up with the Brits...a female president (priminister).<br /><br />Love this line--Margaret Thatcher:  \\"It used to be about doing something.  Now it's about being something.\\"  This reminds me of a proverb written by Solomon, \\"Everything is vanity...\\"<br /><br />This was a fascinating portrayal of Thatcher's life.<br /><br />Who said a woman cannot be a warrior.  Have you ever seen a pride intimidate the king of the jungle when protect their offspring.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. I just did wish it didn't have to end! I loved how it is so sad in some points, but then happy the rest of the book! And now I'm going to read some other books recommended from other people who have read this book! I'm just SO excited!!!!!!!!!!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game. Especially since you can keep playing it and not have to buy a full version. I would recommend this game for anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is an awesome device.<br />Easy to install; plug and play.<br /><br />Only disadvantage is it doesn't support Silver sight and QuickTime.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love that it shows the entire day and not just the current weather. It is also very nice to look at.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|just as this unit is somewhat a work in progress, so is this review.<br /><br /> I don't really see any way to give the product less than five stars for what it offers at this price point.  I have a few 1080p plasma screens that are just fine (along with some current web-enabled models in my media room) For $35.00 this has allowed me to bring some new life and features into some older, but still excellent Panasonic plasma screens that otherwise might not be seeing as much use.<br /><br /> I won't get into features here - those are a bit fluid, and also well documented elsewhere - other than to say set up was easy,, connection to my LAN was easy - no issues with pass/encryption, and content that was on the &#34;menu&#34; was accessible without concern.  In ?? months, with a little more packed into the firmware, this'll be a real contended for Apple TV, etc, but as it sits, it's still missing some critical things, which I won't belabor, as anyone looking to purchase this will easily see the plusses, minuses, included features, and features that are &#34;under development.&#34;.<br /><br />Once this is fleshed out, it will be a killer, though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun but challenging game. It can be easy at times but can get more difficult the father you go on. My favorite part of the game is the cop he is really funny when it comes to the game. Another cool feature is the characters you can get more of them by getting coins or special items. There are so many different thing to do like run and get power ups and shop for your characters it is never ending fun.
B002O2THVA|4.0|It has in it, 'anyone who was anybody' in the late 50's-60's Western genre,  in black/white, w/good music score...good directing and camera work, with  pretty fine acting and a good twist at the end.  You pretty much can't go wrong for an enjoyable couple of hours of old time entertainment...is this where 'Pilgrim' started...?  ;-)<br />  The day after I wrote this review, I came across this article, also published very recently...a homage of sorts to the author, another twist on this story... or, 'what I did not know about 'Liberty Valance'... enjoy this written piece as wwell as enjoy the movie... this i a sample of 'life's good stuf'...<br />[...]
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|the movie would have been better if not for Pitt's acting.....he had deadpanned face throughout the movie and the plot was decent yet just droned on....<br /><br />I haven't seen him any movies before and wasn't at all impressed
B001EZ2T7W|3.0|...sometimes more so that others.  This had an interesteing twisted plot concerning time continuum... or in other words are we here or there, and when... cute, no cigar, but cute...

B008JFUUIA|4.0|This movie is pretty fun to watch.  Not a lot of plot and what is there is quite predictable, but it's quite entertaining.  I love hearing these groups sing.  Actually, I think they should have included more performances.  We ultimately bought the soundtrack but it would have been nicer if it had more complete performances.<br /><br />Not the most profound move but good fun.  My wife really liked it...a lot more than I did, actually.

4770030088|2.0|Okay. Read the title. Look at the picture of the business man. If you need to learn some useful Japanese phrases for work, this is the book for you. If you want to be fluent, look somewhere else.<br /><br />First off, there is no kanji in this book, which is fine for the point of this (to learn 'survival' Japanese, as the book puts it). But if you wanted to know it, you couldn't.<br /><br />Second, almost everything is romanized. Yeah, some things are written in kana, like terms, but it's mostly romanized. Which is almost useless if you want to learn and be using kana right away, which is necessary if you want to be fluent. Start that and kanji early, learn stroke order (which the book gives, though I haven't actually checked to see if it's right).<br /><br />Third, I haven't made it past lesson three and there's no mention of how to do numbers past 9, or honorifics aside from san. Which is atrociously useless, because Japanese is an honorific-based language. Every single name usually has an honorific, and each conversation is going to vary in politeness. They don't teach you that. They teach you one level of politeness.<br /><br />What this book does do well is give you enough of a taste of the language to tell you whether or not you are going to study it seriously or not. It explains grammar alright, I guess, but then I learn grammar by reading the context of how a word's used. I didn't get really good at spelling and grammar by studying grammar books, I did it by reading a lot, and I doubt Japanese is much different. For grammar you're better off with Barron's Japanese Grammar if you want to know more rules of grammar, the book doesn't give you much...<br /><br />Yeah, I'm going to be giving this to my local library. It isn't even worth returning.
B0040HO01Y|3.0|A pleasant diversion after a busy day.  Other reviews have aptly compared it to &#34;The  Waltons&#34; moved to rural England.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|Being a fan of the genre, and owning the Blu-Ray version, I was hesitant to buy the 3-D version fearing redundancy. However, the 3-D Version of the movie is the way to go! It was like seeing it for the first time but, this format immerses the viewer into the story and, the3-D effects are a solid TEN! Recommended.
B00007KQA3|1.0|Having read the book prior to the film's release, I had high hopes for this movie.  I didn't see it in the theater, but watched it at home on VHS with my family who had been regaled for weeks with how great 1984 was.  I spent the entire movie, and several hours thereafter, explaining everything. *Everything*.  Everyone was bored to tears, me included, and everyone but me was confused as they possibly could be.<br /><br />However, I was more than bored: I was irate!  This movie does not do the book justice.  Indeed, I haven't found many movies that are worse adaptations than 1984.  The let-down was so great that I still remember it 30 years later.  You might compare the movie to the book as a malfunctioning sparkler to a fireworks grand finale.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read the book [[ASIN:B00CLUUAOS Nineteen Eighty-Four]]; it will change you forever. The movie isn't worth seeing on its own, and will only infuriate you if you've already read the book.<br /><br />Note: Better version is [[ASIN:B009CTYUHO Nineteen Eighty-Four: The Annotated Edition]]
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I saw tom in IMAX and this Blu-Ray replicates the experience 99% . First, the storyline is original and the special effects are first rate. The ensemble of actors make this movie one that can be enjoyed with repetitive viewings. Well done.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|This is one of the best escape games I've ever played;  Beautiful graphics, great story line, challenging but not frustrating.  I did get stuck a few times but the notes and map were very helpful.  I recommend this game to everyone of all ages.
B00783NWB6|5.0|Although not one of my favorites in the series, I'm giving it 5 STARS FOR 3-D effects and 2.5 stars for the storyline. Again, having the regular Blu-Ray, I was curious to see what was done with the 3-D version. Got my money's worth.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|It's a fun little game.  Not overly in-depth but when you have a few minutes to kill, it's a perfect game.<br /><br />I have noticed a couple of glitches, but nothing that really affects gameplay, just 'page' navigation.
B009MO5G90|5.0|I, and all the others R.E. suckers out there, have made this franchise one of the most successful videos for ocular entertainment. Although you are required to check your brain at the door, this has got to be one the most premier 3-D extravaganza made for TV! Bad plot, ham acting, silly dialogue, WHO CARES! I have even seen the flick with the volume turned off and, IT MAKES ME HAPPY TOO MUCH!
B0033H7VI6|4.0|I love the knife but when I received it the blade had only a small edge on it nor was it Sharp! I took the coating off it blade from the bevel down and stood  a total of 8 hrs on y feet sharpening it on my japanese water stones! Now one of the reasons it took that long there was a lot of dips on the side of the blade and I had to take the whole knife down in order to get those dips out!  The blade now has a mirror edge that starts from the top of the bevel all the way to the edge.  I gave it 4 stars because of those dips,the reason it took so long it is great steel!

B004UA8D1O|5.0|This flick will diagnose the viewer, to see if, they are potential claustrophobics! Although I did not recognize the actors, they bring a sense of realism to the story. It seems like we're viewing a documentary on cave exploration and with the 3-D, the effect is very realistic,at times, I started to feel a little anxious and, short of breath. Entertaining?, you betcha!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I didn't think this game would be this good it is really enjoyable I say that this game is probably one of the best besides Jurassic park builder but still a great game

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome it was confusing but great . I love this ending of when Gale said it l
B00DL47RQ2|4.0|The acting by the leading lady and the fellow who played her prospective brother-in-law were Academy Award nomination worthy. Alec Baldwin seemed to not be acting but playing out his real life on screen. The scene when he says that he was able to get his son to live with him instead of his ex-wife seemed as if he was ad-libbing his own lines. Andrew Dice Clay surprised by acting disciplined. His performance should give him a few more legitimate acting opportunities.<br /><br />All this said, Woody Allen wrote a brilliant script- so superior to the garbage out there that he should be given the Academy Award automatically without needing to compete. However, his editing and cutting of the film was amateurish. His use of flashbacks made the story line confusing at times rather than being helpful.<br /><br />The film is worth a viewing to see some extraordinary acting with characters created from real depth. Enjoy.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A wonderful read! I started reading and just didn't want to put it down. A real page-turner. I loved the character Rose!
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I guess this movie is ok for younger people. Actors did an ok job but the story line was a disappointment. It portrayed Minister daughters as slutty people.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put it down! Loved being so involved in the three families, so very real. Cleverly and well written
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app, but there's one problem. This app needs shorter loading times. It's not to bad, but I just thought that I might want to let you know.

B00008438V|5.0|Loved the movie. Had to buy it because I never see it on tv. I bought it because I remember the movie from sometime ago.
140006922X|5.0|If you're looking for a book to reafirm everything you learned in Sunday school THIS IS NOT IT. This is a great book and Aslan looks at Jesus from a different perspective, that as zealot, not as peaceloving saviour. He dispels some of the myths that have grown up around Jesus and explains his life in the historical context of that time.  The book is only 200 or so pages but it is well worth reading the notes at the end of the text. They are pretty indepth and explain more fully the material in each chapter. I couldn't put this book down, and whether you agree with Aslan or not it is well worth reading.
B00EKR61FM|4.0|Twilight is about a teenage girl (Kristen Stewart) who risks everything when she falls in love with a vampire (Robert Pattinson). Twilight Forever: The Complete Saga encompasses all five films with almost 2 hours of brand new content (not to mention over 10 hours of bonuses containing every special feature ever released for the films). Twilight fans will love the deluxe treatment their franchise receives in this release. You also get an UltraViolet copy of each film (not compatible with iTunes). If you already own the films you should know the movies have not been remastered for this release but they still look and sound great.

B00ADS98FC|3.0|Fun music, cute dancing and a bit funny, so I think it would be a good popcorn, sit at home because I am tired movie.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Great movie for all ages.  The second part of this serious will be coming out shortly - now is the time to snatch this one!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I normally hate silent...&#34;Read this and figure it out&#34; games. I like at least the illusion of interaction, but this is very graphically attractive, fun to do and even if you get stuck there are 3 levels you can tap into for degrees of hints.<br /><br />Even it you consider it too easy, it is engaging enough with the visual to be a nice diversion. The plot is a little thin, the puzzles are not really necessary to the plot, but it apparently is growing, so I expect as they continue to develop it there will be some sort of satisfaction in the story line to give you more of a feeling of success than just... The END. (If they need help with plot creation, give me a holler...lol)<br /><br />Takes awhile to download, so be patience.

159514188X|5.0|\\"He told me to see poetry as a puzzle. It's up to the reader to decipher the code, or words, based on everything they know about life and emotions.\\" -Hanna Baker, Thirteen Reasons Why.<br /><br />You're wondering why I picked this quote aren't you when you know there are probably more meaningful ones in this book. The truth is I think this quote sums up Hanna's story in a nutshell. Hanna herself is a puzzle and throughout Thirteen Reasons Why we get to see that puzzle slowly but surely stumble together creating a picture that even though you don't want to see, you can't run away from. It's staring you back in the face making you think, wonder, am I someone's puzzle piece?<br /><br />Every so often you find a book that changes your life, opens your eyes to things you might have otherwise missed and for me that book is Thirteen Reasons Why by Jay Asher. Never have I read a story so devastatingly honest and gut-wrenchingly tragic before and yet with all the truths and ugliness Asher engulfs the reader in, in the end I can see the tiniest sliver of hope shine through.<br /><br />Page after page my heart clenched as I followed Clay's journey. I cried with him, I got emotionally and physically sick with him and I even hit the \\"pause\\" on reading because I couldn't stop the tears from pouring out of my eyes and dropping on my book. I'm not ashamed to admit I cried more reading this book than any other or that I felt Hanna's story so deep within me that I started looking at how I saw people, my actions in the past and how they've affected the people I care about.<br /><br />Thirteen Reasons Why is an emotionally draining and poignant story; it's suspenseful, hypnotic, and completely unmatched in both plot and execution. I could not put it down even when I had to, the book stayed clutched in my hand as I imagined what was going to happen next. What was it that made Hanna think suicide was the only way out? What pushed her over the edge?<br /><br />Asher is brilliant, I want to meet him and shake his hand for writing a story that deals with a subject we only hear about in passing. Hanna's story is relatable and honest to the core until the very end. My heart went out to her and to Clay as he slide down an emotional rollercoaster with each new tape.<br /><br />He wanted so badly to do it over, to understand, to be there, but in the end he couldn't. All he could do was make a different choice next time and reach out if someone ever needed it. I know I'm rambling on, but it's so hard to get my thoughts about Thirteen Reasons Why down on paper.<br /><br />I don't know why Thirteen Reasons Why is a banned book; I mean sure I can read the reasons why on the website, but anyone who has read this book can attest to the fact that it's cathartic. It can make you see things you didn't know were there. People of all ages especially teenagers are so susceptible to depression and suicide.<br /><br />Maybe reading this book can help people see the warnings signs in their peers. I've never felt the way Hannah felt here, but I know a few people who have and even one girl who tried to take her life and thankfully failed.<br /><br />Suicide isn't a joke. It's real and scary and Thirteen Reasons Why is a mirror into the world of someone who has lost the will to live. I will never forget this book and the way I felt while reading it. I would absolutely recommend this book. In a world where literature is fast approaching craptastic proportions, Asher's Thirteen Reasons Why gives me hope that there are still writers who have a story to tell and a message to leave.o meet him and shake his hand for writing a story that deals with a subject we only hear about in passing.

B0007YMUZW|3.0|Cold Roses and 29 are my two least favorite Ryan Adams albums. I bought them because I have ever other album he's recorded, so I wanted to complete my collection. Don't get me wrong, the songs are good. The lyrics are amazing, but he has stronger records (i.e. heartbreaker).
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I notice that Amazon took off the Madonna's MDNA Bluray from the catalogue. I have not ordered it yet, but I am worried with all the negative reviews on the bluray release. How can no one test play the disc before putting it out to the public?
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Get this album. It's amazing. The song writing, lyrically and musically, is fantastic. I'm glad I heard them on the radio and decided to pick this up.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|The plot was not bad and I don't have an issue with violence is action films but, I could have don't without slow motion, after slow motion, after slow motion, extremely graphic killings.<br /><br />I wanted to watch and action film not a gross anatomy class wrapped in a film.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I had bought my son some Turtle Beach wireless headphones, he was having nothing but problems connecting to his pc (we were told at the local game store that these were compatible). I went and got a bluetooth, still problem after problem, come to find out that they were not recommended for pc. I read some reviews of these, very highly rated, so I got a pair for my son. He is extremely happy, exactly what he wanted, and they sound amazing!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but this movie looked pretty good and I'm glad I rented it.<br />I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it very much.  Lots of great action.  Would watch again!
B0047DVHV2|4.0|Great read. Sometimes a bit long, but all in all a great life story. Keith is really one of the great. Got to love him for what he is... one of the most important musicians of all time.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked this book but it did have some cringe worthy moments. The book in my opinion was a good story, had some great characters, my favorite being Cary, but it was a little crude for my tastes. I think the book could have been a little more subtle, had a little less (if none at all) use of the &#34;C&#34; word and still go tacross the same message. In the first book in the series Eva was strong and fearless but in this book she cried ALL the time!!! LIked it willread the next one, but could have used a few adjs.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Information was very interesting and worthwhile.  It was presented in a very interesting story.  It gave me new view of education and other areas
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I liked the book and was engrossed in the story and the characters but the fact that everything happened in all three books within days was a little much going on.  waiting on captivated in you and any sneak peaks inthe coming months.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Interesting and unexpected. Not my usual pick for reading but couldn't put it down. I am reading the second book now.
B0010SKTRA|4.0|I had to read this or my evolution class and actually enjoyed it and read it during my free time. Some of the information is redundant and is talked about again and again. Other than that it is a great book.
B000TZUSOY|2.0|This music cd was not to my liking. No explanation is required. I simply did not care for this music cd.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|As a fan of Brad Pitt, I was expecting a lot more from &#34;World War Z&#34;.  The movie falls flat, with a mostly irrelevant supporting cast (especially Mireille Enos) and contrived action scenes.  I was unable to reach a &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34;, when watching this film.  The manner in which Brad Pitt is shown to know more about zombie behavior and global epidemiology than virtually anyone else in the entire world symbolizes the lack-luster effort that apparently went into adapting this screenplay (from what is generally regarded a very good novel). Even the zombie action sequences are mostly disappointing (except for the opening few minutes, which were done well).  Stuff just jumping out at you and making loud noises does not translate into suspense and horror.  Skip this one, in my opinion.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great for you tube, netflix. The setup is really simply and the definition is really nice. You have to consider that anyone thats using Wifi and netflix/You tube can control the Chromecast.
0385349947|5.0|All women should read this book that are in leadership roles or aspire to be a leader!  Don't agree with everything but it sure makes you think about how women behave in the workforce!Leaning in now!
0061122416|1.0|The book talks about the importance of listening to one's heart. I wish I had listened to mine before I bought this book. The signs were there, I had paid attention to them before and passed this book by.<br /><br />This time I ignored them and bought it anyway. It is cheap new age aphorisms woven into a story that's just not worthy of the praise that has been heaped on it.<br /><br />I now see the authors's picture on the back page and imagine him laughing at me for being a sucker to their marketing effort.

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Mr. Dawkins does a good job of describing the world in which we live and the differences between religion and science that we use to understand this world. Not being a biologist as he is put me at a little disadvantage in understanding his use of the word “memes.\\" Other than that I liked his descriptive comparisons and analogies of both science and religion with religion coming up completely lacking.

The characters are well thought out, story line is easy to follow, but also complex enough to definitely hold anyone's interest! I can't think of enough nice things to say about this entire show!! I wish there were more shows like this instead of these &#34;reality shows,&#34; which are far-fetched reality! Or those demonistic shows, which are COMPLETELY disgusting! MORE shows like Downton Abbey please!!!!

I wonder what happened to Tom Hanks, did he get hit on his head when he was reading the script????????? It's a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME to bother to watch this movie!!!!!!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH IT!!!!!!!!! Glad I didn't pay to watch it in theaters, would've asked for ALL of my $$$ back. Now, can I get this wasted time back, PLEASE????

B004GHBQPG|5.0|This line of CD's really is come of Johnny's best work. He did some amazing songs in his later years and this is no exception. I highly recommend it!
B00COWOXGE|5.0|While I have the Standard Definition DVD, I avoided the previous release of this film on blu ray due to its lousy video transfer and lossy audio.  Since most everyone includes summaries and acting opinions I will focus, as I always due, solely upon the quality of this new release.<br /><br />VIDEO...<br />  The video transfer is fantastic and has clearly been remastered for this release.  There is no appreciable grain or disturbing artifacts anywhere.  Color grading appears to have been redone as well as all colors have a very natural and real life appearance.  In one early scene, a blue door appears to pop with color but not in an unreal 'Transformers' way.  Details, large and small, are easily perceived and even hair on heads are not mushed blobs but each individual strand can be seen.  This is the video transfer that all have been waiting for and they did not get back doored. The transfer to Blu Ray makes it appear as if the film was made last week on the latest and highest resolution camera equipment.  There is no letter boxing of the film as it fills your entire screen.  The video transfer is a 5 star transfer in all ways.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  We finally have The Fugitive coming with a lossless DTS HD MA 5.1 audio which provides perfectly transparent dialogue and excellent audio balancing of the excellent background score with both dialogue and the many foley effects.  Panning across the front stage as well as the front to rear and rear to front audio stages are frequent and realistic especially so during helicopter scenes.  Subtle foley effects are perfectly leveled in the surrounds with discreet directionality for many of them.  Once set, you will not need to go back and forth with your remote's volume control.  The audio transfer also rates 5 stars.<br /><br />EXTRAS...<br />  Several new and interesting extras including current interviews with both Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones as well as the director and producers and other cast members.  One extra that was on the Standard Definition DVD focuses upon the making of the train wreck.  Not sure why they kept this extra in its original 4x3 aspect ratio but they did.<br /><br />The Fugitive retains its filmic legs both in acting and storylines.<br /><br />All my reviews focus solely upon the actual quality of the transfer and I hope this helps you in deciding your purchase.<br />  Thanks for readingra that was on the Standard Definition DVD focuses upon the making of the train wreck.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read it in two days! What a wonderful story that grabbed my attention from the beginning. Walking Disaster was wonderful as well.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I had read the reviews and knew this was good, but it turned out to be just so interesting. Lots of footage from Senna's cockpit. His story is told in a way you won't even feel the time will pass. I am no F1 fanatic and I didn't even know much about Senna. My hero as a kid was Niki Lauda because of his ghastly crash in Nurburgring, but even then never had much occasion to watch F1 races. But this film is just so good
B00F91RYL8|2.0|I'm not gonna lie - I read the book first. I loved the book and I was THRILLED at the idea that they were going to make a movie. I didn't know how they'd do it but I was so excited that they were trying.<br /><br />Unfortunately after hearing that it bared very little resemblance to the book, I held off seeing it until this weekend.  I went into it knowing not to expect the book but hoping for a new, interesting, exciting experience, anyway. I didn't find it.<br /><br />Not only is this the most generic and bland zombie movies ever, Brad Pitt gives such a bland, blank performance as the main character, I actually zoned out during most of it and had to watch it again!<br /><br />The zombies are badly CGI'd, from far. Up close, they're cheesy (Teeth clacking? Come on) and unconvincing.<br /><br />The amount of times I said, \\"Are you serious?\\" became too many to count - between the awful wife (ill-timed call), the contrivances(mob rapists within hours of the zombie siege), the suspension of this movie's own rules, there were very few bright spots to cling to.<br /><br />The most visually striking image was on the poster, in the trailers and previews - the (fast) zombies climbing the wall into Jerusalem.... and that was about it. The PG-13 rating ensured everything was vague and off-screen or shadowed.<br /><br />My opinion is that if you're in the mood for, \\"Brad Pitt saves the world\\", by all means, get this movie.  If you'd rather have a thoughtful, suspenseful, SCARY fast zombie movie, get 28 Days Later.  If you'd like to see a real zombie apocalypse, read the amazing book.
0321701763|5.0|Excellent examples with clear descriptions of &#34;how to&#34;. I've used these books before and found them to be perfect for &#34;self-study&#34;.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Truly a great read.  At one point, in my head, I compared it to a futuristic Indiana Jones ( not the crystal skull crap ).  A treasure hunt with an awesome but certainly not perfect protagonist, memorable allies you want to see succeed as much as the hero, and a ruthless unforgiving villain you need to see stopped.  And it was nice to see a strong female character.  No damsels in distress to get the eyes rolling in this one, just real people with real insecurities.<br /><br />Read it, it's worth it.

Also, I expected to brouse the web with my chrome brouser, but it does't work that way. If you don't do Netflix, youtube, or buy google movies then your out of luck. Just not any use to me. Will probably send back.

B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The quality and ease of use was fantastic. The price was reasonable . I also received a coupon for a future purchase. Thanks Amazon
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|This first season of Orphan Black is so engaging, that I ended up watching the whole 10 episodes in one day.  Like a good book, I just couldn't put it down.  This series with the character development and the ever widening plot is one of the best shows I've seen in years.  Tatiana Maslany is simply brilliant in her role(s).  The casting overall has been perfect.  I don't want to say to much, if anything, about the plot because it's important you discover it yourself as each episode unfolds.  Simply put, watch it.  You will not be disappointed.
B00AFEXRME|2.0|If you saw Nicolas Cage in \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" then you know the premise of \\"Flight.\\" Alcohol abuse is deadly. This movie is nothing more than Denzel Washington taking his turn as an alcoholic. Lots of drug use, foul language, and depressing spiral down into the gutter. Denzel did not need to make this movie...he's better than this.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|No character development, cheesy CGI, absurd plot lines, and only mildly entertaining. I'm not sure it's worth the $5, might want to wait for HBO/Cinemax etc to watch this one...or you could just skip it and go on living your life.
B004GYY714|5.0|I really love the tune in radio.  It picks up the station that I like and streams it well.  Highly recommended.
1400069807|5.0|Great expose of how they have us addicted to the foods we love. Just reading it changed my eating habits to healthier ones. I can still enjoy the addictive foods, but I am in control now, not the moguls.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This product works like a dream it turns my iPod classic into a blue tooth device with no problems and submits a strong signal to my blue tooth headphones and my Logitech blue tooth receiver to my home and work stereo with no problems. The only thing that may occur is that you have to reset your iPod once in a while if it does not connect to your devices once in a while. That's nothing in my book. I highly recommend this product.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the show. Interesting storylines and the show moves fairly fast. I really got into liking the characters in this show.
0393324818|5.0|After seeing the movie, I picked this up at the airport since the movie was somewhat intriguing and heard great things about the book. I got through a few chapters on the plane, and ended up finishing it on vacation, and I rarely read for pleasure. If you are into baseball or even just the art of winning, this book is for you.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Exceptional read and very practical!<br />Take the challenges and be inspired. Mind blowing results if you believe. My partner and I are converted!  :-)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger games was inspiring and positively thrilling. I couldn't stop reading and I have this unbearable urge to move on to the next installation. Part of me fears that our civilization will end up like it did in the book. I also fear how dependent I am on the accessibility of food, water and warmth.<br />Katniss made me want to fight, to be self-sustaining. The Hunger Games is unique and not something I will easily forget.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very clear.  I tried the low carb diet.  Surprisingly easy to follow, rarely if ever hungry.  Down 8 pounds in first 2 weeks!  Keep up the good work.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I don't understand what all the excitement about this book was. It just reminded me of a little more risqué harlequin romance novel-nothing more. It was a tad boring for my taste-a good story is more than just explicit sex. It should have an intriguing main storyline, more description of a lush lifestyle. This book did not transport me to another world...I'm disappointed :(
1451626096|5.0|I've read several of Ms. Gregory's other books about the women behind the kings.  I thoroughly enjoy her writing and will continue reading through the series of books.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Love these types of books! Fast paced and interesting. A fascinating take on the supernatural mixed in with teenage love stuff.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|This set of discs provided three evenings of entertainment.  Being a 30 year Eagles fan, I enjoyed it from start to finish.  It was interesting how much I learned, including the Jackson Brown connection.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|So the story and effects are pretty good and it definitely kept me interested. I'm just a bit disappointed in the title. The movie, as many have argued, has little reflection on the book. Usually I am not one to take notice as I do not read often, but in this case the book was so thrilling and creative that I must express my disappointment. A few key features translated into the film, but not nearly enough to warrant a movie by the same title as the text. Go see it as a regular zombie movie and you will be pleased. Go see it as a big screen version of the book and prepare for a let down. All things considered, I liked it.
B00278U1W0|5.0|These guys did not have to enlist 3 backup singers and two keyboard players to hide their voices.  This is an excellent performance by genuine musicians who are aging well and still must practice regularly.  Anyone that appreciates Traffic, Blind Faith, Cream, etc. will enjoy this video.  It will be a regular viewing.
B00F8L2VO4|3.0|I am hearing impaired and base this review on what I experienced. Others may give it a higher rating.I started off with the basics but had trouble hearing the Spanish since it was so quickly spoken. I am also using ear buds. I had to repeat Spanish pronunciations several times and then gave up on some. Then I came to the speaking part for me to speak a Spanish phrase but the Kindle does not have a speaker or am I missing something?
B002RVZV9U|3.0|Of the last ten videos I bought, this was probably the weakest.  It was sort of interesting, but too repetitive.  The template for each scene became obvious.  There was too little music and too much talking.  I will watch it again, but it's not likely to become a regular viewing.
1480513156|5.0|I've become a Dean Koontz fan and his audio books.  This selection was suspenseful right to the end.  I'm always looking for books I've not listened to.  If you are a Koontz fan, enjoyment is waiting for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love. to play games at night to try to relax. fun game. easy enough to not drive you insane but does keep you thinking
B008K5T5AI|2.0|This damned book took me eleven months to read.  There are so many reviews for it, I'm only really writing this to satisfy my good record so far, of reviewing all the books I have read.  It's the first time I've read one of Iain (M) Banks' books and not thought highly of it.<br /><br />I can take less care of this review, as I'll be surprised if anyone actually finds it, so it's more for my own future retrospective benefit, perhaps to remind my future self not to re-read it, or perhaps to challenge that same self to definitely re-read it, and see if I can enjoy it the second time round.<br /><br />One thing is for sure.  I definitely feel that I have let myself down in not enjoying it. How can it be?  What did I do wrong?<br /><br />What worked against me?<br /><br />It was a hardback, and so, didn't fit in my bag, which meant it was tricky to read on the train to work.<br />I took it on holiday, and was constantly being interrupted by my nephews, who didn't understand how hilarious Culture minds are, and just wanted me to jump into the pool with them.<br />I took it on holiday, and drank too much beer in the sunshine.<br />I have been quite stressed over the last year, and so my concentration wandered a lot.<br /><br />What might have been wrong with the book?<br /><br />For me, the amount of reveal at the beginning was disproportionate to the reveal at the climax. There seemed to be very little development after the first couple of chapters.  One of the major concepts of interest was Subliming, the character that could shed some light on that, couldn't talk about it.  Perhaps there are reasons for that, like for instance, wanting to keep the mystery alive, but then, you might be in a tricky situation as an author, because you are focusing on something that you don't think you should reveal detail on.  There were good bits, lots of extremely funny dialogue, but lots and lots of boring stuff, and boring characters.<br /><br />Vyr, and her cat.  So boring.  In fact,the Gzilt characters were all a bit boring.<br />The penis guy.  Grotesque, but quite dull.<br />Some drones. Who remembers their names or what ships they belong to? Or if they were drones or avatars.<br />Some other aliens that were quite strange, some of them dancers, but ultimately uninteresting.<br />An old guy with nothing particularly interesting to reveal.<br /><br />So that's my review.  Disappointing.  But, everyone has an off day, and it's a very bitter fact that I will never have the pleasure of reading a new Culture novel.  They are by far (actually, only by a slim margin, as Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space novels are also extremely good), in my subjective experience, the greatest and distinctively amusing collection of novels I have ever read.
B001HZK8FY|4.0|It's fairly obvious who ends up with whom by the end of this film.  But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the journey.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams play a sort-of modern pair of star-crossed lovers (seriously, all you need is some warring families and a few suicides and you've got Shakespeare...well, that and some poetic lines.)  McAdams is the darling of this film and fully deserves to keep this film on her resume for years to come.  Mr. Gosling wouldn't consider his character loveable, but some people in the audience might (take a guess which demographic that will be.)  It's no wonder their combined was widely praised and nominated for all kinds of awards...I was rooting for them.  As I said, it's a fairly predictible love story between two people of different social classes whose love (sometimes) means everything to them.  Nevertheless, it's still worth watching...preferably with a loved one of your own.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I was hoping I would get a game I could play without having a 30second commercial every couple of minutes and if i don't want commercials I have to pay for coins. That is not free. It is a misrepresentation. I'm very disappointed.
B0030GCZM2|4.0|I cannot imagine losing a loved one to murder, especially the brutal murders commited within the first minutes of this film.  I find myself wondering if I too would go to extreme lengths to get revenge on the killers and the system that let me down.  Perhaps that is what makes this an above-average thriller and why we can so easily sympathise with Gerard Butler despite what he's done.  That's not to say that Jamie Fox isn't sympathetic...after all, he's a prosicutor \\"(the \\"good guy\\".)  This film serves to remind us that there are indeed flaws in our criminal justice system...but is murder and torture really the way to solve them.  Perhaps Jamie Fox best serves to remind us that:  yes, there are flaws (for example, plea bargins are quite common) but if you try to get revenge your own way, that system will turn on you.  As clever and determined as Gerard Butler may be, Jamie Fox shows us that he will not give up despite the dangers posed to him and those around him.  Again, this is a decent film and you can watch it without seeing too many cliches.  I advise you to enjoy it...that is certainly possible.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Even if you have watched the show, a interesting and fun read. If you hurry and get it, you can catch up and pass the show :)
B000R4SMD6|4.0|First off, the combination of Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling was not one that I could have ever envisioned.  But it's Hollywood...they can do whatever they want.  And in this case, it's the audience who got a good deal out of it.  In this film, Sir Anthony Hopkins plays an engineer who is highly intelligent, reads other people quite accurately, and then acts accordingly...huh, where have we seen this before?  Relax, he's no Hannibal Lector.  While he does have no problem with shooting people, I doubt that Mr. Hopkins would cross the line into caniblism this time.  Rather, he is just a guy looking to get away with his crime by playing mind games on Ryan Gosling.  Thankfully, Mr. Gosling shows us that he's no moron and won't go down without a fight.  The interaction and antagnonism between these two men is the gem of this film.  The acting is superb and it shows the most during Anthony Hopkins's early tries at being a pro-cee lidigator...granted, it takes the entire cast to make that work, but Mr. Hopkins shines.  If you like any type of legal thriller, this film is definetely worth adding to your collection...it'll make you think about that phrase often used about self-representation:  \\"He who defends himself has a fool for a client.\\"  Enjoy.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A little awkward because the first half of the book is occurring at the same time as the last half of book 4...need to kind of set your mindset backwards a bit. Makes a lot of sense once it catches up.
B00DB97LU4|4.0|This is the first time that I have all the Star Trek movies. I haven't watched every one of them yet in this set. However, I did watch one of the bonus DVDs in it which entails Whoopi Goldberg interviewing Jonathan Frakes, Patrick Stewart, Leonard Nimoy, and William Shatner and that was very interesting. Whoopi Goldberg revealed why she was so interested in being a part of Star Trek. She shared a very interesting story about that.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Amazing the story's are really the sadness the loss the heroism just completely amazing really really really really good book
B000HL0EEE|5.0|I have been re-watching the Star Trek Enterprise episodes and have been enjoying it very much. Scott Bakula does a wonderful job playing Captain Archer whose starship is the the first of the Federation to explore space. Chronologically, this story takes place before the stories of Captain Kirk.
B00EU98VVC|5.0|I have always loved Tyr, and I've been anticipating this album since they announced the release date.  Needless to say, it did NOT disappoint!  It's the only music I've listened to for a week straight...still loving it!
0857208748|5.0|I always enjoy Mitch Rapp.  I'm looking forward to the next, and unfortunately last, in the series.  Who could possibly take his place?!
B0040I09RM|5.0|The great feature about watching this on the Kindle, is when you are finished with an episode, you can click on next episode with having to get out of the program and then back in.  Really liked that feature.
1450419895|5.0|I think this book is a must to everyone who want to lift, get bigger and more importantly, know what you´re really doing at the gym and don´t get injure or something, it gives you the basis to start knowing about bodybuilding and exercises, very illustrative and informative.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|A gripping extension to Matched! The need to know more about the existing characters from book 1 and their shared story had me racing through the opening chapters. With the introduction to knew characters, their back stories & the mysterious Rising, I have high hopes for book 3 and the changes within each story!
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I played this a few times and then it just stopped opening up.  Unable to use it, doesn't work right
B001O5LVPI|4.0|Love this movie defently a sure to be classic . Great story behind it also . &#34;Ohana means family and no one gets left behind .&#34;

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Even if we already know that our thoughts create our reality, there is something so great when we can prove it. It reminds us how powerful we are. The experiments have had me tap back into myself and be more conscious. Something to be reminded of.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|My kinda movie. I love action movies and i love brad pitt, what more could you ask for. Would like to have known how the &#34;virus&#34; started.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|and this is a great way for them to work their neuro paths and have fun and enjoy virtual puzzels
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|For those who have read the Law of Attraction books or watched the DVDs, this book is the next logical step in that philosophy.  Pam Grout challenges the universe to prove that the Law of Attraction actually works.  I tried some of the experiments - actually, I played around to see just how well they worked.  A half-hearted intention got half-hearted response.  Full focus got full focused response.  Specifically,  I wasn't fully focused on the first experiment (The Dude Abides).  I didn't get a special &#34;thing&#34; from the Universe, but I have been getting a slew of green lights any time I'm out driving around.  I wasn't able to manifest a new car (okay, I was half-hearted on this one, too), but my attention was very much focused on attracting a bright shiny new job and I got that one!  I would advise the reader to keep an open mind, play with the principles in this book, and see how they work.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|From Interscope Records:<br /><br />Interscope Records would like to make consumers of Madonna's MDNA World Tour Blu-ray disc aware that the concert will be seen at its most optimal quality by properly adjusting the settings on your television to \\"Normal/Movie\\" mode rather than \\"Dynamic/Enhanced\\" mode.<br /><br />Older Blu-ray players or those without a firmware upgrade may experience glitches when navigating the Blu-ray menu.

No other markets will be affected.<br />We apologize for this inconvenience.
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|It's Fahrenheit 451 re-hashed. The acting is laughable, but appropriate to the writing. Nothing great; but it's a decent movie to have on as background noise or to talk about with friends (either MST3K it up, discuss how it could have been made better, go off on philosophical topics it touches on, or whatever).
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This is a great and thrilling joyride. Perfect for anyone who enjoys espionage mixed in with conspiracy theories. I hope they make this into a movie.
B000FC12SM|5.0|I have heard about this book forever, but never realized that it would hold so many explanations as to how the genders interpret things differently. I guess the tongue in cheek title just made me assume that it was more of a comical comparison and contrast of the the two &#34;species&#34;, rather than a serious self help book. Being the Mr Fix it that I am, I have always had a tendency to try to &#34;fix&#34; the problem, never realizing that by doing so, I would only set myself up to get into an argument...and end up bewildered at how I could go from hero to zero without even criticizing the other person. If you find yourself at odds with your partner, but can't understand why, perhaps this book can help open your eyes as to what is going on.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Nice focus on a rising star who performed well in ER, but now shows the best of her abilities in a well written, and wisely achieved serie
B000FC130E|4.0|Fun quick read. Will definitely have to read some of his other books :)<br />Six more words are required. Dumb
B00BETX5PS|1.0|The best thing about this movie is that we did not get stuck with the higher price at a theater.  Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, or even a Roger Moore or a Pierce Brosnan. A ridiculous plot and a waste of some good acting talent. I never adequately recognized the talent of Ian Fleming until I saw this absurdity. I am glad that I have missed most of the post-Fleming films.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very addictive and I loved it so much that I re-installed the game over again. It's a very good past time when there's nothing to do. Try it, you will love it just like I do.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I suspect we'll see good things from Gillian Flynn down the road, as there are things that I liked a lot about her writing. The character of Nick was consistent for the most part but Amy was not. I didn't believe her as a character and certainly didn't believe she'd go in the directions that she eventually did. I just feel like the storytelling didn't support Amy's actions.<br /><br />Flynn credits her husband for putting up with what she calls inappropriate questions about being male. She really listened to him. As a man, I believed Nick's behavior.<br /><br />There were times when I just had to skip huge chunks because they seemed unnecessary. Other parts were pretty predictable. But for her third venture into fiction, the book was entertaining. I was, however, very disappointed in the climax.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It took almost 1/2 hour to download, then kept locking up both my Kindle Fire HD and my phone. After playing around with it for half the day, I deleted it from both.
B00BSBUZPK|3.0|Don't let anybody kid you,this is in fact the history of the band according to Don and Glenn. Is anybody stupid enough to believe that Randy quit because he didn't want to sing Take It To The Limit? Also,Fingers and the Gods aren't allowed to talk about the issues surrounding the lawsuit. If they ever come out with an updated one that features the full interviews that will be the one to buy. But until then...
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Nice competition and team management system. We need to adjust the ease in how and when the STARS are used,there has been too many times we have used and not intended during collection process. I have lost at least 50+ just trying to collect. Cool game for change of pace!!
B005MVLI8A|5.0|Go look on a shelf that contains the iconic albums of all time.  A few titles away from Abbey Road, you will find Nirvana's Nevermind.  One of the 4 bands that literally changed music overnight in the early 90's.  What do we need in this day and age of the inane talentless garbage so deftly marketed to the young and uninformed?  We need another Nirvana!  If you are reading this and you have kids - do them a favor.  Show them the Beatles. Show them  Nirvana.  Show them real music, that was created by people with real talent.  Do it.  Do it NOW!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|One of those shows that you can't wait to see the next episode. Viewer has to pay attention so you catch every detail. Claire Daines and Damion Lewis are superb.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|Rick Riordian has managed to combine greek mythology and modern technology (that's not meant to rhyme) to make this amazing book. Some say it's a Harry Potter clone. Well, answer this. Does camp Half Blood have any teachers who hate Percy, like Snape hates Harry?
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game in the United states of freaking America and other places! And I totally recommend u 2 buy dis app
B00631HASU|5.0|This is a great game.  I always enjoyed playing Zuma on the computer and now I can play Sparkle on my Kindle Fire.  They are pretty much alike.  You have a chain of marbles creeping toward you and you have to shoot marbles at it and make combinations of 3 of the same color to make them pop.  You have to get rid of all the marbles before they reach you.  Lots of fun and easy to do a game or two here or there if you have extra time to kill.  I would recommend this game.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Every single song is amazing. I want to see her live in Michigan. Hopefully one day she will come here. Thank you.
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|This is a great hidden object game.  I like that fact that for each scene, you play it 3 times and you have 3 choices each time of how you want to get your hints. Some of the choices are:  classic (shows you the item), silhouette, words, backwards words, scrambled words, or spot the differences and more.  I would recommend this game.
B008BM9L72|5.0|one of the best book I have ever read and its my top five book, excellent ,can wait until author write another book
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|really awesome. like temple run but x 1000000 better. I love playing with the minions at the beach. el machos lair. the lab. and home area
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Wonderful show! Just watched all three seasons in a row, and can not wait until Season 4 begins!!! Was very upset that Matthew was killed off, and so soon after Mary had the baby, but it was very real as well.  Too often tragedy strikes, in some of the most happiest of moments.  I will be tuning in in January.
B000OLRH10|5.0|I had already seen this movie when I bought it to watch with my fiancee.  I knew what I was getting and was happy with the streaming quality.  No complaints
B003XT603Q|5.0|a haunting powerful quiet novel which illustrates the interrelationship between life and death, love and passion, that shadows and illuminates our lives.
B007HVBW2A|3.0|Had I watched this when it first came out, it probably would have freaked me out.  Now I can watch it and even laugh at parts of it.  Probably will watch it again around Halloween.
B000SCHBGQ|3.0|As I first began reading this book I was worried because it was started off very slow. But it got better and turned into a wonderful book.
B003TTCURU|5.0|Awesome series, one that you can easily fall in love with. This is my second time watching this show from beginning to Season 7.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|love it so much fun if I were u I would get this game and play it every day of my life
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Could not put this down.  I have read many great stories by very talented authors in my 60 years and this is among the best. Mr. Howey, thank-you for many enjoyable hours immersed in this world you have created.  I am looking so forward to reading the next one in the series. In fact,  I am purchasing the next one immediately, hope you keep writing!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was a great fantasy and very well written. It was also really fun to read all the 80's references. Great book!
B00BWWS81S|4.0|Soft, smooth, melodic.  Much nicer than the so called &#34;critics&#34; gave her credit for.  She has a beautiful voice.  It works!  Very different from &#34;Eye to the Telescope&#34; but worth it.
B00007KQKM|5.0|Thought it was a tv series.  Turned out to be a B B C mini series.  Still a good story.
1250029465|5.0|Just loved reading this true story about Bob and his owner. Can't wait to read more about Bob.  Passing it on to another cat lover.
B000ASATZ8|3.0|Ordered so my mother could watch.  Exactly as I remembered.  First movie was funny. Second was ok.  Not crazy about the rest.  I think they could have stopped at two.  But my mother loved all four.  She said they were very funny and she enjoyed them.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this book! An original idea that kept me turning pages! I'm very interested in finding out what's next for the silo.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have read many books on this subject, watched movies and talked to people about the concepts that Pam Grout has in this book.  E Squared is by far the most informative and concise book that I have read so far on the subject.  The experiments work and it has literally changed my life and world.  I have bought 4 copies to give away and plan on buying more.  Wonderful.  Believe is the most powerful word in the world ~
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Simple well written, inspiring and connects to your heart. Adam is the epitome of humanity and what it means to be human and follow Christ. It's hard work and filled with discipline and yet Adam found joy in it all. Truly amazing individual and amazing family. The book is simply fun, engaging, awesome to read. I can almost imagine what Adam was going through in his mind.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I didn't realize it came in such a nice presentation! Like a book! Brand new, can't wait to re- watch this series! I loved it!
B00AXVZXBC|1.0|This has nothing to do with the show as I am a fan but I'm upset that Amazon Prime is charging for this when it's free tv.  Prime is not a free service and free tv should be free with Prime membership.  My son has Netflix and gets to view this show for free.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I love the raw and frustrating story of toenails lost, and joy that makes this book real and fun, exquisite
B005QYKE2Y|1.0|So, like all action comic movie this one is full of impossible explosions and scenarios.  But, that's why the ham and eggers of the fly over states love these things.  That said,  in the original Transformers, Optimus Prime was always unshakably true and just.  The standard archetypal father figure that would not waiver.  However at the end of this movie,  I'll be it not easy to understand in all the noise.  Megatron asks Prime for a truce and then Prime promptly kills him.  Then proceeds to execute a wounded character begging for his life.  This is pretty dark for a Transformers story line.  Death and dismemberment of humans and robots aside in this movie (collateral damage you'd expect to see).  The standard ending is to capture the bad guys and in the next episode the bad guys escape.  Prime would have stood justified over his defeated enemy and that would have been the end of it.  And to clarify I like dark movies and good guys turned bad films. But, this just doesn't do a childhood hero right.  Doesn't matter, I suppose this will be the end of Transformers anyway.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Only complaint I have is that since I have the pro version, i wouldn't have to deal with the pop-up asking to download the font package. Yeah I can check &quot;don't ask this again&quot; but it's still an annoyance.<br /><br />Since I'm on the subject of fonts (and since I don't have to purchase the package), why can't I use fonts I have installed on my device with the pro version?

B001GUXJQA|5.0|Connelly gives his hero a new platform from which to spring into another case. This time it is crooked cops, a hot blooded woman and a comely widow that gives spice to this episode. Well presented, amusing and thrilling. Another fine read.

B0038NN3B4|4.0|Atkins hits the nail on the head when it comes to a way of eating for life. If you think about it, it's also quite simple; meat, vegetables and healthy fats will supply you with everything you need to lose weight and keep it off.

B008PZ69T8|1.0|It has been said by others, I highly doubt James truly listened to this music while writing such 'literature'. I have nothing against the books, they are not my taste, but this music being paired with such a book is sad. I would much rather see this appreciated for the composers. That being said, I will give it one star out of the fact that maybe someone will enjoy this music while not reading vulgar sexual acts.
B0083Z614S|5.0|LOVED this book,such an inspiration. Just don't understand how a father could not want to get to know his child he had to the woman he loved so much.

B007SGM084|4.0|So I read this by request of my co workers that were raving about it.  It was good and exciting for sure.  I'm not sure how they will be able to keep it clean enough for the movie as it does contain a lot of sexual content.  But yes a good read..

B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|House of Cards is such a well written, well directed, and well acted series showing the double dealing, back stabbing, power hungry, manipulators,con men and women, and political narcissists, that is mirrored after our federal government. So well acted by Kevin Spacey that you begin to believe he really is the person he's playing. This series shows Washington at its worst,the underbelly of what we rarely see. This first season shows Spacey playing the majority whip in the House of Representatives,and his wife as a so-called leader of a charitable organization both screwing literally and figuratively to get what they want. That's not all they are capable of, doing, as you'll see, in this spellbinding tale as season one unfolds. Frank Underwood[Kevin Spacey] is almost likeable at times and as smart as they come. The supporting cast is very good Robin Wright is outstanding as his  tall, beautiful, proud and cunning wife. Her character should,but doesn't come off as a person to despise,she has her vulnerable side, which can be very deceiving. This series is not a story necessarily of all politicians being bad or corrupt,but it does show a side that probably does exist.Again,a masterful performance by Kevin Spacey, this is not just your run of the mill program of power hungry politicians but much more and in much more detail. Highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I have asked for help from customer support repeatedly for 3+ weeks. My inbox will not open. That means I cannot access gifts from friends.

1442359315|4.0|Dr Alexander's experience stands out in that he was a scientific skeptic of the NDE phenomenon and dismissed NDEs as purely biologic in origin. The word &#34;Proof&#34; in the title however is proof to Dr Alexander, he being the one who had the experience; for the reader it is a strong &#34;testament&#34; to maintaining individual identity and continuity of mortal relationships in the great beyond, and that the evils of the present world are swallowed up in an enormity of goodness beyond mortal description. However for the reader, it is not likely that reading about NDEs will translate into a truly moving, soul- changing, &#34;born-again&#34; type of spiritual experience, as it typically is with those who live the experience. It is clear from this and other writings that experiencing Divinity is a spiritual experience and not just a mental exercise or study, and can only be understood by spiritual means. I would recommend the reader become immersed in God's established Word and LIVE the Word sincerely to approach a mortal spiritual experience; then Dr Alexander's experience and that of many others can be comprehended much more intimately than words on a page.

0670026638|5.0|I loved everything about this book except the very beginning and some aspects of the way it ended. So 4.7, 4.8 stars, something like that? But thirty minutes after closing the cover, I am still in a state of euphoria, feeling good about the world, and very happy to have read what is surely one of the most brilliant, original, and daring novels of the year. So what if Ozeki's reach slightly exceeds her grasp? The themes she addresses are valuable historically, politically, and philosophically, and she has found a most engaging way to approach them.<br /><br />\\"Hi! My name is Nao, and I am a time being.\\" A bit cute for an opening, and the junior-high jokiness of a bright Japanese teenager writing in her diary with a purple pen threatens to get old quickly. Only it doesn't. Naoko Yasutani, to give her her full name, is interesting in herself and even more interesting for what she sets in motion. Raised in Silicon Valley, she had to return to Tokyo when her programmer father lost his job in the dot-com crash, and now finds herself lost in a dysfunctional family and horrendously bullied at school. But there are larger horizons. A time being, she says, is someone who lives in time, and her story moves intriguingly forward and back, ultimately to before World War II, when her great-grandmother, now a very old Buddhist nun, was a pioneering feminist writer, and gave birth to a son who died as a kamikaze pilot in 1945. The story that Naoko tells is in part a history of the Japanese psyche over the past sixty years.<br /><br />Ozeki herself also appears in the novel -- or rather a character named Ruth, also a writer, also Japanese-American, also living on an island in British Columbia; several of the other names mentioned in passing are also real. One day after a storm, Ruth finds a Hello Kitty lunchbox washed up in a sealed freezer bag, containing the very diary that Naoko was writing in the first chapter. She determines to read it slowly, a little at a time, keeping pace with the Japanese girl's life as she must have lived it. From then on, the two stories are connected, as Nao's life, despite some wonderful interactions with her great-grandmother, goes from bad to worse, and Ruth tries desperately to find out more about this girl from across the ocean. Adding to the sense of impending tragedy are suggestions that Naoko may have been a victim of the 2011 tsunami.<br /><br />This is truly a novel of the North Pacific Rim. But it is one that makes the ocean seem very small. Ruth's husband, Oliver, is both an artist and an ecologist, and in the early part of the book there is a lot about ocean currents, the migration of species over centuries and millennia, and the degradation of the ocean now. Later on, Ozeki, sometimes with Oliver as a mouthpiece, draws some fascinating parallels between Buddhist philosophy and quantum mechanics, backing them up with explanations in various appendices that I actually managed to understand. Later still, the connections between Canada and Japan involved magical elements such as dreams and time-travel which I found hard to accept. But I was interested in the idea that, just as Naoko was writing her diary for the one person who would eventually find it, so Ruth, the professional author, was simultaneously writing the continuing story of Nao and the Yasutani family, and guiding it towards a conclusion that is not depressing at all. A bit like that Escher engraving of a hand drawing a hand drawing a hand. I have always found the circularity of that fascinating as an idea. What Ozeki does, though, is to fill it out with characters who are alive or hurting, funny or sad, foolish or wise, and always very real -- and that is quite an achievement.th the Japanese girl's life as she must have lived it.

B005DESVPO|4.0|Really great music.  Sounds like it comes from several different eras.  The singing and instrumentals are super.  Kind of a throwback to earlier periods.
B003KJF2WE|3.0|Decent movie. Better than the Eric Bana one for sure. Fits in well with pre avengers movies. Glad I rented. Not one I want to watch over and over.
B0096PAA6E|4.0|A short EP album.  Pretty good songs.  Had I realized its brevity, I probably would have spent the money on another album.  Still a good deal for a small price.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved this cute little movie. We watched with our 8 grandchildren. They are 2-14 and everyone just sat there and enjoyed it!

B00F91RYL8|3.0|The characters were fast moving and so was the movie. It no doubt had something to say but what it was did not enlighten me.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Simple format and graphics. Game has a shuffle option for when you run out of matches. No more frustration when you nearly finish a puzzle.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I purchased this as a birthday gift for a little fellow who loved JungleBook but didn't have his own.  He LOVES IT!
034580404X|5.0|OMG these books were simply marvelous.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I love good trashy stuff to hold my attention and it did that w/out a doubt.
B008PZZYB2|1.0|Absolute 1.5 hours waste of time that you will never get back.  Pathetic story line.  The acting was also horrible.
B00C5R8364|4.0|Would love to see this made into a movie.  The tracker could use more character development, rather wooden.  Fast-paced plot.
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Just right to stimulate your brain without getting frustrated! Some escape games require too much brain power and way too much thought, but this one moves along with just enough to stimulate the brain.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|the cheap imitations are not worth it; this cable is strong, durable and works great.  I have ordered more--caught this one for $5 which was an especially good deal
B009LDD54K|5.0|I am enjoying watching season three, I like the stories and characters.  The action moves along very quickly, hope there will be a season four.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I read so many reviews, negative, positive,etc.  After talking with several xbox friends I decided to order it.  It is very sensitive, you can hear everything.  Usually can only wear it for a few hrs, after that it makes my ears hurt.  I felt it was pricey.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I got it the day it came out and I love it<br />You must buy it it's worth the dollar
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Very informative, succinct, interesting stories I probably wouldn't know otherwise.  Goes the gamut of news of all types and general items in the world.

B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|This albun is spectacular, there are no words to describe how Amazing Anna Netrebko is, her voice is, as always out of this world, the repertoire that she choose was precise, clear  of how have she is getting mature and so it is  her répertoire . AMAIZING CD
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I choose 4 stars as I really enjoyed the novel, but was not as blown away as with his other two books (Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns).<br />I enjoyed the different characters and the way the novel flowed from one character and time period to another. It was very fluid and as always Khaled Hosseini writes masterfully.<br />Definitely worth the read!
B000088SYA|5.0|awesome album! my favorite song is'' be good johnny''and ''the untouchables '' is a  great song too. great memories of the 80s....
B008M7BQHE|5.0|It is great has good maybe better than X-Files.  Sorry that is no longer on the air.  I need new episodes.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I'm only now watching this series ..... It is very compelling and the characters really pull you in great cast!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The only reason I got book 2 was because the author ( very cleverly ) didn't give an ending to book one.<br />There was allot more of a storyline in Darker so was glad I purchased it. I have to say I liked the book but didn't love it.<br />Darker did explain allot more about Mr Gray but had almost as much sex as the 1st book.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|The original tunes here (Walk Us Uptown, Sugar Won't Work, The Puppet Has Cut His Strings, and several more) are stunning, as you would expect.  My problem is with the songs that simply set Old EC lyrics to new beats (Refuse to Be Saved, Wake Me Up, She Might Be A Grenade, etc.).  These pieces just don't work for me, and EC sounds a tad silly singing them, truth be told....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read a lot of negative reviews about this book and I'm just wondering if those reviewers realize that this book is fictional.  There is some repetition.  She does give voice to her conscience.  Her inner goddess acted as the devil sitting on her shoulder and her conscience was the angel sitting on the opposite shoulder.  Is that different?  Sure.  Does different mean bad?  No, not necessarily.  It is perfectly written?  No.  For me, that doesn't take away from the story.<br /><br />I liked the story.  It was a good fantasy.  It made me laugh.  It made me angry.  It made me cry.  At times, it made me randy.  I'm always interested in a book that can generate the gamut of emotions.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I can't wait for the album to be released!  She's keeping us all in suspense!  The video is great too!  Go Gaga go!
B00CRW2066|5.0|This is a great production from start to end, reminds me of those great records in the past that you not only wanted to listen to one song but to the whole album all at once.
B005WBBYXO|4.0|I love fantasy books and science fictions.. that´s why this is a great book for all ages! I hope the others readers enjoy it!
B00F1BFRA6|4.0|I love this series. My dad bought it for my mom, which I was surprised since my mom doesnt usually like to watch this type of entertainment. When Season 2 came out, I bought it right away and then when season 3 came out, I also bought it right away.. each time making it a marathon of watching all of it in one big huge Downton Abbey weekend. I am dissapointed that the pre-sale price for this upcoming season has increased so much. WHY SO EXPENSIVE??? Looks like unless they bring it back down, I wont be watching next season.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Exciting book, typical Dan Brown, action, adventure and history with a little romance. A nice read, I liked it a lot
B009AMANH4|5.0|Loved this movie!  Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed his character very well.  Even if you have no interest in history, I think you will enjoy this movie about one of the best presidents I think we have ever had.
B00DP8XSQ2|1.0|This was not made for simplicity. If you are looking for a simple star viewing app look elsewhere. This is more for people who want to study star locations.
B0081JPTCQ|4.0|HandyNote Pro is very easy to use.  Better than several others with higher price tags mainly due to it's user friendly menus.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game. And has great strategy to all the levels! I would recommend this game to anyone whom likes games likes theses :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's a tough season at Downton.  I won't get into it, but if you think WWI is a shattering experience for the crew at the Abbey, buy your tissues at Costco (err... Amazon Prime...) for Season III.
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|It was a fun movie to watch considering I love the video game series!<br />Halo Rocks!<br />Halo For the Win!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|So here's the thing about Downton Abbey:  Julian Fellowes takes scenarios that anyone who has ever watched Masterpiece Theater has seen before- many, many, many times.  Then, he makes those well worn and familiar archetypes of English life, history, and personality entirely new.  It's as though the audience has no clue that WWI is on the horizon, that it was horrible, that the rigid social classes in England began to break apart.  It's wholly fresh and seemingly uncharted.  And that, my fellow viewers, is genius.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|Fun. Watchable. Predictable. But 220 million? Are you serious?<br /><br />If you love zombie films and want to watch something that is brilliantly conceived, fantasically scary with first rate acting - 28 Days Later is the film to see.<br />While nicely done, one should hope so for the amount of money spent, WW Z is 3rd rate by comparison.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Please don't download this app unless you want hours of addictive entertainment. You play for free and the games are fun and easy to store up cash and bingo chips. The more you win, the more chips you receive on a daily basis. You can play with your Facebook friends and swap items to get closer to your goal. For me, the game is a stress buster! Fun and relaxing before I go to sleep.

0385336691|4.0|...I'm guessing Florida Police Detective's September 15, 2013 review titled \\"IGNORANT NONSENSE!\\" is spot on.  As one of Child's bezillion readers who doesn't know the first thing about how detective work really is done, I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn (as FDP asserts) that Child has no idea what he's talking about.  Judging The Hard way (my first Reacher novel) on entertainment value only, I'd rate it relatively high, though. The writing is hard-boiled here, soft-boiled there.  The characters are cookie-cutter.  The dialog is pretty ho-hum.  And the plot elements are generally way too pat (a lot of unlikely reveals, unlikely coincidences, and unlikely circumstances).  Child is no Graham Greene.  And The Hard Way is no great crime novel.  Credit where it's due though: Child does know how to write a decently paced action-packed story.  The few hours I spent in Reacher's world were pleasurable enough.  Something tells me I'd be more into a movie version of The Hard Way than the book, but the book ain't bad.  If you decide to give it a go, be sure to check any expectations of accuracy or likelihood at the door, and have a big grain of salt at the ready...
B00CATSONE|5.0|Really interesting book about a man well ahead of his time. Good read, very informative, awesome man, brilliant mind. Great on kindle.
0307277887|4.0|I definitely liked this first book, but this is one of those RARE occasions where I've enjoyed the show more than the book! It's still worth reading, but there were some crucial differences between the book and the 1st season of Dexter. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the books because I have heard that after this first novel, the rest go in a completely different direction from the tv series, but are just as good, so we shall see!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|It's one of few free games that give you lots of levels. I really enjoy long hours of playing. Try it you'll love it.
B00C7LB20C|3.0|Typical CIA - oh no you don't exist stuff. Action packed, predicable. Ok for watching at home if you don't expect too much.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Best game ever! Love to play, gets addicting sometimes, but I love it! I like the gem concept and reviving better than the original version, and I play it all the time!
B00C5R8364|4.0|I enjoyed this story as I have all of Forsyth's plots. One of my sons who is on my account is a retired army ranger from the<br />10th Mountain Division. I called him to putit on the top of his list as it would be of special interest to him.

B008R5OKH4|5.0|In the preface to the booklet Patricia Kopatchinskaja provides an insight into her experience of recording these three works with E&ouml;tv&ouml;s and Ensemble Modern: \\"Between heaven and earth, past and future, I sank for a moment into the Hungarian cosmos and sensed whispers, fragments and signs of living and immortal souls. From light and darkness, dream and wakefulness, music burst forth.\\"<br /><br />It's striking how this trio of Hungarian works for violin and orchestra hold together, musical cohesiveness being attained almost in spite of an aurora of sounds which at times defy comprehension. Perhaps the most apparent link is in the Balkan heritage, the folk influences which permeate each work, animating further mysterious and at times wild musical landscapes. Kopatchinskaja herself was brought up in a Moldovan household where the richness of folk music was all around her (her mother was a violinist and her father a cimbalom player), and indeed these performances perhaps owe more to the Transylvanian mountains and meadows than they do to the concert hall.<br /><br />Kopatchinskaja approaches the Bart&oacute;k in the spirit of a gnarled folk-fiddler, albeit with the technique of a virtuoso; her bow alternately inflecting the score with most delicate of gossamer-like whispers contrasted with the coarsest of woody raspings. This is raw and unpolished playing; the traditional salons of the nineteenth century are of another place and another age.<br /><br />In the E&ouml;tv&ouml;s work, a meditation on the tragic Columbia space mission of 2003 in which all seven of the astronauts died, the music seems to reach upwards from the temporal towards the cosmic, the pattern of seven repeating itself throughout the arrangement of the orchestra as well as in the score.<br /><br />The Ligeti inhabits a different sound-world altogether, yet seems to develop some of the themes which have already been established in the first two works. Kopatchinskaja is here required to accompany herself at one point by singing, which in this context seems like a consummation of her desire to inhabit both the inner and outer musical worlds. Her habit of playing barefoot is well known, but her justification for it seems to sum up this album: \\"I have more connection with the earth and with the energy which goes through me to the sky.\\"t by singing, which in this context seems like a consummation of her desire to inhabit both the inner and outer musical worlds. Her habit of playing barefoot is well known, but her justification for it seems to sum up this album: \\"I have more connection with the earth and with the energy which goes through me to the sky.\\"
B00915G6MG|5.0|for all who have enjoyed this series since volume 1 episode 1,you will not be let down.You continually learn more about the lives of the characters as it is interwoven in the episodes.The cast all work together so well,they are like a family..No one  will want to miss season 10.
B00DXPC1U6|3.0|I'm wasn't sure whether Season 6 or Season 8 is the worst Dexter season.  It's pretty close.  But the more I think about it, at least Season 6 had a developed villain and a great ending. This season had a great first five episodes, but went into a non-suspenseful direction, where eventually I just didn't care what happened.  Overall, Dexter should have just ended at the end of Season 7 with Debra killing Dexter instead of LaGuerta (which through some editing could actually be the ending, because they show that alternate Season 7 ending in episode 4).
B00AR3GPHW|5.0|Great book to use with Ks.  One of my all time favorite picture books! I am a K-5 school librarian.

B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Like the person whose name the film is named after \\"Behind the Candelabra\\" is an outstanding and spectacular film that tells the story of Liberace's last ten years of his life.<br /><br /> Completely closeted his entire life as a homosexual it wasn't until after his death from AIDS in 1987 that the fact Liberace(Lee) was a gay man. Many knew but no one discussed Liberace's sexual preference as that was his wish.<br /><br /> This film (based on the Scott Thorson book of the same name) tells of Liberace's love affair and his infatuation with younger men, most notably Scott. The book came out the year after Liberace's death and he was totally left out of Lee's will and Scott wanted to set the story straight and have people know that he was not a gold digger.<br /><br /> The movie (probably one of the finest television films ever made) aired in May, 2013 on HBO. The studio felt audiences would feel the movie was \\"too gay\\" so instead of a theatrical release the movie came to televison in North America, yet was shown in theaters in Europe.<br /><br /> The movie won an outstanding 11 Emmy Awards on September 22, 2013 including wins as Outstanding Movie Made for TV and Outstanding Actor in a film Made for TV for Michael Douglas who played Liberace. The film also won in categories of hair, makeup, casting and directing.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|I was not a fan of SOA five years back I suspect due to commercial interuptions.  I bought the series asa gift for one of my kids and now cant wait for the next season.  Good writing, action, twist in plots; trust no one, not even you mom.
1451648537|5.0|I must say that i saw the recent movie first before i purchased the book and my enthusiasm for reading the book was stronger than watching the movie, which i did enjoy very much. I found the book to be particularly through,informative and insightful. Obviously, the writer did quite an extensive interview with many people who crossed paths at various stages of Mr. Jobs life both personal and professional. I highly recommend this read for anyone wanting to tap into the mind, life and impressions Mr. Jobs left on everyone both personally and globally he touched.
B00DHRLK84|2.0|This was an action pack movie from the beginning till the end, I thought the movie would have had a better ending, it just STOP, terrible way to end a $32.00 movie.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|Finally, we can hear the 'Rock of Ages' concerts clearly after the audio clean up. Rock of Ages always sounded 'muddy' on all of my  audio equipment...even the remastered set. Better yet, one doesn't have to strain to hear Garth Hudson's Lowrey organ. One thing has always puzzled me is why the slower tempos on these tracks?<br />Ah, those soundboard mixes! This includes another live version of 'Get up Jake' a lesser known tune but a long time favorite plus 'Smoke signal' from the Cahoots album. Both sound great and are nearly worth the price of the box set.<br />The packaging may be a bit excessive but since it is 'The Band' all is forgiven. I've read that this is a limited edition package, so Band fans should grab this box set quickly.<br />Lastly, The Band fans should rush to buy 'Another Self Portrait' by Bob Dylan. This set includes Bob Dylan & The Band at the 'Isle of Wight' concert from 1969. The sound here is awesome and shows The Band's greatness behind Dylan.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|I bought these for my sons and I.  We are very hard on our &#34;gear&#34;, always testing it to see how it holds up.  This canteen is awesome.  It's been dropped, kicked, thrown, floated down a river, washed, and generally abused.  It still works and looks like new.  Thanks Bear, and Gerber, this canteen is awesome!
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|The story isn't new but the writing is good and the directing is great.  The actors do a first rate job albeit trying to understand heavy accents.  I highly recommend this series.
B002M9WW30|4.0|This was a gift for someone else. The box looks nice though. I suspect the dvd's are fine, but will have to wait until the recipient lets me know. Personally, I do not like the Rocky series but the person I ordered item for does so I gave it a 4-star for them. The price was fabulous. It was a gold box deal w/free shipping. Love Amazon deals:)
B005H9B44A|4.0|Good story. Enjoyed the plot and storyline. Enjoyed the actors special effects. Would like to see Thor number 2. Hopefully.
B003XURDAY|4.0|good movie beautifully photographed and stunning set designs good acting too.good story but two things could have been better.too many night scenes with rain would like to see some daytime scenes and not enough action to keep you interested but a visual treat all the same.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I have several Mahjong games on my Kindle Fire but this one is by far my favorite.  It has the most options of any of the others.  The one I personally like the most is being able to change the pictures on the tiles.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it is lacking the zoom option, where the tiles enlarge as you delete them.  That would make it a perfect app.  But don't hesitate.  This is well worth your $0.99.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|If I had known this book would leave me with tears streaming down my face, I probably wouldn't have started reading it, but it was worth it!  I loved it.  It's been awhile since I've read a book that I couldn't put down.  I was so engrossed by the characters and what was going to happen that I wanted to keep reading and finish the book.  Even when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it and wondering how it would all play out.  This is the kind of story that will stay with you for a long time.
B000024JHZ|4.0|For  this 2-cd--Jap-Imp Set.  Was  worth  the price.  My girlfriend had wanted  this for awhile.<br />So  it  was  a  good  excuse  to get her  the  re-mastered  edition--without  getting  the<br />box set.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|I am not sure what show the negative reviewers have been watching this season, but the final season of Dexter is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />Why end Dexter the way they did? Read on:<br /><br />The story of Dexter and what makes it so compelling is the journey he has been on. For eight incredible seasons we have witnessed him battle with his 'dark passenger' and watched as the dark passenger's grip weakened over time as Dexter needed less of the justice of the kills Harry and Evelyn built into Dexter as a self regulating 'code' system.<br /><br />When Dexter finally lost that all important last person he cared about (and WOW was that a tearjerker of a scene), going on with a life like everyone else's was no longer an option. Dexter now realized it was NEVER an option. No matter how much he wanted that new life with Hannah and Harrison in Argentina, it was simply impossible now that he had to come to grips with all the people close to him who died because of who he is.<br /><br />Dexter knows that even suicide can never be payment enough for the debt of him being who he is. When Dexter stares into the camera that final time, the absolute emptiness of a soul dead, a being emptied, his life and total existence ended is so much more powerful than anything else they could have come up with. It's now clear that even in spite of his living in the physical sense, he is dead in every way. He cannot have a life. Any life, even as the Dexter we knew before his journey of discovery led him to his ultimate sad fate. Now, if that isn't a proper ending for Dexter, I don't know what is. Saying goodbye to a tv character has never been so gut-wrenchingly sad.<br /><br />In many ways it's justice that some, though they still rooted for him, hoped for and it's a proper philosophical end for him. It was a struggle the whole way, you just knew it wasn't going to be a picture perfect happy ending, and it certainly wasn't going to be a stereotypical Hollywood style ending with his being discovered and brought to justice or killed by those involved with the discovery. The team of writers and producers and everyone involved deserves a high level of praise and respect for everything they have done throughout the series, and yes, that includes the finale. Dexter may very well be the greatest series ever. It opened up a world of emotion for a dark character no one could imagine possible before. The creative team and actors deserve to win every award they are nominated for.<br /><br />As for me, I'm going to plug in season 1, disc 1 into the DVD player and start the journey with Dexter all over again....
B00CMQX84A|5.0|We enjoyed this fun as well as funny movie.  Lighthearted and no need to worry about adult content.  It nice to have wholesome movies like this for children.  After seeing it on Disney Channel, we knew it would be a great addition to our movie collection.
B00138J9HI|5.0|If you're familiar with the early Priest albums, this one is for you.<br />This album showcases the very best tracks from the early albums, and with a top notch performance.<br />A must have for any true Metal connoisseur.

B00E34A9FU|5.0|This show usually tops the favorites list constantly and I've even seen well written articles claiming that this is the best show the band ever did. While I don't think, for me, that any one show can do that. Remember, all those great shows from Europe '72 and the monster Fall tour starting in September. That being said, this show is about as good as it gets in 1972 and that ain't bad! Standout versions of Black-Throated Wind, China Cat Sunflower->I Know You Rider, Playing In The Band, Bird Song, Greatest Story Ever Told, Dark Star->El Paso->Sing Me Back Home make this a \\"MUST OWN\\". The dvd or blu ray contains highlights from the show just like that one that Kesey Productions put out in the late '80's although much more cleaned up here.<br /><br />As far as how this is released, mine is a \\"dead.net exclusive (#331\\") Blu Ray/cd set in a slipcase with s small booklet. I believe that mine has an extra commentary than this version too. However, mine was also more than twice the price as this version so you might want to take that into account too.
B0006B2A42|5.0|I enjoyed this Cold War spy drama. There is some action  but mostly drama and the viewer must pay attention to what is said to not lose the story, which is my favorite type. Great scenes and music. Enjoyable.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|My only complaint is not being able to picture reply!  I would really like if they could do something about that, but otherwise it works nicely.

B00E6890RG|5.0|The number one prog metal album of the year. These men have certainly outdone themselves with this album and it's a wonderful experience listening to this album all the way through. This gives the new Dream Theater album a real run for its money as far as I'm concerned. Brilliant stuff.
B00164CM46|5.0|The late Dennis Farina is terrific in this crime comedy involving jewel thieves, Russian terrorists, gypsies, and English gangsters. It's a challenge to understand the &#34;Pikies&#34; (Roma, or Gypsies), but it's all in good, bloody fun.

0143124544|3.0|It was okay but not the type of book I would choose.  It was a book club selection. Some of the others liked it but not too enthusiastic
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I just give it a four star because of the token option they should at least reload every now and then. Other then that its a very good game
B000SEI230|5.0|I've always been a huge fan of the movie, but I must say the book is even better now that I've read it.

B00280LYIC|5.0|A great story about a boy figuring out his true identity and saving the world with the help of his friends.
B008JFUNTG|5.0|I studied Classical Studies while in college, so the Percy Jackson movies have been a lot of fun to watch to see how author Rick Riordan has morphed the god into modern times. I have not read the books behind the films so I am not able to judge how faithful the adaptation is, but the new Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters is entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />** Spoilers below**<br />Percy has quite a few challenges in this film, chief of which is an identity crisis. Having completed a quest successfully in the first film (Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief) he is finding himself inadequate in competing with other half-bloods, particularly Clarisse, who enjoys taunting him. Along with Percy's self-doubt, he discovers he has a half-brother named Tyson, who is a Cyclops.  Annabeth also has a loathing of Cyclopes', in general, because one killed a half-blood named Thalia, a daughter of Zeus no less. Zeus transformed his daughter into a tree that provides a barrier for Camp Halfblood. However, the tree is poisoned, so a quest is proposed to take the Golden Fleece as it alone can cure Thalia. Percy is not chosen to join the quest (Clarisse wins again) and so sets out with Annabeth, Grover and Tyson (who is reluctantly accepted) to prove that he is not a flash-in-the-plan hero. The quest has many pitfalls and ultimately Percy proves himself, discovers his true abilities and learns much about accepting people for themselves, faults and all.<br /><br />**End Spoilers**<br /><br />There are some very funny moments in the film with mythological characters. The cab ride with the Stygian Witches behind the wheel was great fun as was seeing Stanley Tucci playing Dionysus, who is being punished by Zeus by turning his wine into water. Hermes (played by Nathan Fillion) has his own package delivery business.  The one bizarre element in the film was a group of Confederate soldier zombies that are helping Clarisse. The scene where Percy consults the Oracle of Apollo was effectively spooky. The film is a great adventure for the family, appealing to both adults and children. The special effects are very good and the acting by Logan Lerman (Percy), Alexandra Dadarrio (Annabeth), Brandon T Jackson (Grover) and Douglas Smith (Tyson) is perfect for their characters.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|When you realize there's no rhyme or reason to the tricks, that it's whatever silly stupid CGI they want to throw at you, you realize there's no point to the movie, and that they could keep it going for an hour, two hours, ten hours, or forever. It's like a badly written Saturday morning cartoon show, where the superheroes always get away with the gadget they had hidden in their utility belt.
B0081JAED0|5.0|This is a great return to form for Garbage, and I really, really love it.<br /><br />I got the MP3 download &#34;deluxe version,&#34; but I don't really understand what is &#34;deluxe&#34; about it... because it has all the same songs as the non-deluxe CD and non-deluxe MP3 download of the album.<br /><br />Suffice to say, if you liked the first 2 Garbage albums, as well as Bleed Like Me and the harder rock songs on Beautiful Garbage (such as &#34;Shut Your Mouth,&#34; &#34;Parade&#34;,&#34;Nobody Loves You&#34;, and &#34;Untouchable&#34;), you will like Not Your Kind Of People.<br /><br />Please note: I'm not saying I *don't* like &#34;Androgyny,&#34; &#34;Can't Cry These Tears,&#34; &#34;Cup of Coffee,&#34; or &#34;Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)&#34; off Beautiful Garbage. In fact, &#34;Can't Cry These Tears&#34; and &#34;Cup of Coffee&#34; are probably my favorite songs off that album, after &#34;Shut Your Mouth&#34;: I loved the pop-music-throwback/girl-group/wall-of-sound production values of &#34;Can't Cry These Tears&#34; and I also really loved the eerie and mournful sound of the Theremin used in the downtempo-triphop-chill-ish &#34;Cup of Coffee.&#34;<br /><br />But &#34;Androgyny,&#34; and &#34;Cherry Lips (Go Baby Go)&#34; aren't exactly &#34;Supervixen&#34; or &#34;Only Happy When It Rains,&#34; or &#34;As Heaven As Wide&#34; or &#34;Not My Idea&#34; or &#34;Vow&#34; or &#34;Dog New Tricks.&#34; And they're definitely not &#34;Temptation Waits,&#34; &#34;I Think I'm Paranoid,&#34; &#34;When I Grow Up&#34;, &#34;Special,&#34; &#34;Hammer In My Head,&#34; &#34;Push It,&#34; &#34;Dumb,&#34; or &#34;Wicked Ways.&#34;  And they also don't have the more trip-hoppy feel of &#34;Queer,&#34; &#34;A Stroke of Luck,&#34; &#34;My Lover's Box&#34; or &#34;Milk&#34; (from Garbage's debut) or &#34;Medication,&#34; &#34;The trick is to keep breathing,&#34; and &#34;You look so fine&#34; from Version 2.0. Those two songs don't even have much in common with the hooks and grooves of &#34;Stupid Girl,&#34; which is probably the only real &#34;pop song&#34; on Garbage's debut. But then, Garbage changed the definition of what pop music could be with their debut album -- and that's a good thing as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Anyway, to me, songs like &#34;Androgyny&#34; and &#34;Cherry Lips&#34; were Garbage experimenting with a much more electronic and pop-y sound. They were well done, with the usual catchy hooks, excellent production values, and likeable as stand-alone songs... but as Garbage songs, they reminded me of that game on Sesame Street: &#34;one of these things is not like the others, one of these things just doesn't belong.&#34;<br /><br />I wasn't sorry when Garbage moved on to Bleed Like Me and got back to their usual alternation between hard rocking and trip-hoppy songs, with no more anomalous synth-pop like &#34;Androgyny&#34; or &#34;Cherry Lips.&#34; Granted, to a certain extent, with all their crystal clear production values and the knob-twiddling and fader-pushing that created it, Garbage have always had a sort of synth-pop esthetic -- without the synth pop sound. (I say that being a huge lover of synth-pop and a lifelong fan of Depeche Mode, probably the most successful electronic band of all time.) I always felt Garbage were a grunge-guitars-meets-synth-pop-production-values kind of rock band, and I'm okay with that.<br /><br />All of that having been said: If you like harder rocking Garbage, then Not Your Kind Of People has what you want in spades, starting with &#34;Automatic Systematic Habit,&#34; continuing through &#34;Blood For Poppies,&#34; &#34;Control&#34; (which has a fantastic harmonica riff when the drums and guitar kick in after the quiet intro), &#34;I Hate Love,&#34; &#34;Battle In Me,&#34; &#34;Man on a Wire,&#34; and &#34;The One.&#34;<br /><br />If you like the more ballad-y or trip-hoppy or meditative Garbage, then you get that on Not Your Kind Of People, too, in the following songs: &#34;Not YourKind Of People,&#34; &#34;Felt,&#34; &#34;Sugar,&#34; &#34;Beloved Freak,&#34; &#34;Bright Tonight,&#34; and &#34;Show Me.&#34;<br /><br />And then there's the edgier, wackier song &#34;What Girls Are Made Of&#34; which would normally probably have been a B-side or included on a remix single... but instead is included on both the &#34;deluxe&#34; and non-deluxe versions of the album &#34;Not Your Kind Of People.&#34;<br /><br />A few months after NYKOP came out, I got the chance to see Garbage at a small venue -- the amateur league baseball stadium in their former home town of Madison, WI. They were great, just great, and Shirley was very warm and welcoming to the audience, which seemed to include a lot of old friends and family of theirs. It was an oddly intimate show, despite being in a baseball stadium (and it rained before the show, so I was afraid it would rain the whole time... but it didn't, yay!).<br /><br />I wish I'd seen them during the height of their mad popularity circa Version 2.0 at a huge stadium show. But I've listened to and enjoyed (and brooded to and rewound and replayed) their music for decades now, lamenting their seeming breakup and disappearance. So I was just happy to see them live at all, because I never had.<br /><br />I'm so glad they came out with this album. NYKOP isn't a retread, and it isn't boring. But it isn't an out-of-place, jarring departure from their classic Garbage sound the way &#34;Androgyny&#34; and &#34;Cherry Lips&#34; were, either.<br /><br />It's just a solid Garbage album, pushing them further into the 21st century with a refinement of the catchy hooks they've always had, without sounding like something you've heard from them before. The first listen through, I thought, Wow, this almost sounds like a &#34;long lost&#34; Garbage album... Yet it's too topical and &#34;now&#34; to be that. The new flourishes they've added give it that extra oomph while still telling you: this is a hard-rocking Garbage album, in the classic sense.<br /><br />And there was much rejoicing...!

0345803507|5.0|I received the book very fast.  In time for my vacation.  It was a last minue purchase and it was in great condidtion!
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Been using the free version for years now and was very excited to see the paid version as the FAOTD. I'd recommend the game to any fan of backgammon without reservation. However, I was very disappointed to discover after installing it that my stats from 1000+ games played in the free version weren't imported into the paid version, starting me out at ground zero. I know it seems trivial, but in an app where stats are collected it seems almost a given that the stats should carry over when you like an app enough to pay to move from the free version. I've got enough time invested in the free version that in many ways it seems more attractive to put up with the occasional ad and keep my stats than to start over again ad-free. Gotta knock off a star for this oversight.<br /><br />In all other respects, this is a five-star app. If you're not coming from the free version (or don't mind losing your stats if you are), consider this a five-star review and invest (if you missed getting it as the FAOTD) without reservation.
0224087436|3.0|The book, whilst good, does paint a flattering image of Cixi. She was definately not the instigator of the modernisation of  China. She  did everything to maintain power initially rejecting the advice from the man that tried to modernise China. He was Timothy Richard, who battled with Chinese authorities and a corrupt government[[ASIN:B0085NISF8 Tim China]]His story is contemporary to Cixi and is told in the book \\"Tim China\\". Timothy tried vainly to introduce railways, roads, telegraphs and modern medicine but was thwarted at each stage by Cixi who feared modernisation. She was still a feudal ruler, head of the Qing Dynasty. She only relented when faced with the inevitable desire of the masses for social improvement. They wanted a modern China and not an autocratic ruler who wanted to cut China off from the real world. Timothy Richard's lasting legacy stands in the form of Shansi University - the first western style university in China - still in existence today.day and does not attempt to make amy judgement on the cases
1932100660|5.0|The book was a total eye opener for me, even though I was already on what I thought was a healthy diet.  It is the most comprehensive book on nutrition and the politics surrounding it that I've ever read.
B00FCDPNES|5.0|Here it is: the classic and timeless tale of Dorian Gray as relevant now as when it was first published. Enjoy it with the latest in 21st century technology through the first-class formatting and period illustrations.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I use it to film with my camera and record my voice. Works great. I have recorder well over 10 hours and the battery is still strong. There is no way to tell when the battery goes down. I guess it will stop recording then.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brony daughters, ages 16 and 21, who loved it. I enjoyed it, too.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love the music, songs, energy and uniqueness of the sound! Great CD! Cannot wait for her next one to come out!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was a wonderful read, a page turner and I would recommend it to anyone, especially dog lovers. Humorous throughout with a little sadness.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|beautifully evoked characters, engaging story and the best result - insight into another culture which abides past the end of the book.
B0069UP2PI|5.0|this is a really good movie...i found it more fascinating because i am a nurse and to see this movie and understand the concept of it...WOW...this can happen and thats what is so good about the movie it leads you step by step and then when the end comes you see how all of it started and could be avoided...<br /><br />it was a great movie evn though fiction...i know any one who sees it will like it ...i did...a lot...
B00005JKDR|5.0|everything was just as described and my daughter loved the movie ! we watched it over and over and over again lol
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I loved this book I got all the books on my kindle fire but this one was the second best one in the series
B006TZGVZS|5.0|This was a compelling book that kept me interested til the end.  It was one man's journey through the dying process and it was very well written.  I loved the book and would recommend it to anyone going through problems in life or trying to find reasons for things happening the way they do.
B00F6NKFQK|5.0|I defy anyone to read Oleg Medvedkov's Let's Conquer Paris short stories without becoming hooked on his writing. This man is beyond funny and witty.<br />As a history buff and travel lover I will never look at either in the same light again.<br />Never again will I visit Paris, that most romantic of cities, which had not been conquered for sixteen days, thereby stimulating Attila's inane but perfectly logical, to him, reasons for doing so.<br />Mount Olympus is in disarray with horny old Zeus being given a good tongue lashing by his wife Hera, while his brother Poseidon is itching to get off to the strippers and Apollo has a tendency to smoke herbs.<br />The Trojan guards' contemplations regarding Helen of Troy and the Trojan Horse, whilst endeavoring to open a can of beans to ward off hunger, is hilarious.<br />I'll leave you to discover the other vignettes for yourselves. And make sure you check out Ancient Rome's tweeps.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I have to admit I am a Twilighter.  I love these movies and watch them over and over again.  I love the music, I love the actors, I love the story.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|I liked the all the people their view of life, hopes, fears, etc. This is a great series and I own all the years.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I never read the book but I went to see the movie and then bought the DVD.  Hugh Jackman did a super job in this movie.  So completely believable.  As did the rest of the cast.  I love musicals and the music was wonderful.  This is a must see.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The best book ever. You never know what's gonna happen next. I'd suggest it to anyone that liked a good love story
B004ZH66XO|5.0|A great time passer.  Haven't been playing it long, but - so far - it is a cute game. Try it
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|Wow! This watch is the perfect outdoorsman's, adventurer's watch. The Seiko Men's SSC021 Solar Diver Chronograph is my third Seiko watch. The automatic scuba diver was bought about 38 years ago, the second was the chronograph and now the third is a combination diver/chronograph that is solar powered.. If you are an outdoors person this is the perfect for all worlds.<br />The watch is well made, rugged and eye catching. You will be very proud to be wearing this timepiece.<br /><br />Thanks Seiko for combining the two watches that most everyman desires plus kicking in solar powered.<br /><br />Needless to say I had very prompt deliver from the Amazon vendor.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|This is one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen to date.  If you have a killer home theater set-up, Tron Legacy is a definite must buy.  The plot is choppy at times since the movie is essentially a series of individual set-pieces strung together by a common theme of Sam Flynn trying to escape from his current predicament and find a way home.  To be honest though, I focused more on how awesome the picture/effects looked in a dark room and the Daft Punk soundtrack.  The only part of the movie I truly didn't like was the first 10-15 minutes of scenes related to the hack into Encom.  These scenes added zero value to the movie and could have been removed without any detriment.
B00AHGSVKS|1.0|This is not a well written story by today's standards. I felt like A.C.C. was playing the sims and I was looking over his shoulder, utterly bored. The characters were lifeless mannequins that neither A.C.C. cared about nor did I.
B008FRFN7A|2.0|Tried to use it with a galaxy tablet and had a terrible time. Could be more user friendly. Can't print everything I want.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|this game will suck you in and will not let you go highly highly addictive it is awesome. got all of m y friends playing it now lol
B0063IH60K|4.0|Have always loved to play solitaire and now I have it at my finger tips whenever I need to occupy my idle times.
B009CG9M8Y|5.0|this movie surprised me in that it was funny, poignant, and a great movie to watch with your the person you chose to spend the rest of your life with.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. The character is maturing, the story is continuing on a logical progression and the writing is consistently good. I am very interested to see what has turned Kvothe into the innkeeper, as that is thus far my least favorite incarnation of him. It just doesn't seem that he is himself. It was a roller coaster ride to some very interesting new places.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This gives the appearance of being difficult. I personally feel it is challenging but LOVE the variety of items. Each room has several items to find so even if you have found them for one challenge, later you can play the same room to find others items. This is one of my favorite games.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and its sequel. It's a flashback style coming of age story. I praise it's length as many of the book sin sci-fi/fantasy genre are short serial driven books that can be finished in a couple long reading sessions. This was not just a quality interesting read, but it was around for awhile.
B002NF1ZI6|5.0|My kids were literally fighting over who got the last door or window - fights be no more! Glad this set exists... or I might not.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|For 35 bucks and the integration with my android phone I am very happy with this product.  Controlling Netflix from my cell phone that doubles as my tv remote is great.  Also the integration between Youtube and the Chromecast is flawless.<br /><br />The only drawback is the lack of integrated apps as it is really only Netflix, Youtube, and Google Music.  If Iheartradio and Amazon Instant Video gets apps for it, it will be a great device at 35 bucks.
0446547638|5.0|Nicholas sparks books are always, always the best. He gives us a break from this busy, hectic world we live in.
B00979JTWK|1.0|Very annoyed that despite saying this is an all regions disc it does not play in the USA even though it was supplied via Amazon.com to a US address
B004I744AS|5.0|Overall, it is very easy to use with a simple intuitive UI and clean easy to read definitions with derivations and word usage.  The offline mode is a great tool so you always have a dictionary, even when you're not online.  It has worked flawlessly on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Wonder was one of the best books I've ever read. It was so touching and heart-warning at the same time.  It brought a lot of years to my eyes in good way and bad.  Write another book please. After I finished the book, it made me think what winners actually are. I realized that some people are put on this earth to be a wonder. Just like August. I realized that any body can be a wonder and that truly is beautiful. Just as you meant in this book, if God put a wonder, or miracle into your life you are truly blessed because that is amazing. A lot of people will find out they have something wrong with their child and abort it. When Jesus put that wonder into your life and you killed. You killed the opportunity to have a miracle in your life. God code you of all the other people in this world, and you turned it down. It makes me wonder.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|like 24hour clock.  like getting outside temp for my exact location. alarm is easy to setup.  tried other apps but they don't measure up to this one
B004J4WLB4|5.0|If you have ever been or plan to be apart of the Foster Care world this is a must read. You'll cry, laugh, and be grateful for those who have survived and those that have helped those survive.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site. The app works really well on my kindle. Makes it easy to search and manage pins. Love love love it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book! The most amazing is I never expected this end!!! I'm so eager to start the next one right away with no delay
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is awesome really awesome it is so awesome that I could say awesome 5 times awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|Incredible song by one of the most talented artists on the planet... John Legend always makes date night extra special
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Every person should have this book on hand! My doctor,Lisa Sterman recommended it & I turn to it as if I'm reaching for a prescription bottle. It has saved me hours upon hours,of useless second guessing as to what someone is thinking. Guess what? It's impossible to know what motivates one and who cares? Of course,this book explains it much more gently,but I'm thrilled to have time back to spend in more pleasurable ways!
B001VU1NJ0|1.0|This is a terrible movie. Slow very little action and just when it got to be a little interesting it went into the F word phase F this F that. Really ruined the movie even more. Does Hollywood believe that you can't make a movie without the F word. There are about 70 uses of the f-word, 20 of the s-word, and 20 other profanities and crudities. God's name is abused a dozen times and Jesus' only slightly fewer. A young man quickly flashes an obscene gesture. Really you need to post a rating on the movies so we are not sucked in and then have to endure this foil language to see the end of the movie, not that it was that good or the ending wasn't predictable.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Love the game. And the movie! This was the best download a game the whole family can enjoy together. AWESOME!!!!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|It's a great album and I'd recommend it to all fans of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. I'm going to see them on the 28th!!!!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I bought it for my first Kindle. It fully meets my expectations. It fits my Kindle Fire perfectly and folds over it to protect it. No fumbling with a zip bag or such.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A really good movie. Loved the special effects and very realistic zombie movie. Brat Pitt was great in this movie.
B009KKLQVS|4.0|I have to agree with others in stating upfront that the entire concert that matches the Audio-CD should be released. I would assume it was all captured. So many great songs did not make it to the BluRay video concert. This is why I downgraded to 4-stars out of 5. Should they ever release the entire concert at some date and make me buy the BR again, I still would although I would feel some resentment.<br /><br />Putting aside for a moment this failure to release the entire concert on video, I have to say what was released is very good. The video looks great and sounds great. It really is a fun concert. What great songs they have released over the years. And you are seeing and hearing the Beach Boys at their best with top-notch supporting musicians. That is why this is so special. This gathering may not occur again, so let's enjoy it. Overall, I am happy with the purchase, as what they did release is great. It's just that if you also have the Audio-CD, then you know you are missing some other great performances.<br /><br />I forgot to add this to the original review. On my BluRyay player, the only menu options I see are Play Concert and the Audio Setup. There is no chapter (song) selection, which is quite rare on concert videos today.<br /><br />And one more note...I never knew this. My first song memory of the Beach Boys was \\"Help Me Rhonda\\". I see from this video that Al Jardine sang lead vocals on that song (and also confirmed on Wiki). I just never knew that and was quite surprised. Go Al!
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I mainly bought it to save my Macbook Air's two USB ports for better things.  I have a external drive backup drive and invested in Firewire 800 back in the day, so it is nice to preserve my investment in the faster transfer rates of FW800 and save my two USB ports for more relevant things! Works great with TimeMachine in 10.8 so far...
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Love the John Corey character and love how DeMille lets the reader see into his thoughts. I found The Panther to be slower moving than The Lion and The Lion's Game, but still enjoyed John and Kate's characters and dialogue.
B0053O89K6|5.0|best season ever of house md, everybody loves house md, season finale was shocking, LO MEJOR EN SERIES DE TV
B002VPE1AW|5.0|It is in great condition, like new, just like it was advertised and played perfectly.  Great buy worth the money.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was really entertaining, fun and sometimes spooky. Even the find it games are harder. Great job. I can't wait for the sequel.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Came in original packaging brand new just like advertised.  Great movie and really cheap too.  I owuld recommend to friends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was a decent follow-up to the first book. I will definitely read the next book in the series.
B002UJIY7A|5.0|I like Timothy Olyphant and this kept you on the edge of your seat trying to figure out how it would end. Delivery prompt and packaged well it padded envelope.
0156027321|5.0|I actually read the book before seeing the movie and the surprise ending left me in tears! I love it!
B009LDD54K|3.0|I don't think it is as good as the first two seasons but delivery was prompt for me to find out. If there is a season 4 I don't think I'll get it.<br />The story line didn't seem to follow season two very closely and they introduced new characters that didn't seem to fit in to me.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|awesome, entertaining and love playing this game.  need more like this can't wait for others to come out.  nicely done.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am hooked on this storyline.  Ms. Clare's writing is easy to follow and entrancing.  Not just for teenagers, trust me.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Too many cheesy one liners. The special effects weren't enough to carry this movie, which I completely lost interest in after the first ten minutes.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|As soon as I finished Book #1 I had to read this one... and as soon as I read this one I HAD to get Book #3.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Downloaded and tried this out, which helped a relative in a hospital to relax. I also found that after I recommended it to co-workers who wanted something like a white noise generator, but with portability they were quite happy with the app.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I use to LOVE this game.  It was my ME  time when I got home from work. My first kindle quit working so I had to get another. When I reloaded this game it was different but I got use to it.  Then I had to get another kindle because the second one cratered. Again, this game reloaded different. Now I can't get ANY of my puzzles I purchased nor can I download the new ones I bought since getting new kindle. VERY FRUSTRATING!!!!!!
B00DU74U74|5.0|A believable story with characters you can care about, and more importantly cheer for to succeed and overcome their tragedies.
B006RXPUR2|5.0|No damages to the DVD and it was packaged very well and on time...I enjoyed the movie, with no problems...I would recommend this movie and Amazon to my friend
B00ELD19OI|5.0|Haken is my new favorite prog metal band. They have all the qualities of a  great prog band in the fact they know how to incorporate heavy edged riffs with beautiful mellow passages together in perfect song writing techniques that I find very appealing to my ears..
B004S5D3B6|5.0|There was no damages to the DVD and it played welll...I enjoyed the movie with no problems....It was packaged very well and on time...I would recommend Amazon to my friends
B002ASVQW6|4.0|I remember having this on cassette back in 1990 when this band released backstreet symphony.  I think I enjoyed the songs more back then, then I do now.  Nonetheless, I sill had this cd in my cd player for a few weeks.  The singer reminds me of a combo of Robert Plant, David Coverdale, and Ray Gilen.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|my 2  yr old loves this movie. I do wish there was more music becuase he loves to dance and the songs they do are awesome for him. It has great color and keeps him still for awhile which is nice.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is one that was hard to put down, kept interest all the way through.  Have read a lot of Davids book and this is one of the better.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I ordered it, not knowing the story, but found it to be fantastic.  The little man was perfect for this story.  As an adult I love a good story line, without all that sex and nudity in most of the current movies.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love being able to walk  around with my headeset on and the sound quality is pretty darn good. The buttons on the side are easy to use and the charging dock is also very nice.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This one, I think is much, much, better than the Triology.  The plot was excellent, well written, and the characters were perfectly cast.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Omg!!!! Love this series can't wait for the next book even though I have  to wait next year which I'm sad, but I'm glad I took the journey with Gideon and Eva and I'm happy to know what happen towards the end of the book. Can't wait to see what adventures Sylvia take us on the next book!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|this movie is fantastic.  Just the kind of movie I Iove to watch.  Good story line, adorable characters,  & a nice ending.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This has had much hype, and the premise is interesting. The first half of the book goes well, providing two perspectives on 'what has happened'. The halfway twist is also quite clever (although slightly predictable). However after that, the female protagonist does some things (I cant plot spoil and mention them) that do not fit her personality or previous behaviour at all, and render the 'believability' difficult. Not bad, but ultimately a touch disappointing.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I think Clapton and Winwood are exceptional on this CD. I wish they would get together again for another concert.
B009IF82SK|5.0|This show just keeps getting better and better.  Jim Parsons and Miya Bialic are fabulous.  I am happy that Jim won the Emmy!
B000FBJF3M|5.0|Antiquity was another planet, and for every thing that seems familiar to us, there will be ten utterly, unfathomably alien things about our distant ancestors and how they thought. For this reason I usually hate novels that take place in ancient settings. One exception is this book, and I have come back to it time and again, because it feels so authentic.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This book is more than meets the eye. It was a little confusing at first with all the different people and their issues but it came together and the ending does not disappoint. It's one of those books that you think about afterwards.
0920668372|5.0|Every household with children should have this book. I give it as a baby shower gift/card in place of a card with the gift
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It took a while to get it but I did get e-mails advising me of the delivery.  It only supports YouTube and Netflix, I am hoping that it will eventually support playing videos that are already in the device, Amazon Streaming, Hulu, etc.  Once it starts growing I will come back and change my rating, but so far it is only OK.  Another thing that needs to change is that it requires WiFi to the internet, it would be better if it would also work with cell network or WiFi with no internet (i.e., home network and play movies that are in the network).
B008469DGY|5.0|Good app. Doesn't slow down my phone an I cant seem to be able to put the game down for whatever reason
B008Y6UND6|5.0|This is the first time I see this movie in any version.  My husband has seen several versions of it and he really liked it.  I loved it.  Very interesting story and great twists.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|I am just not into star wars and it was really loud.  I will keep trying.  And the price is right....
B004IE0NY2|5.0|Great streaming, no hiccups and no buffering.  The movie itself is one of those great Stallone B movies, I know it is odd, but in 2013 old Stallone B movies are simply classics!!! Love it.  Then go watch the new Dredd 92013)... It made for a great weekend.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I have this on my laptop and find it to be useful for checking prices,, etc.  Since I don't always travel with the laptop, and usually always have my Kindle, thought I would give it a try.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|No problems streaming.  The movie is awesome. I love everything Star Trek and I loved this one.  It was entertaining, fast paced, good graphics, good explosions.  Love the new actors portraying my old favorites, they really nailed them and at the same time made the characters their own.  I not only want more but I want a new TV SHOW!!!!
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Cute little ap, but songs listed are a little on the &#34;high brow&#34; side.  Have just had a short period of time, have played piano, violin and harmonica.  Piano is best.  Will continue to use for awhile and then see if I keep it or not.  But it is fun.
B00DFFHUUA|5.0|No problems streaming.  The film itself was very entertaining, good fights, specially the mountain footage.  The older Bruce Willis gets the better I like his films!
B007EC27QM|4.0|Haven't had any issues with this app. So easy to use with big digits! Whip it out  from time to time in a group to show quit calculations. (Sounds nerdy) lol very helpful.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Thought the book was really great. He is back to the type of storytelling I love, after a little stumble with Bloodline.
0439023491|5.0|Excellent book!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is an amazing journey with several stories all in one book, that intertwine.  The writing is amazing since the tone and language and writing style change with each story.  The last story in the far future has a somewhat annoying dialect, so I skipped some of that.  I really liked each story and found the book absolutely fascinating from both a writing and story line perspective.  I say its not for everyone because I think some people will not like looking up one or two words per page, and some may get lost in the book and/or writing style.  Think Chaucer to Shakespeare to +500 years from now pidgin English in Hawaii!
B008BM9L72|2.0|Best part ...the last page. I had expected the sex but seriously thought there would be a better story line. Skimmed through it !
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Where do I begin? I wasn't captivated while reading this book.  I skipped a lot of pages to just finish the book.mi love how Sylvia day writes in the first two books, but with this book I felt as though the book plateau, just filling the gaps with repetitive words.
B007SGM084|4.0|My curiosity got the best of me. I had to read this book to find out what were the controversy and the popularity in making Fifty Shades of Grey into a movie.<br />Due to the explicit sexual language, I find this book not my type of reading. Not to insinuate it was not a good book, just not my taste.<br />I do compliment E.L. James for her incredible talent in the use of articulating the written language. Her debt in writing brings the imagination alive.<br /><br />Great job, but I need a bath :)
B00EJB44VW|5.0|An amazing research in history. I really enjoyed reading it. I would love to read more about Jesus from other writers also.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not an electronics lover who plays on pad or phone all the time but really like this game. good to play when waiting on someone anent just wasting few minutes
B005DF2QMC|5.0|i love it! it was perfect to transfer all of my cassette music to mp3, i am able to listen to my old cllection of music, i lov it!
B00CATONCA|5.0|Exactly what I wanted, perfect for any True zombie collection, a Damn good buy for any horror fan or collector
B000068FWC|5.0|loved this music for very long time, had it but it was damaged, now I have it agan and Im thrilled!!!!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Wont run on my android tablet and customer service has not fixed the problem despite me calling up several times.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|A good book for a person, who knows The New Testament and would like to think and speculate about it. I have read it and thought about it on the beach in Barcelona.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Good book held my attention! Sad to think of the life of some kids.  Fun to read about young love!
B000FA675C|5.0|I read this book in 2005 when I was working at Books-A-Million and it was about to become a movie.  I downloaded this book when it came up as a free purchase, and I forgot how much I love Dan Brown books.  I'm now reading Inferno and I love that book too!!
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|What it lacked in variety it makes up for in accuracy and stunning detail. Whoever mad  this can  really knows their aircraft!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME. I sit around and play it all the time and it is something that me and my mom play together on our kindles
B0045HCJ8U|3.0|The movie arrived on time. Good quality. My only complaint is that the case stated there were hours of bonus material, and sadly there was not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun game lots of bananas to collect despicable me is one of my top all time animation of all time hope you enjoy as much ad I do
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Having boys definately makes you watch movies like this. I actually enjoyed it very much. Thanks, Amazon. Your services are great.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I've quickly become hooked on The Good Wife.  Great acting, storylines and having it on Prime Instant Video makes it even better!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was a great movie. All new mamas need to watch this. Not to scare them, but to make them see what lies ahead for motherhood.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I still have tears streaming down my face because of this breathtakingly beautiful book. I've never known greater literary soul mates then Hazel and Augustus. John Green made their love so real and so heart breaking. I won't be forgetting them anytime soon. I won't be forgetting this book anytime soon. It's now added to my list of the most beautiful stories I've ever read. Bravo John Green! Bravo!
0743554434|5.0|Recounting the restrictions and frequent culture sanctioned brutality<br />for the women of Afghanistan, this story kept me praying for these<br />fictional characters - praying that there could be a splendid sunlit<br />dawn for them. The situation pulls on the heartstrings and pushes<br />compassion to its outer limits as the story unfolds. I could not stop<br />listening. I had to know how it would end. And I will pray daily now<br />for the women of the Middle East who are still trapped in this kind<br />of dehumanizing cultural morass. It is well written. The characters<br />will continue to live in my heart and imagination. I am glad to have<br />persevered through the details that were indeed, too hard to hear<br />at times - incredulous that real women continue to struggle and<br />survive the same sort of restrictions and culturally sanctioned<br />brutality.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Works perfectly. Both the slot charges my iphone 5 as well as  my s3 and this Usb charges my phone very fast when compared to the other USB charge which I have.<br /><br />Dislike : this charger is so tight and i took some chance to insert into my car charger slot. I thought I would have damaged my car slot, so inserted it permanently and using my other 12v port for my GPS.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I'm not sure I understand it very well yet, but I enjoy making the matches.  I had never played it before so I need to get more familiar with all the rules.
1594202273|5.0|I ess a BMAT, and a DMCCC in Titan II.  I was on alert the next morning in Az as a DMCCC, and knew some of the people listed in this book.  The author was dead on with his work.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|Kindle cannot keep up with the Apple apps.  The Moleskin is one that I would love ... but it is not available.  I will keep looking for a similar counterpart.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I am so glad that I found this book.  It's a wonderful, quirky story of a man reflecting on his fantastical childhood.  The characters are so vividly crafted and described, leaving me with lasting mental images.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who can suspend a belief and enjoy great writing.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|IT'S A GREAT FOREIGN FILM..ONE OF MY FAVORITE  FOR THE PAST 6 YEARS..SEARCHED LOCAL STORES FOR MONTHS AND FINALLY  COULDN'T WAIT ANY LONGER...AMAZON  ALWAYS THE ANSWER IN FINDING THINGS..

B00992CF6W|4.0|I would give 5 star but in multiplayer over local WiFi you can teleport I really hope this can be fixed and I will do a 5 star.
B004P1JDJO|5.0|This book is a critical read for those working in the domain of performance management. It calls into serious question reward and punishment based systems performance management and presents new possibilities for re-igniting intrinsic forms of motivation. Drive is a fantastic resource for leaders and leadership development consultants, including coaches and trainers. This book prompts fantastic discussion when integrated into leadership training and has served as an effective basis for leadership conversations.
B008133MDK|4.0|Loved the British version of Elementary. Looking for more programs featuring Benedict Cumberbatch. What a nice surprise to find this!
0345803450|2.0|Seems all Ms. Frome wanted out of life was plenty of sex and a man. Any man. She's very shallow. Took a long time to get through because I didn't like the main character and really didn't care how it ended. However, I did enjoy the ending which was a surprise. Unfortunately that was only a couple of pages out of the whole book.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I have always been interested in beautiful stories as this one. It is an emotional rollercoaster with a very heartening ending. I love this book and I strongly recommend to all.
B0000TB014|4.0|A good musical DVD to have in your musical library to remember Michael Jackson by and to enjoy looking at with your family and friends.  I mean, what can I say..............It's Michael!
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|This movie has a great storyline supporting it. The acting was fair, but the message a incredible. This is a great family movie.
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|FUN RIDE. ALL ZOMBIE FANS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. LOADS OF FUN AND GREAT ACTION. THE ZOMBIE ATTACK SCENES ARE GREAT.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|It is not working, not installing the flash player and taking space on memory of the device, some sites are not accepting it
B0066W1AZK|5.0|We enjoy the chess app, you have the ability to control difficulty, can undo moves and play either against the computer or a 2nd player.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book. It was great and very interesting. It kept me not wanting to put it down till it was over.
0399226907|5.0|Very cute classic story.  My son loves the colors of the images.  Great addition to your babies or kids library.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|I couldn't put any of the books in the trilogy down, they are so engaging and well written. Now makes me want to see the next two movies!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Previously I had that classic boxy Nikon bag. This bag is very small, but it fit everything perfectly. I was able to fit my camera body's cap and what little paperwork I wanted to keep in one side pocket, and my battery charger in the other side pocket. there is only enough room in the main compartment to fit your camera, its lens, and then to fold the neck strap and stuff it down the side. This bag is a good size to use the small carrying handle, but it also works very well over the shoulder, and it is small enough to put in another bag. This is exactly what I needed.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I couldn't put any of the books in the trilogy down, they are so engaging and well written. Now makes me want to see the next two movies!
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|His voice is powerful, lyrics are emotional and honest (watch &#34;Charles Bradley: Soul of America&#34;), and his backup band are spot on! I'm so happy with his music, we're playing it at our wedding! Much thanks, Mr. Bradley!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I HAVE DOWNLOADED AND UNINSTALLED THIS GAME FOUR TIMES AND STILL WONT PLAY VERY FRUSTRATED. I have this game on my galaxys4 phone works great but have tried on my galaxy 2 tablet and it will not play! Whats wrong please fix soon. THANKS!
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fun. I recommend this game to anyone who is bored. Good on the kindle fire. I'm glad I downloaded it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|We read all three books in the trilogy twice and loved them all, I would definitely recommend to all adult women.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show.  It has so many scandal's and is well written.  Got my teenage kids hooked on it.  Wish it would have won some Grammy's.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Great book. Love that I couldn't guess the plot twists.  Kept me guessing and reading.  Love when an author can deliver a new idea.  Even though the story has elements of other mind-bending thrillers, the concept is all its own.<br /><br />Reminded me a bit of a short-lived series called \\"Persons Unknown\\", which I also enjoyed (along with Twin Peaks).  Can't wait to read book two.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from the Kindle owners' lending library, but I would have happily paid for it.
159463176X|4.0|Having read three books by this author and while I appreciate his writing very much I have to say that this one is not as strong as The Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns. Yes, I liked it but for me it's not an outstanding read. As one who appreciates Hosseini's writing, I have to suggest that others to check it out for themselves. They may feel differently.<br /><br />This is the story of two people, Pari and Abdullah, brother and sister, and their families. Some are quite successful and become wealthy, others live a decent life while still others find themselves as poor as can be. The author gives us views of most of them as the book progresses. The novel does begin with Pari and Abdullah and end with them but to find out what, how and why, you must check it out for yourself.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|Great movie, kept me laughing!  talented cast! Jennifer Aniston seemed out of place in this movie, but all the other supporting cast helped over ride her role. Make sure to watch the out-takes.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|It is kind of odd to win a game by eradicating human. After the first three chapters, it seems almost impossible to win no matter how hard you try even you spend extra $$$ to get some extra help by unlocking features at the game. Well design, intersting idea but very hard to win.
B00B22MJSG|3.0|One major complaint jumps out at me.  \\"I Go Insane\\" is not what I expected.  Lyndsey Buckingham's solo version is so much better than this downer song on the disk.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|The research into making this compelling movie is incredible.  The timeline and facts all seemed accurate from what I know about the hunt for OBL.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It has 57576 pages of words for \\"a\\". I think everyone should get it so they can find the definition of any word.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you are a student and practitioner of law of attraction, the secret and have hit a plateau... This will jump start you and give you more hope.
B00EE3FTNM|1.0|&#34;The Killing&#34; in Britain. Dull, dead, lifeless, boring, poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted, this show sux! Three more words...
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I discovered Baldacci by accident and I have enjoyed several of his books.  His attention to detail on how things work what happens in various situations.  As with all of his books, he keeps you guessing through most of the book trying to figure out who is doing what and why.  When it is revealed in the end, it is plausable and shocking.<br />This is a very good read, the interplay between Sean and Micheale is great.  They love each other enough to risk their lives to defend the other but never let it go any further. They get jealous when the other is alone with the opposite sex they deam could be threatening.  They walk that fine line of being totally best friends and who love each other, but never cross that line.<br />I would recommend any of Baldacci books.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have become a huge fan of Phillipa Gregory.  English history has become fun to learn and I am not English!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|If you like period pieces this is the best and the set is an actual castle for which one can purchase on Amazon the DVD that tours the castle.
B001I45UFC|5.0|You cannot fault CS Lewis.  A timeless story which will forever enchant children throughout the ages. I can't wait to read more.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Have relied on Google  for years.  Very seldom have I been unable to find what I want.<br />I find the Google maps particularly helpful.
B0009MAP90|3.0|Just as Mount Everest probably started out the size of a pimple every great thing or person begins with a humble beginning. Even a legend like Bob Dylan had to start someplace and his first album is a prime example of that. The self titled album gives no indication of what kind of career that Dylan is about to launch so could be deceiving to the listener. That is not to say this is a bad record. Its just that in no way would you gather from this album what is about to come forth from the genius mind of a young 20 year old lad from Minnesota that would help change the course of rock music. This is pure folk music that Dylan sings but not the kind he would be known for with songs like \\"Blowin' With The Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are A Changin'\\" that would become anthems for the protest movements of the 1960s. These songs are simple folk songs that have been recorded before by other artists and no doubt sung many times around many camp fires. Only two of the songs were written by Bob himself and gives no indication what kind of a song writer he would be capable of becoming. The album itself had at best modest results in sales and there are I bet many who having heard the record for the first time thought the singer didn't have much to offer musically. They would be greatly mistaken a year later when Dylan would release his second album \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" that would for the first time show to the world what music had in store for everyone. Still everyone should give this album a listen if for no other reason then to hear the roots of modern music being born. For the die hard fan of Dylan you will want to add this to your collection of his music but don't add it just to complete your collection of Dylan albums. Add it because while not great music it is still good enough and interesting enough to listen too.
B0061S0A64|3.0|Does what it says it will do. Others seemed to be intrigued by it. I'm a musician and played with it a few times. Understand how it works, but it's just not my cup of tea. Seems to be a taste/generation gap for me.
0761163808|5.0|I love this book!  I've purchased from some other places where the book was in not-so-good shape.  This one from this seller was in almost new condition.  I'm so pleased - now I can gift it as I had originally planned to do.  Thanks for good service and good product.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|Used this at home when one of my computers was running this and controlled it via a tablet. Left the computer on with the program running, but could not control it from a different location. It appears there is a deluxe/paid version that would allow out of home network control. Seldom have a need for that, so I just use it occasionally when I am on the same network with my computer and tablet.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|THe sad thing is that the first 20 minutes or so seriously grab you.  I sat back to watch a great survival story  But less than half way through the movie, it became a drama about the surety and hopelessness of death.  Then it became boring, with tedious dialogue about the only thing that exists is the air in your lungs.  Hollywood folks must live a tragic life.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Visually entertaining, tired of recycled plot lines, good cast, too much reliance on action scenes, hope they are setting the stage for something better - eventually.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Could not put the book down.  I'm really looking forward to the next one!  I can usually figure out the story, this one keeps me guessing and I love it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I began watching the hbo show Game Of Thrones and voracious reader that I am have read these 4 books in the past month, just flying through them. The storytelling is better than fantastic combined with a marvelous well developed cast with fascinating character development. I love this writer and now will probably read all his books.
B00C5R8364|5.0|I am a real Forsyth fan and this new work does not disappoint. The only problem is that I want more Forsyth and I have read them all. There are some great writers out there in this genre but none as fulfilling. Read it.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This is a very simple app, but my 2 year old laughs like crazy for it.  I just wish Ben did more.
B00B3EJ0OY|4.0|I try to avoid sad movies but had no idea this one fit in that category.  However, the story and acting were both superb.
B00C2C637I|1.0|I did not understand this book, nor could I follow what was happening. I would never recommend this book to anyone. That is just me though. Many people love it.
B00BEXB18M|4.0|I've read a few reviews from others, but I already had my opinion of this latest Megadeth album before I read them, so this is an honest review.<br /><br />This record is not as good as \\"Endgame\\" or \\"Th1rt3en\\", where \\"Endgame\\" is the superior of these last two, though I enjoyed \\"Th1rt3en\\" very much. \\"Super Collider\\" begins with a great track, \\"Kingmaker\\" and is followed by a great and catchy title track. Dave did some ringing chord work on the song \\"Endgame\\", which I think works very well when the rest of the song is thrash single noted goodness, and gives us more epic ringing chord work on \\"Super Collider\\", along with a catchy meaningful chorus. The chord progression of SC is almost happy sounding, which is a oddity for a Megadeth song, but I like it! I'm not sure where he got the inspiration to write a goofy sounding chorus on \\"Burn!\\" (\\"Burn, baby, burn! Cause it feels so good!\\"), but the song itself is rockin'! A few of the songs seem to meander a bit, like \\"The Beginning of Sorrow\\" and \\"The Blackest Crow\\" which features some interesting, if unusual banjo work. At this point, Dave can do whatever he likes, and I don't think anyone will complain too much. You can't write \\"Peace Sells\\" or \\"Wake up dead\\" over and over. That would be boring.<br /><br />\\"Off The Edge\\" and \\"Dance in the Rain\\" are the requisite political statements showcasing his viewpoints of current world events. I think I like \\"Off the Edge\\" a bit more. The album finishes off with \\"Don't turn your back...\\" and Thin Lizzy's \\"Cold Sweat\\". Both songs are awesome!<br /><br />Overall, a good album. Not great - but good enough to say that I'm glad to add it to my collection!
B002BI6SMI|4.0|It is a good action flick. My wife really liked it. I, myself would not have ordered it. I like old B&W classics and I have quiet a few blu-ray and DVD. I have really great iCom, all region player. It has a better picture than my Sony, Blu-ray, 3D player. I hardly ever use the Sony.
B00DR98EYK|5.0|If you want an album that will ease your mind then this is the cd to purchase! Songs are amazing from start to end. Sends you on a peaceful spiritual jorney. Female vocals are enchanting! Must have cd.
B001YV506S|4.0|I bought this BD to replace one of my DVD format flicks in my collection. My wife's idea. The video quality is really good, as is the audio. I am not a big fan of Jeff Bridges. Chris Cooper on the other hand is one of those actors that plays very different parts. He is very good in just about every part he plays. Tobey Maguire is good in some movies, not so good in others. The difference between the young jockey and the older one in this movie is not a very good match. The don't even look like they could be kin to each other. Not even close.
1401324649|5.0|Unique, funny, clever. Being of a certain age myself, it is great to have a story centering around an old person who is not a cliche.
B001B7CNY2|3.0|Good action flick. I bought it to replace a DVD from my collection. I like  WWII movies. I would like to see 30 Seconds Over Tokyo and Sink the Bismark come to light on BD.
B002XMGGJM|5.0|very please with my purchased and delivery was great and very on time. Law Abiding Citizen is an excellent movie and love it even more on Blu-ray and 100% please
B00846REIS|3.0|After reading Fifty shades its like re-reading it in this book.  Not written as well after reading Fifty shades. Okay...
B002UD56I6|5.0|very please with my purchased and delivery was great and very on time. Michael Jackson is an excellent movie and love it even more on Blu-ray and 100% please
1451695195|3.0|Not very descriptive to be written by a &#34;doctor&#34; and his vivid experience.  Should be a free book.  Not very believable
0061733199|5.0|A very good Book I find it very helpful. and if you ever need It you would probably have a better chance to survive.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Wow!  Steamy and thought provoking.  Hard to put down and harder to talk about (blush-blush) in a good way though. Read the trilogy.
B006X5L6VS|4.0|Have always wanted to know just what constellations were up there as I was looking around in the night sky. This is an informational and fun app to have and to show others.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Can't wait for the movie.  Glad I read the books first.  Could have had a different ending I suppose but I enjoyed it nonetheless
B009O2XY12|3.0|I play a lot of bubble games between my PC and Kindle. I like to have a lot of different bubble games to play and they all are a little different from each other.  I enjoy this bubble game.
1609611543|4.0|It was a good book but some of it was hard to understand- to much scientific information for the average reader.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is so fun. There are so many different types of Angry Birds to shoot at so many different green blobs. I love the sounds that come out of the Angry Birds when they hit stuff.  It just cracks me up every time.:)
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Big air, baby. Go for air not distance lol. The game has a high replay ability. Enjoy hours of neck breaking fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is awesome I love it and would recommend it to everyone. It lets you interact with the horses just like you would in real life.
