B00JRYHGKC|2|Lets water in and it gets trapped.  Better to just leave it off.
B000STXWO4|5|Gives my elderly mother the independence she deserves by allowing her to open her own gas cap with this useful and clever device!
B00LNE2EH4|5|Identical to the OEM On my RV
B00AB2PBU6|5|arrived as always in good time and they fit perfectly and look great.
B00XJ0WAN8|5|Quick and easy install. Well worth the money
B000UKHHH4|5|better than stock, I took a good spill bent it up, bent it back, kept on going. Good by me.
B00K8NE9T2|4|Cool hat, but if you have a bigger ghead like me, it looks kinda narrow. Otherwise it is great style and quality at a good price.
B008F91ME6|1|From the flimsy clamp to the horribly designed battery holder, it's 100% garbage after a few gentle uses. It's not even water resistant and it's made for marine use.... only one star because I couldn't give it less.
B0083AEVYA|5|Worked perfectly right out of the box. Excellent instructions, very good wiring, looks as good as any factory install.
B004V3QBS2|5|The replacement starter solenoid was a perfect fit for the original OEM part. Installation was fast and easy as our old 100HP Johnson Outboard fired up without further delay.
B000LNWI1K|5|Good quality and easy to use
B00KD3G01M|5|Pleased with the product all though I feel they should be made just a little bit bigger as they was very hard to get on and caused the seam to loosen.
B00EPDKUSK|5|Using these seat covers daily. They fit our car well(Honda Fit) and look great. They also are wearing well.
B007VD36U0|1|Awful. Says black cherry mica but it does not match black cherry mica at all. I regret using this product.
B00D7GXI2Q|5|Good!!!!
B0032LV2QA|5|Works very well
B00PQZMB10|5|Beautiful seat covers at an awesome price. They fit perfectly and were simple to put on. Would recommend and  buy again!
B0014TMVF8|3|Maybe good for one summer but a lot of $$$ to spend for 3 months and a couple of showers..POOR QUALITY. .
B000EW0KHW|5|Works perfect on my 88 mustang
B00D9C2CDO|5|Traveled from NY to Florida roundtrip with any issues.  Rained at times and still no problems.  Highly recommend!
B00KY62MOM|5|I like my windows dark.
B008I7R5EG|5|Good replacement for broken mirror. Easy to install and works great.
B00SFKMN8O|5|Bought the black leather one. Fits well in my 2015 CR-V and is almost inconspicuous. Excellent quality at a fraction of the cost. What else can you ask for?
B006H34BUY|5|I love this! Fits right in the pocket of my car door. I can pull it out and give the dashboard a swipe in seconds with no water!
B00DX8AKF6|4|Cool helment....looks good and has alot of padding inside. ...sits a little high, but thats the way it is if you want to live after a crash. Hehe..I would buy another one!!! Awesome piece....Graphics are cool too!!!
B000FDUN3Q|2|i purchased this to replace an oem mercedes car cover. that one was a soft, waffle textured fabric which had some &#34;give&#34; to it. i must say that i am disappointed in the coverking brand. It is a shiny, slippery, lightweight poly material that has NO &#34;give&#34;. problem 1-the slippery nature of the poly fabric causes it to literally slide all over and eventually off the car. this makes it difficult on windy days to either fold up or unfold to put on. not only makes for a good chance as causing scratches with any particles on car surface. problem 2-the shiny lightweight poly material doesn't allow for particles or debris to become trapped rather than slide all over your cars paint whereas the waffle fabric allows for those particles to become trapped in the divets of the fabric. problem 3-and perhaps my biggest pet peeve.....this fabric has no give whatsoever and since it is semi custom it makes it a chore and a half when it comes to getting the side view mirror pockets over the mirrors. I puts a great deal of stress on the stitching, and again, possible scratches to your paint. i would not buy again and would not recommend to a friend.
B00SIRX03Q|4|These lights are great and the pictures are accurate. The blue LED lights give the inside of my Mazda 3 hatchback a unique, futuristic look and go nicely with the dark blue exterior. As far as installation goes, the instructions are pretty minimal, but it took me less than 20 minutes to swap the old stock ones for these.<br /><br />Here is a helpful video in case you're having trouble https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqEAEn4jDGg&index=1&list=WL
B00OIJF9LY|5|Super awesome sticker and shipped quickly!<br />Absolutely no complaints!
B00OKFUERK|4|I recommend this lift to anyone who actually uses their rover for what is meant for. Super easy to install took me 10 min and did not require any tools or removal of tires.
B0085OLUNY|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Very happy.
B00FFGVOH2|5|ode to ETM...thank you!!
B0013HZOO6|5|Does the job perfectly! My smart is that much cooler now that I have the heatshield. Installs very easily. Bundles up and gets thrown in the back when not in use. IF I had to complain about anything, it would be the price. A little steep if you ask me. If the price was lower, I would totally get the set (top, back, and 2 side shields) for maximum protection against Texas heat.
B00K0PVAPO|4|Arrived on time. Works as advertised. Waiting to take this on trial while camping.
B00BYFE6LO|5|My 944 Turbo loves this stuff. Can't argue with the price per quantity either.
B005LFOFZU|3|Look great, one was a litte rough/sharp on edge. Quality control could be a little better.
B008VM0TLO|2|defective out of the box, would not retract.  Other than that it seemed to be of high quality.
B0059HJZO6|5|Great!
B005MEZU18|3|great product but all the graphics are just stickers
B009J2J0SI|1|Product arrived in a timely fashion, however was missing the hardware needed to mount one of the feet to the bars. Really frustrating, makes the kit pretty useless.  Home Depot / lowes doesn't carry applicable parts.
B00OLNTJ8Q|3|The mirror finish completes the power ranger look (ok with me), BUT the surface is way more scratch-prone than the clear one it replaced PLUS it takes away lots of light so definitely not recommended for rainy dark day (when you definitely want your visor down) or night riding. Why is the clear one not sold in Amazon ? Moved on to a 3/4 SHOEI R-PLATINUM-JR helmet with an Echo 5-snap flat shield. What a difference ! :  safer (snell 2010), quieter (above 40 mph), and no more wet bandanas (amazing ventilation).
B002N5W8Q4|1|After struggling to install the batteries I finally got them properly seated. Turned on the switch and nothing. I tested the circuit with a multi meter and it read the full 3 volts. Let Amazon know and they issued a full refund immediately. I'm returning this piece of junk today and ordering the other brand.
B000C2W9AA|5|Good
B001I0DCXI|3|took a long time to get it. works fin
B00DQUA1FA|5|ok
B00HNW8MJ4|1|it doesn't fit
B000C7ZACY|1|Item was broken when boxed by manufactrere or distribvutor.... as broken off piece was not in the box.
B00G2U0LHY|4|I bought several sets for my truck and car. They are really not brighter than the normal bulbs, but I like that they use less energy. Within two months two of the bulbs stopped working as expected. I contacted JDM and they sent me two replacements at no cost.
B0013REXO8|5|Loved it, thank you!
B004HCM9H4|5|Great Wax, glass like finish and long lasting.  The attached picture shows my 2 year old New England plow truck after a fresh coat.
B0041U7IO6|4|it was a good fit. However, the back the back was slightly different. the original was a snap on. Yours needed  to be secured with a small screw. With i had. All is well. Thank you.
B007IVRU0W|5|Price and quality are perfect. Shipping was right on time.
B001OCXA14|2|These caps are very light weight, and have very sharp edges which will scratch the paint for sure. The item was also described as &#34;bolt on&#34; when in fact they come with one single strip of double sided tape to hold the cap on the bed rail top with. I am sending the parts back as both were damaged in transit due to very poor packaging and they are not as described.
B0068EOK1C|5|Nice
B000C2AISU|5|These are high quality gaskets, they are working great on my Subaru.
B009PIKAVW|5|Perfect to save my floors, I do tuck the sides under the bottom molding of door.
B001EP0GQS|4|Bolted right up with provided hardware in 10 minutes you just need a torque wrench.
B00IIFO2GC|5|Awesome Product and fast shipping!
B00B5LM9DY|5|I love thsee seat covers. The red and black gives just enough color to stand out. Not to flashy or cheap looking. They are comfortable and don't wiggle around when you sit on them. I actually forget they're covers. I would prefer to give this a 4.5 of 5 because I had to CUT holes in the upper part to make holes for the headrest. Best advice is don't cut bigger than a nickel and then tuck the rest around. Then slide your headrest on. Other than my nerves being bad on cutting, these covers are perfect. I would like to order the backseat just because (even though no one sits back there). This is overall a great product for the money.
B008FWCLHU|5|On time delivery and product is great.
B00NP60URE|3|Vacuum works good, but the container is WAY too small.
B000GVDMCG|5|Very nice kit. Great instructions.
B007566Y2A|1|The seller was wonderful and replaced a burnt out bulb immediately, even upgraded it.  But I may as well have no lights on at all when I am driving on low beams.  Not happy with the power at all.
B00ON91E1S|5|Was a bit concerned about what I was getting for the price compared to a lot of other higher priced covers.  When they arrived, I was very pleasantly surprised.  They fit great and were relatively easy to install.
B004A66JMS|1|There are chips, cracks on two of four pads, it seems the qulity is not good.
B00Z8TGR4G|4|Love this light bar. Looks awesome and is super bright. Installation was a pain. My truck doesn't have a 4 pin so it took a minute to splice the wires in but that was the easy part. The 3M tape that comes on it was junk. Went ahead and used the mounting brackets it comes with because I do a lot of off-roading and don't want to put my faith in some tape. I pre-drilled the holes and the tiny screws supplied didn't work. I ended up having to drill out the holes for some nuts and bolts and had to use my own 3M tape as well to make sure it was solid. I recommend the light but make sure you have back up stuff to install in case you have issues like I did.
B000ES9E9G|5|cool cheap leds. thanks
B003XYNDC2|2|The decal is too small.  Was hoping it would be bigger.
B00DJF3QK4|2|I received this well packaged in a tube.  I was surprised to see that the film actually looks just plain grey with lines versus shiny and metallic.  It does reflect a small amount of light, but when in a shaded area, looks to be a plain grey.  I have no use for this roll now since it does not even nearly match the brushed aluminum components already installed in my vehicle.
B00HEMUXKO|3|Have not installed it yet.  The ad and reality are different.  Requires extra parts and wiring to make it work.  I thought it was a plug and play type deal.  I am sure when I get around to installing it, it will work fine.  The switch seems sturdy and matches the my Jeep's other switchgear.
B0041TP2LS|5|Fit 2007 Nissan Sentra perfectly.  Installs in minutes.  Great deal compared to dealer quote.
B0065WU0T8|5|Had to cut a hole in each one to fit the stopper in on a 97 Polaris 780 SLT, but great fit and the feel awesome.
B0086AGF8C|4|This is used as drive chain lube on my motorcycle. The dispenser makes it relatively easy to apply to the chain and it dries leaving a coating with a oily/waxy feel that thus far has served to provide lubrication on the chain and sprockets. Typical of most chain lubes it is best to lube after riding to allow the volatiles to evaporate off or much of the lube will be slung off while riding. I now have over 7,000 miles on this chain and sprocket set and have been using the Liquid Wrench L704 since installing the set. Observed wear is much less than on previous chains and sprockets using other chain lubes and oils.
B00NLMSHM2|4|Good product for the price
B00UHD4HJA|2|Didn't get the stickers that were shown in the picture. I was not pleased with the stickers i got.
B000CPI5ZK|5|Before you buy this and use this, do your research! Your first bit of research would be to find out if your car is running hot, and why. Modern cars are designed to operate at certain temperatures, and a number of factors can affect the operating temperature; maybe your thermostat is worn out, maybe you've got a blocked channel in the radiator, maybe your water pump is pumping as effectively as a new one. The point is, this shouldn't be your go-to fix. Having said that, though, this a good a product to use in certain circumstances, like street cars which occasionally see track duty, or hard driving a daily basis. Another good scenario where you should use this is after doing a head gasket. Allow me to explain further.<br /><br />I used this in my 2000 Mercedes C230 Kompressor after I replaced the head gasket and sent the head out to be rebuilt. While I didn't overheat the engine; there was just a slight leak out of the back of the block (very common on the M111), machine shops generally tend to take off even the slightest amount of material when rebuilding a cylinder head, just to make sure it's straight. When you take material off the head though you then change the compression ratio (you raise it), which in turns raises the combustion temperatures, which in turns will raise the coolant temperature slightly.<br /><br />After doing a crap load of research on the topic of coolant mixtures and temperatures associated with different mixtures, I decided to drop the coolant mixture down to 25% coolant, and 75% distilled water. I actually got this ratio from Redline's technical sheet on this product. If you read the information on this product and look at the dyno testing they did, you'll see that they saw the biggest temperature drop when this product was added to pure water, and the temperature climbed slightly with more and more antifreeze added. That's exactly what's supposed to happen.<br /><br />Modern cars use a 50/50 mixture from the factory so that the cooling system can operate in any climate. A 50/50 mixture gives you optimal protection from freezing while not raising the temperature too high. If you were to just run straight anti-freeze the temperature in the cooling system would spike dramatically. But if you were to run just straight water all the water would boil out, you also would have no corrosion inhibitors.<br /><br />Basically what I'm getting at is that if you want to see results with this you should run a 75/25 mixture and a bottle of this product. And read the technical sheet on this product.<br /><br />Happy tinkering.stem can operate in any climate.

B00FZPPIYI|5|good
B000N5U5VG|5|The new one is great the old lasted 11 years yuasa ytx-9
B005LXMXYW|3|The chrome plating is so-so quality. Would not recommend.
B00E975MPI|5|In the right hands this can make a good car look great, or a bad car look ghetto. There is an art to dipping things so make sure to practice a lot before it goes on your car.
B00KE1AW3A|3|Is a good cover - I wanted it because my seat belt was cutting into my shirts and making lines.  It came 2 to a pack.
B000CHFODO|4|so far so good, time will tell
B00BOEFEPC|5|Perfect for a car with no armrest. This fit in the cup holder so snug that we did not need to screw it in. Son loves it!
B00X6C3PRY|5|Wow.  I am very impressed with these.  Bought them for an '88 Land Cruiser.  Expensive yes but worth it.
B00EYV2PJU|5|Did a night nation run-lit up our tutus-it was so much fun! They worked as expected!~ It has to be pretty dark before you can see them, though. But I imagined that would be the case.
B001KMXQB2|5|Parts was perfect!  Delivery was quick.
B002PWJRWS|5|Works great price was also great
B00B7SJIC0|5|Looks great and functions like it's supposed to.
B00L4U0JWE|5|Bought this for the wife's Avalanch truck and it really works well
B0024NSR4C|5|These fit perfectly and it is much better to see at night.
B00342XWVK|5|Cheap and good quality. Though you can go to walmart and  pick it up for cheaper
B001CF3JYQ|5|I installed these on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler Sport with no problems.  I spent more time making sure I used the correct bracket in the correct location - spend a minute double checking yourself to avoid any aggravation.  The mounting holes all aligned perfectly and installation was quick and easy.  Very worth the money and time.  They look great!!
B00K4N8802|5|Great quality , was surprised. Definitely worth the price.
B000XLXWQ0|5|Great quality and better than expected.
B00092893E|5|I usually look at these things as snake oil. But I had a &#34;check engine&#34; light one month before a state emissions check (misfiring on cylinder 1 for a 99 Ford Taurus 12 valve), and I read many reviews on Amazon and elsewhere.  I used two 12 ounce bottles of Techron spread over two tank fulls (30 gallons for two tank fulls) and it fixed the problem.  No increase in fuel economy, but the misfiring is gone and it passed the test. Put the additive in on an empty fuel tank when refueling.
B00M09WL1K|4|Is nice.
B007XJ6O8I|5|This fits the Hyundai Azera 2012. I'm very happy with the purchase and delivery of this  product.
B006QH55YM|5|Runs my motor and AC.
B00BHD69PY|5|I like my GoBadges key holder. It is a unique color (red) and shape, making it difficult to misplace. I don't use a ring of keys so this is a perfect solution. If you carry other keys around in your pocket this might not be what you are looking for.<br /><br />The holder has a pin (like a two sided screw, similar to a piercing) that goes through the loop in the remote. One side is a blackjack flag and the other side looks like the head of a screw.
B00NP8VBKW|4|Looks nice.  They are not perfect fits, but close enough to not notice without detailed inspection.
B00NG69BE6|5|Valve stem covers, too!  It's perfect for our '78 yellow cj6!  Very happy, thank you!
B00473V668|2|Product sent to me worked. But it is not what is pictured. What I received was 1 solid piece splitter.
B00HB9KBEI|5|It fits well. It is a genuine Ford products. It was very easy yo install following instructions. The instructions were great and it took about 30 minutes to install. There was no need to remove the wheels. All parts were included.
B00Z3FQQRS|5|Fits my Fluke Meter perfectly, has a pocket on the inside for your cables.
B007WR25KW|4|These worked really well.  The place for improvement is the directions for putting them on the straps, as it took me quite awhile to get the loop on the side specified since it is suppose to be really important.
B000OO2O6U|2|Did not fit my 2001 KLR well. I ended up returning it and getting an OEM cable for close to the same cost. There is such a thing as too generic!
B006ACYXTQ|5|I bought them for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved them! Great quality for the price, and fits perfect on his 2007 dodge ram 1500.
B0071NAZV8|5|The parts installed with a little tweaking. The instruction sheet was a copy of a copy of a copy and was hard to see. Over all not to hard.
B00CNUUU5A|5|Great product at a very good price. This is a heavy duty hitch.
B0008F671S|4|worked good , not bad installation , had to make modify to get a good fit.<br />shipping good.
B00BH1G1ZE|3|I liked the stems somewhat, but I expected them to be a little longer.
B0087LCQUQ|5|this product is great for the extra storage of items, its strong and secure
B001AZH6H4|1|broke after a few uses
B0006JLU1I|5|Good quality. I used replacement for a 2012 work and play. Hindge was hard to figure out. If you are unsure, call Camco, I did!
B0002KM5L0|1|I bought this bleeder because it looked like an inexpensive yet capable bleeder system that wouldn't corrode over time like my original one did. I used it a couple of times with great sucess. I was happy with it. Then one day i notice brake fluid running down from the cabinet it was stored on. The hose had turned brittle (bad choice of tubing), broken and most of the fluid had been expelled, as there was a slight amount of pressure in the bleeder bottle.<br />Their customer service is not customer service. When I called and told them what had happened and asked if there was some sort of tubing upgrade (there was clearly a problem with the current tubing) the rep asked me if I knew I was supposed to empty the bleeder and rinse it out with denatured alcohol. I said no, I didn't know that, I had just read all the instructions on the bleeder bottle and there was no emphasis on that requirement and that it was stupid to need to do that. No one would want to go through that process, that you should naturally keep your hydroscopic brake fluid in a closed airtight container and that no one who did routine auto maintenance was not likely to nor would they want to go through that rigmarol. He accused me of having a hissey fit and said he might tell me about a tygon upgrade when I got done. I hung up on the jerk. Bottom line, it does do the job when it is new, customer service is non existent or arogant at best.
B000C9PFJK|5|Just like oem
B00ABTJ8CQ|5|These are a great improvement over my old hubcaps. Quick to install. Look great.
B00MJLCV5U|3|They aftermarket taillights look good and worked fine for about 18 months. Right side Brake / Turn Signal socket in the circuit board fried after 18 months. I would have expected longer life from the product.
B005RR8DGO|5|Item arrived as stated. Easy to install. Great product and classy illumination. Highly recommended.
B00PXNC7K0|5|originally purchased the steel version of this at Northern Tools but returned it.  This one is so much lighter.  Highly recommend purchasing the anti wobble adapter also.  Absolutely no wobble after we added it.  We do use extra ratchet straps for peace of mind.  Works well on travel trailer.
B0007M1ZGE|5|Just what we needed.  Works great.  Easy to use.
B001O0AMNK|4|They look nice... the coating flakes off easily.<br />Also, its a deep maroon color... not red..
B00B85CG5S|5|great look ,fits to a tee.
B010C6URQI|5|Extra cold
B005J94L0C|4|It's not quite a perfect fit, as light seeps in around the edges.<br />It also sags a little in the middle.<br /><br />That's it.  Nothing else wrong with it.  Even on a 100 degree day, it makes a massive difference.  With the Ford Focus, the front window lets in as much light as all the other's combined.  Cutting light out of the front drops the temperature from a scalding, &#34;Get out of the car and roll the windows down before the AC kicks on!&#34; to a &#34;This heat would be uncomfortable if seated in if for a long time.&#34;<br /><br />It makes a big difference and is worth the money.
B002EVIL40|5|i got these for my 94 ACCORD and they fit perfect.... since skunk2 dose not make one for accord.
B000HBNWHA|5|5 Stars. !!!
B0035U52KA|5|Great pad for a great price. They are a big improvement over stock pads. They don't fade in track environment and have great stopping power, even for weak stock calipers that come on SVs.
B00KJGPMZI|5|the best!
B00029KC2U|3|Poor adhesion characteristics...fell off after a few weeks
B00IU22TJ0|5|Love it!!!!
B000AMLWH8|4|No residue. Works great. Spray malfunctions hence reducing stars.
B00IWEV104|5|Nice!
B00029XGAU|2|The horn sounds kinda funny, not deep and has a cartoonish tone to it. Easy to install but will probably replace in the future and wouldn't buy again. Also online here it says 110 decibels but it is stamped saying its 100. Not really a big deal I'm just saying.
B00LKKU4YQ|5|Works great and easy to swap between vehicles.
B001K2JAEE|5|Works as intended. Fits snugly. Can come off in high wind so useful to use the buckle strap (which is a bit of a pain to get on). Get's the job done and keeps my car protected!
B0050Z9QBY|5|They worked great a little customation on my end but other than that plug and play. Very satisfied with the product. No DOA parts
B00MJ470RG|3|Fits 2008 Toyota Highlander OK... I noticed one of the seams already falling apart after only couple of weeks of light use.
B00AMNKULO|5|Great price and good quality.
B005I5GLCS|5|I wasn't looking forward to changing my daughter's inner tie-rod at all on her 2005 dodge neon. But after I got this tool, I couldn't believe how easy it made the job for me. It took me longer to deal with the stupid rubber boot than it did to change the tie-rod. The factory tie-rod was smooth (no flat spots), the replacement tie-rod had flat spots. But it didn't matter this tool grabbed ahold of both types and loosened and tightened them both, no problem. You could use a wrench but a 30mm or a 1inch 3/16 socket makes it easyer to use a torque wrench.
B000CQPL5Q|5|perfect fit.
B001RB61LS|5|My horde decal showed up with clear instructions as to how to apply it to my rear windshield. With a lot of patience, I was able to get this decal on with no bubbling or anything. It lasted quite a bit of time and the only reason I don't have it now is due to having switched cars. I am definitely planning on ordering this decal again in the future.
B005K8YEHW|5|My husband was excited about this! It was a great size and not too heavy for his keys!
B00HEVF34Q|5|GREAT FIT FOR MY DAKOTA, NO LEAKS.
B000JKLG3Q|5|Put this on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee 4.0l and it works great. No codes thrown, and it bolts right up.
B00I1PT70A|5|Very nice helmet and so good price! Real good dea here!
B0082GL0MQ|5|I bought these for a gift for my teenage nephew and his first car, 1991 Ford Probe. These were a great price and got the order in two working days.<br />I put them outside for a little while to tone-down the new rubber smell and they are great. Good service and no problems here.
B009902Y4C|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B00BM7G63A|5|Excellent Battery, have used it before, and always gets the job done
B0009IQZH0|5|Great Product, Would buy again
B0101577VI|3|shipping was good. Came in quick.<br />The product was junk. The lenses came off while I was putting them on the car, had to seal them again. One of the clips was bent completely incorrectly, had to bend it properly. And they don't really fit all that well, which means water will go where it isn't wanted. And the lens cracked when I tried to put the passenger side light in.<br /><br />If you're reading this, buy from someone else.
B0007XB48C|4|Love the  hood design but tape would not stay had to used a heavy duty auto detail tape.
B004947U8S|5|Very good!!!!
B008RWABHU|5|very good stuff within a bout a week my car started running much better. lucas makes great products
B00CASDZKC|5|These worked perfectly
B00PBH1TI4|5|Perfect fit!
B00N36OP7W|5|Happily, I have not had to use this product yet, but it was our peace of mind on a recent boat trip.  Knowing that we have the ability to jump an engine with the jumpstarter gave us the confidence to keep the refrigerator running over night.  Also, it is nice to know we have the ability to charge our smartphone and devices.  Prior to buying this, we carted around a Honda 1000 generator on our trips, which takes up a lot of space, blows carbon monoxide near the boat, and requires extra gasoline to be transported.  The jumpstarter is so much more convenient.
B00BPZAFFO|5|Nice replacement part and now it won't get snagged at the carwash.<br />Works great.
B008KV4IIG|5|perfect for my beloved gas guzzling CCK.
B0010Z4MDK|4|Perfect Fit for my Ion, Easy to Install, fully Charged, Quick Delivery.
B000MIUJMO|4|Worked well for a &#34;basic&#34; test of my coolant.<br />It doesn't replace more sophisticated testing devices,<br />but it does give you a ballpark result.<br />With it, I could see that one of my vehicles definitely needed<br />to have a coolant flush and new fluid.
B004MDEVBA|2|This hitch hits the muffler on 2015 Juke AWD. My mechanic ground off the back side of the tube hitting the muffler which seemed to work but the muffler also hits on the passenger side. The rattling is not all the time but was enough to possibly wear a hole in the muffler where back side of the tube was hitting. There is very little variance in movement right to left so the hitting on the passenger side if not bolted up correctly will hit all the time. My suggestion is not to buy this but if you do take it to a mechanic grind off the small piece at the back of the tube close to the muffler and make sure you have the clearance left to right.
B0009IQZPW|5|These sponges are great and very high quality.
B00M78820I|5|I really like it. The video helped me learned how to fold it. It keeps my vehicle cooler. I'm glad I purchased it.
B00KWGU71Y|5|Fits well and works great
B00JN0U4SQ|3|Nice deal but with the time, the product has a problem with the sun.. it lose his color.
B003VVSFL6|1|Very bulky and impairs vision -sent back
B00AYU8BUC|5|Love,Love,Love this stove!!!  Also purchased the griddle and the grill box to go along with the stove.  Great for camping or at home, outdoor cooking. Easy to break down for transporting, easy to put back together. The only thing I wish it had was an auto start button do I didn't have to use a flame to start it each time.
B007Y0N3L2|4|Ramps are great
B0023W3C5I|5|Works like a charm!
B00269815E|3|Screw on portion of cord does not fit very well.
B002P8OUBA|4|So far so good
B00802GIW4|2|I bought this product but did not work I called for technical assistance but they couldn't give me any help
B00DGVRXD2|5|Great!
B00UGZ2SIQ|5|Works fantastic completely OEM replacement couldn't of been happier
B00B5ZY07I|4|Product arrived on time and well packaged.  Really needed only the screws to finish off a customer license plate frame.  The square inserts are of a decent quality.  The trim caps and rings seem a bit of the cheap side and may not hold up well.
B001JT0KPQ|4|I picked this up to test it for small metalsmithing projects. While I am used to a propane torch, this works pretty well for most small jewelry projects. It certainly out performs similar torches in the price range. Plus it's safe and portable. I like the controls compared to others too. I have recommended this to others.
B005VWYZKI|5|So far so good. Installed over the weekend in my 2005 Honda Accord EX-L (4 door iVtec). The front driver door stopped working consistently about 2 month ago until it finally stopped working altogether. Having read online that it could be either poor battery in the remote or the vehicle battery—I replaced the remote batteries and tested the main battery, but the problem persisted.<br /><br />I found a number of alternative (off-brand) options for less, but I am glad I did not purchase them. Once you go to the trouble of taking apart the door, unscrewing the latch mechanism, and then finessing the whole thing out to the open, you won't want to do it again. With that in mind, the part was an exact match to the factory—except that the new one worked! No I have my remote entry again.<br /><br />My two cents of advice, take you time doing the install/replacement. The most annoying thing was getting the plastic latches back around the metal arms that go to the door handle and the key lock. All in all, following a youtube video, it took about an hour to make the install. Well worth buying OEM.
B00O7XYRQO|5|This is just what we needed and it's the perfect size.  We will all feel more comfortable knowing that other drivers will be more understanding and honk less at my daughter as she's learning to drive. Very easy to see and fits perfectly on the bumper.
B0041PZ2FI|2|Love the look, bummed it doesn't fit tank like they said it would.  It wonr screw in straight, only at an angle.
B005JPJK8O|5|Quality product
B002PL59RG|4|Great price. Honestly the only reason this doesn't get five stars is the OE shift handle needed to be filed down to fit and once it fit and screw was installed there was tiny amount of play in it. Also was a little tight til the unit was re-greased. Key release cable worked fine though.
B0031ZDU62|1|they worked
B003TTL0TE|5|Builds thinks suds and removes stuck on grime with minimal scrubbing or swirl marks.  Seems to rinse quite well after use.  Does take a long time to dry but that is to be expected with how much  liquid this thing holds.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Provide nice rear vision for my 22' trailer from my 2010 Denali.
B002U5XPLO|5|This is a 4:1 ratio mix and had my doubts about using this in a DIESEL, but it worked - stopped my rear main seal leak after a 700 mile road trip.  You do have to put some miles on your vehicle to get this to work, so do not expect this to work after you drive it to work once or twice
B00C304S7G|5|Thanks!
B00KO77C5A|5|Built well and very easy to install and uninstall. Plus, you also get a free upper body workout with every placement and removal. The weight of this thing lets you know that it was put together well. Looking forward to hooking up my camper and getting lost, I feel confident  that this hitch will outlast the truck that I put it into. Great product.
B00EZBSEAS|5|Perfect fit. Made in Japan, looks like factory lighting. Oem.
B000UOGREO|5|bst price
B000E4IGKI|3|product is very cheaply made, hence the price.  bracket is less rigid than the original, light bounces around more easily.
B0087XOTWW|5|:)
B00BITHKY6|5|Exel t
B00008RW9V|3|expensive works ok
B00WM2I9P2|5|A little hard to install considering I had to order mounts but made it work and it's very bright I am impressed and I put silicon around it so it shouldn't get any water in it
B000Q71N8K|3|Heats up quick takes a long time to cool down. AC adapter gets pretty warm. Make sure it isn't covered by anything.
B00G93D4SM|5|LOVE IT!!!
B0054HNQ32|5|Bought a lot of theses work as described all of them work and none have broke. I don't putt the max load on them but it is there if I need it.
B0049DYW1M|4|Great quality. BUT it doesn't fit my 98 F150. This plug has connections on the back that your original wires and plug, plug into. My truck has screw terminals.
B00G6FDT7E|2|Blew out on me after 3 months
B007JEK29O|4|fit 1991 Nissan 300ZX with some tweeting, works good so far
B00E4QHN0Q|2|It was cool for the few days that it lasted. But not long after it started peeling and I just couldn't get it to stay on properly. Gotta be honest and say that overall, I'm disappointed with the quality.
B0056YQEL4|2|They are good pads.... but they are for the rear not the front.. I needed my front pads in a hurry so bought these because of amazon prime. They got here quick and looked great but only went on the rear of my klr 650 1998....  I was very disappointed as I need them right then. Had to miss some riding opportunities and had to buy another pair of pads
B003Y323NC|5|Good product
B0009V1WTS|5|Great quality but too short for me.
B00EMKAINI|5|Exactly what I needed.  Bought an '06 4Runner used, and it only had the front mats.  The driver side mat had a hole worn through it, so it needed replacing, so why not get a full set?  These really make the interior look new again.
B00QMWQOHS|5|Great!!!!
B006ODTR0G|5|Identical product to what the &#34;Stealer&#34; would sell you for over $100.  Gives the car an improved image.  Easy to install.
B00BOEN1M0|5|What more is there to say......it's a custom license plate accessory. Had it for over two months now and it's still looks great.
B008G3KA8A|2|I received the incorrect make and model, even though I put in my correct info.
B002PQMLSG|3|The fog lights are the same as the original one's.i replaced the halogen blubs with LED blubs...they work and look good:)
B00VKM3PSQ|3|Material for auto cover is fine but the size for Kia Sedona is not perfect fit or not even close, at least 2 feet extra.
B000WYYP14|5|Packaged well.  Antenna works great.
B009XA5LNO|1|This filter does not fit 2015 Nissan Rogue SL AWD. This filter is meant to fit Rogue Select models.
B009F590L6|5|Took 1 hour to install on a 2011 escape.  Exact fit.  Did not have to drill any holes.
B004LF1U5O|5|Saw a big difference in braking and zero fade now. Works great. Will order again.
B00JA3BMDW|3|Was a gift to my husband
B000AA4CAO|5|I love this keychain It hangs from my mirror In my Jeep with me and Charlie my Basset Hound
B000GZNO8E|4|worked well.
B0007LVJ2A|2|it is fine for what it is, but the description didn't tell me it would only fit 2&#34; adapters.
B00HPPLRFA|3|not too easy to use
B004RNOVTM|4|Kinda stiff but works for what I needed it for
B002UXBELY|1|Already had one light burn out after 43 days of use. I suppose these items are 2nds.
B0062AHEM4|5|Perfect fit and match for our Leaf!
B00BMRRXSM|4|Really nice beverage holder.  Good construction.  Stable while standing up.  Easy to assemble and easy to disassemble for storage.  The cup holders fit a coozie really well.  Be careful with bottles and cans that are open.  These can be loose in the holder and tip slightly.
B00407RT5S|3|Ok
B001FAO8I4|4|Arrived as advertised. Not used yet but will post again after  use...
B001CEG90I|5|Ordered it for my Toyota RAV4 2014. It fits perfectly. No issues so far.<br />Replacing it is a P.I.A. though because TOYOTA set up the filter housing behind the glove box. Glove box has to be removed to change the filter. When replacing, make sure to insert it top side up, look for the arrow on front, otherwise airflow will be reduced a lot as mentioned by few people in their review.<br />Will update later, if there are any issues.
B00FB7ZCPK|4|Brake line that was supplied was short for my sand rail I ended up using steel brake line
B00MG687JW|5|Has a lot of adapters and a really nice little kit.
B0030GBBRW|5|Super easy to install! 5 minutes to replace both hood struts and they work great!
B00NX4OV96|5|I rescued two puggles and they are my heart. Love this frame
B00029J38E|5|Love the sound of these. Different sound then flowmasters.
B00VA1EP4K|5|When I opened up the Cartman warning triangle, I was very surprised by how this thing was made.  I was expecting some thin piece of plastic, no this thing is made to last!  It is 17' triangle that will stand up even with 40 meter winds.  This product also has two small sides legs off the side of the triangle, the big thing is the middle support leg it has velco on the bottom of it and it full of sand.  The price on this thing is great! It comes in a nice red case that you can keep in your car, which would be great for when your traveling! This product really surprised me! It snaps together like a tight puzzle piece.  I would suggest to anyone!<br /><br />this product was given to me for free in exchange for an unbiased review
B003CH3Z8W|5|Works well, makes my discs last longer than the stock harbor freight one.
B00NF1TITK|4|Ordered this for a 3.8L 2005 Grand Caravan.  The item fits perfectly however, the spring for the interior door handle is a lot tighter than the OEM one.  This is just something that will most likely get a little better with time.  The door lock however, is operating perfectly and at half the dealer price this was a great buy.
B005ESZRI8|5|Happy with product. Fit perfectly.
B000C2UD26|4|This hose is OEM and it fit, It would have been rated 5 Stars but it did not come with the proctection outer cover.  The protective outer cover is required due to the hose rest on the AC unit mounting bolt and housing
B0012BL8LG|5|Use this for our electric cooler when traveling. Works great.
B000BRQ0TW|5|Was able to fix a leak in the hose in my koi pond.
B012UNAT7I|4|F1 adapters were not included, but lucky for me, didn't need them.
B00O2IQ230|5|These wipers do an outstanding job of clearing the windshield. Simple to install. They maintain consistent pressure over the entire length of the blade; no smearing; no skipping. They come with a strip of plastic to protect the wiping edge, which I found surprising--they seem to care a lot about maintaining their quality.
B000X3EVY0|5|always like these  and have them on both my vehicles.  no more dust
B00BAZBOTU|5|Item works as promised
B000C7YQ2E|1|not for a 1972 f100!!
B00MQFHZOG|5|great item
B002OUMW32|5|Good quality.  Have always liked the Rhino brand septic parts for RV's.  They stand the test of time and their pipes are easier to store and use.  I've had my original Rhino pipe system for 7 years and it's still going strong!!
B000UVENVG|5|Love them! Easy to install and look great!
B00HET17RK|5|Good quality and perfect solution for the little one to get onto the top bunk of our camper. Sturdy enough for my 200 lb frame to get up there as well.
B007T12VRI|1|Didn't fit my car...full refund was given
B0002Z9O8C|5|This is exactly what I needed to allow the bike rack to clear the spare tire on my Jeep Wrangler.
B0039KZFSA|5|Exactly as described.
B009FUFBTG|5|GREAT!
B00IZNVS8W|4|love it.
B00PB7UONU|1|Purchased this kit for Toyota 13BT Direct injection engine, doesn't fit the injector studs.
B00U9YZVWE|1|Waste of money and time ...do not buy!!!
B00NANLIVY|5|Works perfectly! Simple to install. I was able to do it in about 15 - 20 minutes. Didn't even break a sweat. If you want to add a remote starter to your Jeep or Chrysler, this is definitely the easiest and cheapest way to go. Don't be fooled, this is not cheap junk, this is a really good high quality product. Fortin knows what they're doing. Best part, it came pre-programmed. Made life even easier. No need to purchase the programmer separately and only need it once.
B0002UNOYM|3|I have one major complaint about this product. Agreed it looks great, but only for the first couple days. This formula has so much lubricant/oil that it DOES make swirls and fine scratches disappear, BUT these same oils attract so much dust!! When it's fresh, it will feel smooth and slick to the touch, but it'll need a quick rinse and dry to blow the dust off every couple days. This result is found on a freshly clayed and waxed garage kept 2012 Dyno Blue Honda. It's not a bad product, but I have had less dust attraction using Meguires deep crystal liquid wax. It's annoying when you want to keep your car clean. If it doesn't rain, it should remain clean. Right??
B000GTUM9O|5|Perfect!
B000JFJLP6|5|Husband has used it several times already to jump start a lawn mower.  Starts right up.  He loves it. He has not had to recharge it yet.
B005ZZH86O|5|Perfect fit and was like it was custom measured for my 2014 Ford Flex!!!!
B00COOS5NY|2|I recently bought a set for my 2005 chevy silverado. They worked perfectly for a week.. Then one of the ballasts took a chit.! Then 2 days after the bulb blew out on the passenger side. These lights are very bright. But unreliable.
B000QIVFVE|5|Perfect fit on my 2015 GMC Acadia. Saved $300 over dealer price.
B000CAINEI|1|Based on my experience, this quality of this product is poor.  It flops lops over and does not remain stiff and in windshield.  As a result, I consider the product to be useless and would not buy it again.
B00GUF74HQ|3|Really worked good but 7 months later the tailgate side mount has come loose.
B000C2YWX2|5|Good
B0016HNVAM|5|Totally fixed the tailgate of my 2008 GMC Acadia. One day it just wouldn't open. This release switch fixed our problem and was easy to install.
B00498KJVY|5|I have a 2008 Jeep Liberty with powered (non-heated) mirrors.  After browsing around the web for a while I was a little bit nervous about the connector.  I was happy to see that the seller included a picture of the connector, which made my decision much simpler.  With the help of some quick web searches I was able to replace my original smashed mirror with this one in just under 10 minutes.  This replacement looks exactly like the original and the power controls are fully functioning.  Buying this mirror direct probably saved me around $150 in mark-up and labor.
B00BYFSCC8|5|A Great Product, 400,000 miles and going.
B00KTHZ2EI|5|Easy to program and much cheaper than the dealership! Very happy with this purchase
B00HFHE4PI|5|A perfect Fit with fast delivery.
B009DJQGWA|5|Perfect!
B00NK016JG|5|no problems with this mat nothing moved On top of this and protected the roof of my car nicely .
B0012PSZI6|4|Finally installed these, Love the ride, and they look good on the vehicle too.
B00DC4OFHK|5|Worked great!
B00TI9OFLO|4|to big
B0002F9YHS|4|Great product for the money.  Brought sun faded leather back to life.  Best results came from a liberal application.
B000B5ZM6Q|5|Exactly what I want. The delevery was in time. Fit very well.
B0000AYFTH|5|As expected.
B000BUU5XQ|5|Works great!  Highly recommend
B00471RMW2|5|I love this keyring.
B0049U3LB2|5|Excelente
B006ID37ZS|4|If you're using this for a Victory, note that the scale does not go all the way up to 72 psi, which is the maximum, at least for a Vision. Outside of that, it's a very nice tool, well constructed.
B001050JMS|3|Overpriced for what it is...but hard to find a camper toy so it's better than nothing
B000C4AI92|5|Perfect in every way. The local auto parts store gets about 1/3 more $ for being able to get it today. I think I'll plan ahead.
B0049I6TJA|5|Works well ,wish I had them on all my gas engines
B0064DRNAC|4|I haven't used it much yet but it is faster that the one I replaced it with.  It should last longer also.  The downside is it takes up more room.
B00GRWOS7Q|4|Helmet and goggles fit great, but the gloves are too small and I was never asked what size gloves I wore they just sent same size as helmet disappointed with that factor. The helmet was comfortable and lightweight very breathable would recommend
B00IV50JTS|1|Great concept with the fan out front, but the HARD plastic channels are too much to take - returned it.
B00LBPK05S|3|This is not a bad option if you're trying to operate on a budget.  It bolts up (eventually) and holds a spare, so it gets the job done.  It doesn't come with all required hardware, and the rattle stop isn't wide enough to be effective (therefore it rattles).  I have a 360 with headers and glass packs, so I barely hear it.  The bumper doesn't have shackle attachment points.  The details here aren't specific, and lead you to believe that there are in fact shackle mounts.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I saved a couple hundred bucks, and got something &#34;good enough&#34;, more important than a cool bumper is a way to carry a 35&#34; tire.<br /><br />Add about an hour to your estimated install time for a trip to the hardware store for more nuts and bolts, and make sure you have a 6' tamping bar on hand to mongo it into position.
B00GR8V7LU|4|I really like the jaguar key ring. It is of good quality.
B003IS3HV0|5|Absolutely Awesome!!!
B007IJ1SNO|3|While they do fit &#34;in&#34; the alloted space of the saddlebags and trunk, these are not a good fit and do not follow the contours of the 2014 GL 1800.
B002JSM7HA|2|I was using silicone brake fluid (Dot 5) and was very difficult to push that fluid through it<br />. Might be better with with DOT 3 or 4.
B00M1X6F9Y|4|Good buy.  Sturdy.  I'll use it for hauling logs on the three-point-hitch.
B0006SH4KU|5|When the product is used as directed, it is phenomenal in cleaning glass and not streaking or clouding a few hours later.
B00M04CIFO|5|Have gotten many compliments on it!
B0019I33FQ|5|work as designed and described.  expensive spark plugs though.
B0002UQAY8|5|These are great
B00KZCALVQ|5|Super bright and works great!
B00FE7DR9U|5|Shipped quickly and arrived as promised.
B003YNHEBS|1|Did not fit my 2007 sienna. Wrong plug, otherwise it looked like a good part.
B005FL5HFW|5|Fit my 2005 Honda Pilot perfectly.  Installation was easy especially taking into account this was the first time I had ever tried it.  Learned it all from youtube.  Brakes are nice and quiet and perform well.  I would definitely buy these again.  The one drawback with the set are the clips that hold the pads in place.  They are too narrow for the rotors and they squeak like crazy.  I had to take them out and use the old ones.  Other than that, no issues at all.
B004KEIFTK|1|I got this from a local auto supply store because it was the only type they had in stock.  There are several problems with this tool.  First, the hex head requires a HUGE socket wrench (14/16&#34;) to drive it, which will not fit down most spark plug holes.  I ground the head down to fit a smaller socket wrench (it would have fit if it had had a square hole at the end for a 3/8&#34; socket wrench extension), why they didn't make it to fit in a standard spark plug socket I don't know.  Once I got it so I could get it at the threads, I found that the teeth are too short at the tip, meaning there wasn't enough thread behind the teeth to pull it down into the hole so the next row could cut - end on it looks like a table saw blade at the tip - it has 6 flutes unlike most taps that have 4.  The tap also start larger than the diameter of the spark plug threads, which adds to the problem of getting it to start.  Perhaps if you pre-drilled the head to the diameter of this tap and were VERY careful it could be made to work.  Frankly, I think this may just be a stock cheap 18mm tap that wasn't made for this application.<br /><br />Rather than mess with it more, I ordered a similar tool that has many more stars from this site.  Either it works, or I'll be paying $$$$ for a mechanic to do this or replace the head.
B004ZF4MW8|5|Good product, I called customer service after noticing one light flicker.  they recommended swapping the bulb, which resulted in knowing that the ballast was bad.  Chester at Customer service sent me a replacement Ballast.  The light did not go off like it did with the original ballast, but sometime flickers.  They also recommended that I install the relay kit and let me know that my problems may have been related to my automatic lights.  I have a 2011 Kia Sorento and they look and work great.  Good so far, i'll install the relay kit and see if that fixes the flickering.
B0039O1UWQ|4|It is light and nice, but the hardware (nuts and metal threded bars for the clamp unit) are not coated or galvanized so it will rust.  So I have to unmount the basket and leave it in my garage to prevent rusting. Otherwise, this would have a great unit to have it on my car all the time and avoid the hassle of put it on and off whenever I need to use it.
B000CQ4ANU|1|The product came as advertised. I purchsed this to install a door vapor barrier on a BMW. I have previously used a Windo-Weld product sold in caulking tubs with great success, but wanted to see if pre-extruded ribbon sealer was easier to apply.  The bead is not sufficintly sticky for my intended use either due to compound design or storage aging. Not even remotely as sticky as the original BMW black sealing compound I had to remove. It kept the vapor barrier is place, but when I tested peel away toughness it kept separating from both metal and foam wapor material.  There is no clear indication of manufacturing date on the package or &#34;good for&#34; statements. The product does not come sealed in the bag  that would protect it from oxygen aging. Buy at your own risk.  If I had to do it again I would not buy this product.  UPDATE: THE PRODUCT HAS COMPLETELY FAILED IN THIS APPLICATION AFTER 6 MONTH.
B00KCXMCTM|5|I used this to remove from pieces to change my cabin air filter. Left no marks and were easy to use. Each tool is labeled for what kind of trim piece its meant for, keeping you from looking like a monkey trying to figure out how to use them.
B00797HWJE|5|Beautiful casting.  Looks great with my finned valve covers.  Has great weight to it.  Good quality product!
B00192KZQ2|5|Hard plastic and let stuff be seen very easily. Gross for many but not for the dooer.
B00EW6LDLI|5|I love this decal to bits. It looks amazing on my blue kayak! It has stood up to multiple rigorous kayaking trips, so no problem with water or anything of that sort. The application was a bit tricky but was worth it because of how great the decal looked on. I would recommend this product to any minion lover!
B000RXNLK6|4|I'm not sure what the instructions on the back of the bottle says but I would never rub any kind of detailer or wax on any of my cars unless the car had just been washed and dried. Think about it, even if the car just had road dirt from everyday<br /> driving when you apply the detailer and<br /><br />I'm not sure what the instructions on the back of the bottle says but I would never rub any wax or detailer on any of my cars. Think about it. Even if a car just had road dirt from everyday driving, rubbing back and forth with the detailer,  microfiber or any other cloth will put swirl marks in the clear coat or paint and especially on a black or any other dark colored car. I would always use this product only on a vehicle that had just been washed thoroughly and dried. I used this product on my Infiniti G35 and it did a great job, still have not driven in the rain to see if the detailer makes the water bead like the product claims.
B009GO6CYO|5|absolutely love this product, has saved me a lot of hard work, so easy to life and low the tongue on the travel trailer
B008Y8WP26|4|I purchased this to replace the cap on the rear arm rest of my 2015 GMC Yukon XL Denali.  It fits great.  The color is slightly off but not noticeably when in place.
B004D5SUIC|4|item as described  not used yet.
B000MIUHS0|5|Great for the price, and I love keeping my glasses up and out of the way.  I had another cheap plastic on in my car but I did not like that it did not have the latch so I went back to this style.  I just like how it is more secure, they never fall out unless you hit the button.
B00TPUKW0E|3|Did not fit returned
B009Y7MJVS|5|It works great for the new Ipass 8/3/2015.<br /><br />I like that I can easily take it off the windshield the second I am not using it.<br />Highly recommended! Great product! It fits like a glove
B00BDJB0AG|3|Returned
B000EBKG9A|5|I bought this for a rather unusual use - darkening the TV in our bedroom. Even at minimum brightness it was way too bright to comfortably watch in the dark. This tint film really did the trick. It's reflective and not so great when the room is bright but later in the day the screen is a much more reasonable brightness. The color shifted slightly towards purple but I was able to almost compensate for it with screen calibration. It was very easy to apply and my $2 squeegee worked wonders for removing the air bubbles. I used the extra on our sunrise facing windows and it blocks out a respectable amount of heat and glare.
B00LY8Z58O|5|Perfect fit for 2002 Yukon with rear air!  Heads up... When you change yours out, make sure your assembly's condensation drain tube is clear!  Mine was plugged up, so I had lots of standing water inside the assembly.
B0013HP98C|5|Didn't want to drill holes into the front of my bumper on my F30. With this i was able to drill from under concealing the holes and mount my license plate (stupid CA laws)
B000CN95RO|5|I installed this kit myself onto my 1985 Corvette. This was very labor intensive but did not require any tools beyond what can be rented at a parts store. This kit really firmed up the car a lot and makes it more responsive on the road. I am extremely happy and felt that I got my money's worth out of this kit.
B00CZ1BS1C|1|my guard was crooked, could nto put on my bike, had to buy a new oe right from Harley
B00IBK8C2E|5|after 105,000 miles liftgate works like new again,after installing the new liftgate shocks
B0082LKFG8|5|Good
B00MX77Q5K|1|Great deal for all in one struts, but the ones I recieved had bad mounts. As soon as I backed or of the driveway after the install they were squeaking horribly. I emailed Unity and they did agree to refund my purchase no problems.
B00C7Z4I54|4|Good coverage.
B000CIIAT8|5|According to Amazon's information these spindles do not fit GM  G - body vehicles. They absolutely do!  These in my opinion are the best way to do a 2&#34; drop. The fit was perfect, they did not affect my suspension geometry at all. I had them installed within 3 hrs. I was able to use my backing plates / dust shields without any interference. That might not be the case for every vehicle - but for me they fit perfectly. I highly recommend these for a 2&#34; drop.
B001O0544W|1|I have now had two TYC alternators for two different cars.  This one for the Honda, has been replaced twice.  The warratny info: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001O0544W?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00 provided by TYC to Amazon isn't easy either for anyone involved.  Ultimately Amazon has to take the return and then give it to TYC.  Takes forever.  Pay $20 more for another brand.  It is worth it in the long run.
B00BITJZ6M|3|the fit was slightly off but it works as expected.
B001GF7MFE|1|Says that is fits for my car.  It does not
B002SSEWD8|5|Perfect fit.
B008RIEQXY|4|Nice little lights.  They do the trick.
B000BUU5UO|4|good
B001GBJQRK|5|I purchased this item on the recommendation from my girlfriend. Love this product...actual install took less than a minutes for my 95' Ford.
B004A0RDGK|5|Premium product
B004PXAUGC|5|They work perfectly
B0099M2RYC|4|I haven't had much opportunity to use it but so far there have been no bad smells and the tank has been easy to empty.
B0072IRLRI|5|Best riding sunglasses. I have a small head and these sunglasses fit perfect. They never move even while I'm going 70 + mph with my half helmet on. I've purchased three pairs in different colors so far. Will probably buy more :)
B000C9UJ6E|5|Delivered on time, as described, and in good condition--thanks!
B0016C3STQ|4|Does the Job
B003FWW4EU|5|Does exactly what it is supposed to and does it well. This is my second one. The first one is still going strong, but it has been permanently borrowed by my significant other. :-)
B000VKODIO|5|The maintenance guide indicates you only have to do this every 30k miles but I recommend you do this every 15k miles as it's not that expensive to do. I drive mostly highway miles and everyone I pull this out at the 15k mile mark and examine the filter, it's pretty gross. No need to buy this part from the dealer at an inflated price, this one works great!
B002OJ9YR0|3|Easy to install. Haven't needed it to work yet thank god.
B00HNMLQAG|5|very good
B000C9O80M|5|Perfect fit
B00BYFXPFM|5|Pretty easy to put on because all the triangles are separate so it's a lot easier to buff out small bubbles! Looks great on my car!
B003R2PYUY|2|These seat covers are a pain to put on. Every piece of lint imaginable sticks to them, and it's not easy to get off.
B00KTHZR7K|1|This did not work for me.  Chrysler could not program to my car.  I returned it and received a full refund.
B00TMFA78Y|5|Great magnet. Great sentiment.Woof.
B00HJDI22E|1|A lot less bright than stock bulbs. Do not but, if you want LED go with the ASTAR<br /><br />I like the JDM 194 the best.
B009PAK6V4|5|I love these seat covers it brings my car to life !! I couldn't ask for more ! Most definitely will order from here again ! also was very easy to install!!
B009S69SD2|5|Happy with product. Fit perfectly.
B00FFRSWYE|1|one star for smell that's it, two weeks max if you are lucky so don't wast your money for something they'll only last maybe two weeks. After that this thing is pretty much useless.
B000K1MYF8|5|Fit my 06 F-350 great.  Saved nearly $200 over the local tire and suspension shop's quote doing this myself.  It was easier than I thought it would be.  No more front end clank and rattle!!
B003VARC8Y|5|Wow this stuff cleans really well. It's a lot cheaper at Walmart. Shipping to my house was slow. My batteries on my golf cart look great again.
B00192QBPQ|1|First product would allow gas into the hose but the other end would not allow gas to flow thru to my new Coleman grill.  Sent it back and the second hose acted in exactly the same way.  The grill works fine with the small Coleman tanks.  It appears the problem is releasing the pin on the check valve on the grill end of the hose.  IT REQUIRES MAKING THE CONNECTION VERY TIGHT.  Then it works fine.  HOWEVER, the next time I tried to use it I had the same problem and it would not allow the gas to flow properly to the Coleman grill.  We tried loosening and tightening but no luck.  Bought a Coleman throwaway tank so I could cook breakfast for our guests. What is of concern is that I see all these positive reviews.
B000ZN17Q8|1|Did not use.  Won't fit Pontiac Solstice.
B005EY2X16|5|Got this for my 2011 Chevrolet Equinox that came with factor rails, but no cross bars (way to think that one through Chevrolet). Fit perfect and looks factory.
B00CQ7W0Q2|5|Great product awesome stellar item received sooner than posted.
B003YKV1J2|5|EASY to install. Looks GREAT on my truck(Ford F150)
B006QGD996|4|These are basic, skinny straps. The ratchets are small, but they work.
B007GLCTPK|3|It is a strong smell, but it is no where close to the &#34;New Car&#34; smell. Disappointed.
B002TMQ4AM|5|Love it works great.
B0000AXR6I|5|Change the plugs in my outboard and started it up in a snap. Already set at the right gauge.<br />Good job. You have a return customer.
B00M78820I|5|Great sunshade.  Golds in and out with ease.  Keeping the car cooler already!
B001BTNKBK|5|great deal ,nice jacket my girl loves it
B00R8MPIDM|5|A++
B010H0QV00|4|This is an all around, handy tool  to keep in your glove box. The most valuable part is the glass breaker  and it makes the entire piece a bargain. The light  is bright, the tire gauge is very accurate. I compared  it to the gas station's and the numbers were identical. My only issue is how difficult  it is to access the multi tool feature. I have nails and  was not able to open them. Maybe a guy would do it with ease but  I found it impossible and if I needed  the scissors  or saw to cut a seat belt, it wouldn't be good.<br />Item received free from vendor for evaluation  and review
B00LU0UBH6|5|It does a really good job.  The telescoping handle is great to reach across the roof.  The design is great, and the soft grip is comfortable even for my big hands.  This thing is bigger then it looks in the pics, which makes dusting faster.  In just a couple of minutes I cleaned the exterior of my new car and it mad a big difference.  I just used washed and put on paint sealant on the car a week before, so when the dust came off, it looked like I had just washed it again!  The metal handle is thin and light, but feels solid enough to hold up to long term use.  Best tip would be to go SLOW and take your time.  Here is what happened:<br /><br />The first time I used it, I was in a big hurry.  I notice that if I went too fast some of the dust is left behind, and had to go over the same spot twice.  Also, because I was going too fast, I snagged a loop and it pulled it long, but if you find a short loop, you can pull it and even them out.  The handle extends, and then with a twist, locks at any length which is great.  But I did try to extend it too far and the handle came out (guess I don't know my own strength).  Good news is that when I forced it back in, all worked well.<br /><br />It comes in a plastic sleeve, but I don't know if you are supposed to keep it in there (but I am) for storage.  The only thing is that the plastic is thin and collapses which makes it hard to push it in without some work.  I wish it had a better storage bag with some care and cleaning instructions on the package, but I guess I can shake the dust out, and find cleaning tips on the internet.
B004AQW02Q|5|fast and good price
B00NJAKONQ|5|I purchased the aluminum Mount-n-Lock heavy duty bumper modular cargo carrier tray that goes with the Mount-n-Lock heavy duty aluminum bumper.  I installed the bumper myself and it took several hours but am extremely happy with the end result.  The bumper is advertised to be rated at 1,000 lbs and I believe it would definitely do just that.  After installing the heavy duty aluminum bumper, we took a 2,500 mile road trip with 4 bikes and an electric scooter on the back with no problems.  I checked the hitch, bike rack and bumper numerous times and saw no movement or flexing at all.  I never would have attempted this trip with the stock RV bumper holding 4 bikes.  I'm certain the bumper would have torn off at the welds.<br />After the trip, I ordered the aluminum Mount-n-Lock heavy duty bumper modular cargo carrier tray.  I have not used it on a road trip yet but did install it at home and stood in the middle of the tray and bounced up and down.  Again, no movement or flexing at all.  I'm really impressed with the tray.  The fit and finish is impressive.  All the corners fit together very nicely.  Overall I'm very impressed with the Mount-n-Lock products and the customer service.  I have spoken with them numerous times and have received excellent service.  If you want to mount bikes or other items to the back of your trailer, give yourself the peace of mind and buy the Heavy Duty bumper and the trays if you need them.  One final thing - give yourself plenty of time for the bumper install.  Measure 3x and cut and drill once!  Also use a square to square up the new bumper to the back of the RV wall before drilling the final holds and installing the bolts.
B007DBT42E|3|While they are a direct fit, the metal filaments are too small and you have to mess along with their position for them to make good contact and light up the bulb.<br /><br />I spend way too long trying to replace all of mine due to this filament issue. Once installed they light up nicely. I had 1 bulb making false contact so I had to re-install.<br /><br />If you don't have patience DO NOT buy them.
B00LXVSCXM|5|I love these. Kids love the way the car looks. Keeps car cooler than usual on hot days. Came with two key ring clips; these are to keep the suction in place - didn't realize till a while after. Fits just right in my 2013 Kia Soul.
B001JT1CEE|5|Works
B0007PHD0S|3|This product worked for me about 60%. Has been about four days and odor is reduced. Interestingly, it smells and looks just like the well-known scrubbing bubbles. The little hose and cap fits on my scrubbing bubbles can as well.
B00U1PEH7Q|5|Product arrived on time and well packaged.  Have used these blades for a number of years and they work very well for three of the four seasons.  They might be OK in areas that have marginal winter snows, but if you live in an area with heavy snowfall they will develop some ice build up.  There is no substitute for a good quality true winter wiper blade.
B00IJ1NCW0|1|BAD QUALITY
B00YBK20L2|2|I have a standardly equipped Volvo XC60.  The velco does not stick to any of the surfaces in the cargo space of my car.  The description really should say that it only works if there is absolutely no pile.
B00QMKYYYK|5|Just as good as the 4.95 pack for 5 fuses at my local auto parts store just a lot cheaper,And you get a lot more.Quality looks better to..
B007KT2AQQ|5|My baby car looks great with her lips.
B001ED6H5E|5|Now I can get rid of that pesky two-stroke motor and never run out of gas again.
B00OPZ6ST8|3|The LEDs are great, but the wiring and connectors are crap. I had to find the &#34;magic&#34; point on the connectors where all the wires made contact and the LEDs lighted and then tape it in that position to prevent vibration from making it lose connection. Hope this doesn't contribute to heat production in the connector. I'm tempted to cut out the connector and hard wire it, but I'm afraid I might have to replace the lights in the future.
B00MUEZS9M|2|They're ok for now. Very cheap material. It'll probably break within a few weeks
B000XOHI4Y|4|This fits my 2015 F250 perfect. The 3m tape at the bottom holds it in place and two holes at the inside toward the top are lined up with the bolts in the tail gate for a nice snug fit. The top overhang over the tailgate does NOT hang over the factory plastic for a smooth finish. The metal is not as thick as I thought it would be, but it lays flat so it shouldn't be an issue.
B007ZDTPUG|5|good
B005GX3GFW|4|works well
B00M6TX5NW|5|Excelente
B00ORCF01Q|5|Decal arrived faster than what was stated and is of high quality. After a few bad rain storms its still attached i dont foresee it coming off without me removing it
B000786JRI|1|your 6 L. was a joke the box would,nt even hold 6 L of lquid let alone a 6 pack.
B000CB42I8|5|Does its job.
B00MIZT7OK|5|My wife loves that I bought this for her protection.
B00603DSI2|1|I bought this for my 2012 JK Sport (2 door).  The fit is extremely bad.  The cutouts for the rear seat do not line up at all.  There is a large gap between the sides of the mat and the inside of the jeep.  The bottom has no teeth to keep it from sliding around.  It is easy to clean out but the fit could be so much better.  This has a &#34;universal fit&#34; look to it.
B00ICR1UB6|5|A nice simple devise that works the way it is supposed to.
B00FXCXIEK|5|Works well, looks well in our jeep !
B000C55WYM|5|good working tie rod! had to replace my passenger side tie rod.
B008TZV6CY|5|First one got wet and broke, my fault, does make my daughters 4 wheeler feel faster.
B0068ODC1Q|3|Already losing the button pictures, case is cracking, but works
B00EQMNOU6|5|Great brakes, rotars and calipers, they look amazing on my 2004 Acura Tl. Great for price also
B007630B4E|5|nice
B004ZF3C24|5|Very pleased with my purchase through Kensun. The shipping g was quick, the packaging was a bit messy but the customer service is excellent and the lights are great. Will purchase more Kensun products.
B000OCHBFQ|4|seemed good on my R12 system, will update if any trouble
B000QFORTO|5|I used this to insulate the fuel line on my 1981 Harley-Davidson FLT-Classic. The fuel line on these motorcycles is routed between the cylinders and with the addition of ethanol to gasoline the carburetor has a tendency to vapor lock. The added thermal insulation provided by this sleeve has thus far eliminated the vapor lock problem.
B00SNN0IO4|5|Keys worked as expected.  Quick delivery.  Matched the locks perfectly.  Great product!
B00B2JDSWA|5|good product
B00382KJVW|4|Ordered kit on weekend, received it on Friday afternoon early.<br />Had everything I needed as it stated in ad except the spring, no big deal, use old one.<br />Engine 1995 Toyota Camry 5SFE 4 cyl 117K miles and the TB was very cracked, as original equipment.<br />Oil seals went in ok, yet cam oil seal was very difficult instal due to odd angles to press it on.<br />Found online TB procedure and read up on process so knew what to expect.<br />Will say this, before removing belt, spray some brakleen on the Cam & Crank gear, then dry, then paint mark &#34;two points&#34; on cam gear position to the &#34;Back cover&#34; and then the &#34;front&#34; on gear and belt. Mark two points not one.<br />Mark also the crank gear front,  to belt. (I used two stripes).<br />If then any confusion, put old belt on to align, then put new one on.<br />I actually put old belt next to new one and marked edge so when it went on it aligned perfect.<br />The new belt will have print from MFG, you should be able to read it as you stand facing engine from passenger fender.<br />Over all very satisfied with product.<br />Lastly, The crank dampener 85 ft/lbs torque.<br />harbor freight for the 49 piece hub puller ($22.00 bucks I think), torque wrench o'reilly $29 bucks 1/2&#34; drive,  and the threads on the hub are 6mm.<br />Hope it is successful event for you.
B00DD27KPK|4|Arrived on time with all necessary part. I like the peace of mind knowing I have a spare when I am in the mountains rather than a can of Slime.
B004969RDM|5|Works great, easy install and priced right!
B00891EDCS|5|great experience!!!!
B004TO0WJW|5|Good product, fast shipping, very pleased!
B006AUPLM6|4|Nice and solid shifter. Fits my 2011 zx6r and installs with ease. Only issue I ran into is when installing the bolts. If tightened to spec, it causes the shift lever to stick in place whether upshifting or downshifting without going back to the regular middle. This made it so I had to loosen  the bolt to allow the shifter to come back to its regular position on its own after shifting. Not really huge issue since I used loctite on the threads but still a minor gripe.
B00BN452O6|5|Needed a small ring at the end to get it to turn 90 Degrees with my keys, but it is perfect other wise.
B000C7S0TO|5|Fits my 2000 Toyota Camry LE. Cool beans.
B008UFS5C2|5|Great quality! The image is bright and clear.  Gary
B00AFVOF3M|5|Works great
B00KMR3J7M|4|After looking at a number of light strips, I decided to go with the Partsam product. the last one I had got condensation in the light bar and started burning out the LEDs. This one appeared to be constructed in such a manner that condensation wouldn't be a problem. The ordering process was easy, as usual, and the delivery was very quick. The installation was a little tricky getting a flexible strip on straight, but it's on and is working as advertised and no condensation.
B000LMT8F0|5|Use some neetsfoot oil and the will last a long long time. Great quality bags for my 883 superlow. No hangers needed.
B00U1YKVIQ|3|Difficult to see the writing on the cap stating the size fuse, other fuses have white littering which makes it easy to identify fuse size.  . No color chart included to indicate fuse size.
B003BZD08U|2|Seemed to keep the pressure down the2 times I tried it, but I couldn't leave the tap on as it sprayed water out the main connection no matter how hard it was tightened.
B00X6BYMIQ|5|Wow.  I am very impressed  with these.  Bought them for an '88 Land Cruiser.  Expensive yes but worth it.
B004L073H8|5|Works great
B00J7RB72M|2|Wasn't what I thought it would be. The slots for the discs were crappy.
B00080QHMM|5|Great product.  Easy to use and accurate, I keep one in every vehicle plus I make sure all my relatives have one available too!
B004ZF4MW8|5|VERY happy with these HID's!! Easy to install and really like the way these 6000k's look. Installed them on my 2012 Tundra, now I am going to have to buy a set for my Chrysler 300.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Took a recent trip out of town and used this cargo bag to haul my stuff there. It performed well.<br />GOOD:<br />* A solid and well made zipper for easy closure. After I had filled the cargo bag tight from corner to corner, I was concerned I might have to struggle with the zipper because it was under slight tension. zipping it shut was breeze and took no strain.<br />* Straps shown in picture were well stitched. under tension they didn't feel as though they were going to tear off from the bag.<br />* provides amble cubic space.<br />Overall good quality for the price.
B0019C4Y6E|5|Excellent, with a new paint job and grill the car looks brand new.  The wife loves her car and it means I get a few more good years out of what has been an excellent car.
B0069SGIR6|5|Part is brand new and fits the truck perfectly. Good buy
B00K4F0TBQ|4|perfect replacement bulb, very bright
B0009JKGII|2|it didn't work for me. We did a cross country trip in our RV and had lots of bugs splattered on the front of the RV. I sprayed the stuff on and waited 2 minutes. Then I tried to rub off a small section to see if the splats would come off. No success. Waited 10 minutes and tried again. Nothing. So I decided to wash the car. That's when I discovered that the stuff leaves a waxy residue that built up on my wash brush and in the water bucket. It was so bad that it destroyed the foaming action of the wash detergent.<br />I finally succeeded removing most of the splats using 'Fantastic' all purpose cleaner.
B00OZ81HTQ|5|Worked perfectly when paired with my Opt7 LED headlight bulbs.
B003ZOH5QU|5|Exact replacement of original filter. Arrived on time. Very satisfied.
B0002STR90|5|Good purchase
B0031ZDU62|5|They work great and were exactly what we needed!
B003ID8IO6|1|Amazon job Volvo on this product again don't buy stitching falls apart
B0013AV9B0|3|Did not cool the food very well; way to much money for a product for just an average product.  It also drained my battery a lot.  Not worth the money in my opinion.
B001UXZ2S6|4|I don't normally write reviews, but I just put this bag through it's first test, and it passed easily. I rode up to visit my family for a week. I thought I had packed it pretty much to the brim for my trip up, but on the way back I had to add a bunch of stuff, like an extra pair of shoes, and it held everything. It also fits nicely over my sissy bar, and I didn't have any problems with it jostling around on the bike. I was able to adjust all the straps to make it nice and snug. Plus, I don't have a luggage rack on my bike, so it was nice that it was able to rest on my seat.
B009PHF32E|5|Easy to install.
B00HRR8U38|1|you get what you pay for. It has rough cut edges. the mounting holes mostly do not line up with mounting holes on the bumper so it requires drilling of the bumper to attach the lip. The metal brackets are bent a little too high so they would require a little tweaking to get a tight fit along border of the bumper. The hardware included is not that great either. It would fit with some work but it does not have the finish and detail of a real STi Lip. I'm sure it would be great for some people but it's not up to par for what I am willing to put on my car. I'll just have to pony up the cash to buy a real one....
B0002SA3WA|1|Does not properly fit a YJ Jeep.  Too narrow for the YJ windshield.  Do not buy this if you have a YJ.  Total waste of money.  The description on here should be changed to reflect that this fits CJs only!
B00HFWYZO8|3|Good fit
B0023VFV2Q|1|After installing it some cracks appeared with no reason!!!
B005FKX1SS|4|No brake dust. They squeak like crazy when the rotors are cold. They're ok. I dont notice a difference in stopping power.
B0006GF5SK|5|Convenient packaging!
B00335HQF6|5|Perfect fit in my truck and now I have no worries about getting in with muddy boots. Easy to clean with a shop vac and I also think they look great.
B0089MP6MS|5|Arrived and is perfect!
B000QJJ4KW|5|Bought two of these for my Dodge Challenger SXT. Not only were they good quality, but they make the car sound so much deeper than the stock exhaust. It rumbles when you step on the gas, and sounds amazing when downshifting. Just make sure to take off the stock resonators or you won't hear much of a difference. However there is quite a bit of interior drone around 1500 RPM but in the higher RPMs it isn't too bad at all. If you get these you will not be disappointed.
B0035YGLZG|5|Works as designed. So nice having the vacuum turn on and off by this relay.
B00RM327NG|5|Works great with Nexus 5. Magnet is very strong so phone is kept in place. The phone magnet is surprisingly slim so it fits easily in the phone case. It's also nice that it comes with a sticky magnet in case you don't have a case for you phone. I bought it for all my cars and so far don't have any problems!
B002VMSJ8U|5|Very happy with this sticker
B00BV6EY2C|5|THE STEERING SHAFT ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY.  IT WAS AN EXACT FIT.  IT ONLY TOOK ABOUT 2 HOURS TO INSTALL.  THANKS FOR A GREAT SALE.
B00BD4OYHM|5|Wish there was a 4.5 because they are a little thicker then I had hoped for. I bought this because it was the cheapest ones (not to mention one of the only ones) I could find on Amazon. I saw they only had one review so I was semi skeptical on them, but my worries were to be proven wrong. They shipped quickly, seem to be made of a good material, had a strong adhesive too! So strong in fact, that I accidentally put one on wrong, left it for a bit and decided I was gonna just rip it off and try again. Much to my amazement it restuck and left to residue either!  I would define you reccomend this to anyone who wants to up their Hondas looks.
B007OXCIB0|5|Easy to use on about anything. Has been on my car for a couple of years now and is holding up extremely well.
B008BT33CY|3|It arrived quickly, and it will work alright - however, it is NOT the font shown in the listing and the circle outline is thinner as well. That is disappointing.
B000JZ5A4W|5|form,fit and functions perfect.
B00R78QXDQ|3|The fuel jugs would be great if they didn't freakin leak around the cap and of course the first time I fill them is 1 day after I can return them. They look nice sitting on the trailer though.
B000EDQQD8|3|thank you
B00KRQQ4Q6|5|Excellent quality.
B001UAICLS|5|Worked just as it should. Nice to have clean smooth throttle control again.
B001RIDVVO|4|These work just fine, but please understand that these letters are white letters only. There is no black background around each letter.
B008INQBW2|5|Worked as advertised
B00NJ5S3RK|4|These seat covers are great. They look like they will give very good protection (fortunately we haven't had to &#34;test&#34; them yet!). The only problem, and reason I don't give five stars, is that the arm rest covers would not go on (too small). We tried and tugged for over an hour, and tried again on at least two other occasions. They will not fit unless there is some trick I am not aware of. We even turned them inside out and tried rolling them on. No luck.
B00C5RB03W|5|Fit tight and look good
B00XKY89AG|5|I like this. It came exactly as promised. If you are concerned that it may be too small as several reviewers said, take measurements first. It is the size promised. My only negative is that it slides around my trunk when I drive.
B00IUWM59O|5|This battery fit my 2004 Honda Shadow VLX even though the Amazon Garage said it would not fit. (I measured the old one and the specs matched up so I bought it.) The bike started right up and has been running well for the last few weeks. I recommend this battery.
B0009IQZH0|5|This makes your faded plastic look brand new!!! Quick shipping too....thanks
B000C8PAVE|5|This kit made the reseal complete and leak free.
B00NQGDIOU|4|Package came within a reasonable time frame. The front seat covers didn't fit my Kia SUV model because my headrests are attached to the seat. I had to cut a slit at the top to fit my driver and passenger seat. A seat cover ripped on the side but I sewed it together. The hooks that come with it doesn't really keep the seat covers down. I've found ways to make the seat covers fit despite the difficulties. The seat covers look great in my car.
B003PI2BZ6|5|So far I am just using it for bike rack and one bike I love it -- much better than the bike carrier that attaches to the hatch and rests on the bumper. I installed this myself in about the time recommended without too many issues. I was most worried about being able to snake in the bolts through the frame but the wires they provided worked flawlessly. Unfortunately I broke the exhaust hanger bolts and have yet to extract them. The bolts that came in the kit were grade 10. I also had a question about the spare wheel pan being so far off from where the hitch bracket comes in but when you tighten it the sheet metal just deforms to meet it.<br /><br />It looks great, very inconspicuous. I have clipped it a few times on the ground so make sure you back out or pull in at an angle if you can remember!
B00AZSPOD0|1|Came broken piece of trash I want my money back!
B0075ZHJSE|5|Nothing fancy here. Works well in the woods!
B008EG66BO|5|Comparable to OEM.
B00B4YCTWI|5|Good buy. Works well.
B000CITK8S|4|works well
B0090B7M2O|5|Arrived in 2 days as advertised. The unit is in a case with the manual, cables and CD. I was able to register and update the software. The unit showed a 6/15/2015 manufacture date but the software level was from 2013. The updates are slow about 1.5 hours on a broadband connection. The unit powered up and works fine for a 2007 4 runner and 2010 Audi A5. Very pleased with delivery and the unit. Lots of features especially with the live data features that I am still learning. Next vehicle is a 2000 Firehawk. There is not a separate battery charger but it is not required. The cable for the OBDII connection seems decent quality as is the USB cable for the unit connection to a PC. Be sure to load the micro SD into your PC to update the software. I also found it easier to load the PC suite from the Autel website instead of the CD.
B0009YDQEO|4|for wife's truck, very nice for price
B001KQD7ZI|5|First one I received had a smashed connector (happened to be the one I needed). Amazon replaced it with no hassles and everything installed extremely easily. Cable was correct length for my application. Housing is plastic vs. metal. Replacement part works as quiet and well as OEM.
B004NY1YYK|5|Reak deal
B000CIQ5DG|5|Works good on Onan 7000 RV generator! Fot perfect took my husband alittle over an hour to put in. Generator works like new!!
B00KTHWYAI|4|I wanted to have a replacement for the awfully cheap keys they gave me with my new Rav4. Toyota would be charging about $70. I said forget it! then I ran into this product. and I have to admit, even though the plastic looks cheap, it does the job.
B00LNE0Z7K|5|Prefect for any sport
B00CODDK8K|5|item as stated and received on time
B000E4KJL2|3|product is very cheaply made, hence the price.  bracket is less rigid than the original, light bounces around more easily.
B001O957YA|5|Just as described
B005EJGSQ2|4|works but became warped and folded.
B00XTVZQ24|5|Made in China, but looks good.
B001U8KNQM|5|Extremely difficult to install but worth it. I have a 2009 Hyundai Excel and they fit perfectly and look great!
B00EAM6KOY|5|Great they look beautiful on my 07 F150 Regular Cab, quick easy install , I put them on at night in the dark underneath my truck anyone can do it
B00DLXZKLM|5|I love it!! Looks and feels like an actual plate. I got it for fun matches my car.
B0009H51LC|5|it fit

B003AN1UA8|5|This unit comes highly recommended from IRV2 forums. Instructions and installation were straight forward. Best part is they have 24/7 tech support!
B005EV95BU|5|good
B00HD9TCFU|5|Perfect fit and works well. Easy to install. I would definitely order from this seller again if needed.
B00UM9LS5U|5|I love these mats!!!!  They are so cute and I'm super happy with them!
B0052SF0LO|5|Good deal for the price, definitely not a spotlight but I was satisfied for the little area I needed covered.
B000HBM5S2|2|Recoeved two cans today , the caps were on but both didnt have sprayers on them
B000QF830S|2|Bought this product in June of 2014 new from Amazon.  The product came in cheap packaging compared to the similar tailights I bought at the same time which initially made me question if this was some cheap LED product or really the quality that others claimed from PUTCO.  Installation of the product was simple and short.  The final installation of this product ended up being better than the tailights that I bought and the fit was perfect.  I was really impressed with the light and functionality of the LED's given the rear facing red LED's and the white LED's were directed down into the bed and produced a lot of light.  Just this last weekend, August 1st 2015, I noticed that the driver side 3 LED's no longer illuminate.  Very dissappointed that LED's would go out just after a year and unfortunately just outside the warranty.  This really makes me question the quality of the LED's.  I plan to check the wiring later in the week to see if something else may be going on (and why three went out on the one side) but still very dissappointed in the product.  I will likely replace this with a Recon or similar so I don't have to waste my time chasing issues with something I expected to be reliable.
B000EDUUIA|5|Ideal parking every time.  We purchased two of these for our garage.  This product is super easy to install - simply park your car where you want it to be, place this in front of the tire, reverse your vehicle back a few feet to give you some room, remove the sticker bottom, and finally place in the same location.  We both stood on ours to make sure the sticker was solid to our garage floor - neither have moved since that day.
B008G510QO|5|It wqs deliverd very quickly. It was exactly what i wanted
B00CXKG8Z6|5|They are so cute!
B00MR2QY18|4|it worked ok
B002O14C84|5|go Pats!!
B0009IQXFO|5|I was surprised that the consistency of this soap is so gel-like.  Note to self, next time I will not follow the directions and make enough for a gallon of water.  That was much more than I needed for my one car.  So, I washed my husband's car, too.  May as well!  They turned out great.
B00LTX87MU|1|I had great hopes for this one after seeing the same one in a relative's car.  However, this one does not stick at all.
B006LNY7Q8|5|Fine.
B00F9LPIAC|5|Bought this for my daughters 4 wheeler to save weight. I have also used it to start my 8750 watt generator and works perfect. I use a $200 RC battery charger and has lasted over a year with a few charges when I forget to unplug it from 4-wheeler.
B007TY7GDY|5|Fit my car perfect!
B004RZDHL8|2|Faded quickly!
B00068XCQU|4|good deal
B009NLMWT4|4|Switch broke first week of having it installed. They issues a full refund and the new switch seems to work fine.
B000C59XKG|5|Make absolutely sure to measure the diameter of the sway bar as some are 24mm  25mm  26mm etc , use a micrometer or a few open end metric wrenches onto the bar to get your size,  I measured and ordered the 26mm they had 25mm on them but did fit fine anyway,  make sure you keep spraying the bolts with WD40 before and during the removal of the bolts ,if they snap there is no way to get them out from the inside, you would need to drill them out,
B00MVDKX8I|5|Good Value
B000VKOD9S|5|Good basic replacement filter for a 2006 Honda Accord. It really is so easy to change these out for yourself. Don't pay the shop to do it.
B005UTS6FC|1|One blade broke within a month :(
B000NNONWK|5|fit well and my brother loved it
B00AV8HKCM|5|Well pleased and thank you
B004C0IA1K|1|DOA.  Stick with Motorcraft
B0016KA8AK|1|Didn't come with instrauctions for installation or mounts hardware. Now I have to take time to find and print off instructions and go buy the mounting hardware. If I had know it would come with NOTHING I would have purchased something different.
B008PJCOOS|5|Looks like a solid kit, have not installed yet, but it is all Japaneses OEM stuff. I like it.
B00C9U3L96|5|Fit right in. Just reached under the glove box to the left and removed cover pulled old one out, it's a good thing they are flexible you need to squeeze the new one together to get it in. Pretty simple.
B000KKU8UC|5|Great table.  I put it together in no time with my 5yr daughter.
B006TMKG3E|1|Product arrived defective.  Tabs to secure bulb were not present.  Bulb has nothing to lock to.  Part is useless.
B00EI26VDG|5|Great
B004GDX25C|4|ok
B00COOSF98|5|I purchased this OPT7 HID lighting kit to install in my Mazda CX9. This kit is truly a plug and go kit. After figuring out which diagram to follow in the instructions the installation was not bad at all. I have not had this installed in my car for that long, so I could not speak as to its longevity. The light is exactly what I wanted and exactly what people have described. The light is a white light with a blueish tent to it. The stock light really seems yellow when compared to it. I really can't see a lot of difference in the brightness over the stock lights, though the street signs are a lot more reflective now. I went with the 35w over the 55w because I did not want to have people flicking their lights at me all the time. I think that if I had went with the 55w that would have been a strong possibility. I am completely happy with the 35w verses the stock lights. I ordered on a Thursday evening and received my package on the following Saturday. Another happy Amazon customer!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product at a great price.. Best windshield sun protector I have ever had. Complete coverage of my windshield and very well made. I have to say I like the fact that I have received a follow up email from this seller asking about my experience with my purchase. That is good customer service. Thank you<br />Thomas Munizza
B001GJ3FIS|3|You get what you pay for...
B00DIPSA8I|1|Terrible. The black ink bleed into the white. Poor quality, don't waste your money.
B00EOB6ZMS|5|They work, and fit on my door.  What else can I say.  AWESOME
B002XLHUQG|5|Works as advertised! I like these better than just chocking the wheels on my trailer. These wheel stabilizers keep my camper from moving around so much. (A lot less wiggle!)
B0042Z0E6E|5|It was very nice, covered the whole side of the camper.
B000HEBR3I|3|It works ok however I would like some type of bottom protection from the pump...without it...lots of jams from any objects.
B004MUI7OA|5|Good deal.
B0038QI1UY|5|Very satisfied with my purchase
B006QKIOLU|5|Exactly as expected
B00514B05Y|5|wife loves them
B00V8YPTX0|5|This cushion does give relief.  I would definitely buy another.
B001G6MOG0|5|Worked and fit perfect.
B007E5VHLU|3|They are ok I guess ...still working...
B002QH5VOU|5|This is the same Fram filter that you can buy just about anywhere. But it's cheaper to buy it on Amazon.<br />No complaints.
B000EQCYXG|5|Excellent product never seen one like it never knew I could charge my ipad in the car but now I never ran out of battery any longer with these great product more grease
B001O07VI4|4|Worked well.  Would be helpful if it had a 1/2 inch drive receiving feature on it for an impact wrench.  Worked fine, I just had to double up on sockets to make it work.
B00GHRUQEK|5|Worked perfectly saved me a few bucks
B00AZ4SRNI|5|Great
B000WJ930C|4|Pretty simple install, took a little to figure out how to use the applicator. Highly recommend putting bike on stands to make install 100% easier. Also I thought tape was reflective it's just fluorescent but that's not too bad.
B000765MHI|1|It won't even turn on
B005U3KM28|5|Fits a Honda CR V 2014 Gary color is a match.Works well and super easy to install.
B00NTNX7BO|5|This is awesome - it has kept me from getting into like, 5 accidents in the last 3 days alone!  They don't look bad, they're pretty small & fit my Mercedes C-Class mirrors pretty well.  And a great deal too!  The foam double stick tape that holds them on is pretty strong, I've been thru a pretty powerful car wash and they held tight!  Great purchase!
B000C8T99S|2|MADE IN CHINA.  ATP automotive lists a made in Australia filter ( a magnefine)  as what you get in box.  It is not. you will get a Made in China Raybestos.<br /><br />If your filter fails, all your transmission fluid may drain out before you go to the side of the road, then you may cook your transmission.  You may be better off without a filter at that point.
B00A82A2ZS|4|Works and half the price of power wheels
B008X033BM|5|Wow... my struts were old so maybe I was used to crappy rides... but these things feel great. They seem well made and feel very smooth on highway. They smooth out those dips on the highway, etc - barely notice anymore. Very happy<br /><br />They also take the time to mark the side that faces you (for DIY assembly) with a chalk mark. Includes new nuts, etc. Full package. Super easy replacement on my 95 civic ex sedan.
B00VIICP4M|5|Perfect fit in my trunk plus it holds everything in place.
B001F85OUM|5|It works as expected, I found  no time lag when the brake light switch was tripped at least that I could notice,
B0091YV1F4|5|Thanks so much
B000IY8ODS|5|Replaced my stock plug cables for these. These seem of equal quality, if not better. Very happy. I also put in new NGK plugs. My civic feels super spunky. I am very happy.<br /><br />I have fitted cheap cables on my previous vehicles and it feels like they dont sit in well... almost like they just kinda lay on, but never click in. These had a very secure fit and I could tell they were manufactured specific to my car as the fit was perfect.
B000NWA8HU|5|Its works great - way better $ than dealership parts
B00DKWJ9VG|2|didnt fit my ranger or mustang
B00B6FBLFG|3|It seems to darken vachetta leather
B001227AHG|5|match my rave sport 2009
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very easy to put up and take down.Fits my 4Runner very well. I'm very happy with this product.
B00T6B5SWO|5|This is so beautiful!!! I ordered two more!!
B0006N5RYK|5|Fits..does the job
B009M0S4Z2|5|These seat covers stay on the seats and protect them well from spills.  This is my second paid and wear well.  Recommend them.
B00VHMJRI6|4|I have to admit, this is a fantastic camera. I purchased it to install in a 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, which do not come with a camera option. These camera quickly and easily install in the back bumper for a perfectly clean OEM look. The 430n navigation radio had to have the backup camera feature activated, but it was simple as can be. The image is fantastic and the install looks perfectly OEM. We love it.<br /><br />That being said, I did the same install for a neighbors jeep and the second chastoon camera was a dud - no image.  Third one I ordered of course arrived quickly and worked great. The one dud is why I reduced a star.<br /><br />Amazing image quality. Very pleased overall.
B002SSBPQK|5|great
B00ROF8SQM|5|I purchased this from Walmart for  $39.99 and it works great. Although I wish it had a bigger display screen, but other than that great product for the price.
B000CPCCFY|5|fast delivery,fit for purpose
B001AGP8BY|4|good fit, one of the tabs was bent so I had to hammer it straight. Other than that fit was good and had no issues mounting to manifold or cat. 02 Accord SE sedan. Does not include hardware or gaskets!
B004C24GIO|5|Great this is a must have if you add new exhaust and intake.. Gives your bike a lot of power and a whole new attitude
B00EHN5272|5|Arrived as advertised.  Installation was tedious, but that is the nature pinion installation.  I'm 74 years old & have trouble pulling enough final torque on the pinion nut, but a torque multiplier did the job.  Also a bearing splitter and press made the job much easier.  Before you start, make sure you have a decent set of digital calipers to keep track of shim thicknesses.
B003POL47Q|3|I could be a spokesman for Griot's Garage products because I have just about everyone and truly believe and trust there products to perform well,but this wheel cleaner did not meet my expectations.Generously sprayed on all 4 tires and worked in well with a tire brush and before it dried on the wheels,sprayed it down with a garden hose.After drying,the tires were not so clean,Probably going to have to do it again,but that's more work.<br />It's O.K.
B006SQ1XPQ|4|LIKED
B00BRL78JC|4|Genuine product. Not easy to install your self without having the recommend installation instructions which was not included in the package. However, you can download the instructions from Toyota website.  You can find the installation instructions in this link:  http://toyotaofmcdonoughparts.net/products/pt938-03120-toyota-camry-body-side-moldings-2012
B000ZIC18Q|4|LIKE IT.
B009YKVR18|4|to early to tell, looks nice
B0096BAMA2|5|Fit my 95 honda accord lx 4 cylinder perfectly. Now hopefully I can get a few more years out of her.  Don't forget to save you radiator cap, and the rubber feet from the old radiator!
B0042OTEPW|5|This fan worked in our BMW 3 series. However... that car was a 'money pit'... just like the movie
B00T9I2FKC|1|When I was putting them in my tail lights, two of them fell apart. They are held together by one small drop of Sauter. Poor design 😥
B0013FY2AU|5|Fit and took away the pulsating feeling in the front brakes.  Very happy with them so far.
B002R1H9F4|5|Item perfect fit for my Durango ... makes the truck look much newer. The hazy headlights really aged he truck.. Great product and easy to work with company!
B001EOWQAS|2|Not for a Highlander 2014 or 15 do not buy it for that as it states
B0050LJMYY|5|Replacement for the same cover I had for 5 years but got too dirty to clean again.  Good fit and keeps RV cleaner inside.
B00YTEQ1CY|2|These may be grip covers, but they are not lever covers, Would be good for worn grips, but advertised as lever covers is why I only gave it two stars.
B00DIHB2QI|3|Paid $50.00 for key programming. Key worked for two days and would open the door,but would not crank the car.
B00PKTN6I4|1|Very cheap. Did not fit well. They look nothing like the picture, color was way off. There was no way to find our what they looked like unless you open and put them on. But if you open them, you can't return them. I was lucky and resold them on Craigslist.
B00RAQCPA0|3|Ok
B003N9MQCK|2|not very sturdy--when I received,the handle on the blue mug was loose (only attached at top of handle)--cheaply made in my opinion
B001XLG5FE|3|I originally got this for my Bronco but it was 2 feet short. But this product was well designed put gather very good.<br />Recommend this product to anybody with a car.<br />That was the only reason I give 3.
B007GCDM46|4|Works fine, way cheaper than Verizon tries to sell one for and most importantly it stops the beeping!
B0027HYW5I|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B00TFZNNG4|1|No instructions included.  Have not been able to get it on the roof yet.  Update.  Searching on line gave us enough of a clue to make it work.  Instructions, even on line, were sketchy at best.  Very little additional info could have saved a lot of frustration. Once installed, working well.
B005HAYDR4|5|Worked perfectly as needed.  Would buy again without hesitation.
B00KSZ5F5C|5|Works great! Air release was perfect
B004HCS4PK|5|Works as advertised great product and superb results! My Mustang looks even more luster then the day I purchased it; looks like a show car.I love Meguiar's products and this is another must have.
B008B5X5GC|1|Tire shop could not program, returned full refund.
B009FUF6DM|5|Great lightweight microfiber towels for auto detailing & good priice.
B007JYNLGU|5|All good
B007BKPVDI|4|I haven'y mounted them yet. I'm a bit worried abut the ridges on the conical washers taking a huge bite out of my new freeway bars. Y think I'll try some slices of 1&#34; radiator hose to protect that side of the bars. I expect that the rubber will hold pretty good for an old guy - I just need to watch it when my gorilla son gets on it. Come to think of it, he's got his own bike, he can stay off mine.
B0009TPX7M|1|Did not meet standard my glove compartment
B000C42RA0|3|Bought for great price and KYB name for 1999 GMC Suburban SLT. These are listed as OE replacement for this but I do not think they are equivalent for this model.  Seem to ride smooth enough but I seemed to gain more sway and roll when turning and braking.
B00CELVIE0|5|Worked great!
B00KL3ALGO|5|Fits easily, doesn't fall off, no extraneous packaging.  Ordered two more packs because we loved the first one.  Safe for driver because it maintains visibility while blocking sun.
B000COYHSU|5|Excellent quality . Wasn't an exact replacing for the centers on the set  I bought earlier .
B00E1JNAC6|5|Good product
B0080E4CW0|5|Just what we needed!
B00NLMRKL6|5|This is a really solid investment keeps my car dry and cool couldn't ask for anything more that I can think of.
B00KLIC70M|5|These were a perfect fit for my scooter. They work wonderfully. Awesome shipping!
B001GN6QS0|5|Perfect replacement for my OEM.
B00H36Y2OO|5|My wife loves this charger.  I will buy again
B00F1Y73SW|5|good.
B009MATHQ2|5|Thought this was a bit too much to pay for a sun visor when you can pick them up at Walmart for a few bucks, however, NOTHING I purchased would cover the entire windshield and because of the windshield height, even the largest sunscreens available would not hold in place.  After trying to deal with a steering wheel too hot to hold, the metal slides  on my seatbelt burning my arm and a leather seat too hot to sit on, I broke down and ordered the custom fit sun visor and I love it!  Car is still hot, but at least its bearable.  Downside, it is big and bulky when you're removing it, but the fit is great with the rearview mirror and ceiling visors to hold it against the windshield.  Suggest a design improvement, where it would at least collapse in the center so you fold it in half and then into quarters.  You practically need the passenger area to pull it down and toss it to the back.  It's really awkward to remove if someone is sitting in the front seat with you.
B008HUKXMK|4|Prompt service and the bulbs fit my Range Rover perfectly.
B00XR45X30|5|Perfect fit for my 82 gl1100
B000C57W5Y|4|Good quality part.
B00LXKYA0C|5|I purchased this mirror because too many deranged drivers with mental health issues on the highways and this mirror help me with my driving on the highways. Far too many drivers are pushing their vehicles beyond what they were meant to be. I call my driving &#34; DEFENCE DRIVING.&#34; I like the blue tint on the mirror.This is my second purchased of this type of mirror. I purchased another brand type of mirror for my CVPI. FAMILY AND SAFETY COME HAND AND HAND.
B000TYLIFS|5|Truck runs better
B001TI5IIQ|4|Be prepared to use some elbow grease. I spent about an hour restoring the headlights on my Honda Civic using this product, and I'm reasonably satisfied with the result. Given the price, I feel like I got my money's worth.
B007XH4IOC|5|Exactly as advertised. A great decal for my store advertising our free WiFi. Easy to read from a distance.
B003YJI06K|5|great price fast shipping thanks
B00BTLHGK6|4|Many comments about poor fitment with these, I have no clue why, this was a perfect fit on my '01 Ram 1500 Sport, the quality was pretty darn good for the price, I needed to re-glue the inserts in a few spots, they were either broken or not on properly, but that was an easy fix, I'd buy another if I got hit again, it looked great in the black it came in but I painted mine match the truck, very nice paintable fining on these too.
B000CSD6RE|5|What a quality product .
B000JZYWBE|3|I bought one of these in an effort to save a little money instead of buying a nearly $500 OEM Lexus part. Well, you get what you pay for. I had to wrap it in fiberglass to quiet it down a little and even then it was noticeable. If I had it to do over again, I think I would have purchased the Bos (sp).
B0040M30U6|4|Arrived with a few scuffs and scratches. For something transparent, special attention should be used when packaging the item. Otherwise, it's a quality product. Tint is just dark enough to notice but not dark enough for Po po to care.
B00JRE38EA|5|Great LEDs, nice and bright
B00FB3GDXE|4|was pretty easy to put on, I used a fandango card to help apply the decal. A bit smaller than what I thought, but still great for the price. Let's see if it stops people riding my tail.
B005FKC3ZK|4|Looks good. It fitted my 2008 Infiniti G35 Sport Model like a glove although it seems like there is a bit of a &#34;break-in&#34; period involved. Will Review more later on.
B00KGGTGO4|3|How do I give this stars?  It is too small for my Class A 32 ft Country Coach motorhome.
B00ELHTC5C|5|Ever wonder how your buddy has had the same car since highschool and it has 600K  miles on it but your last 3 cars have died on you already. Yup, this is why.
B00QK0NXH6|5|My car is a total badass now. Besides the fact it took a while to get here I LOVE IT
B000CB0X5Y|1|Nothing was right about this kit for my 1999.5 Pathfinder. The &#34;filter&#34; had a post that was too long and interfered with putting on the pan. The gasket was a soft rubber material and would squash/extrude if you tighten the bolts too much. The reality is that you don't need the filter unless you damage the original. This filter is only contains a screen. Save your $ and only buy a pan gasket (from a Nissan dealer if you want the right product).
B001DCN1SC|5|When the power lift gate stopped staying up on our 2007 Odyssey I looked on line for a possible fix. I found a YouTube video that showed the EXACT same behavior as our problem. The poster of the video gave no suggestions for a fix but commenters did. They pointed me here and I'm SO glad they did. I saved at least $200 because I did this repair myself and didn't go to the dealer. The repair was easy. Just like in the videos shown.
B00GNQXPMA|5|works great!
B003TKTVGC|4|Love the sound!!
B009W1THMK|3|This does not fit Isuzu 1993pickup but I had to try. I have been looking for 1 three years
B000KZ23QE|5|Worked like a charm.
B00RUZNYFQ|5|Just what I need with no problem
B00W919FL8|5|This is well made! The instructions are very good and useful. I have used this setup for over a week in upstate New York, we towed on both major highways and winding secondary roads was awesome! This comes with everything that you need to tow. The 2 5/16&#34; ball is mounted all you have to do is set up the rest. There are Youtube videos that explain how it works! Nice
B000N5UIGI|5|Fit perfectly !
B00KPQZS2O|5|Very quick shipping. Takes the worry out of towing. Very easy to replace batteries.
B0009T6EA2|5|looks good quality on arrival.  will see how it works after installation.
B0002KKISC|5|Great stuff! Stoner products are the best.
B004MMVS6C|5|High quality. Better than I expected.
B00KMR3F8U|5|These lights make my truck look awesome.  The wired and  connection are weak so I taped them up with electrical tape and used a flexible cable wrap.  To those who claim the white reverse lights don't work, you need to hook up the loose white wire to the correct power wire going to one of the  backup light bulbs.  Don't complain just because you don't understand how to install it.
B008O19JN6|4|Quite accurate and needs about 5.9v to start the led but can measure up to 34.2v before quitting. The led is blue which is a very nice feature but it is smaller than expected. Black is negative wire for input and measurement, red is for power and green for measurement. The wires were untinned but are stripped. Overall, good voltmeter for the price.
B00K35VT3Y|5|great works good
B001RK54EY|5|Super Easy to install, best unit money can buy
B008N206GA|5|Fast and great product
B001F79API|5|Great
B006RKTHWO|1|Bought these to make my vehicle more obvious when on Search and Rescue missions. Not terrible at night, but at day you can't even tell they're on.
B005GY9UZQ|5|Great product, works at advertise, fit perfectly, which I was surprised, recommend to anyone needing a replacement.
B005904LMO|3|Good deal
B00KMYYSTI|5|Ok
B0059XCVVO|5|already has a super nicely carbon car
B000JFJLP6|5|Really good stuff for emergencies you can always plug it to the cigaret lighter and charge it very fast
B00H95Z6VW|4|Like other people, I also had to grind down the tool a little bit so that it would fit properly on the N14 motor.  Also the weld for the dowel pin on the crankshaft lock broke.  The quality of the remaining pieces seem solid though.  These two things were not enough to prevent the tool from working, as it worked flawlessly.
B000HS8PT8|2|Does not last very long if used outside. Had it for less than a year and it's completely faded and wearing through with holes in several places. We don't have winter where I live so I'm guessing it would fail even sooner in colder climates. Not at all worth the money for me.
B0009PD5R6|4|Delivered on time and was as expected
B000C9QTK4|5|Does what it is supposed to do...
B00AK1KJSM|5|No issues with this license plate. Looks good after several weeks.
B0006IX878|5|Arrived on the day predicted along with some other items ordered. I am using this to build a &#34;Y&#34; connection to my RV flush and water supply that can  be valved off to go to either one without disconnecting and switching to flush the black water tank. Works very well! I had to purchase another one to use in this &#34;Y&#34; connection. It is very well made and did not leak on the first use.
B00D3OBPLI|5|It was original and just like you went to the Toyota dealership.  Excellent value.
B000RGXLG2|5|These are great wipers !  New mounting hardware to me as i have owned older vehicles. Everything arrived on time and in perfect condition. A great experience !
B00BTGSGFK|4|Easy to hold, I used one of these to wax two cars so far. It absorbs a lot of the product and makes putting on a thin coat easier. It does make it harder to wash and I'm thinking next time I will try sealing one in a plastic bag to keep from drying out in stead of washing it. For the one I did wash, one of the seams started to pull apart.
B000EIJRJ8|5|Fits great arrived on time
B004U00UE2|5|Perfect fit and function.  They have kept my 2013 Ford Explorer clear of mud, sand and dirt and are very sturdy.  Highly recommend.
B00H6XPZN6|5|Great product. Really cuts down the sun coming in through side windows. I just have to remember to take the shade off before I lower my driver side window at a drive-thru establishment.
B000CIO86M|4|Good stuff. I use it in my V8 Pinto.
B0015DMJ2S|5|Great tool and does what it needs to do
B0050VFA8G|1|sucks, fan didn't work, got way too hot and it just short out yesterday, never again
B00D1CQVIY|5|Nice Kit
B000E35W38|4|worked perfect on my 1998 jeep Classic transmission
B006NZTZLQ|5|Still working on how to get the readings I want. But this thing is reads like VPN software for like 1/32nd the price. Been working good so far. Is everything the company advertised it would be. LOVE IT!!!!
B000BUU5Z4|2|Was hoping to use this with toothbrush heads for my electric tooth brush, the slots were too small to allow me to do that.
B001TJXWH4|4|No strong scents and seems to work breaking down the wax better than laundry detergent. I used it with a sink of water and hand agitation as I do NOT want to have to clean my washing machine of potential residue.
B002G1PBO6|4|Pretty well worked as expected.  A little trouble in getting it to pull out the Schrader core.  Same complaint as everyone else with this and it's competitors.  But definitely better than evacuating the system.  The only disappointment is that Interdynamics has discontinued building its mate for the high pressure side.
B008KV4IIG|5|runs like new
B008BYQ1X2|1|Velcro does not stick to inside of lid hence make the organizers worthless.  They fell off overnight the bike just sitting.
B00W2NMO3Y|5|Just as promised the item came in 2 days, made my job alot easier. Works great I recommend this product.
B007473OWI|5|It is what it is and works on the Honda Valkyrie - no issues whatsoever - appears to be identical to the OEM at a fraction of the cost - this item is widely used on Honda ATV's and Cycles so check the tech applications for complete listings.
B000GU0EBO|5|Easy Installation.  No issue
B009XQHTP6|2|did not works as advertised would not read low tire pressure under 5 lb psi but I will say I was pleased with they way and response of the return of this product went
B00EXKZNUA|5|I bought these mats for my son for his birthday.  Even though they are general mats that fit many models, they look custom in my son's Jeep Compass.  He has been a true Tiger fan since birth.  (He is named after a Detroit Tiger.)  He is very discriminating when it comes to authentic Detroit logos, and these mats passed his scrutiny.  The mats are very sturdy and protect the floor of his vehicle well.  I only wish the Tigers were performing as well as these mats!
B00EC0YZ1E|5|My 2010 Camry LE passenger mirror (non-heated) cracked in several places after I bumped against an orange construction barrel.  No issues with the housing, so I called the Parts department of a local Toyota dealer thinking I could get a replacement glass and plate for no more than $25.  Instead, I was given a price of $63!  I went online, and after reading the reviews for this mirror, took a chance.  I's so so happy that I did.  The mirror fits just as well as the original one did.  I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and rotated the mirror downwards all the way.  This allowed me to pop off the original from the top, then I lifted it up to unhinged it at the bottom.  Putting on the replacement mirror, I reversed by hinging it first at the bottom then snapping in at the top.  You may need to work with the hinging just a bit to make sure the mirror and housing snaps line up properly, but once done it's a perfect fit, and it saved me $40!.
B0010DLIKW|2|These links work as expected, but be aware most alignment places will be confused by them and not service your car. Additionally they come loose VERY easily even if you tighten down the nuts properly and your alignment will then change. Lastly, I had one snap at the adjustment point under normal driving conditions.
B00I0H27EW|5|EXCEEDED OUR EXPECTATIONS, THANK YOU!
B002LEEWES|5|Smaller than other ones that we have seen but the husband loves it.
B0041QU720|4|nice fit works great very comforable
B00BOFEPQA|5|Love it...fits great
B003VAZ6OG|5|Great antenna. The previous owners of my camper had removed the antenna completely so I got to start from scratch. Had it installed in about 90 min and it picks up more channels than my home antenna. This thing has awesome range.  I would recommend getting a signal finder to help speed the process up on site.
B0009JB7GI|4|works great, been using for a year and i have had no issues.
B005JCQ7V0|4|They do exactly as expected. Easy to install and easy to work with.
B000637TE6|5|Very good product -- just what I needed to clean my beamer seats -- will buy again.
B00ZED2TW0|5|Exelente producto
B000LW3O6Y|5|Perfect for riding without a fairing, keeps the bugs and minor road debris off your face.
B0068ESSG0|4|seems to be fine. This is a Replacement for a similar Dow Co cover that started to disintegrate recently.  Hopeful this one will not.
B0015GOA54|4|Only one of the two we ordered lights up, but I didn't really understand the usefulness of the light-up function anyway, so that's fine.  I ordered this because it came as a kit - the ball, string, ceiling hook - which was super convenient.
B00Q3452QY|1|This cover is VERY smelly.  I can't use it on my car.
B00BCRM9YA|5|I really like these seat covers for the price  the front covers are her easy to put on I had no problems the back seat how ever was more difficult it took some time but I got it on and it looks nice. I have a Dodge ram 1500 and the back of my back seats do not lean up and that is were the difficultys came in but they look sharp.
B0032YPMVS|5|worked great
B004ZGOUEM|5|Good
B000WK3SWK|5|Super assortment of tools.  In my saddlebag before every ride.  I have used most of the tools in the bag at least once on my bike, my wife's and friend's bikes.  This is an essential set of tools.
B000P6UT2I|5|Its the best one for 8.1L gmc
B009DJWVYM|5|looks good. will update review based on fit.
B000C9MQ4C|3|I purchased these for a two-piece driveshaft on a Ford.  If you hold the original Spicer clamps in place over the u-joint caps without the bolts, they will rock back and forth.  This is because they are (intentionally) undersized to provide preload on installation.  This prevents the u-joint from moving once installed.  One of the AC Delco caps had sufficient preload, the other had none.  It would tighten down on the u-joint cap, but I just didn't trust it for long-term use.  I ended up cleaning up the original Spicer clamps and bolts and reusing them.
B002MQCY7C|5|Works great, fits fine. I still have to help my wife get her's on and off through - just able to do it quicker. The old girl is only 74, she shouldn't be that weak!
B00B7FC4DI|5|For small holes, like finishing nails or roofing tacks, this tool is perfect! For bigger holes I'd go with the traditional plugs since I don't like the idea of more than one plug per repair.  Also of note, this thing is pretty tough to push into the tire, but I found a rubber mallet provided just enough motivation to get the job done.  Only downside is the price. You're really not getting a lot for your money here when compared to the other repair sets sold by Dynaplug. And the price for the refill plugs is pushing up against robbery.  However, this complaint is easily offset by the fact that I got the job done myself and paid for the tool with one use.
B007HRGZDK|5|Use it at hitch pivots not the bars.
B00JW1VXTA|4|Good product just easy too open
B000HEBR3I|5|Does the job and can't beat the price. Second one I purchased.
B00LNK43FY|5|Looks good, covers all excess text on Texas plates.
B00681BFJU|5|Very quick shipping and easy to follow instructions. No need for professional assistance.
B00WH6ZBE0|5|Perfect t
B0012TWSSA|5|i wear this under my motorcycle helmet during summer,wicks any sweat n stays cool,
B001GMX9XQ|5|had a friend hook it up works great no troubles at all on my traverse
B007Q17AIG|4|It was similar to what was on my '05 Grand Prix, but not exact replacement.<br />Neither the cables nor this part had any lock nut, so none was used during replacement of both sides, time will tell if it holds adjustment.
B0009OR8V6|5|Works fine.
B002MEPIHM|1|This is cheap, and it fits a '12 Nissan Frontier, and it was easy to install... but that's where the good part ends.  The inside mirror shakes like Michael J. Fox holding a vibrator and getting a phone call on vibrate in a walk-in freezer during an earthquake.  It's generally useless as a mirror, but it makes your truck look better than one with a broken-ass mirror dangling off the side.
B0042H6BA0|5|This bag is very easy to use and held more than we expected. It fastened securely and didn't move around at all. (we drove over 2,000 miles with it). We are very happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone!
B002ZU9Z1S|5|The miracle worker.  Had a few grease splatters on a tile backsplash....gone, gone. Follow the instructions and you won't be disappointed. And the instructions are super easy.
B000BW9396|5|Added a nice turbo whistle
B000TYOS3C|1|The top tabs snapped off on installation , Don't waste your money
B00480BWCI|5|Works like expected. good quality
B0033BXWQC|4|My husband loved this gift!
B00II8HM1Q|5|Simple to install & look great.  They don't interfere with the camera.
B000AM8BLI|5|Easy replacement and worked as expected.
B000HBM3QQ|5|AWESOME !
B00EUIEAZ4|4|Looks great
B001O0BJUK|5|This was what our van needed and it fixed our problem.
B00T36Q7R2|4|Worked great (as far as I know).  It is VERY heavy and a bit awkward to handle.  It doesn't allow electricity through until it analyses the incoming current (about 2.5 minutes).  It fit into 15/16 posts this last 3 weeks' use on my long trip.  The one it didn't do well with was the one where the receptacle was recessed into the post.  The 'box' wouldn't let the plug go in and it's weight also held it back from making a connection.  It. Won't fit into my cord compartment, so I have to remember to store it after taking apart from the post and RV plug -- that's why I lost/forgot it at the next-to-last park!
B008B9W0IC|5|Great quality
B000C94FAU|4|It fit just like the original, had it changed in about 30 mins. cheaper too than local parts stores .
B00473V668|5|Great product and working good for my lightings.
B00UO6HP9Y|5|Only used it this spring/summer but works as advertised and is bright!  Happy so far.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|So far great product I'm a triple A locksmith and roadside assistance so I've used this product atleast 10 times and hasn't failed me!
B003O75N30|4|Great unit with one fault:  with a few items in the unit it tends to sag, blocking my rear-view mirror.  Otherwise well constructed and useful.
B003BZD03K|5|Bought this to build a &#34;Y&#34; connection to my RV water supply and black tank flush. It arrived on the day predicted in very good condition. After building the &#34;Y&#34; connection and installing it, I found out that it sealed very good with no leaks. Very good quality item. I would recommend to anyone.
B00632DLVO|5|shocks were as advertised and shipping was quick.
B00803CTDA|5|Very little modification needed to install and the cooler performs absolutely wonderful!  Installed it on a 2007 Chevy Suburban 5.3L - prior to the installation the vehicle would run upwards of 200 plus degrees while pulling a 26ft travel trailer in warmer weather (85 degrees and up) and now pulling an even larger travel trailer (Whitehawk 30dsqb) in warmer weather it doesn't pass 185 degrees!  Awesome product and well built! I did spray paint it black so it would blend in better with the front end through the grill...  Other little trick was determining the direction of fluid flow to even hook the unit up.  In summary, I highly recommend this product.
B00MSSYHEW|5|Thanks so much
B00CPPF468|5|One word... BEAST.
B001BNASZW|5|Bought the product as a gift for my brother, who is longtime Jets fan.  I have a lot of difficulty buying for him, but these were a huge hit! They fit his truck perfectly. Where we live combined with his outdoors job make mats a necessity! Whether it be mud, snow, or rain, these keep the floors in the  truck clean and dry. They also appear to be very durable and are made of a tough plastic - I expect them to last a while.  Great deal for a pair of car mats! I would buy them again.
B00AFBXQNC|4|Yep lots of foam, nice smell. Cleans well and does not impact wax coat so I use this for washing between waxing.
B00RIVNP1K|4|this is ok wish it was bigger
B00KROUYZA|5|Delivery was the quickest I have ever had on Amazon. The colors are vibrant and they are made very well I couldn't believe how cheap they were too! I couldn't find any mats that were even close to this price with this quality and with a variety of interesting designs. Thank you so much!
B00CJ883VE|5|Worked like a charm! No issues with this product so far.Thanks!
B001L2E8MC|5|Fit perfectly and looks great.
B00198KO0S|5|looks like a new car again!
B008BWGK6M|3|No instructions were included, also when the box arrived it was torn open and screws were missing!
B002YKH2MI|5|The item was exactly what my technicians were asking for.  The bit is small and made strong to handle heavy loads.
B00PHXXZKM|5|Item was great!
B00RGZWIW0|5|Excellent  and durable product.  It is exactly what we want.  I highly recommend it.
B008CE06ZA|5|Best drop hitch I've found for the price.  Works great, would definitely buy again!
B005689P7A|5|ok
B003FBV8ZW|5|great glasses and you can't beat the price.
B00OYGFD1C|5|Kit supplied me with the much needed connectors for a project.  Did the job!
B000PWTIUG|5|Nice products
B00OGXI00Y|1|Not worth the money or the wait. Very disappointed
B0057ANREE|2|Switch failed too soon can't use it after a month
B003YMVOUG|5|Good deal  for this rotor, I like it.
B00LCQZEK2|1|Cheap fell apart then melted
B005Z8HAUK|4|excellent compressor, it pumps my 10 ply 16 inch truck tires to 55 lbs in no time at all
B00AZUCV84|1|had them past the return policy time line but only wore them three time the sole separated from one of the shoes
B007S2VD4K|5|EXCELLENT
B0002F67Z0|5|Direct replacement for my old 1988 Atwood 6 gallon LP/Electric water heater. Would have had it installed in 45min if I hadn't decided to upgrade the water bypass and gas lines. Does not come with butyl tape to seal the unit to the outside of the camper so pick some up at the hardware store.
B0017LUZII|4|not the best quality gasket in the world, but it does the job.
B001C6NC7O|5|Works like they say easy to roll when charged with air I have just ordered another one, it works well with spray guns and nail guns
B002R12HZG|5|Not a perfect match for the factory lights, but for the price buy both sides and your still way ahead of buying a new one from the dealer.  Look and fit perfectly.
B000C716U4|4|Very easy to install. Thank you.
B001XVKFSW|3|It's fine for what it is, but an agm battery is the recommendation here, because it won't leak electrolyte on your bike, plus they tend to stay strong for longer periods and the electronics operate with a stable power supply which tends to increase their longevity.
B00YU0LXRU|1|Too expensive , i got the for 25 not so long ago, y did they go so up high?
B00CKINJ1M|5|Fit the 2004 Jetta GL
B00HTX3BNE|4|THIS SOUNDS AMAZING !! MORE SPEED N POWRR ON MY CAR
B00OT7IZ0W|3|not what i needed for my 1500 vulcan classic but i can use them on my other bike..
B000JFJLP6|5|aaa
B003GD98JC|5|Convenient and effective, just as it should be.
B00GSAUHB8|5|The sun protector fit perfectly and is easy to use.
B008CE0R40|5|Works like it should.....big block of rubber.
B000COCTXA|5|I bought some crappy autozone kit like this and it fell apart in a few months, these have been going strong for 3 months now and I would strongly recommend.
B0006IX7UQ|5|I bought this for my 35 pound dog because she loves ice cubes, but had a hard time with normal size ones.  This is perfect for that application.
B0007LVJ20|1|Only used this five times and the and fell apart.
B000GU5IH4|5|Fit both my Honda Nighthawk 750 and now my Triumph T100. Large seems like a good fit for most medium sized cafe style bikes. Has been good for two years covering a bike parked outside 24/7, never ripped or stretched. Good waterproofing and sun protection (although you will see sun fading on the cover). Only bad thing I can say is that after heavy rain water can pool at the very bottom of the cover. Otherwise a great product for the price, no complaints
B00J5SYNAQ|5|Perfect fit.  Great and easy purchase.
B000E8SX0M|2|Put these on my Toyota Previa van, and guess what?  The van still bottoms-out when encountering a dip.  Yeah sure, not AS much as it did before, but you just hate it when it happens unexpectedly.  And this is on paved roads, not some back-country dirt trail, like the McCarthy Road in AK, once notorious for multiple flats and other surprises.  My recommendation is to research the various forums and learn more from those who, know a lot more.  Good luck.
B009YY4WSO|1|Not as shown in image above. Item came damaged twice. Not constructed thoroughly
B000C42R78|3|Bought for great price and KYB name for 1999 GMC Suburban SLT. These are listed as OE replacement for this but I do not think they are equivalent for this model.  Seem to ride smooth enough but I seemed to gain more sway and roll when turning and braking.
B00M8C379E|5|Product as described!
B00LIRVV2K|5|These work and look great!! The lights aren't that bright but if you know how to wire really well, they are pretty tricky but wire up really well!
B0052FRX9E|1|Pros: looks like the original.<br /><br />Cons: it doesn't work without modification to the car.  I put it on a 98 Camry. As it turned out, the handle lever's pull distance is just a bit shorter than necessary to trigger door opening - maybe by 1/8&#34;.  I had to bend the connecting rod that attaches to the handle in a couple of places to shorten its overall length so the handle can pull the trigger within its moving range.  Also, the hole where the locking rod anchors is too small, as noted by an earlier reviewer, and it's not shaped like the original, which makes the rod hard to install.
B0028BVDRS|5|Easy to install. Didn't even have to drop the muffler.
B0035RZ280|5|Easy to use and does the job
B009MQMHHM|5|Love the fit and how soft and thin the material is.
B0028F4CH2|5|I got this for my husband and it looks much better in person. He did pick it out though and it looks really nice!!! He had a pin to put in on with so it worked out great.
B007N6OYSI|5|These competed the Bilstein upgrade on all four corners of my H3. Increased travel with torsion-bar adjust, leveling out the truck, quicker turn-in, dramatically reduced hop on washboards, greater control. Mounted in fifteen minutes.
B00MB0EDMS|5|Shipping was fast and packed nicely. Great seat covers and more then a fair price ! Looks good in any car with such a bright cheery pattern .
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Maybe an odd application, I put these on my daughter's peg perego rzr riding toy. Used an inline fuse and a basic toggle switch. These are very bright and exceeded my expectations.
B00APSSPEA|5|I'm waiting for a replacement-Motor on the lowest speed didn't work on Forward.
B00KDJNRDA|5|This was an exact fit for my Vstar 1100 custom, plug and play once you get the plastic cover freed up to allow access.  Solved my battery discharging problem.
B00X69RMKS|5|I would like to start this review off by saying that any after market products placed on or around the car seat that may affect the function WILL void the warranty on it. My decision was this: preserve the seats on my BRAND NEW car or worry about a car seat that code $150? Not a hard decision. This seat protector works perfectly for what I needed! It fit in my car quite well (2015 Chevy Traverse), excepting that the back of it didn't quite go up the back of the seat to be tied off. That isn't really an issue, because if the seat is installed tightly it will hold it up itself. The pockets overlap the end of the seat so you can store whatever essentials you may need. I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased review.
B007KCXG0C|5|They look really great and work well I am glad I ordered them
B005FG647W|5|This light is indiscernible from the factory original that it replaced.
B00651CLCS|3|I live in so cal. This antenna has no signal what so ever. It looks great, so I kept it on and listen to Pandora. So for looks 5 star. For the purpose a 1 star.
B00603DSGO|2|Works but needs to be modified so that it doesn't point the antenna towards the passenger side. I was hoping they would have fixed this problem by now.
B000H8XLX8|5|Thanks so much!
B001A0F88I|5|Worked great easy to install
B00N11DBQ0|5|Very good performance, good deal!
B00AV9EBIM|5|um does not really need a review but it gets talked about alot really funny
B0085KGOIE|4|Overall good product.  Do NOT order the separate tow handle as it already comes with one.  It also comes with a short 3&#34; diameter hose, but it is for dumping only, not filling the tank.  You need to use a regular sewer hose with bayonet end on both sides, one for the camper, one for the tote.  Or I think pyramid style sewer connection end may work on the tote end.  I will try that on my next trip.  Also, it is not air tight, but I only use it for grey water, not black, so it's not an issue.  Happy camping!
B00U5UBQE4|2|First off, you need to keep the key IN for this to operate correctly.  I guess that is some sort of safety feature? Wish that was stated somewhere.  Not sure if I have a defective unit. When I take the key out and just jiggle the unit a tiny bit, the power comes back on through in the off position.    I tested this on my motorcycle:  1.  I turn the motorcycle key on and the battery stitch on. 2.  This activates my bikes lights. 3.  Then I turn the battery key off and the lights go out, seems good. 4.  But just the process of removing the battery key jiggles the unit creating a connection somehow.    I've checked and double checked my wiring.  This isn't an installation problem. Also this only occurs when I wiggle the unit, not the connecting wires.  Now I'm always double checking and wondering if the power is really cut off...
B001GXLJ28|4|Looks and feels cool
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Worked really well. Removed almost all of the stains I had.
B001U2DPUE|5|Easy install. Works great
B00HNKYD0I|3|Good product
B00VPI09AW|5|It works great. Just what I needed.
B00ECXOF3E|2|Lights work good. But one light I received had three bulbs that did not work from out of the box.
B001FEOSPS|5|Super easy to install put them in my 2013 silverado 1500 quad cab.  Hardest part of install was running the air lines and that was pretty easy, just time consuming.  Great product.
B00GG5C0TM|3|The items were a little discolored and 1 had a pitch in part of the emblem.
B001O0TZE2|4|Met my expectations !
B00JXZJ8G0|4|Great quality compressor as far as I can tell.  I installed it 2 days ago and working great.  I only wish they would have told me that it came preloaded with oil as I spent $23 on a can that I did not need.  I would have given it a 5 had it not been for this.
B000C7QGZO|5|Fit like a glove - no leaks
B000GZCUAC|5|Great thanks! much more affordable than buying locally in NZ :)
B0046I3I8I|2|I've had canvas covers in the past, and they were MUCH better than vinyl, lasted longer---didn't attract mice like the fuzzy-lined vinyl covers and didn't crack.<br /><br />Unfortunately, these are VERY thin, I would hardly call them &#34;canvas&#34;.  If you can find them, the HEAVY COTTON DUCK covers are the best.  I thought this was what I had ordered.  I will keep them (too much of a hassle to pack up and send back), but I'm disappointed.  I would classify this material as CANVAS GAUZE.  The sewing and the seams are very sloppy with lots of loose threads.  The material looks heavier in the photo.
B009F10S3Y|1|If your looking for pro level stuff this is not it.<br />The front bumper of your car gets more action than any other location while driving.<br />You really think some tape is going to be sufficient?<br />....wasn't for me
B00KULFTGE|5|Fit perfectly and work properly.
B005TTZLE2|5|I went with JKS because I've used their quick disconnects in the past and their quality impressed me. I already had a motor mount lift so did not have to fool with the fiddly gear shift brackets. Just had to move my radiator back to its original location.. Instructions were pretty good except they should mention the precaution of removing the 4 gas filler screws so the filler hose doesn't crack the plastic when jacking up the body. Hose is long enough once kit is installed, but you have to jack the body up just a little higher to get all the pucks in and some have reported this can stress the filler mount and crack it. Combined with my 2.5&#34; OME lift I think this gives a perfect height for 33 inch tires and looks great. Wish the bolt heads were black so they would blend in better but I can do this later.
B007QBQ6RC|5|Working great.  Came on time .
B00062ZHBY|3|I've purchased dozens of Edelbrock intakes over the years, and was really looking forward to installing this Air Gap intake on my big block. Pros: It does what is advertised, builds great mid range torque, and looks nice. Cons: It pains me to write these things but each of them upset me more than the last. 1) It took forever for it to show up. I know that isn't an Edelbrock issue, but it was ridiculous.  2) the very first thing I saw when I opened tye box... two nicks, or small gouges on the tops of the front plenums.  3) When I turned the manifold over to inspect the ports, and machined faces... whovever deburred the ports must have been late for lunch or something. They looked terrible, with burrs and wavy edges... and the machined surfaces had .035&#34; deep tool, or clamp marks. I had to sand and deburr it all, and run a straight edge. 4)  This one really got me angry... the gaskets are in place, I super carefully lower the intake onto the engine, so.as to get perfect sealant squeeze out, I loose install all intake fasteners, but when I get to the last two at the rear, passenger side... I can't start the bolts. A quick look with a flashlight reveals the two holes are each 1/2 hole off, upward and to the rear. Had to pull it out, clean the sealant off of everything, and I tried for half an hour to finesse the intake into position... had to resort to round filing the two holes... and 'that' sucks.
B002R0YD04|5|Fits perfectly with my toyota corolla 2000. Easy assembly. Took me less than 5 minutes.<br />NOTE: bulb already a part of the new assembly
B009304KLS|5|Expensive but fits perfectly Altima 2015
B000CO826S|5|I'm not sure what people are talking about, I had no issue installing this intake on my 2013 R/T Charger BlackTop Edition. It fits fine, sounds great, and the car is a little more responsive under acceleration.
B0027EUPFC|5|So far works great and does the job!
B000COB8UK|2|I was very frustrated with this. I installed these in my wife's car and thought they were okay because they illuminated when the lights were turned on. After thinking they were okay and putting everything together, we drove to the store only to find out that they did not blink when activated. We bought an identical pack at the store of 1157A's, and they worked great. So I'm not sure if it was a fluke for those particular bulbs, but it was very disappointing and frustrating to go through the effort only to have to redo it afterward.
B00CGAERCE|5|really nice decal
B00J56MVTI|1|hard to clean,,get dirty fast,,only good for few hundred miles,,,
B001AWLJG6|5|This thing ROCKS!!!!! Very happy with it. I use it by itself to hold up an Ultra Classic. Holds the bike very sturdy. I was worried about the bike  tipping when I saw it but NO WAY. Best accessory purchase I have ever made. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
B00I8OMWQ0|2|This product looks really great on my bike. But I would personally never buy this product again. Not this brand but wrap in general. My exhaust is exactly as hot as it was I don't see how my plastics arnt melting. But it could just be that my bike runs hotter than most. I'm not saying don't buy this it may work great for you, but didn't do a thing for me. Just looks really nice.
B0093XZFPA|5|as promised work fine
B00NTU18KY|5|I use this to test every cable and power hub before I write a review on it. Immediate clear results, amazing product.
B004KB83Z4|5|Very nice upgrade. Easy install on a 2008 Ducati S2R1000. The wiring harness is well labeled, but the wires are very long... you'll want zip-ties to hold the coiled slack so that it can be tucked away neatly under the seat.<br /><br />NOTE: I installed this light after a tail-chop (rear fender removal). In the case of a tail-chop you should be aware that you'll probably need a good set of vibration dampening washers to protect this light from road vibration. I figured this out the hard way. The tail chop kit I bought left my brake light mounted, essentially, directly to the frame. I started going through incandescent brake bulbs every couple months as the filaments were shaken apart. I bought this LED fixture to address the problem of burning through so many bulbs... LEDs are supposed to last forever, right?... it hadn't occurred to me that it was vibration at the root of the issue.<br /><br />So, after about six months of daily commuting (about 6,000 miles total) the first Integrated Sequential LED Tail Light I purchased lost an array of LEDs decreasing the visibility of brake and turn lights (but not failing altogether). That's when I started to think about the 'why' of all these failures. :( But I liked this unit enough to repurchase: so, I'm on my second light now and I'm hoping that the vibration dampening washers will have this one lasting for quite a bit longer.<br /><br />I used these washers: [[ASIN:B006GBIVY4 Isolate It: Sorbothane Vibration Isolation Washer 70 Duro (.45&#34; ID - 1&#34; OD - .19&#34; Deep) - 12 Pack]]. They're available in several densities. 70 is the most firm, but still quite soft: something like very firm Jello or a soft Gummy Bear.<br /><br />I used two washers on each mounting post, sandwiching both sides of the mount-point in the washers so that the light is completely insulated from direct road vibrations. So far, so good.<br /><br />I hope this saves someone else the headache and expense I went through.
B000CF3WFI|5|Fits 2004 ford explorer 4.0l upstream like a glove no fitment issues at all.
B00P2QI9M8|5|Just as described!!
B00700FQZC|4|Cute but small
B004JBYW7S|5|Fit like a glove in my 95 civic ex sedan.  Very happy. This, along with some NGK plugs really added spunk to my civic.
B00Y0P4PI4|5|It's very well made and it even came with a ansatsu kyoushitsu button which surprised me :3
B0013HT2TY|5|Fits great nice quality
B004ZF39T0|4|Outstanding product!!!
B00E1SJDMS|5|Happy with purchase.  Can feel the difference in braking power compared to my old rusted brakes.
B00QI024QO|5|Needed a cheaper set of car mats.  These fit the budget...look nice...and are actually decent quality.  No complaints.
B008M62R78|4|Exterior is nice.  Drawers could be a little heavier.  Disappointed to see made in China.  For the price I incorrectly assumed it was made in U.S.
B000I04Z7Q|5|easy to install. all you need is an ac adapter and you are good
B00WKD9GCI|1|2 big 4 a 83 cr 250
B00009WC2S|4|I purchased this and a the &#34;DS18 RC-CLS2 Red Cobra Central Lock 2 Door System&#34; from Amazon to give my aging 2-door 2003 Toyota Tacoma a refresh with some modern features (that my wife was primarily interested in). I started the day before reviewing the videos that Bulldog put together, which really helped. This morning I woke up, and installed the kit and the two power door locks in about 8 hours.<br /><br />Tips:<br />-remove all obstacles, including the seats around you.<br />-the brake connector (brown) was the hardest connector by far<br />-the door lock red/black wire may need a positive 12v connection, so look into this first before you finish your splice into the 12v power lines (I had to redo this)<br />-the tachometer line (grey/white?) should not have been needed, however, Bulldog states that if your vehicle starts and shutdown in a cycle (mine did, 5 second cycle.), then you need to connect this line to the first ignition line (I had to re-do this splice).<br />-the unit started up and was in &#34;Safe Mode&#34;. look into this. it will basically just cause your parking lights to flash repeatedly.<br />- Note again that the auto-tach feature is not enabled by default and you have to enable it.<br />- you should really have your own set of wire strippers, razor knifes, zip ties and electrical tape. you will use more than they provided. The razor knife they provided was broken (and I wouldn't have used it anyways, but for some I'm sure it is handy).<br />- know that the professionals use solder on these connections, however I doubt the electrical tape + zip tie combo and proper splicing is really any worse.<br />- the install kit comes with splice connectors - these maybe handy for the connection to the brake and accessory lines - I did not use them.<br />- the electrical probe was very handy and i'm happy that they wisely included it. test everything before splicing.<br />- don't forget to connect everything up before you fire it up for the first time!<br />- the connectors are one-way - I could NOT unconnected the 12v and ignition connectors one connected! be warned.
B00JBMRYJI|5|A proven product at a great price! What is not to love!
B009S9RURU|5|Excellent.
B001892VMC|5|Fits great in both of my Jeeps !  I have not used it yet but it sure seems stout !
B00J99S4FG|5|It works well.
B0039H67E4|3|Does not fit with an aftermarket spare tire carrier where the back side of the tire touches against the spare carrier.
B008JQMIT8|5|This is a direct replacement for the electronic front mount on my 2000 Maxima SE. Do yourself a favor and change the rear engine mount at the same time.
B0002U2V1Y|4|This is my first clay bar ever so keep that in mind. I watched several videos on how to do it and what to expect. I have not bothered using the included towel and left it in its wrapper. It worked perfectly and was not difficult to do. I would wet a section, clay it, inspect the bar and then fold it inward to expose fresh clay. Then use a microfiber towel to buff off the detailer spray.<br /><br />I did two cars with one bar before I got ahead of myself and moved the clay bar onto a dry area. The clay stopped, my hand kept going, and I ended up dropping it. Threw it away per the internet. Thankfully there are 2 bars in the kit so I could finish the job. Not sure how often I will need to clay, maybe before each application of wax (6 months maybe)...so I bought another bottle of detailer to use liberally when claying in the future.
B0053P69IO|5|Fit our 2013 Sienna XLE perfectly.  Well done.  Great value.  Quality product.  Install was about an hour.  Did not need to undo muffler rubber connector.
B00W31VMYC|5|Perfect
B00A7YVQRA|4|great product !
B00029J3K2|5|Good product so far I thought it would be louder
B000182DWE|5|Fits well, looks good and does the job. Held on by strong tape. Have had no problems so far.
B00JF55FJ2|1|Ripped into a plethora of pieces but was so cheap didn't even bother complaining
B00OULLWMA|5|Great seller good product thanks!
B00E1IZJVC|5|I installed this on my 2015 Honda Accord Hybrid with no issues. Took me about an hour to install all four of them. Looks great and does what it suppose to do: which is reduce the water and other crud that hits the side of my car. Glad that I was able to do this myself. If I had the deal do it, they would have charged me over $150 for parts and labor. Save yourself the money and do it yourself. All you need is a screwdriver. It's that simple.
B00EJFH6YA|5|Definitely a lot of light for what you pay for I'm impressed I hooked it up on my pick up and it has a good distance of 350-400 feet of visibility and I can barely see my high beams when that light bar is on its the best buy if you have to save money in my opinion
B000FQBWCY|5|This charger does the job for the autos that have a demanding electronic system that can drain the battery. I would never waste my time &<br />money again on a cheap trickle charger expecting it to do the job that this one will do.
B000IY6UU2|5|If you own a Z31 300ZX, you NEED to have this wire set. The quality is as good as OEM and that includes fitment for installation.
B00HV2KMLM|5|Excellent product. Directions are easy to follow, installation was easy. I recommend having 2 people for installing, just makes it that much easier. Thank you.
B00D9BFR8M|4|arrived in timely matter, cover fits good, will help a lot
B0068M09YQ|5|The best.
B005HVG4GQ|5|Never thought it was so easy to test the brake fluid.  tested on an 03' Infinity FX35, probably haven't changed brake fluid for 5 years as far as I can remember, it showed one red light indicating it's time to replace brake fluid (it's the manufacturer's dot 3 fluid).  Tested on an 08' Toyota Camry Hybrid which had a brake fluid change only 6 months ago by Toyota dealership, again dot 3, it showed one yellow light indicating it's still good.  Tested on a newly ordered jar of dot 4 brake fluid, it showed one green light as expected.  I live in Colorado and there is not much humidity here.  So I can use this tester to determine when I need to change the brake fluid, instead of following the dealer's suggestion that I need to change brake fluid every two years. This will definitely make me feel comfortable to change brake fluid less often than the manufacturer's manual requires.
B005R4KVLC|3|It does the trick of keeping car from the sun, but it is klunky and bulky in putting it in place. You need to weigh if you want something quick and efficient or something that works at minimizing heat and sun.
B00IKEVX1I|3|Not too bad. Getting what you payed for
B00L7GTRR8|2|It didn't fix the problem of hyper flashing..
B006NZTZLQ|3|Still testing this, nice low cost solution, Wont work on my windows phone. (Downer)
B00JHQ7PZQ|5|very loud for the money and size. easy installation!
B000C9F4VY|5|Great replacement works better than the original motor and a great price. This is a rebuilt OEM replacement.  Tried aftermarket motor it was weak rolling up. This one is as fast going up as it is down.  Car is a 97 grand am gt 2 door. They come with bolts but it works best with a 1/4&#34; enabled rivet gun. That is how they were factory installed. So you will have to drill or grind out the old rivets to replace it.
B00A70CLZ0|5|Good-looking wheel caps
B00RW7WGME|5|Leaves no streaks!
B006JG5BG2|2|My vehicle had 15amp fuse as required. Followed instructions. Didn't start.
B000WHACHC|3|It is nice. Has great space for stuff, but seems a little flimsy
B00UAEQX4I|5|I am very pleased with how quickly they came, and they look great!! They adjust better than the old originals in my opinion.
B0049E4VJO|5|good
B00GSAUHB8|4|I gave it four stars because it did take me a few days before figuring out the way to twist and fold so the shade would be compact while not in use. I would give it five stars if it had instruction even just pictures so I didn't have to struggle for a week. the shade blocks out every bit of sun and protects the leather interior fabulously.
B003BXMAX8|1|I feel the ad was misleading ! Very light duty pvc! We will be sending back!
B0040DX7EO|4|This is awesome. It fits on easily to the regular mirror, and increases the field of view. However, it does shake and wobble a bit, specially when the car is stationary, or going over bumps.
B003HOWSYC|1|Only received the L... took 3 weeks to get. Was not very happy
B007H2PD1K|4|Fixed the drawer as advertised.
B003LHKS7E|5|Awesome!
B001N2O3PM|5|Very nice looking, came as new, easy to install, thanks
B00OABXJEO|5|The cover look great and are a perfect fit!
B00E5OUOCQ|5|Perfect fit from edge-to-edge. Easy to fold & store.
B0022ZI0JY|5|Works just like I expected. Could use a longer/larger handle. But overall the product works great for the cars I detail.
B00CGK0P4S|4|very nice floor liner<br />I would give it 4 stars but the rear liner doesnt sit completely flat over the middle section
B001LHVOVK|3|Works good, the only drawback that it has, is it doesn't give the breakdown code of the system.
B00C6B2QMG|4|I own a 2007 CT90 and am looking forward to getting the last shirt in stock, and to ride with it on. Should have more to select from.
B008GI731M|5|Excellent product.  Does not fade in color!! Kinda cheap looking plastic though
B00OFQ5JH4|5|Awesome stuff! I outlined my whole dash with this stuff and it looks great! Blends well with itself when I had to connect and two different points.
B009LZUJRY|5|took less than 45 minutes to remove the old unit and install the new.
B00XUY97R0|1|Horrible,  ball joint boots were all ready glue together ripped the boots trying to install, cost another  80 dollars from advance auto..tie rod ends are smaller the gm factory.. not worth the price will cost you more in the long run..
B0051NNHAG|3|We purchased this for our 2013 Honda Ridgeline and on an initial inpection, it looked like it didn't fit without having to drill holes in the truck. But.......With the advice of other customers who purchased this product, we finally installed it! It was a struggle but it looks like we're &#34;good to go&#34;!
B00NG7S98O|4|Light output is very good.  Color is nice, a touch whiter than the incandescent.  Probably a bit hotter than the stated color temperature, but still pleasant.  Not harsh. Much lower current draw than incandescent lights. Polarized, so in some fixtures they will not light when facing down.  I have some dual bulb fixtures. On those one bulb worked fine, but the other one had to face up to light.  I had to cross wire the bulb to work.  Not something you can do without wiring experience. In all the single bulb fixtures I put them in they worked fine.
B005IXPZHW|5|Great looking little plug, only the wrong size for my blower which takes one with a smaller thread.
B00BCRMB34|5|Fits prefect, i love it. Thank you
B009KBUR2Q|3|a little small
B00AFRIT2E|4|the right fit, just bolted it on as it said it would. works great and sounds nice whilst driving.
B00ZVJ3FUM|5|I love this set it fits my car perfectly!
B00SX9UDO8|5|Great radiator and reasonably priced. Fit right in and hooked up with ease. Haven't been disappointed.
B0055EALW8|3|So while the actual fluid is fine the issue for this product lies in the container.  At the opening to the bottle they have molded in a Vent that I am sure helps with a smooth pour when pouring it out of the container. Issue is it blocks you from using many of the fluid pumps available on the market because it does not allow you to center the pump in the opening to thread it down.  So pumps like [[ASIN:B002M589TA Custom Accessories 36671 Pennzoil Fluid Transfer Pump - Gallon]] won't work.  It can go on the bottle you just cannot secure it.  Makes for hard pumping when you are under a vehicle.  So have some clean gallon containers on hand that will fit your fluid pump if you need to utilize one for your application and transfer the contents over.
B0048YFGBW|5|More than I could ask.  All parts and included the studs too.  Arrived fast.  Yet to install.
B006W5HV40|1|Fast delivery wrong bulb size
B00TPKNREM|5|Works better than my rebuilt original starter.
B00KTHY2DA|5|Perfect fit
B008VJ9URQ|2|Ehhh.....mostly junk
B008MVSUB0|3|Works as designed, simple and easy to install. I am using on a boat vice a motorcycle, clearly not made for salt air.  Already showing some signs of rust within weeks of install.  But functionality is good. Would recommend.
B003VGHB9I|5|Like brand new
B004O7DBM4|3|I've ordered this item twice and both times it has been defective.
B00R09FPOK|1|Crappy
B007D5R4GI|5|Looks amazing.
B001C6Q7OO|5|worked like the orignal
B000E4QM7C|5|Great fit great price..couldn't be happier
B012X49ENY|5|And, frankly, makes for safer driving. I always carry stuff with me that I not only need to stow while driving, but may need to access when at a stop. There just isn't enough room in the center console space, and placing your hand bag or sunglasses, phone- whatever in the seat next to you always end up sliding away. Whereas in the back seat it's all over the place and inaccessible.<br /><br />This is easy to install, or move, and rigs up right there slightly behind but beside me for easy access & storing. Fits my sedan well, and adjusts no problem. A wonder this hadn't come to my attention before-- I've been wanting some fix to my driving-possessions conundrum for ages...<br /><br />Very roomy, will store most anything short of a full suitcase. Great work & design+
B004K25ICY|1|Picture shows it will fit a 2015 JEEP Safari 4-door but DOESN'T.  It also requires an additional piece.
B00Q8XY4EQ|4|dust can get through the zipper. I am going to spray with water proof spray to see if it seals better. Fits great easy to install.
B0089K6CWS|5|This is genuine OEM. It doesn't have Lexus logo because it's the same part used for both some Lexus and some Toyota models, but it is real deal. Locksmith laser cut it and said it was good quality metal that cut properly, unlike most keys he's attempted to cut that had been purchased online.
B00UUM0KYE|5|I love it! I used it on the trackpad though i thought it looked better
B009Y7MJVS|4|The best holder I've used, holds better than the plastic ones.
B005BHCEOW|5|The attachment straps are fine, attach the loop ends to your bike (they were attached to D-rings on the bag as shipped), thread the straps up through the D-rings, buckle together on top and adjust lengths . That being said, I also had Rok Straps already on my Tiger 800, so I used them. Can't beat a Rok Strap but not necessary to buy for this bag. This is my 3rd different Wolfman bag so I am a little familiar with the quality.
B009DJSH04|1|One star for proper fit.  Two big issues are that it cancels cruise control when you use the turn signal and the delay wiper waits full delay time before the first wipe.  I wouldn't recommend this product for anyone after the work it takes to replace it.
B00OJUP0G6|3|The red ones did fade quite a bit... A little too much for my taste. But the black ones are holding up just fine.
B00YV3GTWU|5|Love it, I keep these on my person, and hand them out to those who are friends of the cause!!
B000CFHDNU|1|Failed after 2 months
B006166QDM|4|ok
B004RH9X28|5|Excellent brand and cheaper than anyone else.
B001ABPKUS|5|These fit my 2012 GMC Sierra 2500 perfectly. The mounting system for these has been updated since the ones I had for my 2001 Chevy 2500. Easy on and off.
B00GWFOKYO|5|Thanks so much
B00D9E3GTG|2|Easily damaged, but has helped me keep warm on my late night jobs. My first blanket came in badly damaged, but the replacement was as good as new. It won't last long, but since I only need it for 2 weeks it doesn't have to. You're better off paying more money for a better blanket.
B009WEV5AO|3|Bought these and they lasted about 2 weeks. Pad came off on left side and I am out over 80 bucks. The good news is they were replaced and I have not had issues with the second set.
B0013V6NBA|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B00W31VMYC|2|It work only two times. After, it cannot connect to ECU
B00065TSRK|5|Great stuff
B00BTGSID0|5|Great towels
B00F5LN4FM|5|Fits great!
B00NLLH35K|1|the kit i ordered was not what i recieved. no seals with it. timing belt was too short compared to original.water pump was for a geo tracker not a metro
B000IXWFHU|5|thanks
B00KLIWMCU|5|My new sunshade fits my Mini Cooper perfectly.  Any bigger would be too big.  I<br />like the silver finish to keep the car cooler when in the California sun.  I was<br />skeptical I would fold it as small as it came, but it worked first try.  I'm<br />very happy with it.
B00ONHDWYW|5|Kinda surprised this fit really well. No trouble getting the latch to work correctly, and it lined up with the fenders very well.
B008VTA0J8|2|Shades themselves are nice, but I can't keep the in place.  The fasters don't stay in place.  I let them sit overnight after application (the instructions are to leave for one hour) and still they don't stay in place.  It's a lot of money to spend for such poor quality.  I will return if I can't find another way to keep them in place.
B00ZE5RGTY|5|Neat product. I can finally get stuff between the center console and my seat without hurting my hand. The rubber mat is nice as it holds my phone in place regardless of how hard turn i take. And the baby on board sign is one of a kind. Great product
B00ZLPABGC|5|These work nice in my SUV. I liked that they are very low profile.
B00IKZTRLA|5|Looks like it came on my truck. Great quality. Only wish it was a little bigger.
B001B9SL50|5|Just picked these up for my 2007 VW Beetle and the down road vision appears to be much better than stock. Thanks!
B00FXLJ8U4|5|as advertised.  hope i never have to use them but they are in the cars just in case.
B007480MI6|5|Very Easy to install and durable.
B001TYT020|1|Did not fit my 2013 kia sorento like they said it would and the material clings to everything. *NOT RECOMMENDED*
B00GI822C2|5|Although the Stormtrooper mask looks a bit off up close, I much prefer this seat cover to the Darth Vader seat cover I'd bought from plasticolor a year back.
B006OCUAFS|5|Great
B009OTW646|5|Absolutely amazing stuff.  Paired with a good foam cannon this stuff foams up great. As always Chemicals guys does a great job.
B00TEG2QH6|5|They work good I put them on my 1999 GTmustang
B00OI0RRSQ|5|The starter works just as it should.
B007KPS8SY|5|Went on and operated Like OEM unit. Looks good. Functions perfectly
B007R4EZHQ|1|Radical fluctuation of reading (thousands of RPMs)  making the gauge useless.  Contacted GlowShift. Before purchase & explained my application (1996 Ford E150 van w/ 4.9L motor w/ single coil).  Installed tach.  After radical fluctuations, contact GlowShift again & explained situation.  Was told I need a tach filter.  I bought it from them & installed it.  No change in readings.  Contacted Glowshift the 3rd time & explained the continuing problem.  Told to remove gauge & return to them & they would determine if gauge was faulty - if so, they would replace the gauge.  If it was good, I was out of luck.  Anybody who has tried to work under the dash of an E series van knows how difficult it is. If their product won't work with the Ford TFI-IV module system, they should know it and maybe they do and maybe the gauge is bad.  When I get the half day to remove the gauge & filter, I will pull them & send them back to Glowshift, but I don't have confidence.  I also purchased a GlowShift transmission temp gauge which works fine.

B00HZ414IQ|5|I used this petcock for a 2003 Honda XR100R. The new bolts were actually too long for my bikes gas tank, so I used the old bolts with the new petcock. It all fit perfectly and works flawlessly. The only downside is that the labels for reserve, on, and off are not there. But it's really nothing to complain about. Overall, great product for the price, you can't beat it. My old petcock was damaged by gas sitting in the tank for too long.

B009146QU4|5|We are very happy with these covers.  Easy to clean and the fit is great.
B009J6AAGU|5|Works very well.  This works very well for bathroom odors and I was pleasantly surprised to find out how effective it was for removing the lingering cooked cabbage odor from the house after dinner clean up.  Cooked cabbage is one odor that is not easy to remove quickly, but Ozium did a great job.  I will always keep this on hand, I love it!
B005JVQ34C|5|Great product!  Note that the face and needle both light up white.  The more expensive version is color switchable.  This one lights with tiny LEDs, so if you want to change the color, you can delicately pry the bezel off and insert a piece of a stage lighting gel.  Works great.
B00KJ17RLK|5|Very nice light for the price, really bright and looks to be well built.
B00M1XSM0E|5|great value!!!
B00HTOB0NG|5|Got the 6k hids from them installed on 2015 Kia Forte they flicker and then turned off. I bought these. There just as easy to install and fix the problem. The hids work perfectly and I'm extremely happy. Also shipping was very fast.
B00BLX1L4O|5|Very nice
B001KSGJKQ|5|Fixed cruise control 2011 Yukon XL
B00BI3ML1Y|5|Works perfectly.  Better than OEM with the bearing.  Time will tell how it holds up to water and mud.  Easy swap out...bolts right in.
B000CQOIVO|5|Very good for the price.
B001539B7O|5|Opened up the box, plugged it into my truck. Checked with my meter to see if I had 120volts. Plugged my Dewalt 18volt battery charger in and dropped a battery in and this inverter charged it right up with no problem! Inverter was just barely warm cigarette lighter plug and cord, cold! Awesome.
B00065ZIJ2|5|Works really fine, cheap excellent security for your car, as good as described
B0030VH6M6|4|You need to get your own nuts! No joke there, the picture clearly show the nuts are included, but THEY ARE NOT. Other than that , they are fine.

B006D9WBAY|5|Product was just as described, fit perfectly
B00SNCYQL6|5|Simple, looks good, and doesn't make me look like a mushroom head. Great, especially for the price. And as a bonus, it fits in my saddle bag! I might even get a second one to keep for passengers.
B0071Q4TEE|5|Loved it!
B000CMIYE0|2|Had to use a wrench to get them off my valve stems after a few months.
B00Y1960C8|4|Fit fine but I had one in the past that had sides to it so it would contain spills etc.  this one is flat but still protects floor of trunk ok.  Easy to trim to fit.
B00802GZFY|5|Easy to install and great customer service

B00AVYXOZS|5|I purchased this carburetor for a 2003 Honda XR100R. I received it on time and it came in great condition. All I had to do was take the old carburetor off and put this one in. With my motorcycle, all I had to do was change the current throttle cables slide and spring to the new one. I did not have to change the screw cap for the throttle cable, as the old one fit perfectly on the new carburetor. After spending some time hooking the drain lines and fuel line up, I got everything back together. After a couple kicks the bike roared to life, I did have to adjust the idle some. The bike runs great now! I'm 100% satisfied with this carburetor. Once again, if you have a Honda 2003 XR100R, then this is the carb for you!
B007X6NVPU|5|Don't usually review items but this just looks great on my corolla! figured since there was no pictures I'll add one as well.<br />It has 3 tension settings, I used the largest one hopefully it stays on, time will tell.
B005LFOFZU|5|Great Seller, Great Product
