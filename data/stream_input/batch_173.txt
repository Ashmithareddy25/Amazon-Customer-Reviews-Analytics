B003BL1HIE|5|Great for pumping if you get more than 5 oz from each side... it sucks to stop pumping and have to switch bottles.
B002ZDFVP4|1|This could be a great product for making sure your child doesn't fall out of bed except for the plastic components.  The mesh rail is connected to the under mattress supports via a plastic tube.  This piece on both supports sheared off within a month of using this product.  We followed all the guidelines for proper installation, what caused the pieces to snap and the mesh rail to fall to the floor (with child) was our child actually put his body weight on it.  In conclusion: this product looks good, but if it needs to be used (to keep your child in bed) it will fail.
B00K8FMQPE|5|Perfect for storing small items!!
B00AHVR4KG|2|It's good to fold. But It's too big.
B00880P80G|5|This backpack is darling! I bought it for my daughter for preschool, but it turns out she actually needed a regular sized backpack (which I never did purchase, I am just waiting until the next school year to do so). If you get a piece of paper and fold it in half (hamburger style) turning it like a book...that's about the heigth of things that will fit in it. Pretty spacious for a mini backpack, love the colors and design, she was complimented all the time on her backpack. She now uses it as a play backpack, and I figure it'd be good to store snacks and toys while camping.
B009UPUFCY|5|Worked well, it does suck up batteries but with rechargeable so had no issues. Worked well in a playpen bed and on the crib. I would buy again
B00I3YFHSU|5|Love this stroller! I wanted something ultra portable for nyc public transportation and taxis. This is it! I have a phil and ted's double stroller and a maclaren quest, both of which I find to be too difficult to bring on public transportation. However, this stroller folds very compactly, making it ideal for taxis, buses and trains. It also came in very handy at our latest brunch in the city. The nano folds and stands on it's own, so it can fit right under the table by our feet and out of everyone's way. The only con with the stroller is that the canopy lays on the handlebar and your hands when not in use. This is not a deal breaker for me, but a little annoying. The stroller maneuvers very easily on city streets and appears to be very comfortable for my 2.5 year old. I don't think I'll every go back to a traditional umbrella stroller.
B002VWZU7S|5|Super cute!  Perfect gift
B009915MRC|5|great sleeper. we have used these for months and months. they are warm, but when it gets too hot out i only use a shirt with the sleeper and it keeps baby warm but not too hot. it also helps prevent kids from taking of their PJ's if they are at that age.
B000JWSO9I|5|This is a great product. My son personally doesnt use it unless I hold it in his mouth, I dont think this is a great item for a preemie but it is a great product~!
B000UXKZ0W|4|We just used these tattoos over the memorial day weekend on a family trip. Thankfully we didn't lose our son, but it was good to know he had something on him he couldn't take off.  I only wish there had been a place to write his name or our names. Only a phone number fits.  The tattoo lasted 3 days, not the 5 it states.
B0000DEW8Z|1|The lid always falls down and the child can't even lean on it.  When my son tried to use it by himself, the very little protection shield did nothing to prevent a big mess.  So how can they learn to use the potty with something like that!  The bowl is way too small so repositioning did not help much either. Using it as a step stool is no fun either, it is too heavy for a little one to carry around.  Not a very good design at all I agree with all the other * reviews.
B002TKM35Y|4|I am reviewing the black one, which was sent to me instead of the red one by mistake.  Overall I like this bag, though I feel like it could have used more organizational features in the middle.  There are quite a few pockets around the outside, but the middle still ends up being a black hole.  The bag does seem pretty strong and all the zippers and everything work great... However, I don't really think that the price on this bag is spot on - I could have gotten a $50 school backpack and had as good of results.
B00171WXII|5|So this is pretty freaky.  You are literally sucking the snot out of your kid's nose (at least I hope it is your kid -- it would be inappropriate to do this to a random stranger).  The mucus does not get near your mouth though so if you are a booger eater, you will be disappointed in that.
B0002HYCJQ|3|This is a really cute little toy, but neither of my children ever showed any interest in it.
B00337WCBC|4|It really deserves  5 stars cause it's so cute.  But it wasn't easy finding an affordable lamp base.
B001OI3ZG8|1|This is an odd frame.  The front is cute, but it took forever to figure out how to get a picture into it.  It doesn't have any legs, so it can't be stood up and there is no way to hang it, not sure what to do with it.
B002WDEIVA|5|is more practical as well avoid wetting or damaging the boppy because a baby is always inevitable that some accident occurs, very good quality.
B008H55MKS|3|This was DATED. Cute but description misleading
B00J3TVRJ2|5|I bought these for my son and newborn and they both love them!
B004WP8QLE|5|So comfortable! Liner is too short  ( you will spill over ) to wear when menstrating but GREATon days off. The only differance in size is the lenght not thickness ( thickness is the same on all pads. I got white because it matches with all panties.. Yes they do stain .. many reviews say they dont.. but yes I find they did for me  and I soak them and sun them... The pads come in the cutest waterproof hot pink zipper bag. Amazing ((amazing)) quality .. and they are so soft its not even funny ;)
B001CWVYMI|4|This works great for my Cosco Scenera but I would prefer if they made it so it could be worn as a backpack instead of messenger. It's really bulky and falls off the shoulder easily. Still way better than the alternative.
B002WB2P1M|4|Our 3 (soon to be 4) year old has been using this seat for about a year now.  It has held up very well and we are very happy with it.  It's super easy to use and the kids love having their own lights.  The belt hold does a great job of positioning the shoulder belt.  The only down side is the the seat is quite wide, making the cup holders fairly useless next to a door or another car seat, even in the back of my full sized pickup.  The width can also make it difficult to get a seat belt fastened when it is placed next to another car seat or booster, but it is not tied in tight with a latch system, so it isn't too hard to shift the seat around and make the belt latch a little more accessible.   We will be buying 2 more of these (one for each vehicle) when our next one is big enough to upgrade to a boost seat.
B000S9RF4M|5|My daughter says it was the best baby entertainer ever.  And the attachment clips make it possible to use it on stroller, car seat, high chair, etc.  I would definitely purchase this again.
B00CWN3FNW|5|I love this bouncer! It calms my baby down easily and make him fall asleep!!! He's so happy with it :)
B00I3PQL7K|4|They work great and are super adorable. Just not good for chunky thighs
B0032AYC72|3|The play mat is visually stimulating for the baby without compromising home decor - it's quite \\"stylish\\" for baby gear in my opinion.  My baby loves the lights and the music is nice too - less annoying than many musical toys out there. That said, the mat comes with a variety of hanging toys, including three plastic rings with \\"familiar baby faces\\" - while this may be well intentioned, I think it is worth noting that all 3 of the baby faces are blonde haired, blue eyed, caucasian babies. It's kind of disturbing actually. In our multicultural/racial society I think it would go without saying that there are a greater variety of \\"familiar faces\\" for the consumer who might be interested in this product. What is familiar to one family, may not be to another. Otherwise a great product.
B006ZISSGY|1|I purchased this car seat for my Daughter, age 4, thinking it would be safer for her than just a booster seat.  It might be - that is, if the seat covering would stay in place.  I have complained to the company, and was sent another car seat cover -- that didn't stay on.  I complained again, and the company told me to send the seat to them and that they would send me a new one. No. I have one car seat, I am not about to send it back and wait for a new one.  The company gave in and said that they would ship a new one, but I had to send the other one back once I received the new one. Great.  Two weeks later, the new car seat arrived.  I installed it into my car (straight out of the box), and guess what? The cover started coming off AGAIN.  The car seat cover is fabric and has elastic bands to hold the covering in place so that it does not expose your child to sitting on hard plastic (God forbid you get into an accident and have plastic shards flying all over).  The elastic bands 'grip' onto straight plastic.  Not hooks.  Can you see a problem? Of course the covering won't stay on- there is nothing to hold it in place! I thought maybe this was just a fluke that I bought a seat that had this problem, but, sadly, no, it is the way that the seat is manufactured.  This seat was not cheap - and I expected it to at least last one year... it lasted a matter of days.  This car seat is a rip-off.
B00133U7D8|4|Stretches out with use, get a smaller size than you think.<br />Lorna
B00N897M5Q|5|Nice size and sticks great!
B00465QRUM|5|I love this product.  Great multi-use bag.  Dirty clothes, dirty diapers, swim suits, make-up bag.  I'm never without this bag, need to order more.  I would recommend this product time and time again.
B002WB2GB6|5|gifts for my nephew excellent quality
B007XTR71G|4|Thought it would have been bigger only reason for 4stars. Cant wait for baby to be here to rock the k state diaper bag. Go wildcats!! EMAW!
B0013IEUJ0|3|I needed a strap for my seatbelt and found those on amazon they looked cute in pink so I bought them, when I received them they were so small, these straps are for babies. I'm still using it and its comfortable and cute but they are not for adult seat belt covers.
B00VFUJH44|1|Too Small sizes and I contact the vendor and the coustomer services is too bad!!
B000PRUAFI|5|I bough two of these. They were easy to install and packaged well. I like the automatic lock feature. Very happy with them.
B003Y3BH2A|5|Love them...use them in the adult's closet
B000G5XDA8|3|The color and material are cute and nice. It can cover my baby in her infant car seat also. But it's only good for Summer evening though, not for Winter usage. For Winter, the BayBjorn cover is much better. And one suggestion to the manufacture: It should have a hood instead of a flap. Anyway, I own both: this one and the BabyBjorn one for different seasonal usage.
B0009QYTIY|4|Item arrived right on time.  Looking forward to using it when our daughter arrive in a few weeks.  Had one for my son and they relax the baby like a charm!
B0007NC7K6|5|I compared this to the Kelty long and hard and the only drawback is the lack of storage. However, the Chicco carrier is lighter, has a better sun shield, rain shield, and most importantly is a more compact product. My 20 month old is 26 pounds and we take recently took her on a 3 mile hike and she didn't want out! Another great product by Chicco, I also own and love the Liteway stroller.
B001CUYZ7Q|1|This stroller cover is a bit on the small side. Not good for long double strollers especially if you have a Graco DuoGlider Classic Connect Double Stroller. Check the measurements of your stroller and stroller cover.
B000COY136|5|with our first kid we had so many cutesy bibs. most of the time the bottle would soak through them, which inevitably stained the clothing. with the second kid I decided to get a pack of these to supplement. they have been so good I went back, ordered two more packs, and am ditching the other bibs which are worthless.
B001GQ2RV2|5|Very happy with this product! Its very bright colored and comes with lots of attachments. It washes well, and keeps our baby entertained. We have all the precious planet items and are very happy with all of them!
B00008BR9I|5|She'll play with this toy for 30 minutes straight.  It makes lots of little noises (not electronic) and has plenty of things to grab onto with little hands.  I definitely recommend it.
B006W1JXWW|4|Pretty and classy. The baby loves it!
B00K4M2DOK|5|Great Father's Day gift for my husband!! All the roses were intact on the artificial stem. Outer packaging/shipping packaging should say to fridge until use.
B00E8KBYMG|5|Thanks Amy!!  U r right, it is $100 CHEAPER at Walmart.com!!!  Great crib and great price.
B0041EDZBW|5|This is an excellent seat belt guard.  Simple as well as effective. I use these with both my childrens fixed car seats.  We have had an incident (prior to using these) when a family member has in error disconnected the kids car seat belts instead of there own and not said anything.  I was so upset after I realized that I went straight out and tried this cover. A must have for fixed car seat saftey.  If you need to disengage the belt it's quick and simple to use your ignition key to push down against the latch.  No need to hunt for the wooden lolly sticks provided.
B004V90WA4|4|Although the item is really beautiful when it says FLOOR PILLOW it is actually a Sham and you must buy a Pillow , for the price of this item I really feel it is not worth it ... usually this kind of item  would be described as Euro Pillow sham ... THIS IS NOT A PILLOW BUT A EURO PILLOW SHAM ...Im giving it 4 stars for the craftsmanship but feel buyers should no what they are really getting .
B00AHVR4KG|3|My husband was looking for a  stroller like this one to connect with our Graco  car seat  and to  be a little easier to roll on unpaved surfaces.  Though it does not  connect with our Snug Ride,  it has met most of our expectations. Also  worth noting,  the universal smart phone holder is not big enough to hold a Samsung Galaxy 4  or my husband's BlackBerry but they  do fit  in the cup holder and  case.
B00C7DGE1C|5|works great
B00MTUYIRK|5|Absolutely love it :)
B005PWVIZE|5|I love the simplicity of how this product works and that it's very easy to install. Having said that, it's still a very effective cabinet lock that the kids couldn't just easily remove. In short, this product gets the job done!
B002BSGWSS|1|They started fraying after the second wash.
B002SW3B0O|5|These are my absolute favorite blankets! Super soft, super versatile and great for all seasons. Larger size is very nice! My go to gift for baby showers.
B001UZHCAA|5|The images seem clear and the night vision is better than some others I bought. The microphone is very sensitive. During initial setup and testing we had placed it about 5 feet from a wall clock and we could hear the ticking from the clock.
B000CP2X9O|3|The Velcro is tough on my kid's skin.
B003QQT36C|5|I could only find these online after the first store I bought them at no longet sold them. The only sippy cup my child will use, great product although it does leak if not upright.
B001SKKW0E|1|My little guy just might be a houdini in training, but he had no problem getting to the plug! Completely broke the hinge off the thing! Instead of returning it I duct taped it back together and put a dresser in front of it- so far so good...
B0000E262S|3|Our baby is now almost 8 months old and we've been using this monitor since he first slept in his crib by himself at about 7 weeks.  We were first time parents and paranoid about SIDS and all that not unlike most new parents, I would presume.  We got the Angelcare monitor set due to the movement sensor and pretty good reviews on various sites.  We wanted that reassurance that everything was OK when our baby was out of our sight, especially overnight.  There are certainly pros & cons to this monitor/sensor so know what you're getting before you buy:    Pros:  * monitor units seem well-made (although plastic, they're not as lightweight and \\"cheap\\" feeling as some others)  * limited interference/static - this tends to depend on the monitor's location in your house, nearby electronics, other wireless devices in your home (cordless phones, wireless Internet), neighbors with monitors, etc.; we've had interference issues from time to time, but 90% of the time it's just fine.  * battery life is pretty good if you don't keep it plugged in to an AC outlet 24/7  * both the base unit and at least one of two monitor/parent units has been on almost 24/7 for a good 6 months and all are still going strong  * movement sensor; adjustable movement sensitivity on base unit    Cons:  * LOTS of false alarms that got worse as our baby got older/bigger (more on this below)  * sensor pad is small & does not pick up movement well on edges of crib mattress  * \\"Tick\\" sound during movement comes from the base station which can be noisy/distracting to baby    To elaborate on the issue of false alarms: our baby had a bad case of reflux and was on prescription medication and swaddled on a crib wedge for the first few months of life. He was unable to move around the crib and the majority of his body rested on the crib wedge.  Interestingly enough, the sensor picked him up pretty well at factory default sensitivity of 2.5 - we had what we thought were false alarms maybe once every week or two.  Trust me, that gets you out of bed QUICK!  The alarm is loud, but if your baby is a pretty good sleeper & you get it turned off fast enough they may barely wake up...at least it caused little issue with our baby.      Once our baby was getting too big to be swaddled at night and wanting to move the sensor became more of a problem.  The alarm started going off almost every night - sometimes more than once.  By the time we got into his room (mere seconds, really) the alarm had kind of roused him so we knew he was breathing.  Other times the warning beep would cause him to move and prevent the alarm from sounding.  This continued for a number of weeks and I did all I could to thoroughly test the sensor by touching the mattress lightly in every possible area, checking that the ceiling fan wasn't affecting anything, adjusting the sensitivity to every number almost to maximum - nothing kept the alarm from sounding at least once a night.  We finally got so concerned that we took our baby to the pediatrician and were referred to a pulmonologist to test for sleep apnea.  We just didn't know if our baby's breathing was stopping periodically or not - was the alarm waking him up and getting him breathing again?  Was it malfunctioning?  We had no idea.  By this time our baby was about 5 months old.      The pulmonologist told us that it was very, very unlikely our baby had sleep apnea since he was not premature, had no respiratory issues before leaving the hospital or within the first few weeks home, wasn't congested, etc.  He had no symptoms other than this alarm going off.  It would even go off during his daytime naps sometimes.  The doctor had very little positive professional opinion on these home sensor/monitor units.  He gave us the choice of going with our faith & turning the sensor off, or having a hospital grade apnea monitor delivered to our home and use it for a week to confirm.  We chose the hospital monitor just to put the issue and our worry to rest.  If you've not used a hospital apnea monitor it's not something you'd want to do unless it's recommended or you feel it's in everyone's best interest (like in our case).  You have to put electrodes on your baby, run the cables through their pajamas, out the crib and into the monitor unit.  It monitors respiration, heartrate, etc.  Then we worried about the cords running through the crib.  Though by that time we had a wireless video camera set up. :) We were told even the hospital grade ones often have false alarms as well due to loose connections, the electrodes coming loose, body oils interfering, etc.  We expected alarms to sound and then the doctor would review all the stored data after a week of use to see if they were false or real apnea.  We used it for a week and did NOT have a single alarm!  None!  The doctor reviewed the data and told us to shut off the Angelcare sensor - our baby did not have sleep apnea.      We shut it off that night and have slept well ever since, and so has our baby.  It cost us many nights of restless sleep and several hundred dollars to get professional medical confirmation to rule out apnea due to all the false alarms.    So...I'm giving it 3 stars.  I give the sensor 1-2 stars, but reading other reviews some customers have positive experience with it.  I give the monitor units 3-4 stars since they've been totally reliable for 7-8 months now with the base and at least 1 monitor on almost 24/7.  Possibly we just ended up with a faulty sensor unit, but you do see quite a few customers stating false alarms.  Granted, I as a parent agree I'd rather have a false alarm from time to time and have the peace of mind.  However, ours just got to the point of being rediculous and pushing us to take the step to seek a specialist to rule out or confirm our concerns.    If you buy it, just do so with the right expectations so you won't be surprised or disappointed if it's not perfect.
B00BUXKZLA|5|Was a gift. Hopefully they love it.
B00GJIXMQG|5|Wonderful for the price.  Easy assembly.  Convenient.
B007A2ZSZ8|5|I had ducktaped the fridge door shut for months before my now 2.5yo bam bam could pull it of. Attached this to a textured fridge and it hasn't budged since installing. He's absolutely unable to get into the fridge and it's simple to unlock as well as setup. I also have it attached to a wood panel with a side lock because he can slide that lock. I can't recommend this enough. He hates it, I love it!
B00KPZE6N2|3|Cheaply made. I still like it for very light weight use.
B00H9NZHKO|5|Easy to use and install.  We rent, so we cannot screw mount everything.  These are a great alternative.  Doesn't lock adults out of the cabinets either! :)
B000UCWXOY|4|We've got a 3 month old who wouldn't sleep in his bassinet, so we purchased this to use as a cosleeper in our bed. It is very large for a cosleeper, but we've used it fine in our king sized bed. We keep one side open so we can rest a hand on him to settle/soothe him as needed. It also folds easily, is lightweight for transport and has a nice carrying strap. The foam is a bit thin though, so it is probably best on a soft surface.
B00005V9NX|4|Diaper Dekor is the small, plus is the larger. There are TWO sizes--+ won't fit the smaller unit. We have the smaller and our Babies R Us (which is where we bought it) says \\"oh sorry, we only carry the big ones now.\\" Nice! Now we have to buy liners online. I don't mind buying online but I don't appreciate that I can't go buy them where I bought the unit. If I'd had any idea they would quit carrying the smaller one we'd have bought +. It's excellent!
B000056OWT|3|Like another reviewer, we got this monitor free with a purchase at Babies R Us, although I should say from looking at the photo here, I'm guessing the one I got is an older model that was being discontinued. But who knows whether the manufacturer has updated the technology or just modernized the housing.... <br /> <br />Anyway, we already had the Sony Baby Call 27 channel monitor, but since this was free, we got it to take with us on trips or when we're going to a friend's house for the evening and taking our Pack N Play -- that way, we wouldn't have to unplug and pack our Sony all the time. <br /> <br />What's good about this monitor: <br />- Both the transmitter and the receiver can run on AC outlet power OR on a 9-volt battery. This is great if you need to put them somewhere that doesn't have easy outlet access. In contrast, the Sony receiver is portable but the transmitter operates on AC power only. <br /> <br />- The receiver is compact and has a belt clip. <br /> <br />What's not so good: <br />- The sound is not nearly as clear as our Sony. Listening to it makes me think of what my grandmother says about her hearing aid -- it amplifies all the noises equally, so when there's a good bit of noise in the baby's room (i.e., music playing and heat running), you hear a lot of noise through the monitor. With the Sony, I feel like I can turn it down pretty low and it still picks up the baby's cries well without getting all that background noise. <br /> <br />- No lights. Now, maybe if I wasn't using the Sony all the time, I wouldn't be so dependent on the lights. And at night, I guess it's not an issue. But when the baby is napping, I am often washing dishes or running laundry or taking a shower or doing something equally noisy, and in those cases, I really rely on those lights to let me know if the baby is crying. With this monitor, I find myself having to pick it up and hold it to my ear to try to figure out what's going on. <br /> <br />Bottom line, if you're willing to spend a little more, you can get a superior product in the Sony Baby Call. Frankly, since the Sony 27-channel model has a rechargeable battery, you'll probably make up the cost difference over time.
B005H7NXH8|5|GREAT
B00F2MQ294|5|We have a baby who always has to know what's going on, therefore doesn't love being in the reclined position. So, this chair was perfect for him. I was torn between this and the Bumbo but based on reviews went with this and am glad I did. At 2 months he wasn't 100% stable to sit up on his own but the high back of this chair provided great support.
B007MM8JHA|5|Soft, beautiful, great size and fashion burpies
B0013EHGTA|5|As with many of my baby son's toys this was a gift and he loves it! He has had a lot of \\"quick fun\\" with it but his attention is not held by this toy very long, unfortunately.  That is for several reasons, but the main one is he had this toy before he could walk and has been walking nearly over a month (about 7 weeks or so) now...and so this toy is not a fascination compared with other newer toys, and the minute bits of stuff he finds in his daily travels, lol!<br /><br />But the toy is a great 1 for babies to learn the abc song, because my son starting singing it not too long ago, abc \\"e\\"...he sang just the other day and yes, he was wrong but he was singing, on-tune with the toy and that was definitely music to my ears since I assumed he would learn from the Leap Frog Letter Factory DVD and our reminders like his older brother, who before he was 2...could identify all the letters and their sounds from a dvd I bought on this website!
B00433OQO6|5|EXCELENT THANKS
B00115PFOO|5|I bought this bed for my two year old and she loves it! It was delivered in two days and I put it together myself. It was very simple to put together and the wood is beautiful, not cheap lookin at all. Excellent bed for price
B00R6OBPNY|3|These blankets are ok, not the best I've seen, very thin and the fabric is pretty awful.
B00FPFBB3K|5|very happy with seller and product
B0065IL1DQ|4|It is a Snug fit, soft cotton, and seems to be well-made.  I am very content with my purchase and recommend it.
B008PKXMKM|5|I love it, nice vibrate colour, the giraffe is awesome, this one stay in the air, doesn't fall on the baby. Really happy with my choice!
B001JJOE76|3|I loved the concept. As a new parent we were all over this product, I liked that it was portable and could go with baby even if he was sleeping in the pack-n-play at my mom's or sleeping in his crib at our house or sleeping in his carrier while we were at a friends. All those other monitoring systems uses a matt and has very strict requirements. However... while the concept of this thing was great, more than once it slid from my son's stomach area to his side and couldn't detect movement, buzzing and then beeping and then nearly giving the wife and I a heart attack before we realized the baby was fine but the repisense had shifted. After the 2nd false alarm we decided against its use. If you use this, just try to ensure there's no way it can move or shift. We had it clipped to his diaper near the stomach area but somehow it moved itself.
B00BM97FWE|5|Makes a perfect do-it-yourself center console for Scion IQ cars.
B000CSBP18|5|Daughter practically trained herself on this. We showed her what to do several times and away she went!!! Very well designed, very easy to use and very easy to take care of. Wold highly recommend.
B0006B3USM|5|I love these cover's.  They are great to bleach and soft for the baby.  I also love the price for the amount you get.
B004Y426XM|5|My daughter and grandson loved it. It fits the shopping cart perfectly. We been asked by people where did we purchase the cover. The cover laundry very well.
B000JJK9EY|2|This travelmate finally works and it is not easy on and easy off....at least not for the Evenflo Triumph carseat that I have.  The platform the seat rests near or on is slight.  The straps that are included do not hold the seat securely to the rolling plate.  We would have it all attached and the seat would fall off the edge of the slight platform as soon as we lifted the handle.  We finally went out and bought a tarp strap and laced it in through the seat belt holes of the carseat and were able to cinch it in place.  We then used a couple of the pieces included with the travelmate and finally the seat was able to hold my 33 pound child without us fearing that the seat was going to fall to the ground.  The best piece of equipment that came with this was the handle itself.  With the push of the button, the handle lifts to 2-3 different heights.  I gave it 2 stars because of the time and effort that must be taken to work with the Triumph 5 carseat.
B0080D5A2M|3|Thought I was getting a new item, but obviously got an open box return...parts and screws were all dumped into one ziploc bag and the instruction manual was missing. Found a manual online and luckily all the necessary parts were intact.<br /><br />As far as the swing, the toy bar is kind of useless and gets in the way; I don't really use it. The vibration seems to be pretty strong, and the whole seat rattles pretty harshly with the seat locked in place as it should be; my son doesn't care for it. The swing has allowed for some epic naps, so that is this item's saving grace. Speed of swing seems OK, top speed might be a little fast for small babies. The music is not annoying, two volume levels (the higher setting is pretty darn loud for being essentially next to the baby's ear, though). The seat is hard, and seems a little too deep, as my son struggled for a while (and still does occasionally at 3 months) to keep his chin off his chest and keep his paci in his mouth, and he is a larger baby (9 lbs 11 oz at birth). So when he naps in the swing, his head is turned to the side.<br /><br />Battery life has been great, and portability is great; I like to bring this into the bathroom so I can shower while baby swings.
B003YHUY84|4|Lovely and soft and a perfect fit!
B00M0F4SZG|5|This set worked perfectly with my Medela Advanced breast pump as replacement parts. They all came all sealed individually in a box from Nenesupply. I had no hesitation that these were used or not made properly. Very satisfied with the product and the price!
B00Y76V9US|5|Great product! Easy to use.. Colorful and fun!
B00CCR202K|2|I paid $8 shipping for this decal and it was not delivered on time.  It took almost 10 days to arrive.  It is nice looking but it wouldn't stick the wall very well.  We don't even have very textured walls and it parts of it wouldn't stick.  The glue on the backing paper was stronger than on the actual decal.  We finally got it up but it was very difficult. The snail wouldn't stick at all and ended up tearing and falling apart so we couldn't use.  This was one of two decals we used in a room and the other [[ASIN:B001MXQ8V4 Large Wall Tree Nursery Decal Japanese Magnolia Cherry Blossom Flowers Branch #1121 (8 Feet Tall)]]  went up great.  It was extremely easy to apply to the wall.  I don't recommend buying from DecalYourWall.  The only reason I am even giving it two stars is because of the style.  It is a nice design it was just very difficult to apply.
B004OR1DO2|5|These were christmas gifts for my neices. The set I bought last year was such a big hit I'm back for more and adding &#34;Jane&#34; to the set. Heck I wouldn't mind having Bob kicking around my spa since they are such good quality and cool looking,
B0036Z3DDC|5|KinderGlo Quarter Moon Portable Fun & Safe Night Light was absolutely a great buy for my 23 months toddler girl. She started too weak up at night just a few monthsago and I understood that it might be she started to be afraid of the dark. After I bought this light, she sleeps trough the whole night again. The light is perfect, it's not too bright but you can still see. This light is very comfortable and pleasant for the eyes.
B00PHIKPIW|5|Love this soft little paci bear and so does my son. Just the right size and very cuddly.
B00B53KFEW|5|Love the colors and the print of these sheets. It's very adorable and perfect for a little girl's room. The material is relatively soft (as you would expect from cotton sheets). I've washed and dried these and they fit on the mattress perfectly. I didn't find that I needed to iron afterwards either, just take it out of the dryer immediately.
B004YJLJ9Y|2|Nice looking crib but color looks nothing like the picture. Looks like cherry, not chocolate.
B00GJ2HCLI|5|This is extremely well-made, and my baby loves it.  My only minor complaint is that the black part of the carrier attracts lint and pet hair like crazy, so I am constantly using a lint brush on it.  I can live with that!
B000JOT2RO|3|There is no taste, but don't give force, sucker suck
B001BKVYAI|4|These bottles are the only ones my daughter liked. I had previously had a lot of trouble getting my older daughter to transition from nursing to bottles. After doing my research I opted for these for my second baby. She took right to them the first time offered. I thought maybe she was just an easy baby, but later realized when I tried to offer other types that these really were special. They don't sell them in our town so thank you amazon! I only give them four stars instead f five because they do have many parts and if not assembled just right will leak and have to be reassembled. This happens to me semi-frequently but is worth a happy fed baby n
B00LSOZW46|4|It was way smaller than I thought it would be. And the colors are not as bright as in the picture.  I received it sooner than expected though.
B00AJSIVZO|5|Perfect.. loved it for my kiddos..looks great, light and small enough. Just perfect.
B000H1IYXW|5|Very huge, long and safe. A+
B005THDZ06|5|I was browsing Amazon for zebra print items for my 11 yr old daughter's room and found these. We had to buy two because she has a big window.They look great with the hot pink panels that were suggested that we buy with them.
B00BNHJ0BY|5|These are the best bibs! They are big enough to offer sufficient protection to clothing and the little pocket actually catches food! I hand wash these because I use them so much, but they wash nicely in the washer as well (I line dry them). They also fold up super small so they are easy to pop in your diaper bag or lunch pail.<br /><br />If you purchase a set of these you will not be disappointed!
B00LYCR718|5|So soft & cozy!  Love them
B00CWN8IK2|5|Whisper quiet with great humidity output.
B00F1CPBQ0|5|While his mobile is smaller than most, I purchased it for my pack and play. LO Loved looking at the different colors and patterns. I really like how the sound turns off after a period of time to save batteries
B004DCA222|5|Our nephew doesn't go anywhere w/out these blankets.  He's always got one with him, usually in his mouth (he's teething.  And a baby.  I wouldn't recommend eating these, though.).  I'm not sure what makes him love these, but he does, and that's good enough for 5 stars in my book.
B00E59RMN0|5|I wish that I had come across this sooner! My 9 month old loves it! Keeps her entertained and I can keep an eye on her with the little mirror. I like that it all attaches to the metal part of the head rest so I don't have to worry about it falling off like the other mirror I had.
B005AYC45A|5|Good purchase sterilizes well
B0006BAJO0|5|Good
B005PK1EE6|3|Looks supper cute on and does the job however, you will probably not use it that much until it just fades out completely.
B0093NN16K|5|This should be on those lists you read for essential baby items but it is never listed. We have so many of these for my babies. Crib sized for under their sheets. Cradle size in the cradle and for under the changing pad cover. And the small size for over the changing pad cover. Helps to make messy clean ups quick. Super convenient for travel on linger trips as well. They pack up nice and small.
B001BWRWNO|1|here's a story: I had just gotten my baby out of the bathtub and was giving him his goodnight bottle, when I noticed some formula dripping on my arm.  I looked and formula had been dripping onto my baby's shirt, down his neck to my arm and all over his hair that I just washed (and he does not like his hair washed).  And it was all over my shirt and pants.  Does that sound like something you want to happen to you?  Try another brand.  I wish I had read the reviews first!  I bought 2 of the yellow tinted ones and 4 blue ones when my baby was 6 months old, and they worked fine for a while, now all of a sudden they ALL -both kinds- leak about half the time.  Honestly, for how expensive these bottles are I am EXTREMELY disappointed.
B00EEDKDOM|4|Takes a lot of practice to feel comfortable/confident carrying the baby but overall a great wrap.
B001I481LM|4|I am in the habit of preparing a day's worth of bottles at once due to using both frozen breastmilk and formula. I combine 50/50 in each bottle, so you can imagine how my original routine of mixing a bottle of formula, and splitting it, was inefficient. I also still found clumps in bottles, regardless of how I mixed it.<br /><br />This pitcher has solved all that. I can make 24 hours worth at one time and the agitator does a great job of thoroughly mixing everything together. I've been using it for several months now with no cracks or loose parts.
B000JPYEJY|5|We have not purchased this item, but we are borrowing one from some friends.  From the first time we put him in it, he loved it.  He gets a huge grin on his face and will jump in it for about 15-20 minutes nonstop before he starts to get tired.  I have nothing bad to say about it.  The harness seems very safe and secure.  I highly recommend this product.
B00171WXII|4|This works much better than the old bulb aspirators - even the newer designed ones.  But, I get very winded sucking on the little tube.  I have mild asthma so that's probably the reason.
B001MTELJY|5|This was a great tub for a squirmy baby - the hard plastic ones were not working out at all. Great up until I forgot to take it out of the tub and the cats got to it!
B005MPCM0Y|3|I bought this sleeping sack just for it is long sleeve. My baby is 5 months and he can barely fit it coz the length is not long enough. I felt his both legs can not stretch. I think it's only good for newborn
B000NG7XGU|4|This is overall a great unit.  It replaced my Fisher Price monitors and First Year Monitors.  Its a terrific unit, with these highlights:  - Terrific sound quality and range. Definitely the pick of the litter and replaces all other units.  - I love the feature of sound sensitivity.  Our last unit would pick up ever little sound.  This one just picks up the sound when our daughter gets really upset and cries.  - Accessories.  More flexibility for you if you want belt clips or lanyards to carry these.    These are the caveats that Philips stills needs to improve.  - Build quality of the plastic seems low.  It actually feels like the same as my Apple Mighty Mouse, but I guess the mouse weighs more so it feels of higher quarability.  - Batteries.  If you follow the instructions on first charging the units, you have no problems.  I have read other comments about them and made sure to fully charge and discharge my units 4 times before even thinking about taking them offline.  I havent had any trouble since then.  - Can you add more Parentel units than just the two?  Philips' website and documentation isn't very clear on this.  I think you can, but I can't purchase a Parental unit seperately.  Please Philips give us the option as I want a unit in a few more rooms!    Overall, highly recommended product and is worth the extra money though.
B00GJG9XUW|5|I use it with essential oils and it works like a charm.
B00D2JN87I|3|It is quite nice. But I think if it also vibrate it would have been perfect.<br />For me, if this would have a movement sensor and activate the &#34;shhhh&#34; sound along with some mild vibrations it would make a world of a difference.<br />For now, this product can only make the &#34;shhhh....&#34;shhhh....shhh&#34; sound for 15min or 30min straight. But after that, if the baby moves and awakes and start crying, you have to go to the crib and turn this back on (hence my suggestion of the movement sensor).
B00NHMDT4W|3|They worked for a little while, and then after my 2 year olds yanked the door enough both broke off
B004EBUX9Y|5|We bought the first one about a year ago, and recently, got a second for the second car. These seats are great. Initially, our concern was that our son would not like the way the headrest really hugs the sides of his head. He's always been curious, and loves to look around. But actually he doesn't mind the headrest at all. And when he falls asleep, his head is well supported so he's still in a safe position.<br /><br />One thing that we did notice was different between the seat we bought this time, and the one we bought last year, is that the new one doesn't have pads on the shoulder straps. It would be nice to have these, since the belts are kind of bare, and when it gets warmer and our son doesn't wear a jacket anymore, it could get uncomfortable for him. We'll see.<br /><br />Regardless, he loves the seat, it supports him well, it's easy to install, and after one year of use on the older one, it's still like new - that's why we bought another one.<br /><br />PS Sorry Amazon, but we bought ours at Babies R'us. Lower regular price, and way cheaper with their 20% off coupon.
B00HH0FV32|5|This toy is amazing! Before buying, I read reviews written by those who had purchased this item. The reviews were so helpful. I especially wanted a toy that had a good suction cup and this one certainly more than met my expectations. It adheres wonderfully to a plastic tray on a high chair and the toy is enchanting for my 6 month old grandson. He loves the different textures and sounds Lil Skunkie provides. There is endless entertainment while the baby is in the high chair.
B00AFMETP0|3|This Vera Bradley baby bag is the perfect size for a busy mom on the go!<br />Love this bag :)
B003V7GF5I|5|I tried (2) of the popular baby carriers and was disappointed because of all the straps and buckles.  They were cumbersome and my baby and I would overheat when I used them.  This carrier was such a great find because it is easy to use, comfortable, compact and my baby loves it.  This carrier fits both me (all of 5') and my husband who is over 6'.  This is a necessity in my diaper bag when I am out running errands.
B00COQGR00|4|Very cute cups. Overall good quality in terms of holding juice/milk however, the color scratches off easily. My son was able to scratch the white off Elmo's eyes with his teeth!
B004071ZOY|5|Bought for an upcoming baby shower - hope they love it!
B001KZH692|5|I love these sheets...they are so soft!!! They fit perfectly with my GRACO pack n play. I hope they don't discontinue.
B003JT3OWU|5|I absolutely love this carseat, my newborn and toddler enjoy it. It is a little big but totally worth it! It's super cute too.
B00T63S5MM|5|I was given this potty free of charge from Contours Baby and these opinions are my own.<br />I couldn't believe it. My 2 year old had a mickey mouse potty before this one. He was terrified of it. If i sat him down on it, he cried. When i unboxed the contours potty, he LOVED it! He wasn't scared, he actually sat right on it. We are still working on potty training but he puts his stuffed bear on this potty and pretends he is going! It is awesome progress. Thank you so much!
B00511SFRS|4|I bought this for a shower gift for my niece.  She loved it! It's hard to find \\"cowboy\\" themed items in retail stores.  The towel is good quality terry cloth...soft and large enough to wrap your baby up after bath time.
B000067EH7|4|My 7 week old baby hated sponge baths for the first couple weeks after she was born but as of transitioning to this tub she loves her bath - as long as the water and bathroom are warm enough. I haven't tried it without the sling so far as she is still developing her neck control but I think with this positive start she will continue to enjoy bathtime.
B000Q7G3VM|3|I think bit too expensive what it is.I would pay maybe half what they asking...I wasnt able to find simmilar product so i kept this one
B000BPMJR6|5|Excellent quality, soft, waterproof cover fits portable crib mattress perfectly.
B00BGD7GRK|5|Super cute diaper stacker. Looks exactly as pictured. Great price too!
B001OAKMEO|5|Don't even use the all plastic sippy cups!! Go straight to these....Helps when you are out at resturants too. Just order them a water with a straw and lid while you are out and they will drink from it no problem!! Total life saver for the family on the go and easy to clean !
B0097D4ZMU|4|I got this as an alternative to cramming the noise machine in my son's room into the diaper bag for naps on the go. I love it! The sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small speaker, though not quite what you would get from a nicer non-travel one. Still, better than anythings else I've seen at this price, travel or not. Volume controls range from a whisper to a roar. The clip that it comes with is great for hanging it on the handle of the car seat or the side of the play pen. I've been tossing this thing around in the diaper bag for eight months now and it shows no signs of wear. The batteries seem to last quite a while, and with being used for several hours at a time, several times a week, they last me over six months.<br />The ONLY reason this got four stars instead of five is that the power button can sometimes get pushed accidentally in the bag, and I'll spend the next five minutes trying to figure out what the noise is. This happened so many times that I had to start taking one of the batteries out when it's not in use. This is really only a minor inconvenience since the battery compartment is easy enough to open. Just a slight design flaw.<br />All in all, I love this thing, and would highly recommend it to anyone.
B00C6FGG9Q|5|Super easy to use. Very Accurate. And does not wake the baby!!!
B0056S88AK|5|makes giving baby medicine a breeze!
B007WN4N88|5|I have a highly sensitive child who doesn't nap well during the day.  I tried everything to get her to nap and this is the only solution.  I think it's a really high quality carrier that is comfortable for both baby and wearer.  It's EXTREMELY easy to put on with baby and makes baby wearing much more functional during the busy days.  Three times a day I wear the carrier for about an hour each time.  During that time, my hands are free to use my phone or ipad for work.  It comes with a sleep hood to make it easy to move around the house without disturbing the baby because of light, and really comes in a breathable material.  All in all I cannot complain about the carrier, it has been an absolute live savior.  Though I was getting some really great arms because I was carrying, this has really saved my overall body.  Thanks Pognae for such a great quality carrier.
B005VLX5D2|5|The spoon has just the right size of quantity of food for baby at the first feeding stage. I started using it when my daughter was 5 months old, and now she's almost 9 month, still works great for her. Also, the design is so cute with high quality.
B00821B0QM|1|These are not good at all. Adhesive is only on one spot therefore it doesn't stay in place. The material itself is rough and scratchy compared to the Lansinoh ones. Will not buy again, I'm going back to Lansinoh.
B00005367X|1|These are not my favorite. I found that they kept my daughter too wet and she started to show signs of irritation! They are also very bulky, like your diapering your tiny baby with a book.
B00067VWQ8|5|We bought this one mostly because of the great price, but it has turned out to be a great jogger.  I originally thought I'd have to cart it over to the park for a smooth ride, but I jog through our neighborhood, over some pretty crappy sidewalks, and it's a pretty smooth ride (a few bumps here and there - but NOTHING like in our traditional stroller that's part of a travel system).  The big, bicycle-like tires make a big difference. <br />Also...this has lots of storage (some joggers don't - I guess to make them more streamlined but I am not training for the Olympics!) and pockets inside the stroller that my daughter can access herself. <br />To reiterate what others have said - No, the front tire does not swivel but if you want to use this as a jogger, that is what you want.  Say you have a stroller with a lockable front tire -  you're jogging a have a pretty good pace going and the front tire becomes unlocked and turns...that would be quite a hard and sudden stop and could injure your child and/or you! <br />I have not had experience with folding/unfolding this stroller since I haven't had to travel with it so I can't tell you about that. <br />My one wish for this stroller is that the sun shade came down lower.  It pretty much just covers the top of my baby's head...this can be remedied with a detachable sun shade for strollers (about $15) which I had already purchased since MOST strollers don't provide adequate sun protection.
B00NWGWILS|5|My baby loves this! Great quality. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00008XL2W|5|This stroller is so easy to use, I could even fold and unfold it when I was 9 months pregnant. Considering I'm a very small lady, and was in a lot of pain during the last part of my pregnancy (due to my huge baby), that's saying a LOT. My husband has been very impressed with this item as well. It turns easily, but the wheels are big enough not to get stuck in gravel or grass. Plus, I got to choose the carrier I wanted. I love not having a bulky stroller to push around or try to shove into the back of my small car. Definitely a great buy!
B0088N4CUA|5|Cute, strong , very good material .
B00009EF09|5|I have spent literally HOURS researching car seats, their safety, longevity and ease of use.  I own a Cosco Alpha Omega and Britax Marathon for my older girls.  While the Britax is rated #1, it is TWICE the price of the Evenflo Triumph and yet does not have all the features.  The Triumph is easy to install, my daughter fits well in it, and it didn't break the bank purchasing it.  I highly recommend the Triumph to every parent whose infant has outgrown their carrier (we had a Graco SnugRide which only goes to 26 inches).  My daughter is average and at 5 months was 26+ inches long - bye bye infant carrier, hello Triumph.
B0035ER58I|1|Doesn't really cover up the smell like I thought they would
B004TTXKM8|5|LOVE these.  My son throws them over our second floor balcony if we look away too long, and they hold up.  I've had no problems with the paint coming off, so I think that may have been a bad batch.  They are so durable and don't leak.
B001L61286|3|This is a super small bag.  The listing has it &#34;Measures 18&#34;x12&#34; to fit all toy&#34;.  Note the part &#34;to fit all toy&#34;, not &#34;toy's&#34; pleural.
B00KPEAFTC|5|received its fast and packages nicely. this is a great idea, however my little one doesn't know its there yet. maybe he is too young. great product though!
B004I6UKWA|3|After month and month of nerve wrecking research I found this to be the stroller for us. I love it, love it, love it!!! This stroller has all the bells and whistles I was looking for ...... IF it would only be bigger. After playing with it for 1 hour in the store, I finally gave up and decided NOT to buy it. I have a 3 month old girl and a 21 month old boy. My boy is 36 inch tall and weighs 30 lbs. He barely fits into this stroller. That means I would only be able to use it for a couple month as a double - if at all. Investing this kind of money ( $900 with all the add ons) I would hope to use this fabulous stroller a little longer. The 2011 model features a seat only 9 inch deep and a back rest hight of only 18.5 inch. The foot rest is way too short as well. Make sure to watch the Baby Gizmo Video Review. One of the child testers has his legs bend to the side and the other has her legs pulled up with knees almost touching her chest. I figured my boy could just have his feet dangling but found that the bar surrounding the foot rest would hurt his calfs after a while. The canopy is not very big either in compare to all other Baby Jogger strollers. Another con is that the only way to recline both seats at the same time is if they are facing both toward the handle, which was not the deal breaker for me though. Please, please, PLEASE Baby Jogger make a stroller just like this one ......... but BIGGER!!!!!!     Pros:   Baby Jogger thought of just about anything a stroller needs.   - A huge EASY accessible storage basket   - A flat and EASY fold   - Handle break   - Adjustable handle for tall parents   - Add on glider board   - 16 ways for double occupancy   - Rubber back tires   - Suspension   - Very sturdy frame   and on, and on, and on ..........       Cons:     - Made for only small kids   - Not as easy to maneuver as other Baby Jogger strollers   - Very expensive considered that ALL the add ons have to be purchased seperate   - A little more heavy than I wished for
B00HX43K94|5|Absolutely love this! I'm so glad I got this! I've been looking for about 7 months for the perfect tree for my daughters nursery and I am so happy I chose this one! It's very forgiving too! You can peel and re stick as many times as you want! The pieces are durable and they look beautiful. I bought this product  and another one to use with it as well (to add some birds and birdhouses to the tree ) it looks so good my husband loved it too! The only thing is that the color is slightly different than I thought but you can't really tell when it's on the wall.
B00LK5J73U|4|Not the best mirror quality, but is large.
B001L2SA6M|5|Great
B00HQW9M68|4|wanted to get rid of the little potty but my son isn't tall enough to reach the big toilet. This sits next to our toilet against the wall and he can use it independantly. Works fine, no complaints. Wish it came in different colors.
B000JOOGK2|1|I own this item purchased thru Amazon. The lock system is good and new concept. But the material the lock is made of is too bad quality.     the Side guide system and the Lock stopper mecahnism broke on both the locks on just few uses.     Not worth for the money. Look for something of good waulity of similar locks.
B000I5Q19Q|5|We got this cradle just 2 days back and my 8 week old daughter loves it. We used to swing her in our arms before to  put her to sleep.  The assembly instructions were very clear and we got the piece together in less than 30 mins.
B0090PNZVW|3|These towels are pretty but don't appear to be as absorbant and durable as I had thought they would be.  Also they aren't very thick.  I probably wouldn't order them again but, they are still ok.
B00EEDKDOM|5|So simple and baby always passed out in here. Perfect for colic baby!
B00NFY534Q|5|These are awesome. Cute prints and very absorbent.
B002J4U8M0|5|The mirror isnt the best quality but it will do. After my baby got older, I put this up by her carseat in my vehicle. It's an additional mirror for her to see me and keep from getting bored in car rides. Got my moneys worth.
B0051ONV0G|1|If I would have known , that I could tape carboard  boxes together. I would have never order this mess. Its a rip off and a waste of money
B000YFRC34|4|My baby's \\"baby\\" toy (3rd name for it we settled on) is her favorite in her crib.  It's small enough that I don't worry about crib safety but big enough that she can still hold it and grip it securely.  Favorite moment was finding the baby in bed with her \\"baby\\" petting the twig top of the eggplant's hat.  Very cute.  The reason I gave this 4 stars and not 5 is that after the wash the 2nd time, there is now a watery looking stain around embroidered eyes and nose on the eggplant's face.  I suspect that the dye in the thread isn't colorfast, though not sure why it was ok the 1st wash.  I washed it with whites so I know nothing else ran.  After 4 washes the stain hasn't come out and the toy is looking more faded but very well loved.
B0042SXOS6|5|item was exactly as described.  I can't wait to use them!  there is not much more to say.  they are pacifiers:-)
B00CJ2OWUG|5|I bought them for my granddaughter they are perfect .They come on a nice packing and a the small gift was wonderful. the important thing is that i received it on time to ship overseas  I recommend the product and the seller.
B00BLY1L7A|5|Fits my mini crib very well. The mattress is firm, comfortable and strong. It arrived earlier than expected. extremely satisfied with the purchase.
B00ZRZSP0U|5|Too cute and material seems durable.
B000324Y7U|3|My son seems to like this bouncy seat.  My 2 month old tries to focus on the water and fish.  The music is sooting and not annoying, and there is a volume control. <br /> <br />  My one caution is that my baby got fussy in the chair, and even though I had him strapped in, he squirmed and had his neck over the side of the seat!  Now  I prevent this by swaddling him up real well in the seat and I don't leave him in it for a long period of time and take him out as soon as he starts to squirm or fuss.   <br /> <br />  Overall probably the best bouncer out there, but he likes his swing better, so if you have limited space or are on a budget and had to choose between them, I'd go with the Ocean Wonders Swing. <br /> <br />  By the way, I've had it for 2 months now and haven't had to change the batteries.
B004I42GQK|5|Love these bottles and how they never leak or drip. I will never buy another brand again ! My daughter can always hold these bottles even the smaller 5 oz ones with no effort at all. Love the shape of the bottle as well.
B00HG4VJTO|5|this package came really fast and it is just what i wanted! i love it so much!
B00AEPHKVS|1|It had a horrible smell. Does not stick well , and leaves residue behind. Luckily I was able to remove the residue without ruining anything. Don't Buy
B0007WHCZ2|5|It kept her wrapped all night and was much easier to use than receiving blankets at 3am! Kinda reminds me of a baby straight-jacket, but it worked. My baby has particularly strong legs and was able to kick her legs free and occaisionally get a hand out. But she was always secure when I went to check on her. The fabric is flannel and she got a little hot. But a few wardrobe adjustments took care of that.
B00IVNEGOO|4|I love that Fisher Price has finally started using black/white and red in some of it's early child products.  I especially love that you can easily take the bar off, and switch the activity sides at the appropriate ages. It has the added benefit of keeping my little ones attention longer because it's like getting a new toy.  By having two different sides, one for when your baby notices patterns more than colors, and also a side for when your baby can start seeing more colors.  It grows with them extending the lifespan of the bouncer.<br /><br />Like many bouncers it can bounce and has vibration (which is a life saver and would not buy one without it).  It was easy to put together and it's easy to take off the cover to wash it.<br /><br />We've used it to entertain the little one while making dinner, using it to feed, and sometimes even nap.  Our little one actually prefers the vibrating bouncer to a swing.  The only downside is that it sits up more and doesn't recline any for napping.  An older bouncer I had that stopped working had this feature and it was awesome!  I felt that I could use it even at the beginning because the baby didn't slump or slide down since it reclined.  This bouncer doesn't have that feature.  I wish it did because it would then be close to perfect.<br /><br />Overall though I love this bouncer, though I feel that it sits a bit too upright for babies as young as 1-2 months, but that's just my opinion.
B002ABSHPM|5|this stroller toy bar is attractive in colours n design..love e detachable part of e toys..most toy bars comes in one piece..so now u can rearrange the toys or just take individual toys to wash!
B0019UF3RK|4|We've been using this mat for 2 years... there is some trouble with the characters getting water under them and getting a little icky, but the mat itself is totally great, has plenty of suction cups so it never slips, cleans and dries well.
B0016A7QYQ|1|Ordered specifically for large size. Literally shrunk 4 inches first time they were washed and dried. And not super absorbent.
B000H953Y2|5|Good quality one.
B002Y0OGPO|2|I loved the looks of this diaper bag and when I purchased it, it seemed nice enough. After 4 months of use, the zipper had broken and the handles came unsewn, leaving me with no diaper bag. It is also very wide, and when you put all your baby essentials in there, it really makes for a wide load. I would save your money and buy something else.
B000099Z9K|5|I am a professional nanny and have used many car seats in my time.  I currently use 2 of these seats for 11 mth old twins and have used with 3 yr old twins and children 4 months to 7 yrs old.    PROS  -really easy to install forward facing and booster  -very comfy(have had kids fall asleep in mins)  -can be used until 30 lbs rear facing and 80 lbs over all(Canada)  and 35 lbs rear facing and 100 lbs over all(USA)  -All the families i have used it with have loved that i can get these carseats installed very snugly  -You can take the base off for a narrower seat or just to make it easier to see over.  -2 of my friends have bought these seats for their children and are very happy with them.  them.  CONS  -straps do twist occasionlly(but what carseat doesn't have that problem)  -seat cover can be a pain to take off to wash until you get the hang of it  -says it can be used from 5 lbs but doesn't seem to fit properly for a very small infant  -rear facing can be a challange to get properly but get a trained inspector to help and you should have no problem  All carseats have there problems but try to get one that works with your child. *** Also it is unsafe to wash or iron carseat straps because that can make them weak and in the event of a carcrash they can break than.  REVISED:  I just found that if you take the base off the carseat than it is alot easier to install in the rear facing position and easier to see over the carseat. Just use a towel or something to keep it reclined. *** New information notice from transport canada at [...] Something to check out.
B00B9ZRZFS|5|My 5 month old daughter loved it! She can stay there for hours and even take naps. This is what we were looking for.
B000K4YSVI|4|I really like how easy it is to organize my breastmilk in this.  You just lay the bag down flat, on top of the organizer lid, then file it in the next day.  My only complaints: It's somewhat cumbersome to get the lid off in the freezer, so I end up having to remove the entire organizer before I can add/remove milk.  It would be an easy fix to move some freezer shelves, but we just don't have the space to do so.  Also, the lid doesn't fit very snugly on the organizer, so it falls off easily when bumped by other items in the freezer.  Other than that, love this way of storing frozen milk!
B0057GU2AA|5|this set was a Christmas gift for our youngest great-grandaughter....she totally adores it!....she is 20 mnths old, a tad taller than her age group....suits her perfectly. First thing she did was put her new baby doll in the one chair, had a little chat with her, and then sat in the other chair...trying it out.....just the right choice, I DID do a lot of looking before purchase and based on the reviews and her love of Elmo, chose this. Very glad, great purchase.
B001AX8QWK|5|I received the I LOVE BEER onesie and I have gotten alot of laughs. My hubby has all the beer shirts and loves his beer himself, so we had to have one for junior.  We went to a local fair and everyone was laughing and asking about it!
B001ULCJFM|1|Since Playtex decided to change the lid, I am constantly cleaning up spills. You can hear/feel the lid click, but once the sippy cup is dropped a puddle of liquid will slowly form. Had this happen recently in our van when a &#34;sealed&#34; sippy cup full of milk was dropped and not cleaned up in time during a hot summer day, needless to say I stopped using these cups. Don't make the mistake of buying these thinking they are the same as the old design!!!!
B00318CLD2|3|I love my baby jogger. Anyone that has one knows how expensive it was to buy. You would think you could get a break on a cover but not so. I have the basinett too so now I spent $80 on covers. And when we have baby two... I will be buying a third. I think $25 would be a better price point.
B0064LV3DW|1|Terrible product.  Don't waste your money!
B000LSL5ZK|5|Very functional and colorful.  Easy to use.  Perfect portions.  Take them when we travel and they work out great.  !
B0039NLVVC|1|If I could give it zero stars I would. Completely pointless. I couldn't even get them to stick to the window without looking absolutely terrible. It came practically wadded up with all kinds of wrinkles & kinks already in it. I tried to smooth it out for about 15 minutes. On ONE window. I gave up. They are currently in a ball in the floor of my car. DO NOT BUY if you care how they look attached to your window. Now if you're one of those people who have the tinted windows that's already bubbled up, then go for it. These will totally match!
B004SDTTAW|5|Bought this for a family members first baby & they loved it.
B000LZUL30|4|Mount them high enough or they become pointless. Oh and let them set for 24 hours after installing, or they'll pop right off.
B000IDSLOG|5|My daughter was given this as a gift, and being my first child, I had never heard of \\"Sophie\\" before.  I was impressed with the story that comes along with it (with respect to the natural rubber and safe paint) but was really surprised with how much my little girl absolutely loves it!!  As soon as she started gripping objects, this one became her favorite as it is easy to hang onto.  She is just starting to teethe, and chews on either the legs or head constantly.  I would absolutely recommend this as a gift for your child or for any baby shower gift.  Thanks Tammy!! :)
B008W8429W|5|Works perfectly and MUCH lighter weight than the original. I use this one for back-and-forth to work and leave the big, chunky original one at home.
B00IQBQNR4|2|Set is very cute and well made with nice fabric. I have a standard size crib, nothing fancy from babies r us, and the bed skirt has large gaps in the corner I do not like. The adjustable skirt is nice but disappointed with the large space at corners where skirt doesn't meet up and can see into under the crib. Sheets fit mattress well and comforter is good quality.
B00SG2WU0C|3|I love the way they feel and don't irritate the skin, but I would love it if they were bigger and didn't show odd shapes through my thin spring shirts.
B0097D4ZMU|5|What a lifesaver this product is. I have a four-month-old daughter, and as the famous Dr. Karp explains, babies sleep more soundly and longer with white noise. Unlike the cute and popular stuffed animals with timed sound machines inside, this plays continuously. It has four different sounds (my daughter's favorite is the ocean), volume control, and a timer option. The clip works seamlessly and the batteries last a long time. We've been using this everyday since it arrived (over a month) and have yet to change the batteries.
B0001WAO8U|2|The sound machine worked well. However, when it arrived there was a tear where it velcros shut on his tummy. Tried to contact for a replacement but never received a reply. Also not very cuddly. More of a &#34;sit it next to them for the first couple of months&#34; sort of animal rather than something they will enjoy for cuddling with. Sent it to the thrift store after a couple of months.
B0002OT00U|2|Ended up returning these. We didn't like how hard the bib was. It was too wide as well and our baby had a hard time maneuvering her arms around the bib. Opted for the Oxo bib instead which has a soft wipeable fabric top and a silicone cup a the bottom. It also rolls for easy storage. This bib was just too stiff. Maybe would be ok for an older toddler, but not for my 10 month old.
B000WUD83O|5|We got this one to replace the [[ASIN:B005OOKOK8 Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Jumperoo]], which was great, until the springs started squeaking really loudly in the past month or so. On both models, please note that if you encounter this issue, there is no way to grease the springs without tearing off the protective covers, which is NOT recommended. (Contact Mattel / Fisher-Price, or if within 90 days of purchase, get in touch with Amazon - both have delivered great customer service to me in the past.)<br /><br />The following will be more of a comparison between the Ocean Wonders and the Laugh and Learn jumperoo, recommendations on age appropriateness etc.<br /><br />The Laugh and Learn Jumperoo arrived this morning and my wee girl was in the Ocean Wonders one getting tired and wondering what on earth I was doing. It only took about 15 minutes to set the L&L Jumperoo up, but I had a working model to look at and kind of knew what to expect. I would estimate that an inexperienced jumperoo owner may need 30 minutes or so, but it's pretty straight forward. I didn't need the instructions, but encourage you to use them if you have never had one before.<br /><br />Baby girl was 4 months old when she started using the old one and we needed a pillow under her feet for the lowest level. The L&L jumperoo that we just got appears to sit higher, so I would recommend that unless your baby is taller than average, you might want to consider one like the Ocean Wonders, or Rainforest Jumperoo as the height adjustment levels appear to be slightly shorter.<br /><br />The play area on the Laugh and Learn jumperoo seems bigger than the Ocean Wonders one (yet they still take up about the same amount of space on the floor) and the various discovery items appear to be geared at an older infant (hence the ABC etc). My girl seems fascinated with the new addition of an overhead bar. I was initially concerned that the bar would somehow end up smashing into her head at some point while she jumped,but it sits behind the seat and not directly over it. Therefore the bar doesn't appear to be an issue. (Just a point for those who wondered the same thing when looking at product images.) Our child is 9 months old and is about 29 inches in length.<br /><br />In the first ten minutes of use, baby girl was chewing on the carrot and the tomato. She's teething, so chews on everything. On the Ocean Wonders jumperoo, there is only one teether (a seahorse) and it hangs off the side, which is hard to grasp for a younger infant. Baby girl was also playing with the toys hanging from the overhead bar and seems interested. I think she was actually getting bored with the Ocean Wonders Jumperoo because she could do everything it offered and needed a change anyway.<br /><br />Sound: There are two volume settings on both jumperoos, but the lower volume setting on the Laugh and Learn is definitely much quieter than the low volume on the Ocean Wonders. You can also turn the sound off entirely. There is a switch that changes the music output from ABC style sounds and tunes to music without vocals.<br /><br />Seat: There is padding in the seat on the Laugh and Learn that there wasn't in Ocean Wonders jumperoo. Both are made of machine washable fabrics, but I think this is a huge improvement on its predecessor.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this if you're shopping for a 4 month old. I would recommend this if your child is over the age of 6 months, simply because the items would be harder for a younger infant to master and grasp with their tiny wee hands.<br /><br />One may wonder why I opted to get another jumperoo if we experienced squeaking on the Ocean Wonders model after only 5 months of use. It's simple really: Our daughter fights sleep so much that we have no choice but to let her wind down and crash out in her jumperoo and then transfer her to her crib. We have tried EVERYTHING (except cry-it-out, which I'm not keen on) and she feels comfortable in this position, so until we can communicate with her effectively, this is where she will continue to doze off at the start of her naps. Another reason to get another: our daughter also really loved the Ocean Wonders jumperoo. I would have got her another of the same model, but I think it was time for her to try something slightly different.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like with this model is that with regards to the bar, it seems to make for noisier bouncing than the Ocean Wonders jumperoo did before it developed a squeaked. The noise is coming from the chicken on the top of the bar hitting the bar itself. I may end up removing it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Recommended for 6+ months. I would not recommend this for any younger because it is a bit more advanced than the Ocean Wonders style.
B00003XAKP|3|The concept of this sheet is great, however the quality and fit is not. It contained messes and saved me the trouble of changing the crib sheet every so often. It lost its fit after just one wash and started to pill after a couple. Also couple of snaps broke off in the washing machine :( Not sure if i'll buy it again even though the price has gone down considerably ( got it for $18 6 months back).
B00J0K35FI|2|Chair is missing some padding on the arms, where your hands would rest. Quite noticeable and uncomfortable.
B00D2JDEJU|5|My baby loves it!
B000YCAJGY|4|I've had this stroller since my one-year-old twins were born and when we are out in public now I get more comments about the stroller than I do about my babies!  My babies love to face each other and play footsie and entertain each other when we are out and about. People want to know what kind of stroller it is, where I got it, do I like it.  The really bold ones ask how much it costs and are shocked to find out it is a $200 stroller when they are expecting that it would be an $800 or up model.  One mom of older twins I know said she would have twins again if she could have my stroller!  She also said it would have been a great stroller to have when her boys went through a phase of NOT getting along, as she would have put them in the back-to-back position so they couldn't bother or see each other at all.    It fits through tight doorways well, folds up easily, and makes getting out with twins possible.  My only suggestions for improvement would be easier one-handed steering (for when I'm pushing the stroller with one hand and pulling the grocery cart with the other) and a snack tray/cupholders for the seats.
B00ASZ0DDQ|5|I love this carrier  after much research I picked this one... all carriers hurt a bit but this one sits my daughter  up in a great position. .. I love the style as well.
B004ETIG22|4|I love that they will probably fit for a couple years (now they cover my baby's whole legs, but they'll be super cute when she's a little toddler to cover just the bottom half of her legs). My only complaint is that they're pretty thin and not of the highest quality. They might fit our daughter for a couple years, but I don't know if they'll hold up that long with regular use. Next time I think I'll try Bambino Land leg warmers. They're only a little pricier, and they're organic.
B00TGLET24|5|Love this!!!!!!!! It made an awesome addition to my nursery :). Made very well.
B004OEKAWG|3|this bedding is cute, right out of the package.  however, it is not cotton like the description says - in fact, the description only uses the word cotton once, without giving the true fabric breakdown.  i assumed (wrongly) that at least the sheet would be 100% cotton, but it is a 65/35 poly/cotton blend as is the rest of the bedding.  the only thing not blended is the quilt, which is 100% polyester.  the quilt is soft on the side with the elephants, micro suede feeling, as are the bumpers. we haven't decided if we're going to keep it, as it just arrived today.  we are disappointed that it is not made with more cotton.
B00I2HAVAC|4|Good bumper. Has a lot of ties so it can fit any crib. Not very soft, but it's just a bumper.
B001W1WMHA|5|I bought two different sets of \\"giant\\" foam blocks for my indoor play center and these are the clear winners! They are a really nice size and can build a very tall tower. They also hold up very well but are not hard or heavy if they fall on a child.
B0049GA5GU|5|I just assembled this by myself this morning with my 1 1/2 yr. old on my lap half the time. It's very easy to assemble, great instructions and great quality of parts. We decided to go with a cheaper crib for our 2nd child, but I really feel like this one is about the same in quality as the $400 one we bought before. They use real screws instead of those annoying things you push in and turn the screw driver once around the bolt-like thing.
B0006B6TTE|4|Don't expect these 0-3 month onesies to fit a newborn, or even anything under 3 months, all too well (they are much larger than regular 0-3 month onesies).  Sure, they 'grow with your baby' and that's great, but not if they're much too large to wear for a couple months.
B00BPCJGL6|5|Perfect for photos
B00095LILQ|5|I'm not sure why Bob strollers don't just come with this product?!?!?! They should include it with the stroller.......This console is so easy to install yet VERY sturdy, I was worried that it wouldn't stay in place as it's held on by velcro BUT it's wonderful and very handy to slide a water bottle in and out of while running!  It holds a pretty big water bottle as well.
B00P6JYAXI|4|Dislike the lach. It is very stiff which makes it hard to buckle and unbuckle.
B00Q4K6ULI|2|First off, note that this is a Chinese-made imitation of a well-known Korean brand that cost about 3 times as much (note the blurred out label on some of the photos). Also, there are no foxes on the hood - only stripes - which makes the carrier a bit boring in design. In any case, upon first wearing it, felt great. The ledge seat is a really good idea and is excellent for not squishing your child's chubby thighs. Unfortunately, the seams are scratchy and will rub against your child's face when facing forward and cheeks when facing in. The ledge tilts down a bit when baby is facing forward and squeezes baby's thighs even more than a carrier without the ledge as it does not have the give or flexibility of your belly. The carrier itself is difficult to put on - it has a velcro closure under the click closure that overlaps in the opposite direction of the clicks. It would be impossible to put the carrier on while holding the baby. The velcro also makes it really loud to open or take off - need to be away from sleeping child if you're removing them from the carrier and wanting to keep them napping. The side holder is actually a really good and useful piece of this holder but not incentive enough for me to keep this carrier. Returned and got the Ergo instead.
B00G2NGXVO|5|This mirror is perfect! I was adamant on putting my baby in the center back seat, but since I did not have a center head rest I could not find a mirror that would work. I also wanted a car mirror with 4 straps to securely strap to head rest... this mirror has that and more. The pivot option gave me the ability to strap mirror to passenger side head rest and pivot in multiple directions to best to see my baby in reflection. So happy I came across this mirror. Worth every penny!
B00004DSG5|4|I was a little worried about pinching after reading reviews, but I ALSO read the reviews about how to use it and that helped so much. It works like a charm. I like having it because DD's little bum would just fall into the bowl w/o it. I bring it aling everywhere so we don't have to worry about if someone has a potty seat or not.
B00D40VQEM|3|Looks fantastic after putting together but takes forever. There are ALOT of pieces. Seems pretty solid after assembly. I'm very happy with the dresser and crib in my nursery, they are beautiful! Only gave 3 stars because of assembly time.
B004BFYFHO|1|The video and audio quality are great BUT:<br />- When it looses signal, it doesn't alert you. We found our baby crying desperately one morning and the monitor light was green. We didn't know it had lost signal so we did not hear her all night. She was only 3 months!<br />- Last week the video died, I just have a blank screen and audio. LUCKILY I have the receipt, so I contacted the company via e-mail (their waiting time on the phone is about 15 minutes!). Their suggestion is for me to ship back the broken one for analysis and wait for them to ship another one. HOW DO THEY EXPECT A PARENT to be without a monitor for 2 weeks?<br />There are many other reviews on Amazon complaining about their customer service and durability of this monitor.
B000RHYPS4|4|It is a good pillow. It seems to be bigger and higher than the boppy. The strap was not small enough to do any good for my baby. It should be more adjustable.
B007CFKR72|5|My daughter wont use pacifiers, so i clipped this to my calendar, tied a pen to it, instant great new use!
B0076NYZBE|5|Perfect! Just perfect! I prefer Snappies to any other sort of diaper fastener. They are fast, easy, secure and convenient.
B003YH2BNA|5|My daughter loves it.
B001DNJBDK|5|It does what it's supposed to do and fits on my crib with a larger edge.  No complaints at all.
B008DDPL32|5|Bigger than I thought it would be! Perfect for use in a two story home when I need to be downstairs and baby wants to sleep! Folds up very easy and I love the rocking/stationary feature. Colors are beautiful, and love the double mesh sides. Wish I would have found this with my last 2 children!
B000GKP1A8|3|The palm tree leaf basket and the comforter are okay, but the other fabrics and the cushion feel kind of cheap. It seems too expensive for what it is made of.<br /><br />Updated on April 4, 2007: After less than three months, the fiber on the handle starts the break. Not very durable or safe. Don't carry the basket when your baby is in it.
B0047RI5YU|3|Since it is made by Tommee Tippee, the bottles fit in perfectly. Only drawback is there is no automatic shutoff switch.
B00073HJG8|5|I used to have one of these when I was a kid. I remembered when I was looking for a good place to keep some of my things and it has been perfect.
B00382BNMQ|4|baby after 6 mo loves toys that move on \\"their own\\" very ammusing, seems like a good quality and fun
B0042D69UG|5|My daughter is 17 months and have been using this item for a month now and she loves it so do I. We have a 12 month over all the time and he sits perfect in the chair also. Easy to clean, fits snug, and looks cute. If I had to come up with one thing that bothered me about the chair is that its back is a little ways away from the chairs back so my daughter is always leaning back in the chair, arching her back to put her had on the kitchen chair. But that is very minor I love the booster.
B0064CTIC4|5|the ducky meter is perfect. I was hesitant to give my newborn a bath without having a thermometer, but this definitely eased my worries. It was easy to use which is very helpful (as a new parent) and will double as a bath toy when she gets older.
B00PF84ATO|5|I like that the divided compartment is just an insert. This can be used for snacks once my baby stops formula.
B0016KV73W|5|Awesome product, great to use on outings & when traveling.  It fits easily folded into a backpack or diaper bag.  We have used for long car trips, plane, visits to the zoo, etc.  The refills are pricey so you can do the trick with shopping bags (2) and a sheet of paper towel in a pinch but when traveling, the liners are so flat that it's more convenient.  Make sure your feel & hear the click when locking the legs otherwise it will not be secure.
B00F3R03LG|4|Greatest
B00R1H4XNK|4|I like that it doesn't have any taste, and it'is concentrated enough so I don't have to give my baby a large volume.
B000YDDF6O|5|Had one 3 years ago and lost it- had to buy a new one for the new baby because it was such a hit with the first kid.  2 month old loves it!
B008YUPPR6|5|Really durable and I love that you can convert the wristlet strap to different areas of the bag. Love it!!
B00009X3Y3|5|I absolutely LOVE this carrier.  I originally registered for the Baby Bjorn, but I'm glad I changed my mind...I couldn't stand the thought of having one of my relatives spend that kind of money on a carrier when this one looked just as good.  My baby loves the Snugli and it's easy and convenient for me to use.  The only trouble we ever had getting her into it was when she was wearing a big puffy snowsuit and even then we managed.  And she's a big girl..at almost 3 months, she's already almost 14 lbs.  The side tabs are easy to open and I've had no trouble getting her in and out of it by myself while standing.  Would recommend this to anyone...especially a parent who's constantly on the go...a great value!
B000F1ESJI|5|My daughter got this bear as a gift as a new born, and she has carried it around since.  It's been three years now, and even though it's starting to get a little worn, the bow is still attatched, and it hasn't split a seam, or lost any body parts.  I can't count the number of times it's been washed.  I'm buying a second one, in order to stash away the fist one (for a memory box) and replacing it with the new one (wish me luck, I know it's not going to be easy).  If you find your child latches on to a toy, blanket, etc. as a favorite, do them, and you a favor, buy two!  One to wash, one to hold, they'll never know!
B00HHYVT7U|1|my kids chew them on the first day they use it.
B004FN0Z4O|5|Love this stroller.  Great for my long legs, I never kick the basket.  Only bad thing is the basket is kinda small, because of the extra leg room.  Easy to put up and take down.
B00CQ9UUK8|5|Sooo cute. I love using this diaper.
B003H4QFSM|4|We are quite happy with our recent stroller, Joovy Caboose Ultralight.  The shipping is absolutely on time and we love it so much as a customer who ordered from Thailand.  The brownie color does not let us down at all because it has the reflection strips that make it blink at dark.  The front seat for younger is wide and comfortable while the back seat for elder is acceptable.  It is also easy to make turn at narrow anger.  Just some inconvenient things may be the baby tray is not easy to pull out when we need to lift up the baby and the elder cannot sit on his/her seat when the front seat is bended backward which we have already been informed.  Overall, it is a good one to invest.
B008P8EZOG|4|It's ok for the price
B008XJP4YC|4|It is small but  serves main purpose
B00NGUCNPQ|5|Quality all the way. Continues to get softer with washing. Fits crib mattress perfectly. Only con is price.
B00CSAWINW|5|Seat is sturdy and the straps make the seat very secure.  The toys are easy enough and colorful so that they attract my 4 month old Grandson but will keep him occupied later when he is able to move them totally.
B000056HM8|5|I use these for everything - usually for cleaning spit up and burp clothes.  They are great, wash up really well and there's enough of them that you can have them all around the house.  Highly recommended.
B001387H40|1|Gets knit balls on them.<br />I do like the size. I'd id buy 4.<br />Just wishes they used a different material.
B00171WXII|5|I registered for this item based on the reviews, but hadn't used it because I was still working on getting over the gross-out factor. Then baby had a bit of congestion and the doctor asked me if I had heard of a Nosefrida... she recommended it. I was excited to say that I had one. I went home and used it right away. Boogies and snot were sucked out. By allowing you to be the \\"sucker\\", you can apply a more steady stream of suction than the traditional bulb aspirators.<br />As for the gross-out factor, there is a filter-looking thing and there's no way the snot could even make it up the tube. I probably wouldn't use this on anyone but my own.
B000056HLT|1|I thought this would be great, as I love Carter's items, but the sides melted in the dryer on a low setting and now have multiple holes. I was going to buy another, as I thought I was the one that had done something wrong, but I see I'm not the only one that this has happened to.
B001B1FHK0|1|I was very disappointed with is product.<br />It doesn't fit my sons head at all, he is 4... And it is very hard plastic so uncomfortable for them to wear ..waste of money
B0051O0ADW|5|Pretty much as advertised. I wound up getting 4 different colors to mix things up. Enjoyed being able to wear regular shorts this summer, unbuttoned, with the belly band over it. Worked great. Finally was able to stop pulling my maternity pants up every two minutes  :)
B004K2KOP0|5|This stroller/car seat combo is all we expected it to be.  We bought it for our newest grand baby and it is light, easy to clean, well designed and most of all it keeps our granddaughter safe!  Thank you for a quality product!
B000G80RW2|3|i purchased this a month ago and was excited when i got it. the material is nice but too bad my 2 month old son wasn't able to use it. too small for his head and he's only 12 lbs. i suggest you buy the bigger size.
B008RXWCT4|5|I chose the 5 star rating because this cup is absolutely adorable and even cuter when you see baby drinking from it...my baby is a little monster so this cup fit him perfect!!!!!
B0016IZ2DK|5|I love this stuff, may dry you out a bit but the clean fragrance lasts all day long. Key is to lather it up before spreading around on your body. No chemicals or nasty stuff!
B004G8QJ7U|5|This high chair exceeds my expectations, everything I wanted! The only thing is I wish it had wheels but I knew it didn't. The seat cover is soft and easy to clean:)
B00BMTKPZS|2|the photo is very deceiving, its 2 feet long! the photo shows it fits the whole wall. looks very weird in the room
B005OSQ958|5|We needed a towel that was a little bigger than the average baby towel but not quite adult size, and this one is perfect.  It is really cute and soft too.
B002WGI5NO|5|I love my travel nursing pillow! I used the My Brest Friend travel pillow in the airport, on the plane, and at my destination. I can't imagine making the trip without it. It inflates quietly with just a few breaths and deflates to a compact size. The pillow has great support without the weight or bulk. I would like to purchase the original My Brest Friend as well. Great product!
B00GR5KC8C|5|When my son is teething he drools constantly and these work great!
B000WJLKQM|5|Very well built and designed for safety and designed for toddler interest in mind.  The tray in front is especially useful
B0075T1NDC|1|This item is of poor design.  Our baby was able to pull it off his head.  It would come off when he was on his back in the crib on the floor.  He's just beginning to crawl.  I guess the best remedy is keep hard objects away.
B007JTSPG6|4|Now is even cheaper
B002UD65Y0|2|I am too particular to keep this item.  It did not fit the mattress and slid around so bad it was hard to put the sheet on over it.<br />I like giving honest reviews for one main reason, MONEY!  I just can't afford to buy things that don't work or seem too cheap to hold up in the wash!  and I don't want other customers to waste time or money on them either.<br />I am particular, and spend as wisely as I can.<br />try the J lamb products, they are much nicer.<br />lilyput
B000FFL58Q|5|Fisher-Price Rainforest is a great play toy . I have bought two of them for my friends who were having babies. They have been very pleased with them.
B007ZZCRJ0|4|received all 30 (some have been getting partial quantities).  cute light green with dots pattern.  has a slight chemical smell - will air out before placing childrens' clothing on them.  slightly (about 1/2\\") smaller than the plastic children's hangers found at the big box stores, so likely won't be able to use them after kids turn 8 yrs.  wish they made a size between the adult's and children's.  good value.
B0018Z8CN8|5|the tub ive been looking for. baby doesnt slide around, comfy, easy to clean, baby seems happy in it, a little big but just like most baby tubs. love this tub.
B000GUZC2A|5|good!amazon service is good!
B00A47J6YU|1|The table is positioned in a way that the food and drinks tumble off onto the floor or dirt depending on if you are camping-cannot have that going on in the outdoors.
B003KFCV6S|5|Our little guy scoots around a ton and didn't particularily like running into the bed gate we had on his new twin bed, so I was really glad when I found these, because I was tired of him waking up!  They were super easy to put on (we put them all around his bed because he ends up all over) and while they make the bed look kinda funny, they totally work!  I also think it gave him a better sense of security going from his crib to a big bed... kinda makes him feel blocked in.  At any rate, they totally worked for us!  Sometimes we even go in and he's awake, leaning with his back against one of them reading to himself!  Double bonus!
B007ZT5RRA|5|The sheets that arrived were just the ones that were advertised and the ones that I wanted,  they are nice.
B00BEVF1XA|5|I love this seat! The clicktight installation was simple and literally took about a minute. It sits fairly low to the seat, so it's easy to get my daughter in and out. It very adjustable (and easily adjustable...DOES NOT have to be unistalled), so my daughter fits perfectly into the seat now (she's about 3 1/2' tall), but still has tons of room to grow. While, luckily we haven't had to test it, the head support definitely appears to add a lot of protection. I was afraid the flower pattern was going to be &#34;too much&#34;, but it's really not. They made it just subtle enough to be cute without being overpowering. It is heavy because of the steel frame, but that's a trade off for safety that I'm willing to make.
B00F2MQ0GO|2|I got this for my son because I was looking for any motivation to get him to go!  He loves it, but I do not.  He is 3 so maybe he is too big for it, but like others, I find it is too small.  We have also found that the sound doesn't work every time.  Also, the pee seems to go everywhere!  Even when I hold his thing down, the pee is somehow getting under the seat and out the front from underneath the seat and down inside.  This is obviously a potty little boys would love.  Is this the best design they could come up with?  I would rather change diapers than clean pee off of everything.
B00CJF5P3G|5|OK
B00005OONH|5|I love this high chair and so does my daughter.It has many toys for her to play with while she is waiting For her food.The chair also folds compactly for storage.It has a great bar in the back to hang all of her bibs and towels.It has a height adjustment that is great.I adjust the height to fit right under our dinner table so she can sit with us at dinner.It also converts to a booster chair so she can still use it as she gets older.I love the chair pad, the cushion is so comfortable and it a beautiful fabric but it wipes off clean.Which is great for moms since we hate a mess.It is very sturdy and safe.I also like the five point harness system.My daughter is like hodini she can get out of the three point harness and since i have her in the five point harness she is locked in safe.I highly recommend this product to new and old moms.I love it!!!!!!!!!!
B0075M5H90|5|I love this its so soft!! and fits my changing table perfect! I couldn't stop petting it because it was so soft and I can't wait for the baby to born so he can lay on it!!
B000F1MBQ0|5|This pillow was the only thing that allowed my daughter to get any rest from her injuries after her debilitating automobile accident (broken ribs, hand, spine, clavicle,ankle, hernia.....).
B000067PQ0|5|I just gave birth to my first child and from day 1 of my pregnancy I set the intention to strictly breastfeed.  I was sensitive about my breasts but now as a mother, realizing I am not the only person with my issues, I am more free to share my story for those that may feel insecure as I once did.  One of my breasts has a flat nipple and the other an inverted nipple.  I tried to nurse my baby girl on both sides and man was it sore. I bled and cracked and although determined to feed my baby no matter what, I knew it would eventually become too difficult for me feeling &#34;abnormal&#34;.  Then in comes my lactation consultant with a Medela nipple shield.  I received conflicting information from so many people and resources on breastfeeding, but after giving the nipple shield a try, I listened to my gut and have been successfully feeding my baby since.<br /><br />Depending on the position you want to feed your baby in, you'll have to place the mouth opening of the shield accordingly on your breast to accommodate the baby's mouth which may take a few tries but once you lock it into position, you won't forget for the next feeding.  Follow the instructions on cleaning the shield with hot soapy water.  I let mine soak when not in use and it cleans throughly well. Before I use it, I like to express some milk first and use the milk to wet the shield, on the inside of the rim so it sticks easier to my breast, and also on the tip of the shield's nipple for the baby to smell. Every so often I try to feed the baby without the shield because with more feedings, my nipples have pulled out a bit more, but it has become much easier and convenient feeding with the shield.  I received a free shield from the hospital but am going to order extras here on Amazon and decided to write a review because I love this thing so much. It looks like it's disposable but as my lactation consultant told me, you only need to replace it if you lose it. I literally feel more like a woman and a mother using this shield because I can feed my baby the best food on earth and the bonding experience is simply irreplaceable.  I don't like being attached to anything but when I left the hospital with my baby, I made sure to have my nipple shield in hand. That's how valuable this little golden nugget is for me.
B00LTSZT3K|5|I ordered these to use for snack time in my classroom. The kids and I love them!
B000067EH7|5|Great
B006G9F8TC|2|My babies did not like them. I ended up getting the cheap mam brand from walgreens that are bpa free then again my babies are not big nuk takers, like to do breastfeeding.
B002SG7JSU|4|I like them but they keep falling off with the tape provided.  Need to use you own double sided tape
B0007CS4EU|5|Pros:<br /><br />- somehow very easy to pop the contents loose<br />- no discoloration, easy to clean<br />- lid is useful, even though it doesn't really seal completely<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- would have been slightly better if the lids would completely seal, but for my purposes it's not really important<br /><br />Overall, nice product and probably would be using it even after finishing the baby food period.
B00XAWQN9W|5|These are great my kids no longer complain and car rides are more enjoyable Nice material sturdy easy application these were bought at a promotional price for my review
B000056OWC|1|I thought this tub looked wonderful, boy was I wrong! The 4 stage system seemed great, but stage 1 is not working out well at all. The &quot;no-slip&quot; surface is a joke. My son slides all over the place in it. Since I don't have a full-sized tub, I use this on my counter-top, and can't give my son a bath without someone helping to hold him. I do NOT recommend this product at all!
B002YQQP9I|4|My daughter is 18 months old and I can't wait to see her face when spots this is under the tree with a dolly in it.  My daughter loves all purses and bags and I think she will really like this baby bed with handles.  It is small enough for her to be able to carry it.  I purchased a 13\\" Gotz doll (from Amazon) with eyes that close and it will fit in the basket perfectly.  I agree with other reviewers the canopy of the basket is crushed.  The heart that hangs down and plays music is also mishaped a bit and the blanket is kind of cheap but for the price I am delighted.  I really like the (lighter) corduroy material on the outside and on the handles.  I hope it holds up to alot of play. I am so glad I didn't settle for the junky doll accessories available in most chain stores.  Happy Shopping!
B000RFCSMQ|5|Gets the job done at cleaning the bottles. Hasn't fallen apart and love how the tiny brush is stored at the bottom of the brush.
B005ASKQ42|5|We use this bed more as a portable changing table than sleeping quarters.  Our baby likes to rock, so he has been sleeping in the swing.  This product is super light and we carry it all over the house.  Its great for laying the baby on the bed and keeping the toddler separate while I change the laundry, etc...  I highly recommend this product, especially if you have an older sibling, it helps to create boundaries!
B003OUWIKI|5|This Britax convertible car seat just arrived today -- what a great product! It is sturdy and well-designed. So much more impressive than the Graco convertible car seat this will be replacing. The LATCH system is super easy to install, and I had this car seat ready-to-go in under 15 minutes. What's more, it is very attractive. I was concerned that the beige portions of the fabric would be too light and hold stains; however, it is a rich beige color and I am no longer concerned about staining now that I've felt the fabric.
B009IVKY7Q|5|Good quality!
B00NOQYZDK|3|It doesn't do much but looked like my baby was amused by the faces.
B004BDOIZU|5|Gorgeous book - would recommend and buy again :)
B001CWAVJ0|5|It holds up very well! Love it!
B00B507CG4|4|I bought this car seat for my 2012 Sienna van. It arrived and I loved it! Beautiful in person and the marine color is really lovely. I have previously owned Britax and Sunshine Kids/Radian seats. I decided to give Recaro a try. I really wanted to love this seat. I did a trial installation and I just couldn't get a great fit. I absolutely needed additional support (pool noodle) but even then it seemed bulky and awkward.<br /><br />The biggest problem for me was the height! This seat sits WAY up high. Radians are especially low and close to the seat of the car. Maybe this seat just seems super high comparatively. I really enjoyed the flushness of the Radian seats because they didn't look so babyish as the kids got older. My kids have been in those seats until they were 6 years old. The height might work better in a sedan but the van seat is already higher so it just seemed awkward.<br /><br />I really wanted this seat to work! It might be great in your car but it just didn't work well in mine.
B007Z9719W|1|I ordered these stickers because I thought they would look adorable in my sons room. I do like how they look but they do not stick to the wall. Our walls are lightly textured and didn't think there would be a problem with them sticking to the wall because we have around 30 other stickers in his room and they are not falling off. I have 50+ stickers in my other sons room and have no problems with them peeling off. As cute as these stickers are I would order different ones if I had to do it over again.
B002TKM35Y|5|I'm flying over seas with my son and this bag holds everything you need for a 4 month old. There are tons of pockets to hold everything you need or might need. I didn't want to get it at first, thinking a standard back pack diaper bag would be fine. I quickly realized that is not the case. A 40 hour flight with a 4 month old demands a ton of stuff!!   It comes with:  1. Changing pad- VERY THICK and soft. Super long. Super easy to clean. Fits in a couple different pockets in the bag.  2. Wet clothes bag- Big enough to hold a couple sets of outfits. Lined for no leaks. Easy to clean.  3. Pacifier holder- Velcro's to the side of the bag. Thick, flexible plastic material. Open on the sides for ventilation.  4. Wipes holder- Holds TONS of wipes! Has its own holder in the bag. Removable. Small zipper. Could be more convenient.  Diaper Dispenser- SOOOOO easy to load diapers in! You load the diapers through the zipper closure. Fits 16, size 3 diapers. super easy to pull diapers out. I suggest separating your diapers before hand so they don't stick together when you pull one out.   Lined bottle holder- Holds 6, 4 oz. bottles or 4, 8 oz. bottles. Opens very wide like a book. Could be used to hold breast milk or anything that needs to keep it's temperature.   Left side pocket- Holds plates, bowls, spoons, single serve formula (what I'm using it for)... Middle pocket is a little tight but still very useful. They're long pockets so not very good for short items.  DVD holder- Holds standard travel dvd player. There are straps on the sides to keep the pocket from falling open. Perfect for its purpose. The pocket goes all the way up the length of the back pack for more storage (books, DVDs, coloring books... anything long and thin)  Top pocket infront of bag- Pretty deep! I'm using it to hold my travel documents and such. Can hold a decent amount.   The bag its self- Has TONS of pockets!!! Two elastic hoops on the inside, perfect for linked toys. Thick metal clasp for keys or such.Big and thick zippers for easy open and close. Opens multiple ways (like a book, like a standard back pack or like a \\"tray\\"). Loops on the top for hanging on stroller or closet rod, are thick and sturdy. Very easy to unclasp and re-clasp. Mesh, elastic pockets on the outside are very strong and sturdy. Won't lose their elasticity through use. Plastic grips on the bottom to prevent sliding/slipping. The straps are thick and wide for comfort. one strap has a clasp, perfect for holding loop toys on the go. The other strap has a little mesh pocket for your ipod or small phone. The back of the bag is cushioned for added comfort. The bag, when empty is VERY light! Which makes all the difference for when it's actually full! The price is steep but, well worth EVERY penny!!
B0051RIELY|4|I bought this to decorate my son's nursery in Classic Winnie the Pooh.  The set is very nice and the colors are just as pictured.  The only problem is that so far we have only really used the sheet since you are not supposed to put bumpers in the crib anymore and no heavy blankets until he can roll over on his own.  However, I will say, my husband put the bumper below the crib so at least you can see one of them.  When he gets older I am sure he will use it more but if you are looking for a first nursery set you can probably get something much less expensive that will meet your needs.
B0012IYFO6|5|I won't repeat the detailed run-downs that previous reviewers have given, but this monitor really delivers.  I've been using it for a little over a month and it's wonderful.    -Excellent reception.  Sound always comes through clearly.  Video typically comes through clearly, but when I get 2 floors away and the signal is going through interference of 4 routers and several wireless phones of various frequencies, the video gets a little choppy. No big deal, I can still see my little girl quite clearly.  It's not DVD quality, but when I want to see her, I have no problems. **edit** After 6 months of use, I've found that the monitor does interfere with G band wireless routers.  The monitor doesn't get interrupted, but it definitely slows down transfer rates between my computers and routers.  As long as you don't get the monitor in a direct line between the laptop and router (and you aren't running VPN, because it may cause enough interruptions to require you to reestablish your VPN connection), the interference is acceptable.    -The monitor is paired with a camera when the 2 devices are within a few feet of each other.  There's apparently some encoding too.  Since I live in a town home, I didn't want my neighbors to be able to get video or audio of my house, this is a definite plus.    -No fancy useless features to clutter up the unit's operation.  This is a video monitor and it does the job well. Period.    -4 settings for activation based on noise level.  First, you can have all sounds come through. Even when I'm getting choppy video because I've gone too far away from the camera, audio is crystal clear with no static.  There are 3 other settings that make the monitor only produce sound when the sounds are loud enough.  My wife is a light sleeper, so we use it on the setting that filters out the most noise. Soft to medium cries still come through, so this is perfect.  At other times the monitor is silent.    -Rechargeable batteries come standard.  Someone was thinking here.  The monitors use AAA batteries (might be AA, I forget) and come with rechargeable batteries.  Here's the best part, when you plug the monitor into the wall, it charges the batteries.  So I never ever have to change the batteries and in about a year when the batteries start to wear out and battery life suffers, I'll just swap in some new rechargeable batteries for under $2. Brilliant.  I can't report how long the battery life is, since it's never run out on me, but I can say that I've had it running unplugged for about 8 hours. (It does have an annoying beeping sound when the batteries die. I found this out after accidentally leaving it on all day and happened to come back to the bedroom to find it beeping.) **edit** After 6 months of heavy use on battery power only, the monitor last for about 4 hours with video on the entire time.  We found that battery life was so good that we just started leaving the video on all the time rather than using the 5, 10, or 25 second shutoff.    -There is a flashing green light on the front of the cameras. It's quite bright, so I picked up some scotch tape and double layered some colored paper to cover it up.  It's a silly design issue, but easily resolved.    -Each monitor can take about 4 cameras. The only downside is they aren't widely available, so you'll need to buy them directly from Safety 1st.  They give instructions in the manual on how to order.  The cameras are a little pricey, but sometimes they'll negotiate to a very reasonable price. **edit** There's no way to monitor the sound from multiple cameras at the same time, instead you need to press a button to cycle through them.  I wish I could see 1 of the cameras and hear sounds from all cameras, then maybe have an indicator that said which cameras were currently transmitting sound.
B004BSFNWC|4|The one-hand fold on this stroller is a lifesaver for city dwellers. When folded, it stands upright on its own, and you can even wheel it behind you kind of like a dolly. The basket is large and accessible. Handles well - you can steer with one hand. Very compact. We were going to get the City Mini, but our brownstone has double-doors in the entryway, and the City Mini is too wide. This fits through perfectly. Wish it were one-hand open. It is not very heavy, but neither is it very light. The seat and canopy seem to be of higher quality than those on the Zippy.
B00IAJ639A|2|The wristlet is a nice fabric and good quality.  However, I was hoping I might be able to wear this over the shoulder, tucked under my arm.  I was looking for this because I am expecting my first child in April and thought in my come in handy.  Unfortunately, the strap drop length was much too short, so I returned the item.
B00IBZ8ADK|5|Great product. No leaks at all!
B002SW3CLC|5|These wash cloths are super soft and we love the large size. Many other uses like burp cloth, lovey etc. Ours have been washed MANY times and they still like new only softer. Soft, durable, huge!
1453052593|5|My one year old daughter got these as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves them! I would definitely recommend these books.
B000HCMUDQ|3|It's a cute set. I want to like the product, but I am not happy constantly finding bristles in baby's hair after using the brush. I've used natural boar's bristle brushes for many years and have not seen such shedding. I'm surprised the brush isn't bald yet.
B00BOKJH90|4|Red is closer to a pink color.... then again, its only a cup.
B00INGNYXS|4|Everything  went good, we can  see our  son. Perfectly.
B0017VM2NY|3|I bought this car seat because they don't use flame-retardant chemicals. I read reviews about it being too upright and that is true - my son still falls asleep in it but his head will either lean back or forward, neither of which look very comfortable. When his head hangs forward, I wait until a red light, then reach my arm back and push his head against the car seat. I bought the car seat knowing all this, however, so I was ok with it. My complaint, however, is that the red seat belt button is very hard to press down and release. I am a 5'7\\" fairly strong woman, with 15-month old mommy muscles. I have difficulty pressing the red button to release the belt, and for my mother-in-law who has arthritis, it is impossible. My son is often anxious to get out of the car seat and it is frustrating to be fidgeting with the belt with a crying toddler after a long car ride. I never had this problem with an old Britax Marathon car seat, which is now in our other car. I called Orbit Baby and they said it was due to a safety standard that makes it difficult for toddlers to undo the seat belt themselves. They also said that the button should \\"normalize\\" with time, meaning it will get less difficult to release for an adult, but still difficult for a child. I understand that, but I also feel that it is a safety concern if you are trying to get your child quickly out of the car - if god forbid, there should be a fire, or if you need to get him/her out of harm's way. Have yet to see if time will \\"normalize\\" the button but for now I will hang on to the car seat just because I am tired of looking and because there are no other chemical-free alternatives out there (yet).
B00LITRXMA|5|Just as described. Easy set up!
B0032UCZQM|4|The photo and description of this item listed the actual \\"Tot Lok\\" system by Safety 1st, which is supposed to be product numbers 71175 and 71172 (for the spare key).  What I actually received was the newer design, product numbers HS132 and HS129, which is a similar product, but not the \\"Tot Lok\\" line.  I talked to Safety 1st customer service and they assured me that it is basically just a newer design of the same idea.    In any case, the locks are easy to use and they can be mounted sideways, which is necessary in my cabinets.  Some magnetic lock systems like Kidco have to be mounted vertically because the locking mechanism uses gravity to engage the lock.  The Safety 1st locks (Tot Lok and newer non-Tot-Lok version) do not use gravity to engage the lock.
B00006G9LI|2|While I was disappointed the Food Mill had a plastic strainer rather than a steel one like the one I used for 5 kids (they do carry a model now that has the steel strainer disc which I highly recommend) the customer service when going through the return process was great.  The company stands behind their products 100% and were very pleasant to work with.  I would definitely purchase other products from them again.
B002WB237I|5|We have the bugaboo chameleon, which we love, except the sun shade isn't long enough to shade our child's face most of the time, and if we pull the shade all the way down, she can't see. We tried getting her to wear a sun hat, but we all know how long kids keep hats on. We also tried hanging a light blanket over the edge and the wind just blew it off. I was so sick of flipping the sun shade back and forth on what were supposed to be leisurely strolls, that I went searching for an alternate. I put this sun shade on the minute it arrived and it worked like a charm! Easy to attach, adjustable, and SUPER light. The only negative is you can't fold it back when taking the child in and out, but it's easily bendable, so it's easy to just nudge it back with your shoulder. Plus, since it twist and folds in a snap, and it's so easy to take on and off, it's not really a huge negative in my mind. I can actually do long strolls without constantly having to check if the sun is blazing down on my child's face. Another plus is that it also fits on our light travel stroller, which is perfect for trips this summer. It has great side pockets for a light wallet, chap stick, keys or sunglasses. So great, because I don't have to go fishing around the stroller bag for small items anymore! It would also fit a cell phone, but because of reports about radiation and cell phones, I wouldn't suggest it. I keep my cell under the stroller in a bag and away from her brain. I find myself constantly asking why bugaboo doesn't just make their sun shade exactly like this one?!
B007JVX47E|5|Fit the seat perfect
B002SG7KO8|5|I had bought a couple teethers for my son, who started teething at 12 weeks....he hated everything I had bought. Then, I got this and he loves it! He has learned to hold it himself and keeps him from trying to pull my finger into his mouth to chew.... great product! And, it's handy to be able to wear it :)
B0015TM0M6|5|I also bought the BabyComfy and used regular squeeze aspirators. Regular squeeze aspirators you get from the hospital can get mold inside, are terrible to clean, can fall apart, and don't always get the job done. BabyComfy is a good product but the pieces can come off when my baby is giving me a little boxing match while I do this and the plastic isn't as hard. The Pigeon is high performance in every respect as far as quickly getting the mucous out, cleaning, everything.
B002R26LZM|4|So i have just used our contour stroller for the first time.I have the following review to offer, which will probably be useful for aomazon users in the UK.    First thing is, My husband assembled this with relative ease, which was refreshing.   I havent had our second baby yet, so I cant really comment on the weight of the stroller with 2 children in ( one at 18 months and a soon to be new born) but when i took it out today i did a relatively big shopping for food and found that the basket was useful and it still wasnt heavy with this underneath.   so to break it down   PROS  Easy to steer  great it has so many interchangable seating options ( today was interesting as even though i only had our 18 month with me i found that i could swap seats. For example he started out in the front and then when he was moaning due to being tired i just popped him in the closest seat facing me.  Great to look at , I got 3 comments today  Parent tray was VERY useful just to put my bits in and his bottle and / or water  easy to recline seats  The multi fit car seat adapter is handy. Since we live in the UK our brand of car seat wasnt listed but i have an i'coo and it fits very very snug on this adapter.   The rotating front bar is great for toddlers entrance and exits and keeping my older one safe while strapped in. i found this very useful being able to pop it out and roatate it out of the way  It folds really easily and the free standing capability is great  CONS  The seats are a little small, my 18 month old is slightly larger than average and he just about fits in, so wont last him past maybe 3 yrs old  The material is quite flimsy, looks nylonish and quite thin  The fact that it doesnt have many accessories is a little unfair but I suppose this is available on the next model ( which is obviously slightly more expensive)  Not having a peep hole to see the children if they are facing forward, i just found that i was checking on my 18 month alot, since he seemed so far away and i could not talk to him etc. this is easily cured by turning the seat, which is great ( and again this is avialable on the tandem 2 model)  The baby head rest is very floppy, so I cant see this being useful to hold our newborns head sturdy    All in all, the stoller pros out weigh the cons and we are happy with it, especially since this isnt avail in the UK and with the exchange rate was worth it  I think the new features on the more expensive model is an expample of kolcraft listening to the customers.
B004Y4FHZG|5|Great product, durable, high quality!
B00EY7SKVG|5|I love love loved it. The name tag gave a perfect touch. Shipping was great. The picture of the bike looked exactly like it does in the picture. It is kinda hard to mess up a coffee mug.
B003CUXV0Q|5|Very well made and as described. Fits our portable and small crib perfectly. Just the right amount of support and not to soft or to hard. Great buy for the price and will be easy to clean if any accidents do happen.
B000WUF4LS|4|Bought this booster seat chair for my grandson.  Pros: Secures easily to our kitchen chair and is always ready for him.  Play top is an added extra though I must admit there really isn't much to play with.  Things move back and forth but that's about it.  Easy to clean and very portable.  Cons: sits a baby lower at the table than I thought.  I think I would find it more comfortable if he sat higher (more table height) so I could feed him more easily.  When he outgrows the tray and is more of a toddler I will be able to use it again and he'll fit to the table easier.  It's a nice alternative to a separate highchair.
B0011URFRE|5|Great seat for the price. It was easy to install and my daughter seems comfy in it. The straps were a little cumbersome at first to tighten but just took some getting used to since they were different our other seat. Overall very happy with this seat.
B0029WQFVU|1|I am VERY disappointed in is &#34;so-called hands free&#34; bra. It's a regular nursing bra like the ones I already have, the only difference is that the outer flaps are a bit thicker so when you fold it down you can stick the flanges of the pump and bottle on it. It's not handsfree because as soon as you move the bottles fall out of the fold. There's no way I could move around or do anything but sit still. It doesn't even make the pump flanges sit close to your breast. What a waste of money.  My son is 6 months old and I pump every day/  at work, this would not help me at  all.it would even seem like some material is missing that's why it's so big, the size I got was a 32C the cup fits will, it's the so called hands free portion that is so wide that it wouldn't hold anything. Please don't purchase this bra if you want something that's actually a hands free product, it works great as a regular nursing bra.
B0006BAJIQ|5|We haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have.  We have regular square tile on our bath walls.  The basket holds several floating toys, plus a cup for dunking water, shampoo, wash cloths, etc.....  We love it.
B000JPQPLO|5|I gave this bag to my sister for Christmas to use as a messenger bag.  She is an elementary school teacher and frequently needs to bring books back and forth to school.  She absolutely loves the bag and continuously receives compliments on it.  It is not bulk enough to betray the fact that it is really a diaper bag!  It is a gorgeous bag with pink lining and I plan on buying one for myself soon!
B009Z4W140|5|Very secure in tub & at the sink.
B00AIFY38W|4|I really liked this seat over any others because it has a latch to secure it to the car's seat.  I don't understand why anyone would want a car seat that moves since you no longer have the five-point harness to keep the child secure that way.  The cup holder is a nice edition since long trips and snacks are a constant.  The arms are removable which was good for us since our 7 year old is very tall and larger than most.
B002VLR6JE|5|I am bringing up a Great Dane puppy and these gates have been a blessing!  I bought one for a standard sized door opening and then had to buy more to gate off the kitchen for the ever growing puppy. They have numerous extensions to fit all the larger openings I needed. Installation was easy. The gates work like a champ. My 5 and 7 year old grand kids can operate them and the puppy can't!  The design is ingenious and I have nothing but praise for these gates.
B0000CCOJL|1|This car seat is such a joke! The harness was absolutely miserable to deal with everytime we took our baby somewhere. You have to pull it over your baby's fragile little head, and then scratch there head trying to get it through! We took it back to Target to exchange it, only to realize they had no other infant car seats in stock, except for this one and another 3 point harness. So we finally found a decent \\"regular\\" car seat at another retailer. I would NOT recommend this car seat ever..it was cute and all, but that harness has got to go. I was really surprised I wasn't warned about this type of harness from family and friends. We now know in the future to never buy a 3 point harness again.
B00ER6XV36|5|Perfect!
B00PB5NDPI|5|I was a little hesitant to purchase wondering if it was going to be soft & fit. I was more than pleasantly surprised. It is softer than the expensive bed set sheet that I got! I will be purchasing another one or two!
B00X070H6C|2|I was a little disappointed because the rubber at the top is so thick, my 5 month old baby had a hard time getting it into her mouth.  She got frustrated with it, which made me frustrated.  Ill keep it for when she is older maybe it might work better then.  It still however is a good concept.
B00BIFACT0|3|I love this brand and use their bottles exclusively and am not knocking the brand, the pacifier, or the packaging specifically.  It is just that my daughter does not like them.  I think they are too thin for her and do not truly mimic the shape of a nipple.  She is not a huge pacifier fan, but she prefers the MAMM pacifiers when she does take one.  These are worth a try and maybe your child will like them.
B005XJ2VGE|5|Awesome high chair!  Sooooooo versatile and easy to clean!  My son lives sitting in it and I have never had any problem with him falling out of it (but I do use the 5 point harnesses every time). Would highly recommend this product!
B004CJ9D6W|4|We bought this monitor as a replacement for one that was given as a gift. The monitor worked very well for about 2 months and then broke while we were on vacation. The company was very nice and sent us a new one once the original was sent back.
B000YFSFVC|1|Cheap, not soft or durable.  Looks like it's going to fall apart.  One set of string ties long the top of the bumper so you cannot even secure it to the crib.  Save your money
B001IY2SPW|4|Looks good.
B00005V6C8|4|I registered for this item, as it can be converted later on to either a regular trash bin, or a kitty litter box, making it very economical.  It works great, and I haven't had any odors escape, however, it is not child proof and is very easy to open.  My son (9 months old) is constantly stepping on the lever and opening the lid, or lifting the lid himself and catching his tiny fingers inside.  He is also able to open the lock and has has peeked inside.  Great product, just be careful with a curious toddler.
B002VBXY40|5|My grandson loves it
B0060SYG6U|4|This is very cute and as advertised. True to color and size. Can hold up to a 4X6 pic easily.
B002BSGWTC|5|Nice quality flannel blankets. However, these are a bit small. Can't quite swaddle a baby in this. I use these to keep him warm when he's in the car seat or for a bit of cover when at the drs.
B001ARH6H2|5|happy with this product so far seems to have done what is claims!
B00G92KHEW|5|Love the water proof feature!
B00005TNIH|4|This is the second monitor ive had since my son was born.  Ive been using it for about 2 years now and Im just starting to have some problems with static, but its sporadic and usually stops quickly.  Im expecting my second baby and planning to get another monitor just like it.<BR>I think my favorite thing about this monitor, is that when my son cries, it muffles the volume against the loud noise so it doesnt lift you out of bed in the middle of the night thinking the child is screaming right in your ear!
B00020V5A2|2|We received this monitor as a very generous gift from my parents at our baby shower and I was thrilled to have the video and audio features in a monitor.  The monitor has lost it's picture after only a year and the overall quality of this less than expensive product is not worth the money in my opinion.  Also, the company does not offer a replacement monitor, they only offer a replacement camera which is not helpful when the montior, which is often moved from room to room in our house is what takes the wear and tear, whereas the monitor remains immobile for the most part and would often not need replacing. I would have registered for a different product had I read some of these \\"lower star\\" reviews prior.  I won't be purchasing a Summer product again.
B000I5Q19Q|3|Looks like q good quality item, assembly is simple and straightforward. Unfortunately, I have received a partially DOA item as it works only with batteries. There is definitely an electrical problem there. When using the power supply I can feel the heat in the electrical unit and only one motor (that circles the butterflies) works.
B002M77N22|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product!  My son is not ready to sleep in his crib yet, and hates his pack n play.  My son sleeps through the night in this just fine, and has been since he was 8 weeks old!  It's perfect to pack up and bring to grandparents, or hotel! It comes with a cute little rattle too!
B000067QMD|5|I originally planned to pump into storage bags and did that for a while.  Then I realized I was wasting time and money transferring milk from the pump bottle, into bags and then back into the feeding bottle (Avent Natural).  I decided to start storing in the Avent bottles and these are essential for safely and securely capping the bottles.
B0006Q561Q|5|Good product, identical to the ones at Target or Medela.com. They worked just like the ones that came with the pump. Price was good and would order again if needed. Membranes shipped early and arrived nicely packages.
B008BGNUMK|4|I wish I would have had this from day one.  I think learning from the beginning to use it for nursing would have been great.  Since we didn't get this until our son was 9 months old, he will not nurse in it and that's OK.  It's great to have when I'm trying to do tasks around the house and my little guy needs some attention as well.  He loves to sit in it and watch me work.  We also use it for walks and when running errands!<br /><br />My only complaint is I ordered the Charcoal Grey and it looks like more of a plum than grey.  Not a huge issue but not the color I was expecting.
B004C43JJ4|5|I purchased this after using a hand-me-down highchair for a week.  My son is eating solids BLW (baby led weaning) and an important aspect of this is that he can reach the tray to feed himself.  Traditional highchair's tray was too far away and the straps were too loose.  This is perfect!  He was so happy the first time I put him in it.  He can reach all of the tray and sit close to the table.<br /><br />I chose this one because my sister recommended it, she also has it for her twins.  Plus it can travel to restaurants and family and friends houses.  Definitely a $25 well spent.  Highly recommend this over ever buying a traditional highchair.
B00008ODBG|4|I didnt purchase this because I saw all the non essentials lists moms kept putting up on their blogs. Wipes warmers were always on the list.<br />Well, my aunt gave me this exact wipe warmer after using it for 5 years with her two sons and I'm glad she did. This warmer is still going strong and my baby isn't getting startled with a cold wipe at 3am. I feel it is a good investment amongst all the baby crap we are bombarded into buying.
B000IDSLOG|5|I highly recommend Sophie! My thirteen month old still uses it as a teething toy above all the others I have purchased.  I have found (by accident) that running it through the dishwasher on the top shelf makes it stop squeaking.  Could be a useful tidbit of info if the squeaking is driving you crazy.  We have definitely gotten our money's worth!
B005SPZG5Q|5|Wonderful product. Easy to use.
B001DU23D8|2|Had poor directions. Was not made from real wood like stated in the description. Its just an okay piece for the price.
B000UD3ZGI|4|It does the job just wish it had instructions on how to put on the pillow that's why it has 4 stars. I figured it out but with such a large pillow and having to take off and start over instructions would have helped so much. Feels great now though !
B001NPDFNU|4|This is a cute little lamp, smaller than I thought it would be, but to be honest I didn't read the specifications when I ordered it, so I only have myself to blame for that. It is only a 40 watt maximum lamp so it is not going to light up an entire room mainly just a little corner. Perfect for having by a changing table for a newborn baby. It isn't overly girly and can be used for boy nursery's as well. Overall, I got it, plugged it in, it lights up and well, what more do you want from a lamp?
B005IA84M8|5|The video is clear and the sound is awesome.  Temperature gauge is accurate. Great item and very reasonable price compared to many other similar items.
B00N1R1DSC|2|Smelled like a fish market its been 3 weeks and it still smells! Wouldnt buy.
B0019L6ZDA|5|It works and looks great!  I feel so much better that my son will not hit his head on the hearth of the fireplace.  I even let him play on it now!  Wonderful product!
B006SFUEF2|1|I agree with others who were disappointed with the reliability of this product.  I ordered it before my son was born, and only took it out to test is when I received it.  It worked fine, and the features seemed great.  I then put it away, and we didn't use it for the first few months after he was born.  We then took it out when he was about 3 months old, and when I turned it on, I found that the images project, but don't rotate.  This was very disappointing!  Since it didn't rotate, we really didn't even try using it with him, so I can't comment on how well the other features work over the long term, but I would suggest purchasing a different projector.
B008H3SS4M|5|Works with Boppy brand pillow. Nothing much more needed to say expect works great and washes well. Good material and love the pattern.
B0035RQF8G|5|We have used these door covers all over our house. They are loose on the door, so they rattle a little when baby tries to reach them. The holes are wide enough apart, which makes it hard (but not impossible) for those little ones tall enough to grasp the knob to turn it. It also requires enough coordination to grasp the knob through the holes while turning, something that often stops our adult guests in their tracks, which is also very amusing. :-)
B0029WSIP6|5|I had a difficult time finding a dual purpose bra (pumping & nursing) in the stores. My sister in law suggested this bra.  It's been working great.  I was leary that without a wire it wouldn't hold up my large breasts (42D), but it did.
B00EVTF4PC|1|This blanket is horrible!! It sheds everywhere! Even after 5 washes it still sheds on clothes furniture and it gets all over baby and in his mouth! !
B00IN8OIZY|5|Great quality and my daughter took to them right away!
B00O19AIDK|5|My toddler loves these for squeeze pouches, and I love the lack of mess! So glad we found these!! All of my mom friends ask where we got them any time they see them! We have come back to buy more to keep handy in the diaper bag and at home!
B003VNKLHA|5|This gate is awesome! Fits perfectly and easy to put up!
B000G6BZJI|4|I bought two of these gates when I rescued a dog. He was not potty trained and I needed to keep him blocked into a manageable area. They arrived quickly and did the trick! They contained him and I was happy with how securely they closed into the doorways!
B0024FAWSE|5|This worked perfectly for the difficult space we had (walls didnt line up). Very sturdy. The latch does feel a little flimsy but so far has worked great.
B00UA988S2|5|This carrier is an absolute must for any baby wearing twin mom or dad! It's easy to get on and off, my girls love it and it makes doing all kinds of things that are typically problematic for twin moms possible! I take my girls on hikes, go to the store, walk the dog, etc! It's easy to adjust for any size or height person, my husband is 6'2&#34; and I'm 5'4&#34; and we both use it easily. The fact that it breaks into two carriers is awesome and makes airplane travel even easier so we don't have to being an extra carrier with us once we board the plane. If you're questioning if you want to buy this or now, I say do it! There isn't one single item that I own that has given me independence and freedom as a new mom to twin girls than this carrier.
B00P6KN55Q|5|Looks great. Does what it's supposed to do. Organize toys! Easy to put together.
B00WHO5SCM|5|We bought the Little Sleepy Head pillow so a pillowcase was a must. I like the color choices and the way it fits on the pillow-doesn't come off easily so it will stay on with a wiggly sleeper.
B009AE77EO|5|This is awesome and my twinsies loved them! They are just the right amount of squishy plus this has lots of different bumps to help with sensory functions. My twin boys dont usually take to things very fast, but they both immediately loved these.
B002I42MM0|3|Not as durable as some cups.
B00IP8A9HI|5|This car seat is like a lounge chair every adult wishes they had. Seems very comfortable and very well made. It's a huge car seat though. Much better than I had thought but it's a great car seat. I don't recommend putting a baby less than 6 months old in this. Just in case anyone was curious.
B00SUK91K2|2|It's a great looking seat that is super uncomfortable. If we drive for more than 20 minutes he's telling us his butt hurts. If he falls asleep in it he wakes up soar as well.  It also isn't quite as sturdy as his previous seat. He loves how it looks but we put the old seat in when traveling long distances. update** our child is pretty small and he constantly complains that this seat squishes his legs and hurts his butt. It's less sturdy than the other seats we've had and we're super disappointed since it's such a high priced seat.
B00BAAX39E|5|We love this thing.  It fits on every seat we've tried, our son will go on it, and the rubberized bottom doens't slide around, even when you don't use the included adjustable tabs that will hold it on the seat.  Definitely recommended.
B005G4VUPO|5|No leaks.  Holds up to 8 oz
B000056HMY|5|This is the only thing that helps my baby go to sleep. She is 6 weeks old and at 1 week she cried a lot and would never take a pacifier. This is so soothing for her, it works like magic! It does go through batteries but it is definitely worth it!
B003YDTTNY|5|These are great value for money.  I also like that they come with the No.2 nipple as some come with the No.1 and they are pretty useless at this size.
B00834D5SO|5|I researched which car seat to get for my toddler grandson. This one got high marks from other users. Now that he has<br />used it for a while, I can absolutely agree. Very well made and sturdy. Instructions are clear and understandable.<br />It has been a very good buy.
B00CRAV4VK|1|The product arrived on time - no complaints there. However, the tubing that is supposed to connect into the Medela Freestyle pump does not fit. It is too big. I even tested the other two tubing connectors to see if they would fit into the pump, but they do not. They fit fine into the pump head parts. I was very disappointed.
B00AFQ07GQ|5|These are nice and soft but only at first. After washing they rough up a little. Since they aren't waterproof, I only wear them around the house. I made the mistake of wearing them out one time and I leaked through them onto my shirt. Oops. It's nice to have a reusable pad though.
B005UB9PPK|1|I hated this stroller. Returned it after 3 weeks of using. The wheel in front wobbles so bad I can't even run with it, even when it's locked. Plus, the air in the tires kept going out. I exchanged for the Jeep Liberty stroller and absolutely love it. The jeep is made so much better too.
B003BHFP8Q|5|I was returning to work and wanted a full set of extra parts so I didn't have to wash my breast pump parts at work. These have worked out great- perfect fit and I've had no issues with them.
B00RI5P8VQ|5|Thank you! I just bought my son's first overnight diaper from you and I absolutely love it! My son is a heavy wetter and we have not had one single leak since we started using this diaper for bedtime. I will definitely be buying more.
B0013A31KW|3|I was very surprised to see how small this bunny was when I opened the package!!  The description says 8' but the attached tag says 6'.  I don't know if I'll return it yet, it is cute, but sooo small.  We have a much larger NAB kitty that is my 2 year olds favorite and so I bought this for my new daughter who is due in September.  Good size for a baby...but I'm upset with inaccurate advertising.  Did I mention it's tiny?
B001WAJVZM|5|I felt better having this faucet cover installed when my daughter started to stand up in the tub. Super easy to install.
B002P1LEZW|5|We had this towel for my daughter (now 19-months) and I can swear to you that we use it NIGHTLY after bath. It has held up in color, shape, absorbency, and softness with more than weekly washing and daily use. We had to have one for our baby boy on the way, too. I wouldn't recommend any other towel. You will not be sorry.
B007XL658K|5|Little one outgrew size small, these large swaddlers are very big, but should work well.  Excellent price for two swaddlers!
B00HUCFLIM|4|The product material is great, its soft and strong too. It's a very good product the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't fully close. on the sides it has a gap the cover doesn't go all the way down so some wind still gets to them also occasionally it won't stay in place and goes to one side. but overall it does the job keeps baby cover.
B003VNKLHA|3|This gate was not as sturdy as the shorter gate by the same company. Our toddler was able to shake it out of the wall!
B0057GU322|4|I like this product, It looks good, does not take up to much space and you can store a good amount of toys.
B00J40DY0A|5|It's Perfect!
B003JJX2IG|5|Thank you for taking the stress out of using public restrooms for my little girl! Very nice product, heavy duty/thick & the individual wrapping makes stashing them in my purse or car easy. Even us grow ups will use them! Great for car trips, I ordered 5 packages of 6 & will be ordering more & sharing with my friends. Already gave a demo at parents support group:)
B00AHPZY68|5|IT is really a comfortable car seat. I have used it for my 5-years kid and he enjoyed it and loved it very much. Now, he can sleep while I am driving very comfortably with the car seat inclined.
B00O3GH80W|5|Great price and quality :) Love the pattern too!
B001P1VBH4|5|I actually used this as a car seat cover for a little while too, so it was like a 2 in 1 product for me! I love that it has a hood, and that it's super warm and fleecy on the inside, and a clean almost water resistant surface on the outside. I don't know if it is actually water resistant since I never used it long term in the rain, but at least it's way better than a blanket!!! Super easy to use too, just loop it around your neck!
B00083HK0M|2|Works great I have not had a problem will smell and I love to foot peddle but it's small I use it for my cloth dippers and can only get one maybe one and a half days of my 1 month olds dippers in it before it's full :(
B0028LXK74|5|It is a quality product
B00HHRH07U|5|i like it
B004323NHS|5|same as the picture,good
B00H8MSC0S|4|It's great but I wish it didn't make so much noise with every swing--click, click, click, click…
B0006B4BVC|5|This is one of the best products around!!  After 2 sleepless nights when my son came home from the hospital, I tried to swaddle with a blanket like the hospital nurses do.  I am just not that talented and went out and bought these wraps and they are fabulous.  My baby sleeps comfortably all night in the swaddle.  This is a must have for every newborn!!
B00004S7MV|5|My 2 year old Thomas Loving grandson LOVED this.  It is dishwasher safe and makes meals so much more fun for him.
B0019QHZ7A|4|A bit let down as picture shows an assortment of colors. However, we received blue, purple, & green only. I ordered this product twice, from two different companies and I still received the same colors. I like having the colors and it adds a great color pop to a bottle. I love Gerber products, and trust them to be safe. We prefer the silicone nipple. A great thing about this purchase is the nipples reduce colic; which was not mentioned in item description.
B002VLGD2A|5|work great with the medela bottles would also fit the cheap gerber bottles you can buy at walmart.
B0061BW6XG|4|Our second graco 3 in 1. Great car seat, very sturdy, love the cupholder which is a MUST! I would of given it 5 stars but the black one I have for my son has a better material, this one shows dirt faster
B009QXDE32|5|Only bottle my baby likes
B001DLJVPA|3|I like it but...it is not a true white. It is a creamy white :( .  I can't adjust the height without using two hands.  To put it down I need to place my hands on either chair arm and push down with my body weight. To bring it up I have to get my baby out of it and pull up with force by grabbing both chair arms.  I am not a weak woman...5'9&#34; 150lbs and athletic!  Definitely NOT EASY to put up or down.  Also, the height at its highest level is low for me.  Wish I could get it another 6&#34; higher.  Disappointed with the color, height, and pneumatic lift.  Despite these three issues I chose to keep the chair and am satisfied.  It glides around my house with ease and does look more modern than any other highchair at this price point.  I sacrificed function for overall aesthetics...but that's who I am.  You'll never catch me in a pair of sensible shoes.
B000BPMJSK|3|Definitely felt like terry, but not in a good way.  The color did stay true.
B00ENXEZ3I|1|very cheap looking
B000BOKAQ4|3|Hey there,<br /><br />My two going on three year old rides in a marathon car seat. This guy would not fit around her comfortably.<br /><br />Well made, but just not for us.<br /><br />Kind regards.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Shannon
B000YZD0QM|4|I bought this for the long trips.  It has a soft bottom part to the seat but the back is not cushioned very well.  It is very roomy and my 16 month old seems to like it.  I like the ability to adjust the seat belt so easy, and that the bottom seat cover is easily removable for cleaning.
B00K770NZS|5|adorable pattern and does a very good job in helping us wash our tiny baby. especially good now when the umbilical cord is not yet completely dry and we want to have more water than only sponge the baby.I can easily wash the baby using the rinser without touching the umbilical cord. Great product and will buy it later for other friends that expect babies!
B000O7WL88|5|I am so glad I bought these! I have a baby on the way that will be here in 3 weeks and I was looking for cradle sheets this particular size and glad I came across the chenille sheets. They are SO soft. If they had these in Queen size, I would buy them in a heartbeat!
B008ZPD40K|5|Great product with a variety of flavors. My personal favorite is the garlic but what I really love about these is that I'd never thought of putting something on the outside of my potatoes. I love the fact that these help to make the potato peel crispy since my husband and I both enjoy eating the peel.<br /><br />We use these as a 'treat' to make the potato extra special, usually when we have friends over or when my husband makes steak on the grill. If you use them with the spud spikes the potato will be fluffy and moist, just as they should be and the peels will be yummy! What more could you want? Give these a try, you won't be sorry!
B000S9RF4M|5|Great for baby bjorn babysitter bouncy chair. 5 month old's favorite toy. The Bjorne wooden arch is nice too, I alternate them
B00FCSCJB8|5|I love the drinks holders! The product is exactly as described, and I use one of the large drink holders for a huge water bottle, and the other to hold a container with snacks. The central compartment is roomy and secure enough for things like baby wipe, dummies, more snacks etc, and I love that I can put my keys, some money and my phone into the detachable compartment so that these are easy for me to take with me should I move away from my stroller. The mesh netting is soooo useful as i can just throw anything in and I know it is easily accessible using the top zipper. Compared to other products I looked at in my local stores, this stroller organizer is very well made, of a quality material and is way bigger in terms of compartments and drink/bottle holder size. I also love that I can attach it either flat onto the bar of my stroller, or let it hang - so good to have options, and the velco is super sturdy. Happy mum!
B000FFL58Q|5|Great product, my son is 10 weeks old and enjoys looking at the various animals \\"hanging around\\", good music with two volume settings.  I like how the animals can come off so he can hold them as well as look at them hanging.
B000K4YSZO|1|It has absolutely horrible design.  It's complicated to install and to use.  You are wasting money on replacement of batteries. All together it's an expensive and bad product.
B004XIQTSM|4|Mats are a life saver for our little baby. He can now crawl around without bumping his little head on the tile floor. Delivered as promised, on time and without any damages. Would buy again from this seller. Thanks again.
B005BMA53Y|4|My little dog has figured out how to push it over but it slows him down long enough that we can catch him before he gets out.
B002A9JCY4|5|My 11 month old LOVES this thing!  The water goes up a little high though so it gets him in the face, he doesn't like that so much.  Its certainly a favorite bath toy in our house!
B00LMN93NY|5|I was so glad to receive this so quickly after ordering it. It has saved me so much time and energy! I will be ordering more!
B00EZWL4Y0|5|These are so cute I bought 3 sets of them. Some of them pill after a while some of them never do, it's random. Great for winter. You can go a size up and let them bunch at the ankle in the beginning, they're super tight and stretchy so the waist won't be too big.
B007UYBOKY|5|My daughter likes it very much,beautiful color ,comfortable....
B005LODJR6|5|THE DESCRIPTION SAID SOFT, BUT IT TRULY IS.  MY TEENAGER WANTS THESE SHEETS!  I ALMOST DIDNT GET IT BECAUSE IT IS JUST THE SHEET SET, BUT I AM GLAD I DID.
B007ZBQZ60|5|Why use sleepbags? That's a question I would love to answer one more time, but here I will only review this TOG 2.5 6-18mo sleepbag:<br /><br />As always, Grobag products are very well made and practical.<br />Size zipper on small sizes (up to 18mo) and front middle zipper for bigger sizes.<br />THere is a snap on top of the zipper at the armpit (unzips from top at the armpit, to the bottom. The zipper is long (it goes all around the left side of the bag and all around the bottom of the bag and ends approximately at the junction of the right side and the bottom side). When opened, it gives a very generous space to be able to lay your baby on top of the opened sleepbag and just snap the shoulder snaps and close the zipper. This is a great feature for babies that don't like to have their arms go through armholes.<br />The fabric is two layers of cotton with a layer of cotton batting in between, and all this is much breathable than fleece, while keeping baby warm but not sweaty.<br />Snaps on the shoulders: two on each side. Super sturdy. Nothing to say about these - they are strong enough so baby-proof (even our 3.5yo kids cannot open them).<br /><br />We are using them on our 3rd child and will not change brand of sleepsack anytime soon (at least looking at the US market. European sleepbags, including the Grobag, is a much better one IMO)<br /><br />This TOG 2.5 is great for cooler winter nighs in SoCal (when temperature is around 68-72), but also in other cooler climates.<br />Grobag website and the paperwork that comes with the sleepbag indicates very accurately how to dress your child when using the sleepbag. Just follow directions.<br /><br />We now have 4 Grobags (and a couple of other european brand sleepbags) that have been washed at least once a week, and they hold up really well. The fabric gets softer the more we wash and use, also more pilly but that's normal.<br /><br />Pricewise, it is more expensive than HALO sleepbags, but you get what you pay for. Grobag are definitely sturdier. Zippers are higher quality and fabric is incompareable (quality and cuteness).<br /><br />I was tempted by the Gunamuna sleepbags before buying this sleepsack, but since the TOG rating on the Gunamuna was not specified, and on their website the warmer ones were fleece (which is not a very breathable fabric!), I went back to Grobag, and I am not disappointed.<br /><br />The seller Positronic actually ships much quicker than Amazon says (I received mine within 2 weeks, I even think it was 10days) Their customer service is very good too.<br /><br />Hope that helps to make your choice!
B00C78G3G8|5|Really cute straps.  Fabric is soft & the taggies aren't rough or sharp like some I've felt.  The stitching is tight & the velcro is strong.
B00AANPUUM|4|I guess I didn't read the fine print, because I didn't realize it could not be personalized.  I sent an e-mail with the desired information and was told that it wasn't offered.  Luckily I had a neighbor that could do it for me.  Other than that, I liked it.
B000BUTCOO|5|We received a couple mirrors from big-box retail stores as gifts and we researched many other mirrors before settling on this one. We've had it for a couple months with no problems at all. In fact, the only time we've had to readjust it was when someone sat in the seat and bumped their head against it. Otherwise, it's firm in position and clearly reflects the baby's smiles and frowns.<br /><br />UPDATE: 11/30/2012<br /><br />After using this mirror for a few months, we are still very happy with our purchase. It almost never shifts even with small direct bumps (like putting something in the back seat). It's strapped securely to the headrest and doesn't shift. We have recommended it to friends and purchased as gifts.<br /><br />If you liked this review or if it was helpful in your shopping decisions, please let me know. And be sure to check out my other baby-related product reviews. Thank you Amazon for being the easiest shopping experience ever!
B0027VSPBQ|5|I would never thought this bassinet will be the most useful baby item in the first weeks. I can drag it along with me. It was easy to assembly it. I love it.
B00OSGP9CG|1|Complete deception. I thought I ordered a pack of headbands to only discover that it was a single headband with the supplier color choice.  Can't even bother to return.
B0000E262S|5|What a great product!  My son came home from the hospital on a monitor after being born early and spending almost 3 months in the NICU.  We got the Angel Care monitor for when he no longer needed the hospital monitor.  We actually used it while he was still on the hospital monitor -- it was more reliable with significantly less false alarms than the hospital monitor!  It has done wonders for my peace of mind, and I wouldn't put my son to bed without it.  I'm actually considering getting a second one for his pack-n-play so he has it for naps and when he's away from home...it's really that good!  The only \\"false alarm\\" we've ever gotten from it (other than when we've forgotten and taken him out of the crib without turning it off first) was when he wiggled so far down into the corner of the crib that it didn't pick up his breathing (a situation that needed our attention anyway).  I think the alarm volume could be a little louder (but it may just seem quiet after hearing the ear-piercing screech of the hospital monitor), but even so, the volume is adequate.  Overall, a great product!
B00CZFAZGM|5|Very nice.  The kid loves it.
B006WWTMT0|5|Very nice when trying to keep kids food items completely seperate. Liquids sometimes leak through into other compartments. Washes in dishwasher well
B00G34TJY0|5|Bought this seat as it had the best safety ratings. Very heavy and sturdy. Less plastic components than many other seats; has true metal rails. Beautiful color. So far, so good.
B004HO587A|4|i have been looking for a jogging stroller for my mom but i didnt want to buy a whole travel set after i already bought a car seat. Took a little bit to put together but it was worth it. I love the fact that the front wheel locks into place. Two complaints: one is it doesnt list the car seats that fit the frame luckily mine fit (graco snug ride)...the box has a list though. Second is the car seat could be buckled in a little bit more secure, but the way it fits will do. Its great that it will last a while in my family for a while...only because you can take off the metal car seat frame and attach the bigger seat at any moment at no extra hassle. I would def recommend this product!
B00H2CRNVI|5|Its awesome product. Beautiful and accoeding to need
B000BFP0HC|5|I used these with my kids, 15 years ago, (different brand). My daugher is babysitting a young girl who makes a mess when she eats. I ordered this bib and my daugher couldn't get over how well it work at catching so much of what had ended up on the floor before. Get rid of the cloth bibs, including those with pockets, (they don't stay open) and get one or two of these. They work great!
B003TY01HG|5|I fold this little joey in between my sustainable baby trifold and use a cover diaper and he has never leaked at night. I use this on my 2 year old at nighttime.
B0025MYX2M|4|Small toothbrush that fits on my finger. Soft bristles and a soft design. The case is pretty useless. Would buy again
B00M1Y5AI0|5|I am a huge fan of Britax car seats.  I already had two convertibles, but put one in my mother in law's car for a week and she was involved in a major not-at-fault accident (baby was not in the car, but if you don't know, car seats must be replaced if they don't meet the criteria after an accident), so back to searching for a new carseat. If you want the safest, highest quality protection for your child look no further.  Now they have made Britax even better with ClickTight.  Instead of struggling with latches, you place the seatbelt through the seat, tighten up the lap, then shoulder belt, and push the seat bottom down until the ClickTight indicator locks into place.  Done!  Took about 3 minutes to install only because I couldn't find the seatbelt connector in my car right away.  I got limelight, first because I have a girl, and second because I live in Texas and it would be a little cooler than a black color.  The material is very soft and the colors match the picture.  ClickTight was important since our little girl was getting to the point where she was outgrowing the Latch anchor system limitations (total weight = 65 pounds).
B00JGPS7LY|5|I can't thank you guys enought for the product. It is well worth the money. After spending numerous days looking for shoes that will fit my 1 year old and failing miserably I came across this great product. I was skeptical at first because of the shape in th picture, my husband thought they looked funny...clowny like. I ignored him and preceded to purchase them anyway. Once my baby put the shoes on, the shoes took shape. They actually look really nice on her feet. She was able to walk right away, she didn't hesitate or anything like she did with other shoes. I will definitely buy again. Thanks for this amazing product.
B0056Z2BTM|5|I love the item purchased, I highly recommend it, its very good ...<br />the product is comfortable<br /><br />is useful<br /><br />easy to use<br /><br />fits the spaces
B002SG775U|5|I really wanted a Dr. Seuss diaper bag, so this was a great choice. It actually has quite a bit of room, comparable to those I was looking at in store. I don't like the ribbon that ties it shut, so you will have to find an alternative such as adding a snap to keep it closed. It also comes with a very thin changing pad, so I just bought my own. All in all I would high recommend this diaper bag!
B000BNQC58|5|My 2 boys trade of on this every other night. It is awesome seeing the stars in there room, I even lay in there longer just looking at them. It is a great temporary night light for them.   We were at a friends house one time and my 3 yr old was going to spend the night with my friends 3 boys. He was crying because he wanted to go home, really he was just scared, anyway I pulled the Turtle out and turn it on and the other kids thought it was soo cool this got my son to stop crying and he was happy being there with it. Made that night, and many other nights very peaceful.
B000EMRK5W|5|This is a great bib.  The fact that it has arms keeps it from getting out of place.  It is tough and cleans up very well.  My only criticism is the Velcro is sewn on where you can't get the bib tight enough.  I took it off and sewed it on in a better spot.
B00AGJFNCA|5|I almost can't describe how awesome this mirror is.  I was hesitant to spend so much on a child rearview mirror, but I don't regret it in the slightest.  I can see the whole back window, parts of the side window (eliminating most of my blind spot), and all three kids in the back seat.  Just awesome.
B00E8NGRN4|4|Love this product. My daughter had a severe apnea episode and had to be resuscitated. She is a normal healthy baby with no previous episodes. We never found a cause for that episode. I ordered this monitor and it has helped me sleep easy. The vibration stimulates her easily to breath without waking her completely. The alarm is easy to hear. We use it along with a sound monitor so we can hear it when we are not in the same room as her. My complaint would be that there is no way to save, record, upload or view the data. I wish I had a way to upload data to my computer so I could see how often the vibration was activated.
B002DELZ2I|5|I use this bag almost daily. My daughter requires \\"special milk\\" and I can't leave the house without a bottle or 2 on me. This bag keeps 4 skinny bottles or 3 wide bottles cold all day with 2 ice packs.  Large sippy cups fit too with no problem.  This bag slips nicely into a purse or diaper bag. I have used it as my personal lunch bag too. My tip: get 2 of these and alternate them. My other cooler bags have gotten funky because of the condensation from the ice packs. Once it starts its really hard to get rid of. The liner of this bag is attached, but it also slides out for easy cleaning with soap and water. As soon as I'm done with one, I wash the liner and leave it inside out to dry completely before using it again. Then I use the other bag if I need to store milk again. Great value for the price!
B00295MQLU|5|Well, currently I am no longer using it, but got very good use of it. This is made beautifully and it is good quality. If you will double pump, this is a must have. I tried to go without it but it will drive you mad- having a scratch on you face that you can't itch, trying to use your phone or iPad for browsing,just to text... etc etc. I could even hold my baby if she cried and still pump but without having a bra it would be crazy....I wasnt sure if I should get the SM/Med or Lg/XL. I followed the chart and got the SM/Med. It fits fine and there is room to spare. A large would have been too big. I wish I had it right after my baby but I waited for almost a month and that 1month was crazy..now I recommend to everyone, if you are pumping you need it...just BUY IT!
B002LNSCXG|5|We purchased this item online about a year after our daughter lost this item (accidentally) in a yard sale.  She was devastated and has talked about that kitty nearly every week since then!  I purposed then to find her another one.  It wasn't until recently that I looked online at Amazon and on my first search found the exact kitten.  Praise the Lord!  Now all of us are happy!!!
B0051POJC4|5|This item is fantastic!  We got this for out 7 month old as a Valentine's Gift.  She just loves music and her face lights up every time she hits the button to turn it on!
B00C2JKUAC|5|Very good car seat!! Looks EXACTLY like the pic.. Everyone loves it!!!
B00MJ8K092|5|awesome great liners, just what the item describes.  perfect for added absorbency to any cloth diaper or use as only liner in a cover.
B0013Z7TNW|2|We had a MacLaren for my son that served us well for four years and finally died after a long trip to NYC.  When my daughter graduated from her \\"bucket\\" we had to get another lightweight umbrella stroller to cover her baby years.  I had been happy with the MacClaren except for three things:  It didnt' recline very far, the basket was ridiculously small and it was forever tipping over when I hung something from the handles and pulled the baby out prior to removing that bag.  Comments online led me to believe the Mia Moda had solved those problems.  It did!  It was a little heavier, but I liked the footrest for a baby, the basket was nice sized and I hung a heavy backpack on it, pulled me daughter out, and had no tipping.  It also had a much better sun shade.  HOWEVER.  We've  used it for a little less than a year and it started to not collapse well and not latch when collapsed.  My husband tried to force it shut and broke the top piece.  So I'm back to MacClaren.  It's not worth having to replace that many times.
B00KHZPH74|5|Love our sleepsuit. Did exactly what we needed it to do. Baby was done being swaddled but would wake herself with her arms. This helped her to be cozy and not wake herself but still be able to move her arms when she wanted to.
B000U1XHFY|5|Recomend
B00CPTPI8S|5|Delivered quickly it was a gift and there was a note saying something about no gift information.  The gift got there but had no name.
B00HQW9MCC|3|We thought that this was bigger than what it was so imagine the shock when we put it together. The overall height of the stroller is for someone who is 4'10, very short and low to the ground. My son is only 3 months and 13.5lbs and he took up all the room in the seat. His arms could have hung out on the sides. The wheels are very small so they don't roll easily and get caught in any small crack. The good things about this stroller is that it is very light and easy to open and close. Takes up little to no space in the trunk plenty of cup holder space at the top.
B001Q4VOW2|5|We own two ergo carriers, the blue sport ergo, and this one with the matching backpack. I've tried the moby wrap and two different sling carriers and I have to say, nothing gets it done like this. I've thought about trying the other brands of carriers that have a similar style of support, but their reviews just aren't as good.  While I love them both, and the Sport gets way more use, without the heat as a factor- this one is my favorite.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Fast to put on<br />-You can put it on by yourself<br />-The most comfortable for the longest. I can go for about two hours before this thing starts to irritate. Sometimes it's too tight in the waist and I have to readjust, but it's all about making those adjustments.<br />-Adjustments are EASY. Once you get used to it you start to figure out where it needs to be adjusted relative to the discomfort. When the other carriers get uncomfortable, you're screwed.<br />-I nurse in this thing all the time, and once you get the hang of it you can do it really discreetly- with the infant insert, I haven't tried without yet- and even while you are walking. That's one of my favorite features, to not have to take him out to feed on demand. My son is 17 pounds at 4 months and I haven't been able to nurse him in the slings comfortably. To nurse it helps if you lower the waist and then lower the arm straps, lowering the strap more on the side you're going to nurse helps to not have to preform boob gymnastics, but you have to hang on to baby, they start to slide out that way.<br />-Grocery shopping, house work, I take my son to work with me and actually get stuff done. The nice big pocket makes it a lot easier to not have to carry an extra bag if you are just going to the grocery store.<br />-I love how if I decide to take the carrier off I can roll it up and snap it all together, with the infant insert inside it and velcro it to the backpack with the straps that you usually use to attach it to the carrier<br />-Since we live in south TX this one is strictly worn indoors, it's not that the sport carrier is that much cooler, the fabric on this one is just a little thicker.<br /><br />no cons yet.<br /><br />Update:<br />My LO is 8 months old now and this thing is still being used like crazy. He's 20 lbs and I can still cart him around for about about 45 min while he naps. Some days carrying him around in this is the only way to get him to sleep especially since he's teething. The sucking pads are a must at this age.<br />Not only that, but they get really shy around this age and it makes him a lot more comfortable in situations where he doesn't know who everyone is. I still nurse him in it too. I freaking love this thing.worn indoors, it's not that the sport carrier is that much cooler, the fabric on this one is just a little thicker.     no cons yet.

B003PCYMP4|5|This lamb is adorable. Really cute. I love its tiny pink nose. Our daughter loves the stability of the WubbaNub and the shape of the soothie. Everything came well packaged and came quickly.
B006HKVWRM|5|Perfect for our 4 year old grandson. They fit as expected, wash well and are absolutely adorable. They arrived promptly and were packaged well.
B00F1QH56U|5|I love how many different characters come in this pack! My daughter can never make up her mind and this covered them all
B0031A1R26|4|Great customer service and good price for product. There is an expensive market for breastfeeding families, especially with storing milk. This was the best price and product I found.
B002WN2BKA|5|Great to use at home and have a few extras when friends come over. Also great to have a spare in the diaper bag at all times!
B003ULP592|5|I love that you can fold it down to have better access to the fitted sheet.
B00026FWXW|1|I do not like this stroller and would return it if it wasn't a gift and I tossed out the box...I am anticipating a recall on it anyday.  I have only been using it for a couple of months and I am ready to dump it.  First of all the seat has little to no padding, so I bought a padded insert that really doesn't fit well but doesn't leave a red mark on the back of my son's head anymore.  The seat is elevated by pulling on a string, yes a string...Talk about cheap.  Second the brake keeps falling down and stopping the Stroller, I have to kick it up every few steps.  And this is one heavy stroller.  STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE.
B002WYJYT0|5|I bought this because it attaches to the &#34;soothie&#34; pacifier and lots of the ones in stores will not.  Good quality material, washable, I'm very pleased.
B00GQO0KMW|5|My daughter absolutely loves this walker. She is constantly turning around to play with all the toys. It didn't take long to assemble some of the toy pieces were hard to attach but I was able to do it. The best walker for the price. I have purchased more expensive toys and wasn't as satisfied with them like I am with this walker. Don't hesitate to purchase this walker it's definitely worth your money.
B002X7PBH0|4|We find this Jogger very useful, easy to fold away<br />also useful to walk to the shops and do the shopping<br />each night to get exercise
B00F9BEXF8|5|We have a 3 week old and have this set up in our bedroom. She sleeps in the raised area in her uppa baby bassinet/pram. We found she prefers the bassinet because it is a more enclosed area. She wasn't sleeping well just in the pack n play alone. We didn't want to buy this and a separate cradle or bassinet just for the first few weeks, so this set up has worked great for us. This pack n play is easy to assemble, easy to transport, easy to set up or take down, and very well built. I think this was worth the investment and we will love this purchase for a long time to come.
B000JWWN1S|4|These are great for storing formula, the spout is good for pouring the powder formula out.  The only thing I don't like is the tops are a little hard to get off sometimes.
B000G6BZJI|5|Purchase product to keep my young son from coming into kitchen and it works fine as long as you follow directions and properly install it. Seems like some reviewers don't know how to make adjustments.
B003D3NW4M|4|as described
B00005JIVI|4|I like everything about this item, except I read on the instructions after opening it that it warns against using soaps with moisturizers in it, saying that it increases the chances of mold. What good soap these days don't have moisturizers?! It suggests you put lotion on your baby afterwards. Well, my newborn is still getting used to his bath; I want to dress him as soon as possible. With our apartment, we are already fighting the \\"mold-battle\\" this winter. I rinse it and air it out the best I can even though we don't have an outdoor patio which would be more ideal for thorough drying. I have used this several times already...I hope it doesn't get moldy before my son outgrows it.
B004H0YHKS|5|Good material, daughter loved it, very cute & confy, had one for a year and still looks great, wanted an extra.  Recomend washing it in delicate cycle with not too many other clothes in my opinion.
B000H4O8IO|5|This bed  has served as my son's regular sleep space away from home for months now (from 20-30mos so far). It's much more roomy than most travel cribs. The down side to that is it's tricky finding proper sheets. We simply went with regular crib sheets.<br /><br />I used a crib-sized mattress pad to add a little extra cushion and support, but I didn't go out of my way to find an extra travel mattress that would fit. I hadn't seen any good recs for one anyway.<br /><br />Overall, this is great value for the money and will likely provide a regularly sleeping space for my son until he's 3 or so.
B000BNQC58|5|Great for little ones to learn about the stars and to be used to help by soft lighting to go to sleep
B003Y3BGYE|5|Fast delivery, item was as described and Love!  Place through loops on Bobby Cart/high chair cover when out and about.
B00GU4FPE6|5|Exactly like the picture.  Exactly what I wanted.
B003HS5JMQ|5|Perfect bag for taking little knick knacks on the go.  He loves wearing it too, so it make our load a little lighter ;)
B00GUN3Z1W|1|This gate is so terrible that it deserves its own reality show. Only the bottom bumpers actually make contact with my base boards, leaving the top bumpers a good inch or two out in the middle of nowhere with no support like they work customer service for Comcast or something. If you have a normal house built after 1952 then this gate will be terrible for you too.
B0007V644S|5|I have tried almost ever type of diaper sack on the market and these are by far the best ones. They completely hold the odor in. We use them everywhere, at home, on car trips, on vacation, at Grandma's house, etc. Would highly recommend them over any of the others!
B006Y7OS4C|5|Large and cute! It fits well into my child's room!
B000S9RF4M|5|This is so cute and so practical. My 3 month old loves to look at it, and soon I'm sure she will interact with it more, great for keeping her busy in the car or stroller.
B001CW7CVK|5|We bought this for a six year old who was having surgery to keep in the hospital with him. He really enjoyed being able to look at the stars and playing with it in general. All in all a beautiful toy that is very much enjoyed. I will be buying one for my niece in the future.
B00380IRDQ|5|This product offers great back support and it is very comfortable for the baby. We love it! I recommend it.
B00CWN8IK2|5|Great item! Fast shipping..
B000Q6T7TI|1|I've been along time fan of this product, until they recently changed their formula.  Now, every bottle that I buy is like water!  You can't even blow bubbles with it!  So I contacted California Baby, asking for a reason.  Someone named \\"Sue\\" responded, and said that she would send me postage paid envelope to return the bottles I had.  It's been a month now, and no envelope has arrived.  Now when I email \\"Sue\\" about it, she either ignores me, or places the blame on another department in the company.  So I'm still without bubbles, and it looks like CA Baby still has my money.  I feel gipped!
B005JN6304|3|I really like the gate, however, I was VERY disappointed that it did not reach quite as wide as the description said, and when I tried to order an extention for it, it did not come in bronze (how dumb), eventhough the gate was bronze, AND the extention did not say the same company name on it as the gate. ???
B002QYW8LW|5|Our 5.5 month old baby has been drooling, chewing, and teething like crazy. She took to this thing immediately and absolutely loves it. It's the perfect size for her to hold.
B0087F871E|4|After 2 months of daily use, this is our favorite lunch box.  It is nicely sized, and fits our lunch boxes better than the popular Skip Hop bags.  The inside material is easy to wipe clean.  The zipper works easily, and the handle is sturdy.<br />One star off because the outside material is tough to clean, and the inner material has developed a small tear at a seam (easily patched with duct-tape, that is nearly invisible since the interior is silver.)  I know it says it is washing machine safe, but I don't believe it, and have not tried it.  I'm going to expect a 1/2 year of use from it, no more.
B0006B4BVW|4|I love using this in comparison to swaddling with a blanket, which my son escapes within a few minutes. Its also much easier for a tired parent in the middle of the night. However, one arm will often wriggle out, as the fleece fabric is a quite stretchy and the velcro tabs don't secure the wrap all the way down. However, his elbow usually stays secured so he doesn't seem to wake himself. I also bought a Miracle Blanket swaddler, which is much more involved to wrap up, but does a better job of securing those wriggly hands. Having said that, I still prefer this product for its ease of use.
B000056HKJ|5|I didn't really want to spend a ton of money on a high chair, but was ready to.  Then I found this feeding seat.  I love it.  It is the perfect thing because it is mobile, safe, and very practicle.  I wouldn't have chosen anything else.  My daughter loves this seat, she bangs on the tray and just has a hay day.  Clean up is easy, and this is espically helpful for a child who can't sit up all the way.  This is a must have for babies and parents!!
B004EWGDGU|1|I did not like this at all. I don't know if its just me but I couldn't get the stupid think to play the music when it flushed and I followed the directions perfectly.
B000E89BNU|5|I have tried several bottle brushes and I like this one best! It's sturdy and has bristles on the littles which I think cleans better than the ones with a sponge.<br />I use Dr. Brown bottles
B00J1TG8HU|5|We use them to mark stains for our motel laundry and they go thru the washer and dryer very frequently, minimal breakage for the abuse.
B00881G426|5|When I needed a temporary crib for a few months I didn't want to invest a lot of money but wanted something that at least looked good and this exceeded my expectations.  Not only does it look good, it's a great quality for the price.
B001QKBMIW|3|My son had one of these, which we bought 2 years back and it worked great and its STILL his favorite \\"go-to\\" cup. So I thought I'll get one for my daughter.. WRONG. Somehow they have changed the design since and after only one week's usage (we only hand-wash our cups), the insulated cup came apart from the bottom (blue) portion. Maybe its a manufacturer's error (glue?). The cup is still usable, but its a pain having to try to grip onto the white \\"wave\\" while try to screw the cap on and/or off!
B00NEOBSJQ|5|This is my 5-month-old's FAVORITE thing right now. He plays with it for long periods multiple times per day. Highly recommend.
B004VL2VRY|1|When you spend hundreds of dollars on a video monitor you expect to be able to see your child.  However, most of the time I could not tell whether it was my child in the crib or just a lump of blankets.  I am extremely disappointed and returned the items as soon as I found a superior alternative!
B001OC5UMQ|5|Very good product. Well made and very functional. Note: Before you think the thing has been damaged in shipment look at the tag they have on it that tells you the same thing. To give you good tension when it tightens up in the doorway, The gate is intentionally bent outward and will straighten up when installed. It looks bent when you pull it out of the box but works great.
B005IWM99K|1|So the pad and the shoulder straps come off easily and can be cleaned. However, the lap straps are not removable.  Well they are after an hour of taking out screws.  I haven't figured out how to get the middle attachment strap off yet but I'm working on it.  Who on earth would make a feeding chair where you could not clean the straps.  Food does fall down and unless your child is wearing a full smock this chair will annoy you. I wish I could return this.
B002VBXY40|5|THIS IS BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST.....NO OTHER LIKE IT....GREATTTTTT..IHAVE SEEN AND TRIED OTHERS..BUT THIS IS MUCH BETTER SINCE IT FREES HIM UP TO WALK AND NOT BE IN ONE SPOY
B001QKDI48|3|Non
B00NLOELZ2|5|Just gorgeous- I actually have these adorning my bathroom (definitely not just for kids rooms) and  I can't tell you how many complements I get.  There is a ton in the package as well- I've decorated the main bathroom, the separate water closet, as well as the walk-in closet and I STILL have extra decals to play with.  Hooray!!
B00LVGXUY0|5|This works PERFECTLY at the top of my stairs. Install requires a bit of tweaking to get it to close well... but it works great... when it's open... you barely notice it exists... and when it's closed... very strong and hard to open for a child... and, in my case, pet.
B00HNRR2SQ|4|Watch https://youtu.be/DWfcK9vbG18 for in depth detail, demonstration and explanation. It does the job. My baby will fall asleep quicker when swaddled. He is a pretty strong four month old and breaks out of a traditional blanket swaddle. With this one, he has to try harder and sometimes doesn't get out. However, he is only 17lbs, and the Large Swaddleme on their website said it is good up to 20 lbs. I have a very difficult time connecting the velcro on the final flap; it barely touches even after readjustments. I don't want him to be squeezed too tightly. He is transitioning out of being swaddled but I still want to use this when I can. The velcro is very loud, and when I'm trying to put him to bed it sometimes stirs him awake when I have to unvelcro it. Two is recommended in case there is an accident like pee, then you have a back up for the rest of the night.
B00E0HOULO|5|Fit as expected. Excelent quality
B006ZBREJ8|5|My baby loves it.
B000QE87FK|5|I remembered this as a cherished toy of my son and I wanted to give that same joy to my grand niece.
B0051GH2ZO|3|I purchased this for my daughter's Graco Snugride carseat. I was disappointed with the lack of cradling and support it provided for my daughter's head. Her head would slip to the side and then forward when falling asleep due to the overall design. I hated to see her neck in full flexion when sleeping since that's a dangerous position in the case of a car accident. I removed the Snuzzler and she was able to better rest her head against the side of the carseat while napping- a much safer position for the head and neck.
B00008URU5|5|I love this potty!  I bought the graco soft seat and the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer, but my toddler would have nothing to do with them.  Not that the other seats are bad, he just didn't want to go on the potty.  When he saw this mini toilet with the flushing and paper holder he fell in love.  He started going on the seat all on his own the same day!  It is not wobbly as a previous review stated, I have it on my wood floor and it doesn't budge because of grips on the bottom.  It is simple plastic, yet is sturdy.  My toddler also doesn't pull it apart like he did with the Graco seat.  I say it is definately worth the $$$ if you have a hard to train toddler.
B007TB5GZ2|5|This purchase was a great because the pump came with extra parts and enough storage pods and bottles to keep you pumping for awhile! The pump works well and when the battery is fully charged it lasts a long time. Definitely recommend this pump!
B004BV7UOS|5|We bought this set two years ago for our then 6 month old.  It is perfect.  The cups have sippy lids, tight sealing lids (we carry milk in them and they have NEVER leaked, even travelling by bike), and snack lids that allow little hands to get at snacks but preventing big spills.  They have lasted, and the cups show no sign of wear after two years of daily use.  The only part that's looking a bit worn are the sippy lids that my son chews at.  It also came with two bowls and fork/spoon that are perfect for little hands.  I would HIGHLY recommend this for a busy family or as a gift for anyone with toddlers.
B00AAFUH3U|5|Love this wet bag. I use it for wipes and sippy cups and such so I don't spill stuff into my bag and ruin things such as my wallet:)
B001F4KLT0|5|Purchase this mattress and you can rest easy, knowing your precious baby is not breathing in toxic chemicals.<br />Used since daughter was born, and still in use 2 years later.  Non toxic, organic.  Will be sad when she grows up to a twin bed, but time marches on.  High Quality.  Recommended.
B00KF6YS7U|1|Bad mine broke right away
B0035ER5A6|5|It holds socks, mittens and bibs. Really usefull good product. I just put into my laundry and dryer. It can be holded from anything
B000WJLKQM|5|My granddaughter loves it.
B00JVM6STK|4|Very soft and cute. Fits my daughter up to 4 mo & 11lbs. Still fits but pretty tight now.
B00004C8S8|1|These child nail clippers are so safe they don't clip. They are extremely dull and completely useless.  I threw them away within minutes of trying them out.
B000XPWXK2|5|I love them. Easy to wash and use.
B00LZKBP2Q|5|Super adorable carrier and my 3 yr old LOVES it. :)
B009F98SSS|5|We opted against a diaper genie and have been using these bags for the poopy diapers and I literally don't smell the poo at all! And I take out the trash about once a week!
B004D6LO2U|5|I was skeptical at first because this item was expensive, however it is worth the money.  My baby no longer bumps her head on the wood sticks of the crib, instead she lands on the soft bumper which covers from top to bottom.  I love the colors and it looks really nice when put together with matching sheets.  I should have purchased it sooner instead of waiting until she was 5 months.
B0065JVATK|3|This lunch bag was VERY cute. However, the zippers were positioned kind of weird and the lunch bag itself was kind of small. It would be great for a child who does half day preschool and just takes a snack but we cannot use it too often for my full day preschooler who packs his lunch.
B004FN0ZBC|5|This base works great. So well, that we have 5 of them. One for each vehicle in the family. No messing with changing out bases when switching from one vehicle to another. Well made and easy to use. Simple installation and durable.
B000056JHN|1|I bought this item when I was 20 weeks pregnant and excitedly tried to find the baby's heartbeat every week until I delivered at 37 weeks.  I never heard anything other than random gurgles and the occasional kick.  What was worse was that you had to hold a button down the entire time, and if you flexed your fingers or moved in any way, all you could hear was that movement.  And you couldnt hear anything if there was any other noise such as a fan, or anyone talking, or even a plane flying overhead.  Dont waste your money or your time.
B002Q0Y8QO|5|I shopped around in Canada for this carrier, and it was $130 + tax. Definitely worth it to buy on Amazon for half the price. Very easy to put on (compared with the active or synergy carriers in the same brand) and the material is fabulous.
B00IOGIO5U|3|Doesn't fit flat, baby can pull tray up. But worth the $10.00
B00CJIK754|5|I am using this to get my 17 month old out of our bed and into his own.  I put it in the section of our bed he sleeps in and turn it on, I moved it to his toddler bed next to our bed and he takes naps there instead of on me or in our bed. Next step is to keep him in his bed with this in place all night.  I think it makes the shift easier since it is the constant variable that reminds him of sleeping in our bed.  I think it is well made and will last a long time -- I wish we had had it with our daughter!
B00QA3VXR0|5|so many pockets to keep things organized. Great &#34;hiking&#34; look so my husband can carry it. Although the straps are not comfortable like a regular backpack. I never have anything heavy in there so it isn't bothersome. Just an improvement that could be made.
B00PXV6GIG|5|great to protect items
B0012BWUDQ|5|Over the past year and a half my wife and I had a cheap seat that just went on top of the existing seat.  This was one of the &#34;elmo&#34; seats from a big box store with the foam padded seat.  At first it was great but over time it just ended up getting really gross.  The seat always smelled and was very hard to clean.  This is when I started searching around for something different.<br /><br />I found this seat and ordered it right away.  The shipping was Prime so it got to me when it was supposed to.  The packaging was great, no worries there.  The install is very straight forward and took me about 10 minutes to remove the old seat,clean the toilet, and then install the new one.<br /><br />Once the seat was installed it functioned as advertised.  The top of the seat is the lid for the training side of things.  It's light weight and easy to lift up.  This is important because we now keep it closed all the time and my three year old must lift it up when he needs to use the restroom.  The standard seat is a good size and actually quite comfortable.  It also has a non slam hinge on it so there isn't a loud bang in the middle of the night if the boy is trying to use it.<br /><br />I've had to do some touch up cleaning since I've gotten it (about a week now).  Really easy to clean and sanitize.  Much better the the Styrofoam sponge seat we had before.  The bathroom now doesn't have reminiscence of urine every time you walk into the bathroom.  Since this doesn't have a &#34;pee guard&#34; as I called it I had to make sure he tucked down when he used it.  Otherwise he may end up with some splashes under the seat that would make it to his pants.  The same thing that happens on regular toilet seats.<br /><br />As for the kid using it he did have to get used to it.  The seat is wider than his old seat so it took a couple times for him to get used to it.  But all in all it was a quick transition.  I have a one year old daughter right now that isn't potty training yet but it will be nice having this when she gets into the swing of things.  I wish I had gotten one of these a year and a half ago.t will be nice having this when she gets into the swing of things.  I wish I had gotten one of these a year and a half ago.
B0057LUMX2|5|Never believed these magnetic signs would stay on the car.  But they have now been there for months without a problem.  They are a little bit small, but plenty visible.<br /><br />But I've never been able to figure out where to put the batteries.  Just kidding.
B0072UPCEA|5|Great swim diaper for my 6 month old (about 15 lbs.) we used it every day on vacation last week and it worked perfectly.
B00008ODBG|4|Ok, ok, I will admit, a diaper wipe warmer seems like a bit much. When I first saw it in the store my mother and I laughed! She said babies today were going soft! Then my daughter was born, I would change her diaper and she would cry, and wet herself each time a chilly wipe would touch her backside. So, I buckled, and sent her daddy to by the Ultimate Wipes Warmer.<br />  Well, all I can say is that I am truely pleased with this warmer. It really does the trick! Now, when I change my daughter, there are no more tears and no more washing the changing table pad either!<br />  I haven't had any problems with the warmer burning on the bottom, like I have read in other reviews. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that most wipe refills they sell don't have a layered configuration for easy dispencing, so you have to lift the lid each time you want a wipe. But I really don't think that that is such a big deal. And I would buy this warmer again in a heart beat!
B00E3HLW2Q|5|Perfect gift for a friend's baby shower. So cute and soft!
B00A0ID90A|5|Easy to clean and fun for my child it took him three days to get used to it and be excited to go potty on his own
B00921MSUS|5|I use this diaper bag everyday and I love the compartments and find it very useful. Very satisfied, great product.
B0007V644S|4|These diaper disposal bags are very nice and the price is right. The scent is noticeable but not overwhelming. The plastic is thin but strong and is not obviously see thru (more of an opaque sort of transparency). The best part is the handles. These are sort of like small grocery bags with oversized handles. The bags can be hung up. I like to hang mine in the car to use as trash bags on trips. The handles also mean they can be easily and quickly tied to contain diaper messes. They are large enough to hold two dirty diapers plus wipes or 3-4 newborn or size 1 diapers. They contain odors well but for a really big mess that will be in a confined space, like the inside of a diaper bag, I would double bag. The only thing I don't like is the packaging. The box is like a sturdy version of the boxes ziploc bags come in. They can't really be put in a diaper bag unless they're in a small pocket or in another bag. They also tend to cling together when you're trying to get one out of the box. They'd be perfect if they came on a roll or in some sort of dispenser.
B00B0ZCC2I|1|Defective
B004Y3FLE4|4|Products good , waterproof as well. So far it's working and it's a gentle angle for the baby. Good buy
B00029HVH4|5|I can't say enough good things about this chair - it's so easy to use and it fits on just about any table.  It has long hook-on hook thingies so that it can hook onto tables that have obstructions underneath.  It all easily disassembles for cleaning, which is very important to me!
B001G4RWG4|5|These bottles are great.  They were suggested to my wife and me by the lactation consultant at our hospital.  Unlike other bottles that boast \\"reduced colic, gas, fussiness, etc.\\"  these bottle actually do what they say.  It's also a plus when your child drinks the formula/milk and doesn't end up wearing it!<br /><br />we had a friend that recommended Tommy Tippee, and they were horrible!  If you want an affordable bottle that works great, totally try these!
B001OC5UMQ|4|Pros: looks nice, good price, easy lock/unlock mechanism, easy install<br /><br />Cons: if you don't use the little cups that screw into the walls the gate can be pushed down without a crazy amount of force. Also, my 3 year old nephew came over and immediately figured out how to loosen the knobs that keep the gate in place.<br /><br />Overall, the gate works well for us. It's purpose is to keep our 1year old and our dog separated during times when I can't be monitoring without distractions, or when our dog needs a break :). We won't need to use it by the time our little one is old enough to figure out how to loosen it.<br /><br />The opening seems a little narrow but my husband and I are both pretty slender, so not a problem for us. We haven't screwed the cups into the walls yet to make it more secure. A heavy toddler (30-35 lbs) could probably knock it down as it is now. Our 20 lb little guy is safe for now.<br /><br />If you're looking for a walkthrough boundary gate that isn't going to see a lot of abuse, this gate is excellent. If you're trying to keep a determined three year old away from their favorite toys, you may want to get something more sturdy.
B00BI37EBQ|4|It is beautiful and well made. I would like to have seen some kind of a pad or such to keep the lid from coming down on little hands.
B0038IWHR0|5|Got It for my brother and sister and law whose dog passed away. They received it and she said her heart absolutely melted when she seen it! I didn't see it myself so I was worried what it looked like and asked questions but she said it was PERFECT  and not cheap looking like someone else claimed. I am very satisfied I ordered it!
B004GCJMO8|4|this wire holder worked well for us, concealing enough of the wire to keep baby away. it was easy to &#34;install&#34; (stick to the wall), and i would recommend it/buy it again if needed.
B0001NE340|3|I got this stroller as a gift. We began using it two months ago for my 8 month old. We loved it. it is great around the neighborhood when walking the dog and even in the mall. So much easier to lug around then the travel system. However, today as I took it out of my car and opened it up the seat bar totally broke, I know I am not that strong. its completely busted and now I have to buy a new one. Since we only got two months out of it I am hesitant about getting another one.
B002MN3JY2|3|I like that they're organic, but they're not very absorbent.
B002ARX6UC|5|It took a while to find a crib that my husband and I both loved.  This is a beautfiul crib and does not take long to put together - only 1 1/2 hours...not bad as the last crib we bought took us 2 1/2!  The color is a beautiful chocolate color, not black so it can still go with a lot of the darker brown furniture.  The drawer underneath is HUGE.  Also, great to note, the screws that support the mattress are very easy to access when you need to lower the mattress.  This is very nice as the other crib we own for my older son you have to almost be in the crib to undo.  Last, the bolts used to put this crib together are very long and overall this crib seems to be very sturdy!  VERY happy with this product!
B007QZRCL2|4|So far, it's been pretty useful and I havn't had any problems with it.  I leave one in the diaper bag and one at home.  They're a little small, but it gets the job done and it makes food prep so much easier. If i'm on the go, I just wipe them off after use. At home, i just wash them and place in the drying rack.  Havnt had any problems with rust. Definitely a cool tool for the diaper bag!
B0000CBGBS|5|My daughteris 10 months old and when she was born, she was 6 weeks premature and was extremely colic.  The first week I did not know what to do.  There was no way to make her comfortable. Then one night I took out the bouncer seat, put my daughter in it and amazingly she was comfortable and was able to digest her bottle without sever pain and crying.  Then from that day on after every bottle, instead of laying her down during the day to sleep and rest I would put her in the seat and she loved it. She would laugh and was a whole differnt baby. As she got older I would put her in it to play with her toys and again she loved it. When she out grew it I was so said, because she really did love to relax in it and play.  I would recommend this product to every mom to be.  It helped my daughter though rough days and nights, which made everyone happier.  This is a must buy product.
B00027ZMDQ|5|This tape is great; this price isn't. I purchase this regularly at local stores for $4.99 and even less when I use a %-off coupon. Guess it pays to check prices and not assume this site has the best...
B005NK10E2|5|We use this a a second camera to our baby monitor. We love Levana a they make great products. I had trouble paring this camera and thought I would have to return it, but a day after I requested to return I not only got an email response on how to trouble shoot the problem but also received a phone call from the people of Shoptronics. This is a rare trait in a seller now a days.
B00NJ3G4BE|5|I've never written a review on amazon before, but I was so happy with this purchase that I needed to share my satisfaction with this product.  I was using the ready-to-use formula bottles with my six month old baby, but it was getting way too expensive for us. My baby has reflux so we switched to Enfamil AR powder formula, but I needed a plan to travel with the powder and bottles.  I was looking for something that would be fast and convenient for me to use on a daily (hourly) basis. That's when I saw these amazing tubes. Gotubes are easy, convenient and they'll save you money. The funnel is so easy to use, the tubes are durable and I'm done prepping the diaper bag in under 5 minutes. When my baby's hungry?  I just pour two tubes in his 8 oz bottle and shake away. He has his food in under 10 seconds. People always stop and ask me what interesting tubes I'm using for the baby's formula, too! I gladly explain to them of my brilliant find on amazon. Most older parents tell me wish they had this around when they were feeding their babies, too!  If you know anyone who is looking to formula feed, send them some gotubes. Take it from this first-time- mommy, she/he will love it!  Thanks again, gotubes!
B00JRYS31I|1|Under stroller hood has Yellow stains the air vent Flap the velcro don't even up for you to attach it to stay down
B001L2SA6M|5|I love these. They come with a case to keeping the pacifiers clean. The design is simple but Avent insures the quality is great.
B004RQSO6K|4|love these light color bibs and its easy to machine wash and dry clean. best of all it goes well with all boys clothes!
B00HT6E6GW|5|I have a love hate relationship with my Diaper Genie. I love that I don't have to carry dirty diapers into the kitchen to throw away every single time. Our diaper changing station for my daycare is in the toyroom. However, I HATE the smell when you open it up to throw away a diaper. Smells awful. And we change a lot of diapers so it gets emptied a lot.
B0032KDSYA|3|The fabric had a weird smell. The colors are not as bright as they seem. They actually had that old looking fading color. It works for me since I will be adding brightness to the nursery wit hother items. Also it's very easy to put together.
B00014PLAY|4|My 19 month old learned about 3 weeks ago that he could climb out of his crib, even with the mattress at the lowest level.  Not only were we afraid that he would hurt himself getting out of bed in the middle of the night, but bedtime was a nightmare and no one in our house was getting any sleep!!  I found this tent but didn't want to spend this much on it.  After a couple weeks of no sleep, I gave in, and I'm SO glad that I did!!!!    It took some adjustments to get the tent to fit my crib, but I was determined to make it happen.  After about 1 hour and 3 elastic tubing bands, it was structuraly sound.  The back of our crib is higher than the front, so that took some work...the velcro bands in the front were a little short and needed an extension, which was an easy fix, and the tent in general seemed about 4 inches too short for our crib.  But I just worked with it until it looked and felt secure.  It was also a chore to get the mattress back in the crib, and I'm not looking forward to changing the sheets, but all that being said the security that I feel knowing my son isn't wandering around the house in the dark and the fact that I can sleep again make it worth the inconvenience!!    The first night was rough on him, but we're on day 3 and he has gotten used to it.  He's actually slept better at night, napped better during the day, and just seems more comfortable in his crib with the tent.  I don't know if it makes him feel safe and cozy or what, but it's working!!!      If you're having a problem keeping your toddler in bed, don't hesitate to buy this.  The worst that will happen is that you can't make it fit like I did, and you can return it.
B004Y9AKZI|5|This has really helped to keep our little one corralled while we are getting ready in our bathroom. It is a great space saver.
B0064CTIC4|5|This is just the cutest and perfect little thermometer out there. I love the color changes with the temperature. It is a big help
B00L8JIO4G|4|great gate, super easy to set up. but i ordered 2 and both were damaged.
B00ONGIU90|5|My daughter is super adorable in this. She seems to like it very well. Not fussy to get out or anything of that nature.
B002J4U8PW|5|This worked great for us on our cruise.  We used it when my son was 9 months old to entertain him during the long dinners.  It stuck to the tables in the buffet and on the dining room tables when we slid the table cloth up.  Some Carnival ships (with the &quot;new&quot; dining) have smooth topped tables.  It won't work on most cruise lines because they use the banquet style tables which are not smooth.  This product needs a smooth, nonporous surface to stick to.
B0028RY9CI|4|We bought these for the Evenflo classic glass nursers. We used the glass bottles without these silicone covers for about 6 months and never had one break, crack or chip. But when our daughter started daycare, they asked us to use silicone covers with our glass bottles.     We did notice that the bottle has a \\"softer\\" landing when we drop them or when they hit against each other in the bag. No more glass on glass clanking.     Cons:  Hard to get on the bottle. It does not \\"slide\\" on and off. It has to be forced on and off.  Makes it more difficult to read markings on the bottle. The silicone is translucent but the Evenflo markings are imprinted in the glass (no colored markings) so these make it difficult to read.     Pros:  Fits Evenflo glass bottles perfectly. The large siliskin fits the 8 oz Evenflo.   Pretty, the gray is more of a sea glass green then a gray-gray.  Protects bottle  Sturdy and long lasting    Neutral:  Easy to hold - the product description advertises it as easy to hold but  don't think it adds to that, nor does it take away.
B000E0P1ZU|5|I bought this stroller for my grandson.  He is only 3 weeks old, but we have already gotten so much use out of it.  I love the removable car carrier and the stroller folds up flat for storage.  The stroller also has so many compartments for purses, diaper bags, etc.  I'm glad I got this stroller.
B000YDDF6O|5|The music is great and the baby I gave it to really loved it.
B000S6O6R4|1|We did not like this swing and here is why:<br />1.) Didn't seem to move quickly or well.<br />2.) The angle of the seat just didn't quite seem right. Our son always seemed slumped and uncomfortable. He never liked being in this swing.<br />3.) The music got annoying.<br /><br />Spring for the larger, more expensive swing that swings both ways. It really makes a difference!
B0041EDIDC|5|Good size for Toddlers 3T, very good quality, no issues and good price we are very happy with the purchase.
B000G80T7U|1|WHEN I RECEIVED MY ORDER I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.   BECAUSE IT WAS ABSOLUTELY BROKEN INSIDE OF THE PACKAGE.   WHEN THEY PACKED THE ITEM THEY DID NOT PACK WELL.   I HAVE RETURNED & REQUESTED REFUND ABOUT THIS BUYING....
B00EAD7LF0|3|Very cute.  Some of these stickers took up the paint when moved, but overall worth the money.
B000YDDF6O|3|Heavy
B00J40DRQG|3|I really like the design and idea, but it fell a bit short of expectations.<br /><br />For the price, perhaps I shouldn't have expected it to be any better. My issue is that it is nowhere near loud enough, and even with the low levels it has, the pitiful speakers rumble and wobble. The timer features work fine, though after fiddling with it I left it on continuous. I couldn't figure out how to use only the nightlight feature (pleasant orange), so I just turned the volume down and I use it as a night light. I bought a different, much louder noise machine. I enjoyed the alarm feature for the morning, but it seems that, if you let it play through its time it doesn't come on again the next day? Not sure if that was why, but my baby and I enjoyed the music and let it play until it timed out, and the next day we got nothing. I really wanted this to be the solution for getting my little one to stay asleep at night, but it just isn't up to the job, even right next to her crib.
B00938R0XA|5|This thing is awesome. Came with all of the necessary hardware and was very easy to install. I couldn't imagine not having one of these while using a trainer potty and cloth diapers. Highly recommend a diaper sprayer not just for cloth but also trainer potties.
B003HKQ8FQ|5|Very Pleased with this product.  I am so happy about the price.  Hooded towels can be very expensive so I was very pleased with the products.
B006ZVV0NO|3|I thought that this would have silicone things to hang this on the window but it didn't. It is supposed to cling like a window cling, and that would work if you never fold it back up for storage or if it didn't come folded up in a package. It doesn't flatten out and then it won't really stick on my window. Kind of a bummer.
B00OE5X4PA|5|They look great!
B0035LLG2W|4|It's okay
B001XUQXUW|2|this is very cute. i really like the idea of using it to store diapers. the downside is that you can only put about 4 diapers in each section ( so the whole thing holds about 12 ) beacuse if you try to put more than that in there the velcro will not stay.  i also found that the ties stretch out overtime, making it hard for the organizer to stay put.  you definitely cannot store anything remotely heavy in it.
B004IYNIFS|5|Love everything about this.  Love the color, love how light it is, we travel with it bring it everywhere.  I love that it comes with a cupholder and that it reclines.  My son is able to nap on the go if he needs to.  Only wish is that the bask et at the bottom was la little bigger and more practical (the best feature of the vista).  This has completely replaced our uppa baby vista.
B00AZWDK6Y|5|This is going to be a stocking stuffer for a 10 month old. She loves Minnie Mouse. Just right for little hands to fit inside the hole to get small snacks (like Cheerios) and have less chance of spilling them all over. Nicely made, durable. Now that she has it, my granddaughter loves this cup, she uses it every day.
B0009OLSZ8|5|I have a 2 year old in the potty training phase. I first potty we bought him was terrible, so I decided to try the Babybjorn. We ALL are so happy we did! It's a perfect potty chair. There are only 2 pieces and NO nooks to squeeze into to clean. it's very simple in design. It has a wonderful pee guard for my boy and he never gets the pee on the floor. He actually sits back a bit and watchs himself pee. I just love this potty for the ease of cleaning it. I just lift out the bowl, dump and rinse. It's good to go.At the end of the day, I just spray a little Clorox anywhere on it and let it dry for the next day. My son loves it, too. Its very comfortable and easy for him to use on his own. When we were doing the naked potty training (now we hav emoved to underwear! yah!) he was able to get to the potty and go all by himself without trying to get a lid off like the previous potty we bought. He would sometimes just sit there for a decent period of time just waiting. He was totally comfortable. LOVE this potty and we will be using it again with our second boy due in a few months.
B0013FGWD0|4|didn't like the idea of bumpers until my son moved from bassanet to his crib, his arms and legs would get stuck in the slats so i bought this, easy instructions to put it on, works like a charm, does it job, and keeps baby safe!
B001QFQR9Q|4|We purchased the maxi cosi mico as based on research on which infant seats are safe. We purchased the mico in phantom (black).<br /><br />At first our baby HATED the seat. But maybe babies hate car seats in general? The base is easy to install in the car, and at first I also had some issues getting the car seat to click into the base. Silly me, it turns out that the tightening strap was getting in the way. Once this was moved to the side or up into the seat the base clicked in no problem at all.<br /><br />Pros<br />Super light!! one of the lightest seats<br />Compared to e.g. Chicco, cotton seat cover = less sweaty baby<br />European design, sleek, lightweight<br />SAFE!<br />Cons<br />On the expensive side<br />Bit of a pain when you have to take the cover off to wash it. I couldnt get the bottom buckle cover back on again<br />The black seat gets H O T in summer. Summer covers are not available and the European accessories do NOT fit the US carseat.<br /><br />My baby is 90th % for height at 5 months...she is the height of a 10 month old. She also weighs 18 pounds. We will be moving her into a convertible seat way earlier than planned. Her feet are starting to poke out over the edge of the mico and is getting a bit heavy for me to lift comfortably (but that would be the same in any car seat)<br /><br />Overall: We love it, we would use it again and recommend it for others.  And now my baby likes the seat too.
B000K4YSZO|4|I don't understand the negative reviews about this product. My wife and I have been using it for almost a year now with our new daughter and I haven't smelled a single diaper oder! I have been called an \\"odor fiend\\" by friends for my sensitivity to bad smells and am diagnosed OCD and I notice no difference between the ambient smell of our nursery and any other room in the house. If you ever see this product on the store shelf compared to the other diapering solutions you can tell it is a superior product just by the way it is constructed.    If odor control is your main concern this is the diaper pail for you. The carbon filters completely eliminate the smell. I don't understand the complaints about the diapers not \\"falling\\" into the pail. The lid has a \\"push down\\" device that pushes the dirty diaper into the pail when you close it. Clearly this is designed so very few odors escape the pail while you are putting a diaper in. If you install the bag and plastic holder piece properly there should be no issue. If these reviewers wanted a pail they could just sling a diaper into they should use their trash can and deal with the smell. I think this device does exactly what it is intended to.    The lid does makes a loud \\"popping\\" sound when you shut it and I'll admit that is a problem at 3 AM. This is a part of the airtight seal. Personally I'd rather have a good seal than a quiet pail. Other than that I can see no downside to this product. Other reviewers have complained about not having an AC plug and I can understand that but we are getting about 4 months of use out of a set of batteries so I really don't think it is that big of a problem. Those issues alone make it a 4 STAR instead of 5 STAR review.
B0080DV0KS|3|We bought the Car Seat Adapters to easily attach Chicco Keyfit 30 carseats to our City Select.  Overall, the item worked as advertised, although, in reality, it's essentially a simple bracket and has no click function or any special mechanism in terms of attaching to the car seat.<br /><br />At around $60, I'd say the simple adapters are also expensive.  You'll likely only use them until the child outgrows the car seat and even in use, the car seats on the City Select make a bulky and large stroller.<br /><br />As another option, we ended up looking closely at the Babytrend Snap N' Go and have grown to like it much more than the Baby Jogger car seat adapters.  The resulting package is much lighter, easier to manuever, and around the same ballpark price range.<br /><br />In tne end, we love the City Select, but it's best when you use the native seats.  Attaching Chicco Keyfit 30 works, but it will be much larger, cumbersome, and less convenient than what we've grown to find with a Snap N' Go.  [[ASIN:B000BMKEVC Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller]]
B00171WXII|5|I know it seems gross, but it works so much better than the bulbs, and with those tiny nostrils I always worried the bulb was being shoved up there too far.<br /><br />My husband claims that it made us sick from time to time, but it sure did help get all that mucous out of their nose!
B00JFUN6WK|5|Great toy, my daughter loves it!  Great to deal with replaced the item right away when it stopped working. Can't say enough good things!<br />Love it.
B00155ZVW6|3|Like everyone else, I had old Avent bottles that I was unwilling to use. These Gerber bottles seemed like the perfect answer and sooo much cheaper! However, they come with medium flow nipples which is obviously too strong for a young baby. No problem, right? Well I can't find Gerber slow flow nipples anywhere, so I have to buy Avent. Then that means I have to use the Avent rings too (I don't think the Gerber rings work as well with the Avent nipples). Fine, but what about the people who don't have old Avent bottles. Are they just out of luck? Plus, after 9 weeks of use and only handwashing, all of the numbers and ounce markers are wearing off. I am very rapidly regretting my purchase. I have a few new Avent bottles that work a lot better. I should have just made the investment rather than waste my money on bottles that won't hold up and don't have any selection for nipples.    Oh, and FYI, these bottles do not attach very well to the Avent pump conversion kit. Not that they should have to since it's a Gerber product, but it's a fight trying to screw the bottles on.
B000VZKGYY|5|My 2 1/2 has been using this every night since she was 1.  She loves to play a game of- find the moon.  We had to get a new one a few months ago, because the light either burnt out or somehow we broke the insides of it..... she hit it on the ground a couple times.
B004KFUWAO|5|Turned out great. Was easy to apply and remove.
B00AAJNHA6|5|Bought this for my son to use with my first granddaughter!! It took some time to learn how to work it, but I was told it is wonderful! Delivery and all was super. No problems as of yet and hope there won't be any. Thanks so much!
B001EPE4B6|5|Got this for our daughter when expecting first baby-she loved it.  Everyone at the shower loved it.
B00IPYS032|2|Scuffed up, covered in scratches and black marks. Was a Christmas gift and I was embarrassed to give it. Also found it at big lots for a fraction of the cost. I totally got suckered on this purchase. Oh well, can't win them all.
B0055R6AYS|5|item arrived as described. It's in a good quality. compared with the old one i had, it's super-light, super-thin, and so easy to handle it. My girl and I love it.
B00E3RKC36|5|Easy to fold up and travel with and baby loves it.The safety strap has a cute cover so not to rub babies skin
B005G3QSF2|5|We are so happy with our Kozii!! Great product. We have been using it for 6 months now and it works like a charm.  Saves on time and water. Easy to clean.  Definitely highly recommended.
B00PTL87R8|5|They are stronger than the picture shows
B00FB5JE7E|4|Wonderful car seat. The only reason it doesn't get a 5-star rating is because i don't feel like the harness tightens as much as it should, but I am comparing it to the Britax Marathon-70 (the harness on the Marathon tightened more then the Pioneer)
B004JU0H6O|5|Fit perfect in my baby's koi pink play yard :)
B00P5USESU|5|This is awesome for dining out - a true clean area for toddler to eat from.
B00PH1VMZE|5|This is super cute!  I got one for my baby shower and have bought them for many friends since.  It's a total hit a baby showers, if you want to be the one whose present gets the biggest &#34;ooh,&#34; &#34;ahhs&#34; and &#34;how cute!&#34;, then buy this.  Moms go nuts for it!  It's so soft and my son still uses the blanket (as a blanket) even though we no longer swaddle him.  I'd highly recommend this.  There is also Lil Sushi and Lil Eggroll that are just as much fun!
B00M0Z3IEI|5|Very cute diaper...I love it!  It's very absorbent and well made.  This is an all-in-one (AIO) diaper...it's not clearly described on this website.
B000MPQY6W|3|Bought for a two year old who is really into puzzles.  Good puzzle to interact with but would be better if the peices were a little more sturdy.
B003TPPZYO|3|Great for putting fruits in, but it's a headache rinsing our the bits, especially bananas.  I end up having to literally pluck and scrap every little bit, while rinsing under the sink.  After a few uses, I give up and throw it away.  Maybe it's designed that way, but seems wasteful.
B004V8VR8Q|1|This one can not get to stick anywhere. It's too bad quality stick because is on the floor all the time, or in the worst case scenario pop out in my baby face. Not recomended.
B000O3GCFU|5|Fantastic!  Really keeps food hot.  I got this for my daughter to take to preschool with a warm lunch on cold days.  I followed the suggestion to first pour in boiling water and then empty it right before putting in hot food.  Then I started to get notes home from school that her food was too hot.  So I stopped doing the boiling water first.  For me, I'd do the boiling water, though.
B001M2D76O|5|Recieved today, fast service was very excited to get as we needed another nipple like this one. You have to order these type of nipples online.They are a special nipple that you cant get in discount stores/ drug stores. etc.
B006Z2BZAQ|4|My daughter like to jump on it. But I don't know why after few months of sleeping on it, the center looks dent in.
B0012S9D4S|5|great for kids
B00DRANVJC|5|Love it! We can easily strap this in with the baby in her carseat and it keeps her pacified!
B001NI95AE|4|Maybe a bit of a splurge for a single onesie, but it was an adorable presentation and a fun little gift for a baby due on Christmas Eve. The mom-to-be thought it was great.
B00CE422AG|5|***10-27-2014 update*** It has been about 14 months since I started using this pump. And I am still completely satisfied. As an extended breastfeeder now, I am still amazingly able to pump milk for my little one. That was not possible with my first child when I was using the Medela pump. The Medela lost suction around the 10 month mark and I could not pump any extra milk. The suction on the rumble is amazing, it still pumps like the first day! I am incredibly happy with my decision to go with the Rumble Tuff, I would never go back to a Medela after this. And yes, I am still utilizing the Kiinde system with absolutely zero issues. Also noteworthy, I am still using all of the original pump parts. I have not had to replace a single piece. I highly recommend the Rumble pump as well as the Kiinde system for storage.    First, I did not purchase this pump via Amazon, my insurance covers breast pumps and I had to order through their authorized third party.    With my first child, I used the Medela advanced pump in style. After less than a year of use, the Medela lost suction and started to make a strange clicking and grinding noise and I could barely pump any milk at all. I called their customer service and they were less than helpful. They told me the noise was \\"normal\\" and I must just not be making much milk anymore. I was beyond frustrated, as I knew that my milk supply was fine. I packed the pump away in it's bag and stored it away.    I had my second child at the beginning of August. As with all insurance, there was a delay in getting the pump delivered, so I ended up renting a hospital grade Medela pump for a month. The hospital grade worked fine, and I was able to increase my milk supply. I had to return the hospital grade pump a few days ago.    So I am comparing the rumble tuff to the two pumps listed above. I set up the Rumble Tuff, READ THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL, and sterilized the parts. After reading the manual, the pump design makes a lot more sense. I cannot believe how well this little unit works! I actually had to turn the expression wheel way down to a 3, and on the three setting I pumped 5 ounces in just over 6 minutes FROM ONE SIDE! In the month that I had the hospital grade, (which I did use the night before returning which was just one night before using the Rumble) the best that I could pump with the Medela hospital grade was 3 to 3 1/2 ounces in 15-20 minutes from both sides. I am sold!    Pro's:  -Super cute design, compact and very portable  -In no way does the pump itself or the accessories look or feel cheap, the Medela pump in style has a very cheap looking design in comparison. The Rumble shields and accessories are made from very durable plastic just like the Medela accessories. I do not prefer the silicone shield insert, so I do not use them.  -Functionality: I can pump way more in half the time! Efficient and a time saver! *as a tip, make sure that you are setting up the shield pieces correctly also known as, read the manual. Also important, I have found that I just need to make sure my breast and nipple are correctly sealed on the shield, so make sure you just push your breast a little bit further into the shield than you normally would a Medela shield.  -I love that this pump has a backflow prevention design. Medela advanced pump in style does not have this. The hospital grade does have backflow. Backflow prevents milk residue from entering the tubing and making it's way into the unit. I am going to bet this unit will not lose suction like the medela pump and go! Also, you don't have to worry about bacteria or mold issues due to the backflow design.  -The LCD display is great, I know how long I've been pumping without using my cell phone or a clock, and I can also see what time it is.  -With this pump, I achieve let down in 10 seconds or less. With both Medela products it would take at least 45 seconds or more.  -I use the Kiinde bottle and storage system with the rumble. Kiinde products can be found at buybuybaby, and the system is such a time and milk saver! Essentially, the Kiinde allows you to use an adapter so that you can attach their milk storage bag to the shield. The bag doubles as storage and a bottle! When you want to feed, you snap the bag into the Kiinde bottle (sort of like the playtex bottles) and you attach the Kiinde nipple and feed straight from the bag saving you time and spilled milk.  -The pump remembers my settings from the last pump, so I don't have to turn the dial up or down from some arbitrary default setting. It also has a memory function for your pump preferences (so it can remember how quickly your let-down occurs and switch from the swift expression mode to the natural expression mode). I have not used this function yet, but it's nice to have for when I am ready.  -Obviously, the price. They package a lot of suction power in this little pump, more suction than a 250 or even 1500 Medela pump. (Just an FYI, ANY PUMP used in battery mode does not work as well as using an outlet, I had that issue with my Medela)  -This pump comes with a manual expression kit, which can come in handy in a pinch. Medela pump in style does not. End of story.    Cons:  -Yes, the bag is a little gimicky. However, again, look at the cost difference between Medela and Rumble. Go buy yourself a $10.00 bag for pump transport, or do what I am doing and just reuse the Medela bag. For now, I am using the Rumble bag to store my pump accessories next to my glider in the nursery.  -The unit is noisy. It rumbles (probably hence the name) and it does beep. However, I will happily take the rumbling and beeping if it means I can express more milk and not have to be attached to a pump for so long.  -The issue with accessories. Yes, I do wish they were available in stores or on Amazon. However, all you have to do is contact customer service (I did) and they will email you a parts and price list and you can order them via email or phone. Easy.  -Yes, the tubing is a little short. But we are all spoiled by Medela's super long tubing. That being said, I have had no issues with the tubing, I am used to the length now and it's not that bad. I do not multitask when I pump, I am just focusing on making sure I produce enough milk for storage. Not to mention, I am not attached to the unit for very long now, which is a huge plus. 6 minutes per pump out of my day attached to short tubing is really not a big deal for me.    Take a chance on this product. I did, and have absolutely no regrets. No, it is not set up like a Medela product so it does have a different feel, but the Rumble is by far a superior product. I do plan to update this review in 6 months and again at a year to evaluate performance.
B00BWIOHSU|2|I got this for my niece, she loves Brobee and his long floppy arms.  It's a nice enough pillow toy but his arms are permanently sewn to his sides most of the way down! The long arms are the reason my niece loves Brobee...a bit disappointed but she'll probably still like it.  I was hoping it would've been more true to character.  Maybe my crafty mother or sister can undo his arms and still make him look good.
B0078X9RKG|5|I bought this for my baby to come soon and it's very cute. It's a very good deal considering what other sites are charging for the set. You certainly have a choice in colors for the nursery if you are using the colors from the set. I did the nursery in orange which I love and it all fits well together.
B00004S7MV|5|My Great Grandson was thrilled to receive his own dishes of Thomas and Friends. I'm so glad I found them on line and could send it to him for his 4th birthday.
B0015DIMQA|3|I absolutely love the pictures on this plate.  However, the new, non smooth surfaces on high chairs just don't seem to accept any of the suction products in the market these days.  We have tried a number of them and so far have not had much luck.<br /><br />Sadly, the plate did break after a swift toss from our 1 year old. I won't buy another because while I love the images I just can't justify buying another knowing it breaks so easily.
B0000645DP|4|Despite other reviews, we think the monitor works great!  There are two channels, A and B.  As long as you have the monitor and receiver at the same channel is works great.  We had a cheaper monitor initially and the static was horrible, but now that we have this one, we can hear our children anywhere in the house or outside.
B003HS5JMQ|4|Granddaughter @ 2 loved it. She still uses it for preschool .
B00ODV8FKY|5|This is really awesome product. Density of the cushion is very good and it's very easy to apply on all types of edges whether it's table edges or wall corners.
B000YZCFWW|2|We decided to get this booster for our little one because she hates sitting in cheap restaurant high chairs. The straps broke the first time we tried to mount it on a chair. We thought about returning it but then figured hey, it's only [...], maybe we can just fix it. So, I took out my sewing machine and sewed the straps back on so now its functional. I noticed the threads they used were very cheap and fine, not for heavy duty materials, and the seams were loose on all the straps. So, make sure you have a sewing machine handy to reinforce the seams. I give it 2 starts for poor quality. It goes without saying, you get what you pay for....
B00CWN3FNM|5|We got this as a hand me down from a friend. Our 1 month old son has fun with tummy time, and when on his back he tries to grab and hit the hanging toys.
B002R7Q7ZG|5|my daughter is 30 months and I decided to get this for her, she loves to play in water and wash her hands all the time. Now she can reach the sink on her own and be more grown up every day.
B00451ACTO|3|When we opened the box to put the dresser together we found a crack in one of the inside pieces. There was scratches on the outside and some of the holes were not drilled. Because of the holes not being drilled some of the pieces cannot be tighten like they should be. I bought this as a shower gift for my daughter and have to say I was disappointed
B001IY4MUQ|5|This crib netting was exactly as described in the ad. It fit the crib with room to spare! I was able to cover the entire crib all the way to the floor with ease.  The only negative was that it ripped easily but I was able to repair that with just a few stitches. Overall, an excellent product that did exactly what it was designed to do and it was reasonably priced.  I would definitely buy this again.
B00KFMVOFI|4|cute
B00FB5MWRI|2|DONT BUY! This stroller is extremely bulky. Can hardly fit through standard doorways. Takes up all the space in a trunk. Difficult to maneuver.  Heavy once car seats are in it. Very durable, but very awkward in moving about. Much too big.
B0015R2AWI|5|Thank you very much and received the package in perfect condition and we are very satisfied and happy with the products
B006QHCQAI|5|This is a solid.  I would of used it more, but got the wrong connector.  I needed connector 2 not three.  I guess I should of reader which stroller it connects too.  Oops.
B001CWN692|5|Perfect fit for toddler mattresses.  Cotton quality awesome and has held up well with many washings.
B00PVZAR8Y|3|I'm not a big fan of this hook and loop closure when the end of the diaper fold over it tends to hit my little one in the stomach which looks painful.  As far is wetness it is a good lead blocker but I prefer the snap version of this diaper.
B00PTL2AVC|4|Daughter loves the cup holder. It gets deeper as the child grows so the front seat keeps getting pushed up farther.

B000HIP352|5|This kneeler is great - especially if you have hard tile floors and a toddler that doesn't like to take baths!  My knees were killing me so I decided to purchase this.  It is so comfortable and you can store the shampoo and body wash right in the pockets.  It folds up and attaches with Velcro so you don't have to worry about it taking up space on the floor when you are done.  Wipes clean and absorbs water.  Never had a problem with mold or smells.
B004GCJN7O|5|Great product
B00214WYOI|4|I actually bought this as a toybox for my dog since he chewed up  his last one. This is solid, well made and arrived quickly. It is a bit small overall for what I wanted, but they did list the dimensions accurately online, I simply failed to properly measure!
B00HAN29QI|5|I'm an ED doctor and mother of a 3 y/o who had a chance to evaluate this product before it was available to the public.  Great product especially for little ones who get fevers, ear infections and the like and simply can't won't cooperate with medication administration.
B009EDSWJA|4|So far my 2+ month old loves this pad. For some reason we have our best &#34;conversations&#34; here. It's comfortable for him and seems durable. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't know yet how durable or long lasting it will be. I will give it 5 stars at a later date if it holds up. Overall, great product!
B00J7ICKA4|3|This little baby monitor works quite well. It's the 4th such monitor I've used and in the end I've been as happy with the LorexBaby as any I've tried. The app (only tested on an iPhone 5s) is a bit fussy, but once set up works well. If you don't get it working right away stick with it a bit and you'll get there. The angle of view is about right for my use but some people might wish for a bit wider view. The image quality is nothing special, but enough for it's intended purpose. I have found the night vision feature (which only works in SD mode) to be less that perfect, but I use the camera to look at a whole room and the LED IR lights have a hard time filling a room. Up closer (if the camera is setup to look into a crib for example) it would work very well. There are a lot of options in this category now and while the LorexBaby Little Link HD doesn't shine, it holds it's own nicely.
B0013FGWD0|5|My baby wasn't sleeping through the night because he would crawl around the crib... He would wake me screaming so I would check on him and his arm or leg was caught in the rails... The pediatricians push not to use bumper pads but I had to do something and this was a great safe alternative!!!... You can see through it and it's very easy to put on... I have washed it several times and it's still in great shape!
B000056OV0|5|After seeing this product and reading all of the reviews I purchased this for my daughter who was expecting her first babies, Twins.  After seeing how this bath holds the baby, I thought that this would be great not only for one baby but for two.  I felt that when you have twins there would be many times that mom would have one baby in the tub and have to possibly quick do something with the other one.  Also, when they were older this tub would be big enough for them to sit in together.  Well, I was not wrong and my daughter loves this tub.  They are not old enough to sit in together yet (5 months) but they can lay safely and kick and enjoy the water without someone holding them up.  They even had their cousin (2 yrs old) take a bath with one of the twins.  This tub is large but this makes it a tub that wll be used for years to come.  All of my daughter's friends that have seen this tub all want to get one.   I don't think you can go wrong with this.  It also has a drain hole on the bottom so you don't have to lift the tub to drain.  It is hard to see in the picture that on the opposite side there are indentations for little cheeks to sit up when older or for an older child to take a bath with a smaller baby.  I don't feel you can go wrong with this tub.  Come on all you grandmothers and buy one of these. Your grandchildren will love it.
B00PF84AM6|4|I'm not thrilled about the nipple brush .
B0019IAIZO|5|Had an Under the Sea birthday party for my three-year-old daughter. We gave these out in the party favors. They were cute and the kids loved them. My daughter still plays with hers in the bathtub.
B002Q0YA30|5|Bought this one for our daughter because the ones that have lids she wouldn't sit on. She just wanted to play with the lid or make it sing. This potty is really easy to keep clean and easy for her to use!
B006PB2B6O|5|I like this better than the one my daughter bought that is part of a travel system. I feel the baby has more room and doesnt get as hot.
B001B1FHIC|4|My dgt was hysterical when it came to getting her hair washed. I've tried a few products by this was the best. She was a little hesistant with it at first but now she doesn't mind. It makes it so much easier for me.
B002XMRGMS|5|I have twin 1 year old boys. We purchased this booster and another booster that the seat inflates. They both seems to have their pros and cons so we wanted to see which one we liked better. After several uses we end up returning the other one and getting another one of these.  The solid base makes it very sturdy.  The legs in the bottom lift if up high enough so both boys can be comfortable at the table and see what is going on.  As they get a little bigger we don't have to use the pop out legs.  We haven't had issues with the T-straps yet but my boys are both on the small to very small side (21 lbs and 14 lbs.  The think I love the most is the storage.  I like to be prepared for everything, so I still tote their large diaper bag with use everywhere.  Since the boys are in different sizes and have different needs, I can pack the eating essential and a diaper change in each booster and keep the diaper bag in the car.  I can fit paci wipes, face wipes, butt wipes, two diapers, their spoon/forks, disposable placements, sippy cup, bib, and 2 diapers in each of them.<br /><br />They are still small enought that we can fit them in the basket under their stroller.  We don't use them full-time at home, but use them when we eat out on the deck.  They strap to the patio chairs perfectly.
B00HPD4V1Y|5|I bought these to save money and they are amazing. They wash easily in the dishwasher and I have not had any problems with it leaking. I have a 10 month, 3 year and 5 year old whom all love using them. I love that I can just open one and hand it to my 10 month old who can feed himself with no mess. Furthermore, I usually throw a couple empty ones in the diaper bag along with baby food jars, so if I am away from home I can open a jar and pour it into a pouch for easy, no clean up feeding. This is a great price for a wonderful product.
B00004D3EU|1|I bought this and rushed home to see how well it worked although at the time I was still 9 mo pregnant with no baby yet to bathe. I'm so glad I didn't wait until I needed to use it because I found this tub really difficult to use. The squares you push to slide the tub bigger or smaller wouldn't budge. I tried until I was exhausted and pinched my finger in it pretty bad!Then my husband managed to get it to move (with some difficulty himself)and once we got it extened neither of us could get it back to it's smaller size. The directions weren't the problem, the tub was. I wasn't at all impressed with the newborn sling either. I ended up returning it the same day with it hanging out one end of the box since we couldn't slide it to the smaller size. Overall, I think it was clumpsy and later found one alot cheaper that my son loved and it wasn't complicated to use.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Fits the door perfectly and is very easy to install and remove.
B00064NZQQ|5|My son got this gift from his Nana when he was 5 months old. The purpose was to have something to keep at her house so we didn't have to cart his Jumperoo, etc. when we traveled to vist. He loved it so much, that it ended up coming back with us and travels where we travel. I like that one side is electronic and the other is more hands-on, plus you can switch modes from a learning vs. fun mode, so that there is a lot of variety. Two volume modes come in handy as well. Now that my son is 9 months old, he does get bored much quicker, plus being that he is mobile, he doesn't really like the idea of being constrained. But it comes in handy now when I need both of my hands and I'm not comfortable leaving him in his room with the gate up (simply b/c he gets into everything). Me and my son would definitely give this product 2 thumbs up (see customer images). As to others commenting on hard to move back and forth and turning, the back and forth goes very easily the turning is a bit hard. However, we've found that when putting the seat cushion in you have to make sure it isn't caught in there the slightest bit otherwise it really makes it difficult to turn. Hope this helps.
B00E9RMHD8|5|My daughter bought a couple of $19-$40 monitors before I bought her the older Advent version (510) three years ago. She is a small farmer who needed to get work done but also be assured that all was well with baby when he was napping in the house. Whether in the barn, fields or greenhouse she is never 'out of range' as long as the batteries are well charged. She loves that she can clip it to her belt and that when she's using loud equipment the lights indicate when baby is awake. Three years later and with a second baby this monitor still functions perfectly.
B00005YYE3|2|When i selected a product I liked , were for a boy, because I have a son! received some cups for girl, I guess I'll have to wait for a girl birth to use the cups!
B00FSQUAZG|4|Love these super undies. But don't take my word for it...my potty-trained little girl is great during the day, but still has accidents at nap time and needs something at night. I was in love with using cloth diapers for her sensitive skin and hate the idea of buying disposables. However, my husband is not totally in love with the idea, but with the ease of use of these, he's coming around:) It definitely beats changing dirty diapers!
B001IXYOD2|5|If your baby is colicie, these are the best bottles to use. Within a day her colic was all gone
B001NAAQRI|5|OK, let me tell it to you straight: these are my favorite cloth diaper inserts of all time.  If I could do my cloth diaper shopping all over again, I would buy 5-10 packs of these.  THEY ARE AMAZING.  (Yup, amazing enough to justify a sentence in all caps.  That good.)  They are the most absorbent inserts I have found anywhere.  Put one or two of these puppies into your pocket diapers (or laid on top or inside of other kinds of cloth diapers) and you can go all night or for a longish trip out of the house, without a leak and without a change.  Finding these felt like a little miracle in my cloth diaper world.  I had thought night time cloth diapering would be hard or that going out of the house for a long time  (finding a changing room can be such a hassle...).  A lot of my friends gave up on cloth diapering because of these factors.  If only they had found these inserts.  Give them a try.  A true game changer.  Happy diapering...  :)
B007IQ9TG0|5|Great. I have been so glad we got several sets of these so many times. My kid likes to be rough, play with play doh and color/paint on the floor so these are a great way to protect him and my wood floors
B001OC5UNK|3|at first they worked wonderfully...... then after use they tend to get &#34;knocked out of place&#34; even with tightening them up..... and my 2 year old can actually get the thing to come off the wall by tugging back and forth on it. But the gate portion is nice and works fine.  Just securing it to the wider doorway isn't trustworthy.
B00012CHFI|5|I brought this sleeper for my sister in-law who has just had a baby boy. She absolutely loves it. Since coming out of the hospital she has only used this. I think the reason for this is because it is so light and easy to move.
B006VR14BA|5|Very soft!
B000W8TAEC|1|This crib was way too small. I only used it for four months when my son started rolling and bumping his head on the wood and waking up in the middle of the night. We ended up just using his pack n play until he was 18 months old. We live in a small condo and needed something that could be moved from room to room, I think the pack n play worked out better. Looking back (my son is now 2!) I would have just gotten a full size crib. It's worth it to keep them confined to a crib as long as possible!
B001ZT12T8|4|Usually I don't write reviews but for this product I need to write one. My son is 7 days old and I have about 20 oz saved up and I just started using it a few days ago. I usually put it on the non-nursing side when I'm feeding my son or even if I'm feeling engorged. The most I have got from the non-nursing side is 2 oz! I can't believe I would've wasted that if I didn't buy this product. This is a lifesaver because its too soon for me to start pumping but I still can build a supply for my son. I just wish it wasn't so open on the side where the milk can leak out
B005MR4A6G|4|These boot liners are for my grand daughter who wears a size 1 shoe. I ordered a sz. 1-2 so perfect and room to grow I thought but they were a little too small already. A little disappointing. But the liners are very nice and soft. Good quality. Just small.
B006SFUCV8|5|Easy to wash. Holds everything perfectly. Worth your money.
B007VBYVVA|5|They Work Fine
B001GQ2RXK|5|Love this product! I searched high and low for the perfect chair that my baby could grow into (after having a high chair that I hated) and I am so happy I chose this one. It is very portable for when I take my daughter to grandma's house, requires no extra room as it straps onto my existing dining room chairs, she plays with the toy tray attatchment and I can take the toy tray attachment off when I want to put snacks on the tray beneath. I pull the chair in the kitchen when I am cooking, throw some snacks on the tray with her sippie cup and she is good to go. As she gets older (she was 10 months when I bought the chair) it turns into a regular booster, the tray and seat back detach for older toddlers. It is also a breeze to clean. Very happy with this chair!
B00BNQEZZ6|5|Perfect for my baby
B00ESK08S2|5|just what i wanted!!! altough i was looking for something warmer for the winter!!!<br />next time try to offer warmer nautical outfit!!!
B000056JAZ|5|These containers are tops!  You can pump right into them, with the Avent Isis Pump, which is great, or with most other pumps (with the converter piece).  Then just stick the container in the freezer.  Exchange the sealing disc for a nipple and, presto, it's a bottle.  Add a handle and a spout instead of the nipple - it's a sippy cup.  And it is safe to use in the microwave.  And it does not leak, even when it's not upright!  And, thanks to the wide mouth, it's easy to clean.  The small size makes it easy to store, minimizes waste (very important when using breastmilk) and - for those who care - these containers are actually aesthetically pleasing.  I am very happy that I chose Avent bottles - they are well worth the extra money, as after six months of use they still look brand-new.  And if you ever need it, Avent customer service is even better!
B0002JETPQ|4|I have a 9lb yorkie who the gate works perfect for... and a friend has a 4lb yorkie who can fit through the gate rungs with ease. I didn't screw it into the wall I just put it between the fridge and the wall and put a pillow up against the other end to keep it up. Cheap and it practically comes put together. The wood was cracked at one part where the metal clasps hold the other piece of wood next to it but my boyfriend put some woodworkers glue and masking tape around it for about 48hrs and it holds beautifully now. If you're looking for a cheap gate for a large opening this is perfect for you!
B0031ARQKI|5|Great bed, sterdy and absolutely fantastic for its price...I highly recommend it. My son loves and I do as well.
B006V84JLG|5|Gud
B000WPBAVQ|5|I was looking for a collapsing gate to be able to set up around travel toddler beds/cots for my twins when we travel and for use at their Grandmother's house. This gate works great!  We have also used it outside to enclose the toddlers at playtime. It is easy to clean by spraying with a hose. It seems durable. Only ideas that could improve this product 1- ability to add more panels without buying another box of 6 or 8.  2- travel bag with handles to make transportation easier.
B001BTS0YW|4|This is a little larger than I thought it would be.  I don't let my 10 month old play with the snail, just the rings.  But I imagine that she will love it more when she's older.  The top sun toy is a &#34;squirter&#34; so there's a chance of mold.  I would recommend sealing it up with glue before putting it in the bath.  It seems to take DAYS to dry out.  The rest of the toy is great and I wouldn't expect any mold.
B004Q7QP7U|5|It's just darling in person.
B001FB5BHA|3|I bought this seat instead of the Graco Nautilus that has a similar weight harness. I wish that I had bought the Graco that I was able to see in person at the big mart store because this seat is way bigger. My 8 year old daughter sits in this and it looks like a mini lazy boy. I was hoping to down size from the big Britax car seat that my son was in but instead this is bigger. This seat is lighter weight wise but in size if you have a small car this would take up almost half the back seat, this seat is WIDE (and tall). I was able to get this for $50 less than I could find the Nautilus for, I don't know if the Graco is worth the extra money or not. I didn't think the Graco looked as nice as this but the size and quality seemed better.
B003BTXSCE|4|After reading other reviews I was nervous to purchase this product, but the price was attractive. I'm happily surprised with this product. It works as described but it does takes some muscle and coordination to fold it up after each use.
B00TGHX13G|5|I love these spoons! They arrived very quickly after I placed the order. My nephew is learning how to eat himself he is around 10 months old. These Spoons are easily held, and are smooth. He can scoop up whatever is it easily and without difficulty. My neighbor stole one she liked the color so much! And said her baby ( 4 months old) enjoys using it as well. It's a large enough size I don't have difficulty holding it with my hand size and neither does my new phew. Perfect for a baby a few months old until a couple years! Highly recccomend, great quality and purchase!
B00BXWTVJ0|5|Got this tub as a shower gift and we have used it every single day for the last 7mths of so... It holds up very well, provides proper support. The only thing is, out boy is growing out of it at 7mths so I'm sad to have to let it go. Trying to find another good 'transitional' tub before he is strong enough to sit up comfortably in the regular tub. I do recomment this product!
B001IXYOD2|5|Greatly reduced my infants gas and no more nipple collapse like my Medela bottles. Highly recommend.
B000S8O9ME|5|This fits just right on my tile wall while the shorter one was could not fit on 2 tiles without hitting the grout lines
B005555GL8|5|This bag is excellent for my cloth diapers. It keeps the stink at bay and is strongly constructed. I love the cube shape, so it can be hung up or set down. Highly recommended!
B001UF8BL4|5|This was a gift for a Toys for Tots organization so can not really comment on if it was liked or not
B001CB7I4W|1|Ripped and fell apart within a year- waste of money. We purchased the Carter's Easy Fit for our other daughter and it has held up well.
B003D8P4OI|3|This \\"organic\\" item  came packaged in toxic-smelling very thick plastic packaging.   I'm commenting on the packaging, since many people who choose organic do so out of a hope of having less impact on the environment.  Also, relatedly- there's pretty much no way of knowing if the product actually is organic:   It's imported, with no indication of how it was determined to be organic.    Regarding the item itself:   Note that it's for babies 10-15 lbs, so you probably won't be able to use it for a little while.  But otherwise, the sleepsack is fine--   it fits well and the zipper works well....   the fabric is a bit stiff though compared to others we've purchased.   The Halo sleepsacks seem to have softer fabric (both micro fleece and jersey type).
B00TGHX13G|5|These spoons are great, the shape is perfect for my 6-month old baby, and the heat-sensitive color-changing part is a good idea. Basically, if the spoons get too hot, the colored portion that gets hot becomes transparent. I was worried that the food sticking to the spoon might conceal the change but the difference is obvious. However, note that carrots will stain the colored part, but not the white part in the middle, so now my green spoon turns yellow when hot (because of the carrot stain) and not transparent. But carrots stain everything like crazy, so I'm not surprised... just don't use the yellow or orange spoon for carrots. :)<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to receive a bonus 5th spoon that look s different. Well worth the price, 5 stars!
B00LIRJ5H8|5|Didnt think this would be a good investment but it ended up being the best thing for my son...he loves it. This is NOT self rocking...you need to do it but it is great.
B001CRM60M|4|This was an adorable Halloween costume but very small like many of the reviews said it would be.
B004X8N1WY|5|we tried EVERY \\"sippy\\" cup out there...my son didn't want any part of them....<br />But this one was different.  The straw is really soft and the perfect length/size/shape.  He doesn't have to lift the cup up to drink.<br />We even tried other cups with straws (after we had success with this one) and he struggled...this one was a quick study (we showed him a few times ) and all of a sudden he got it!<br />i definitely recommend.<br />Oh, my son is currently 13 months and we are getting him a new one as he's worn this one out.  Has been using it since about 8 months.
B003E6OBMA|3|The cotton fabric is too loose and stretchy to get a good, snug swaddle. I also really wish there was a larger area for the velcro to stick to. My baby meets the weight and age specifications, but she's a long and slender kiddo so the swaddle wings wrap all the way around her back and have very little to stick to back there.
B001OC5UMQ|5|Ordered this from wish list for local animal rescue, so can't really review well, but sure they have used them before so they put it on their wish list.
B004GJXFYE|5|I had bought this product and I love the stuff it does and the color is awesome...and dislike there's nothing that I dislike about it as of right now and I don't think that there's going to be anything that I would not like about it....and I did recommend to my nice and she has gotten one but in blue...
B001C054Z8|4|I bought these for my son who is just starting out on rice cereal and we loved the fact that we could bend them straight for now while we are feeding him, and then when he starts feeding himself we can bend them to help him as he learns to use a spoon. He also liked the shape and feel of the spoon, as he is at a very mouthy time right now.
B00BPLW5AG|5|man, these are  useful!  we  use them in the freezer, in the fridge, in the kitchen  cabinets, in  the garage...
B006J2U4T0|2|I guess you get what you pay for. These work alright but started tearing in the wash after the second wash. I previously bought OsoCozy wipes and have been using them for over a year (they look exactly the same) and almost none of them have torn up with frequent washing (I use these as diaper wipes). I would never buy this brand again and would pay double for the OsoCozy that won't fall apart immediately. My mistake!
B007JY1L7G|4|I got this stroller a couple weeks ago.  It is great quality. Easy to put together. I actually put it together by myself, no help from my husband. One of my front wheels got broken during shipping. Customer service was great. They shipped me out a replacement promptly.<br />I have had a bit of a hard time opening the stroller and folding it back up. Everything is really tight. I talked to customer service and they said the more its opener and closed the easier it will get.<br />It's great quality. I really like it and so do my babies!!  It's not horrible to push either because of the large wheels!!
B004WW9KJE|1|I purchased this camera based on the reviews.  The product I received was very low quality.  Even the box it came in made me think I received a counterfeit, made in China knock off product.  The video quality was horrible and the reception was very hit and miss.  One minute the monitor would receive the image, and the next it would be out of range.....very frustrating!  I ended up paying double and purchasing the Summer Infant monitor with the two cameras for the same price.....a much better system!
B005MQRI7U|5|I have tried many different kinds of car seat protectors, or \\"piddle pads,\\" and this one definitely takes the cake. I could tell it was of a higher quality standard when I first removed it from it's box. And after using it one day I can say my little one put it to the test and it does its job very well. It actually HOLDS the mess, it doesn't spill around the edges the way other brands/types do. Great product and a great value!
B0083TTLG4|5|I am an expectant father, all of which are prepared for the baby, look very good, hope your baby will love
B001CFFX72|1|Would not stick to the wall.
B003D3NVPW|5|I use this with my travel pillow.  I like being able to wash it separate from the pillow.  So far, it washes and holds its shape quite well.  The only improvement I would like to have is either Velcro or snaps to close the open end of the case after putting it on the pillow.
B0011MQLNQ|5|i absolutely love this swing! im not due until next month (Nov 2011) but let me just tell you all the bad reviews on here are over exagerated! ya you can hear it but no it isnt loud. the music settings are great! i find it to be very sturdy and very handy cause you can just switch the directions and also you can just pick the seat up and put it anywhere. The speed settings dont really differ from eachother which isnt a big issue cause it seems to work fine how it is. Like i said i dont have my baby yet but my 8 lb 2 1/2 yr old mini dachshund thinks she is a child. she will get up in this think and let me turn it on and she will just go to sleep like it was made for her. it doesnt swing her out of controle like a roller coaster nor does it seem as if its gonna flip over. and if it was going crazy while on then she would definately jump out of it. so there for i gave this a complete 5 star rating cause i dont see anything whatsoever wrong with it! Great swing! i would recommend it to everyone!
B007XIWUYG|5|When my daughter was born she received 3 different loveys. I tried numerous times to get her to become attached to one but despite my attempts she wanted nothing to do with them. When she was about 10 months we were at right start where the drool monkey was sitting on check out counter. She pointed to it so I handed it to her and she didn't want to let it go. So, I bought it and she has been attached ever since. Sleeps with it and drags it around. It is very soft. I've washed it a million times and it still looks new. The head quietly rattles. I love the snaps that you can secure to stroller,etc. It also makes a great teether and nursing cover. We had a scare and almost lost monkey the other day so I'm on amazon ordering a backup in case we lose it and to have an extra when he gets his baths :)
B004M0WRLE|5|Beautiful gift for my newly baptized God children, both parents and children love them.  I shall buy more for stock.
B0050HDX7U|3|This product didn't work as we had hoped but deserves a small explanation in fairness to the manufacturer. With our 7 month old baby girl, she is at a point where she can hold the bottle up at about 4 ounces - we purchased this based on the advertising that it would help her hold the bottle. It just doesn't do that - the bottle holders that have built-in padding underneath are what ended up working for us so now she has a baby panda to play with who just has a little hole in the middle.
B00AJSIXUC|5|Arrived promptly in perfect condition.  Easy to install, comfy fit for toddlers.  This is the second one of this model we have bought.
B00F8NKKZO|1|Terrible. SO disappointed. The latches are so flimsy my baby opened it up in just a couple of minutes. We tried putting a rubberband around it after that and it sort of worked, but you shouldn't have to do that. Cheap crap!
B00WVUWZCS|5|The product that I received for review from Fresh Baby Products is called Fresh Baby First Teether - Green . This product is made of silicone and is easy for baby to chew on. You can buy this on Amazon for only $6.95. It comes in a green color and is perfect for teething babies. It has textured nubs on it which is great for teething babies.
B0002JETNS|1|Recieved and immediately processed a return. Very hard to adjust to right legnth. Makes for a PIA to open and close. Flimsy plastic so once you adjust it to fit the doorway and put pressure on it to lock it will bow and not make contact with all 4 pads causing it to be loose on one corner. Amazon was very quick about the return which says nothing for the gate really.
B007M5IWUG|3|I bought this item at Amazon because it included the bottle brush and formula dispenser. When I received this item it contained neither of those items. It did contain a pacifier, but I already bought one of those for my stepdaughter's shower, I was hoping to have the brush so she could wash the bottles. I consider this false advertising.<br /><br />The bottles hold a lot of liquid and are squat in shape. Wondering how the baby will hold them herself when she tries, although it might be easier for her because it won't be an awkward length. Didn't open them because I am considering sending them back (because they were not as advertised) and going to Target to get the one with the brush.
B0057GU264|5|Very sturdy desk it was worth it and my son loves it
B00QNZYUN4|5|This teething necklace is amazing. I got it as a gift for a friend and she absolutely loved it. Fits her baby perfectly, is stylish and most importantly--it works. I also loved the packaging and logo. Great for a gift or for your very own.
B00B561YLC|3|I got package
B000V96W0W|1|DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!! This is a waste of money. The Prince Lionel mixer is 100% better. This mixer if you can call it that doesnt even mix. It clumps everything up and is just a waste. My son has a tummy problem where we have to give him drop and a special formula and mixing the bottle didnt put as much air as shaking the bottle. I first bought the Prince Lionel mixer and it was amazing but I used it so much after 9 months it gave out (good run for its money though). So when I went to go order a new one they were sold out,so I bought this instead. I should have saved my money and just waited for the other mixer to come back in stock. People save your money and dont by this junk it is a waste.
B0046N26YU|4|Very cute and fun. No height adjustment so had to wait a little longer to use it. But baby loves it. Has a nice variety of songs and sounds. Lots to see and do. Definitely recommend.
B0018LYOZM|4|I purchased this chair for my 15 month old. She sits herself in the chair as proud as she can be. It is not flimsy and much more comfortable and safer for her than a bean bag. I was cautious about buying the chair with the high price, but the reviews on Amazon were so good.  I purchased the purple chair which was a little more money, and It is larger than the other colors. The foam is thick and sturdy. She will get a couple years of use out of it. I gave it four stars because there should be a removable cover; however, it is not hard to spot clean.
B002VPXTCS|4|I have not used this yet, as baby is still on the way, but the bag arrived on time. It has great pockets, is a good size, and I like the material. I found this bag, while looking for something that was eco friendly. I am trying to avoid adding too much plastic to the dumps eventually, so this bag is great. The price was competitive with other bags that were plastic etc, so why not!!! Great color, has a removable pocket inside if you just need more space. Comes with a shoulder strap, but I think it will be good just with the over the shoulder shorter straps.
B00361YZ42|1|False advertising! When my sponge arrived I thought it must have been a joke. This sponge barely fits in the palm of my hand. Unless you're planning on using this to bathe your extremely tiny dog, do not buy this product.
B0006NM08Q|5|This is a great car seat -- I don't know why it's so cheap -- they could easily charge $100 for it. The pillow that it comes with is great. My son can also lean against the edges of the seat for support while he naps. I also like the fabric pillow insert it comes with -- great for catching crumbs & dirt. Just remove and shake it out. The color scheme is also very tasteful and attractive.
B006ZIST04|5|I can't not express enough how in love I am with this car seat. I love the different stages it can be and the extra head rest. It gives my baby room without being squeezed into something. Honestly wish I had ordered it sooner.
B005S1TXSG|5|All of the attachments were with the package as shown in the pictures. The directions that came in the package were written in Korean, but very easy to follow the picture directions. Came in the mail within 4 days from ordering.
B006GYLKOO|3|These do the job, but they do not sit in place very well.  They only have one adhesive strip on the back, so by the end of the day, it is sometimes coming lose and out of position.  I opted for the Medela ones after I purchased these and have been having much better luck.

B003CK3LDI|5|My 7 week old daughter is in LOVE with this WubbaNub giraffe. The giraffe sits perfectly on her chest while she has the paci in her mouth.
B000H6R15O|5|We originally had the Peg Perego Viaggio SIP 30/30 infant seat, so I bought the adapter for the Bugaboo.  The Peg adapter is very different from the Graco adapter.  The Peg adapter are just two posts that have to perfectly align with the slots in the car seat. This was practically impossible for one person!  I had to be on one side while my wife was on the other, as we aligned each post into their slots on the car seat.  It was very difficult and I was completely disappointed in the design.<br /><br />I then found this adapter and since it mimics the car seat base, it was SOOOO much easier to lock the car seat into the Bugaboo.  We ended up returning the Peg car seat (it was too big and way too heavy for us anyway) and bought the Graco Snugride 22.  And let me tell you, it is like night and day.  Placing the car seat onto this adapter is as easy (if not easier) than placing it on its base in the car.<br /><br />As for the price, I don't think it's overpriced, especially compared to the equally-priced Peg adapters, which are nothing more than just the two vertical pieces.  At least the Graco adapter has several other parts, including those extruded aluminum tubes, which justifies its price somewhat.  The Peg Perego adapters should be at least half the price of the Graco.<br /><br />I had no problems assembling this adapter whatsoever.  The pieces fit perfectly.  It may take a little bit of strength to push the rods/tubes into the plastic ends, but I can't imagine anyone having any problems with it at all.
B00HZO7110|1|Really didn't think it was as small as it is. I'm a tall woman... So it kind of sucked for me. Quite cheap, guess I should have known that. But overall, a waste of my money.
B000FGG8TG|5|This lil set is perfect for packing my 6 month old foods and snacks. They say disposable but I have washed them numerous times already (by hand).
B000UUBRYI|5|Love this base easy to install. Easy to use. Secure and makes taking tiny babies out of the car a dream
B00F2MQ5SC|5|love it. super cute and my son stays comfy in it for a while at a time. he is 6 months now and just starting to get a little too chunky for it but I started using it as a bath seat.. yes I know.. bad me.. but I actually watch my kids so they will be fine. anyways, great seat and so light weight you cant take it anywhere.
B002T5Q01C|5|We use these whenever we travel so cloth diaper cleanup is easier. They don't bother our daughter, who has very sensitive skin and are absorbent and don't rip. We do not flush them down the toilet.
B001CFFX90|2|I have non-textured tile in my shower, but if you put the littlest weight/pressure on the foot rest it falls right off the wall.
B0012ONBP4|4|As a first time mom, I'm discovering a lot of trial and error with the baby products I'm coming across.  I wasn't happy with the first nursing pillow I was using because my baby boy is extra floppy and I was afraid he was going to flop himself right off the pillow, which I was already having difficulty keeping in my lap.  When I found out about the My Brest Friend pillow and how it attaches to you, I knew I had to get it and give it a try.  It does a great job of keeping my baby in place even when he tries to flop around!  He seems to like it, too, and sometimes falls asleep on it.<br /><br />The only con for me for this pillow is that it's not easy for me to ditch the pillow if needed.  Wearing the pillow, it can be a challenge to get the sleeping baby into his bassinet.  I can easily unsnap the pillow from me, but getting it off while holding a precariously sleeping baby is a different challenge.  All the same, I love this pillow!
B004QJ1H6C|5|The Perfect present for my Packer backer baby :-) He loves it and so do I!! Very soft and ADORABLE!!!!
B000XY0N0U|3|I purchased this for my daughter when she was 4 months old, she has showed little to no interest in it until recently.  Now at 8 months she is able to start to push legs on her own and make \\"music.\\"  However some of the legs are more difficult push and hear sound from.  I anticipate that she will like this toy more as the months go on.  In general, it has a really cute face and its well made, I just wish the tones were more clear.
B001PYQWXY|5|I have a super mobile 12 month old who is incapable of pulling down this gate, no matter how hard he shakes it.  It's a great product for a great price!
B001CFOMQA|5|An excellent product and perfect for the summer months as it's a lightweight material.  It saves your baby/toddler getting their feet caught in the side of the crib.  I have all of the sizes and TOG's (temperature)..  They are easy to wash, safe, durable and fantastic materials and colors.  I would strongly recommend them..
B000H1IYXW|5|In the long run it was very worth it, but we never thought we'd ever get it put together (glad other customers warned us). Took three adults to figure it out. But once installed we feel perfectly secure with this protecting our grandchild. Really appreciate the extra-long length.
B004K6LMTI|3|Straw is a little too short for my son.
B008LZLMJ4|5|I bought this sleep bag since my baby girl is very mobile even during sleeping.  When I first got it, I thought it was too thin and tried it with two long sleeve bodysuits even though my room temperature is about 75F.  Surprisingly, it was too hot for my baby.  So from the second time use I was confident that one onesie is enough.  Since this sleep bag cannot be dried in a drier, I bought another one so I can wash it and let it dry flat as recommended.  I ordered woolino baby sack just want to see what the difference is.  The woolino one is very similar.  One pro is that it has two shoulder snaps while merino only has one.  However, there is no zipper top cover on the woolino.  I'm worried that the zipper top would somehow makes my baby uncomfortable so I end up returned it and bought another merino.  I have been using it for more than two months and really love it!  Highly recommend.
B004EWGDAG|3|The product itself is good. The kit has all the neccessary items. However, I did not recieve the product that is in the seller's picture. The color of the pouch was green, not blue. Not a huge deal, but I like to recieve the product that is advertised.
B0009W85WO|3|Does anyone know if this car seat is also rear-facing?  My 4 mo old (20lbs) has outgrown her infant seat but it still too young for a forward facing seat.  Thanks!
B004AHMCLY|4|Good for feeling different textures and learning to grasp. Better for a baby that already has grasping down and can use two hands to old something.
B00EI7DI6O|5|good
B00594T4Q8|5|I absolutely LOVE the look of this travel system by Graco!! I'm not really a big fan of patterns.  Rather, I'd say I prefer clean and sophisticated solids.  So, naturally, I was immediately drawn to this system for its posh design.  The product description is spot on as it describes the lighter material as a champagne beige color, as opposed to a grey color (or even khaki, as it appears to me in the picture).  It's a very cute and contemporary way for baby to get around.  Assembly of the stroller was super easy.  Probably because all it entails are putting the wheels and drink trays on :).  Most everything snaps into place with the exception of the rear wheels.  I had some difficulty getting the securing pins through the axle holes, even with my slender fingers.  That part was frustrating but trivial in the long run.  All the mechanisms function smoothly (reclining the stroller seat, lowering the basket, etc.).  Adding the carseat to the stroller is as simple as snap and release. I did have to move fabric out of the way to get the carseat locks of the stroller in place but it wasn't a big deal. The ride of the system is phenomenal.  The front wheels can be locked into place or swivel for uneven surfaces or turning sharp corners.  If strollers had shock absorbers, I think this system would be the Mercedes Benz.  It maneuvers easily and smoothly, even through the rough asphalt parking lot at my office.   The part I am most impressed with is how easily the stroller can be folded up and/or opened for use.  Literally, it can be done with one hand.  Which, I am thinking, will be really convenient for loading up in parking lots after a day of Christmas shopping!    Graco makes being a first-time parent seem a lot less daunting :).  I should note that, while the product description does not say so, the car seat DOES come with a base.  I know when I purchased that I had the thought I would need to be buying a base.  Nice to know that I don't.  (the carseat also snaps in andout of the base easily, fyi).  LOVE this purchase and would recommend to anyone!
B00008439C|5|THis is one of the best baby items out there! It has so many sound options and combos...and its safe to have in the crib unlike the stuffed animals which can suffocate younger babies. Now that our son is older and can pick it up we place it right under the crib.  I love this thing!
B00171WXII|5|I don't need to repeat everything everyone else has said...a friend got it for me as part of a shower gift of her \\"favorite baby/mom things.\\"  I was a little skeptical about it but around 2-3 weeks old my daughter was totally stuffed up and snorty, so I thought what the hell, I'll give it a try.  This thing works. It was very easy for me to use (I can see how it may be harder later when the kid is older and can fight back...but they will probably fight back anything going up their nose...) easy to clean, and wonderous and gross how much snot can be in an infant's nose.  Use Simply Saline Baby before sucking.
B00081J3MW|5|Fit into any standard US outlet. Perfect for making sure little fingers stay out!
B00005RW7M|5|This mobile goes with our Del Mar crib set.  We also have the night light.  There are only a few drawbacks I have found with it:<BR>1) It only plays for what seems like two minutes.  I have to wind it up as tightly as possible to get enough time out of it to lull the baby to sleep.  When it stops running, I have to wind it up again and the sound of the winding startles the baby awake!(This would not be so bad if it played for 5-10 minutes)<BR>2) I have a Parisienne 5 in 1 crib and the wood is too thick on the back or side rails of the crib to attach the mobile.  The only place I could locate the mobile is on the crib gate (which is not recommended).  However, it was there or return the mobile.  You might want to try the mobile out on the same crib as yours in the store before you purchase this mobile.<BR>My baby loves the mobile.  She loves to watch the turtles and dolphins swim around the crib!
B004L2JJ6O|5|I can't imagine life without this item. We have it on a bar table and he is able to join us for all his meals. It buckles securely and is very compact and light weight. I can't wait to travel with it. I am so happy with this purchase.
B004071ZOE|4|Arrived at a timely manner as a gift to my pet sister, who just delivered her new bundle of joy, and she instantly loved it. She told me it's really cute!
B00IOSD8PO|5|My wife really likes it!
B002YQPDFK|5|Great at home or while travelling (you can keep it deflated in your suitcase, and re-inflate it when needed, though it may take some time if you do it manually and don't use a pump.)  Very durable.  Our baby is very active, and this tub seems very safe with the inflated sides and floor.  Can be used in regular sized bathtubs and shower stalls.
B001NGFSMK|3|The bowl's design is good because of the angled inside. However, it could be improved more if it was made of BPA free microwavable plastic or glass. Also, it would be nice if it was bigger too to accommodate more food once the baby grows.
B000Y8TXS8|5|I haven't washed this yet, but the quality looks great. It's plush and thick, soft, brightly colored, and charming. Looks awesome in our gender-neutral nursery.
B00LIRJ2KI|5|Great for my three and one half year old grandson.
B00BDG2W5G|4|good quality and comfortable but at 6' tall it isn't long enough for a full body pillow or easy side sleep without curling up. I've had others with better length but will cope since this one has the best support otherwise.
B000ZPM5G2|5|I'm a mom and surgeon. I recently saw a 1 year old boy that fell on his sippy cup and suffered a terrible cut near his eye from the spout. He needed surgery to repair the deep laceration. There is no way something like that could happen with these cups. They are not only soft but really functional. No leaks, and my son loves them.
B0011URFRE|5|Bought this seat for 2.5 year old who is off the charts it weight and height. He loves it, I love it! I love the price too!
B00B4DD0MC|4|The only pacifier my LO ever used I just love these MAM is the best.
B005BWXJKK|5|I really like this crib rail cover.  I looked at the \\"gummy\\" ones and the fabric ones in Babies R Us and even thought about making one of my own, but who has the time.  Then I saw this one and decided to give it a try.  It's a nice soft fleece material on the side baby touches and plastic lined underneath.  The ties hold it in place well, and the size of it covers just the top crib rail and doesn't make a big pouch think like the ones that cost twice as much elsewhere.  I like it.
B002C30S96|5|Love the bag. It is the perfect size for my little guy. Plus it is so cute and holds everything he needs.
B002UD65GI|5|Let me start off with saying that this blanket is amazing! I bought this before my daughter was born along with several other baby blankets that I had received from friends and family.  Every since she was a few months old, she began to cling to this blanket--and only this one. It has withstood animals, any mess from a child (which is alot!) and several/tons of laundry cycles.   When she was 18 months old we realized that while the blanket was in good shape still--it was getting dirty and just looked worn. So we bought her another one while keeping the original one. She is now 2 and she uses both of them and no other blanket. Even my husband uses the blanket for a cushion to sleep, lol! That being said, we will be ordering another one very soon just in case they decide to stop selling these in the near future!
B005DOS2EE|5|This gate is wonderful. Our little dog was running out every time the door was opened.  No matter how careful we were she is so fast we could not catch her. The gate is sturdy and easy to install. Our gate is in our kitchen and looks very nice. It really blends in with our decor.<br /><br />The Watts
B00IIDRNWE|5|Love, love, love these. These Aden + Anais bibs are awesome - perfect size, durable quality, wash and dry well, and I love the Twinkle print. Thanks Aden + Anais for a great product!
B00QR9O4N2|4|I purchased this sheet because my child would cough through the night due to her allergies. I purchased this sheet along with an air purifier and have noticed a huge difference. Her allergies do not bother her at night anymore.
B006PB2H40|5|I purchased this to keep my baby from entering the kitchen.<br />It does not have a door, so I need to go over the gate in order to enter my kitchen. But, it is not that hard for me.<br />My baby can see me through the net of the gate.<br />I think it is sturdy enough.
B00L378VRS|4|Bought it for Delta Bentley 4-in-1 Convertible Crib. It works just fine, but it could be a little bit better fit (brackets)
B000G82KJK|4|great general gift for a new little boy- cute coordinating items make it a great little gift!
B008HRJKHM|4|This potty is very cute but the seat does not fit the adult toilet. That was very disappointing. My granddaughter hated sitting on the potty but loves sitting on the toilet. The seat would have been great here. Now she uses the toilet and pushes the arm down on the potty to hear the fun sounds. Smh
B00A6EU3KW|5|Great quality happy I found
B00C4RIGAS|4|The definition could be a little better.
B00HY0OIYI|4|Is nice, true to picture! But i thought it will be more woaw! But is something ordinary! For baby is ok!
B004BSFP02|5|I got this chair for my 9 months old grandson because I wanted him to sit at the table with us, and , given the space I have in the kitchen, I did not want to by a high chair.  After reading the reviews and based on the way it looks, I chose Inglesina 2011 fast chair.  I am very pleased with my choice!<br />I chose the color Mandarino and it looks great on my kitchen counter!  It is very easy to clean!  Because it has a strong grip on the furniture it is very safe and, yet, given the soft rubber material it wont damage a wood table.  The padding is soft and comfortable. The material is of high quality.  It is very easy to place on and to take it out of a table.  It folds nicely to a small flat volume, which can be carried with you everywhere you go.  My only concern though is, although I never tried, how it will handle a small light table.  My grandson is 24 lbs and will easily flip a small  table.  However, it is great for kitchen counters and solid firm tables.  My grandson loves the chair!  I strongly recommend this chair if you want your little one around while cooking, cleaning, or eating.
B002X7DDM0|5|It took me 7months to find the right stroller: The baby Jogger F.I.T combines everything I have ever wanted! As an active triathlete I can now go jogging whenever I want to and my baby loves it as well! I can really recommend this stroller! It is stable, convenient, has a bigger seat than all the others and you can handle it by one hand...jogging is smooth and comfortable because of the three big air filled wheels. This stroller made my life and my training so much easier! I love it!
B0041EMMV6|1|I bought this nap nanny through amizon and have seen it has a call back and that amizon is takeing them back.Do not want to keep it if there is any chance of an infaint death.
B00GNB5Y2Y|5|Although not that exciting an item for an adult my 15 month old granddaughter has a blast playing with these in the tub.  She fills them up, watches the water drain and tells me Minnie, so she recognizes the shape.  A fun little bath toy.
B002SG7JSU|5|I am very pleased with these corner guards. Very thick and cushiony. The brown blends well with our furniture, and they were a breeze to apply. Not looking forward to taking them off later since the tape will probably leave residue, but with a product like this, you just know you're going to have to use Goo Gone or something similar to get rid of the sticky stuff afterwards. Totally worth it to make our home safer for our son.
B0062TNEOC|5|I purchased this to use at our child care center. It is amazing how many items we had that were just a bit too small, a lifesaver for families as well.
B004B762AK|3|I liked the unit itself however the battery life is very poor. It's not a cheap monitor so I was somewhat disappointed with the battery quality. I expected more I guess.
B000067K0L|4|Baby likes to stare and bat at the animals. The music is loud though with no volume control. He &#34;talks&#34; to the animals for 20 min or so each day :)
B005DPQW90|5|The Disney Jr Junction Fast Friends Wall Decal is an perfect addition to anyone decorating their child's room in Disney Jr. Cars!<br />I purchased it for my 1 year olds room, it looks great and matched the bed set perfect!!!
B000NV5VDW|4|I was needing something to go that little extra to help protect my daughter from the sun....well this is it.  It's easy to put on and off.  I'm really glad I found this product.
B001TMXBXG|5|These are my favorite go-to gift for baby showers (along with the Happiest Baby on the Block DVD). They are the perfect swaddling blankets. I wonder how many parents give up on swaddling because the blanket isn't big enough to hold a swaddle. Here's what I like about them:<br /><br />1. big enough that you can swaddle correctly (google the DUDU swaddle - down, up, down, up)<br />2. baby doesn't outgrow them like other swaddling blankets (we swaddled for 4 months in these)<br />3. lightweight - great to carry around with you even in the summer<br />4. can use as blanket, nursing cover, swaddle, drape over infant carrier to keep people from disturbing baby<br /><br />I threw out all of the receiving blankets I had stocked up on. Wish I had bought these from the start.
B00917LK16|5|I did a lot of research before buy this car seat. Security and comfort was my priority, and I not have any regret, best decision. My 13 weeks old baby love it!! He fall sleep right away. Very sturdy,nice,cozy and comfortable. He born in December and we bought the bundle me from JJ Cole to add warm. The car seat is a little heavy,  compared with others, but I consider this a good sign of security, we have the key fit caddy frame and we are ready to go. Very easy to install, my husband did it in less than 5 minutes, and the base is included.  My husband, baby and myself lovet it.
B001N44BWU|5|This crib is well made, with quality hardware and very nice fit.  I've seen cribs for twice the money that are of comparable quality.  I do think it is made of pine, rather than a hardwood so it will ding somewhat more easily than, say, oak.  But, you're not going to be playing basketball on it, so that should be fine.  Assembly is very straightforward but as mentioned by others, some bolts are provided with exactly the number needed so try not to lose anything during assembly.  There is a nice pouch under the base to hide the instructions for later use.  It is made in Taiwan, not mainland China, in case that matters to you.<br /><br />Some reviews made me concerned that it was, in fact, painted rather than stained.  I can assure you that it is stained and the grain shows through nicely even with the espresso finish.<br /><br />The base crib comes with all that you need to convert it to a toddler bed.  You'll need to find some space to store the extra pieces for a few years.  I also decided to get the conversion pieces to make it into a full bed.  I do recommend that you do this. Who knows where this manufacturer will be when you decide to convert it.<br /><br />From other reviews, it sounds like the dressers and other pieces that match the crib are (1) not manufactured by the same company (2) of inferior quality.  I decided to stay away from that stuff.  The good news is that the toddler bed conversion has a couple of small pieces of finished wood you can take with you furniture shopping locally if you like to match the espresso finish.
B00629MXNU|3|it is really too big for my baby。 I need to wait my little girl grow up to use it。
B00AHPZZGC|5|I purchased this for my daughter in law, son and grand daughter. They love it. It is a hit.
B002H9XCO8|5|Our daughter started teething about a month ago and we've been going through a LOT of different teethers.  The Philips Avent animal teether is great!  It is made of a soft \\"silicone\\" like plastic, well shaped for early teethers with little hands and a harder time hanging on to things.  Our daughter is 4 months old and it is easy for her to hold and provides relief for teething pian.  I love that it is BPA free and easy to clean.  I have no idea what kind of animal this is supposed to be but of course our daughter does not seem to mind!  UPDATE:  At 9 months of age this is still one of my daughter's favorite teethers.
B004DSRJM2|5|This is so cute... A little big for my 3 week old, but I love it... Very cute and good quality... I want to order a few more.
B004C43JJ4|5|Just what I wanted!
B002GWW1TI|5|These have 3 (4 with the lid) parts to clean.  Our baby loved them. The slow nipple was a little fast for him in the first two weeks but we have used them for 7 months and we are thrilled with them.  I had Dr. Browns before and now I spend half the time cleaning bottles. We used the Triton and the glass ones and prefer the Triton bottle. We *never* had a problem with leaking so I am confused by the other reviews.  Dr. Weil doesn't do a lot of advertising so these bottles are kind of a best kept secret. I highly recommend them.
B000K4YSZO|1|The only good things about this diaper pail are that it takes regular kitchen trash bags and is not an obnoxious color. The entire battery/filter &#34;thing&#34; has barely worked from day 1, and it is super top heavy when you change the bag. At 3 months with a newborn, I've had enough...and will purchase something else even if it means using branded diaper bags/liners.
B006ZVV0R0|5|Loved
B003SRIQLM|5|Bought 2 sets of these for my son's changing table and they are very cute. They fit perfectly underneath and hold a bunch of stuff. They are pretty soft-sided, but that's not an issue for me. I'm sure we'll be able to use these for years to come for toy storage as well.
B00QX0D6LG|5|Awesome
B000GB0NZK|5|I love these snack cups. My daughter as alway had problems eating, and her feeding therapist and GI doctor told me to buy these cups. I love them. They help slow the toddler that try to eat to fast down.
B009STPWK2|5|I made pacifiers key chains for my baby shower gifts . Everyone loved them.
B0001IU5HY|5|We have been putting our son in this swing since the day he came home from the hospital.  He is very comfortable in the reclined position (make sure you realize this option is available), and never cries in it.  This swing was on the expensive side but because of the comfort of the seat, I feel it's well worth it.  The only drawback is that even the slowest setting seems a little bit fast, but he doesn't seem to mind, and is buckled in tight.  I would definitely recommend this swing over others.
B00KGIQYEW|5|Perfect crib addition for my 16month old. She loves the pillow and is sleeping better since receiving it.
B001BLCII4|5|My son loves this stroller.  We've had him in it since day one.  I like that it comes with the carseat attatchment, we have a graco safeseat, and it's so easy to just set the carrier in it when he's asleep...there is a strap you put over the carrier and you're ready to go.  I love the way the seat faces both directions.  This was a selling point for me.  I can change the direction he's facing while he's sitting in it!  It rolls very smoothly.    I found out that to fold it up the seat has to be facing out.  We have a 05 Civic and this stroller takes up half of our trunk.  This is a little frustrating, but it's worth it to have a roomy stroller for him, and a place for me to store my shopping bags, purse, and diaper bag.  The basket on the bottom is very large...we can fit his diaper bag, my purse, a blanket, and a few shopping bags in it.    We have the stroller that has the cup holder/tray across his lap.  I love this option.  I put his juice in the cup holder and a few puffs on the tray and he is snacking down the mall.    The recline options are great.  When he was younger I would recline the seat all the way for him to sleep and it was great...a bed on wheels.  I like to keep the seat all the way up now because when it is his canopy will cover the entire area to the tray.  A great option for public places during flu season.    This stroller is heavy, but it's also heavy duty.  It's worth the weight.    I highly recommend this stroller...I'm a first time mom and I researched forever.  Like I mentioned before, the selling point for me was that the seat faces both ways, but I have been soooooooo pleased with this stroller.    We did get an umbrella stroller to put in the other car so we wouldn't have to switch back and forth.
B00EU5AHK4|4|This is a soft and lightweight blanket. I like the giraffe feature since our son's room has safari animals. The biggest thing to note is the size. It is 30x 36 inches which is like a newborn blanket. I generally prefer the 60 inch blankets now that my son is almost 2 years old so there is greater chance he will be covered in the middle of the night.
B00V5KOQX6|2|The guard on the top is downright sharp.  I read quite a few reviews of other pottys, and saw at least two parents who warned of their child needing stitches because of skin getting caught on a guard.  While those reviews were not for THIS seat, I could easily see how jumping off this potty quickly could be harmful, given the sharp edge on the top of the guard that my child would slide over.
B00CMJ226M|1|I was excited to get these. First time I tried them in the wash, they both fell apart! The seems came undone and the support ring fell out, the zipper didn't stay shut. Total waste of money!
B000H1MRJO|3|I got this item as my son and I will be traveling during the holidays.  He has outgrown the pack n play, but I am still worried about him sleeping in a twin bed due to the height.  He sleeps very successfully in a cot at daycare and I thought this would be perfect.  It was a great price and design EXCEPT for the support strap that goes across the middle of the cot.  I guess I see that it's needed, however, because it's so stiff and the ends of the cot sink in more, it's not comfortable for my son.  I have to buy something else to pad the cot for our trip, and then cot it with the sheet.  Thank goodness we will not have to use this more than a day or 2.  Happy Holidays!
B00O8RRFWC|5|I am thrilled with this booster!  My 4 year old is using it w/ the 5 point harness.  I was impressed with the quality right out of the box. It was easy to install, my son loves to ride in it.
B0035LLG2W|5|This thing is great! I would recommend it to any parent.
B00H9NZHKO|4|Easy to install. very strong. They are kind of big and bulky though.
B00LGCA4HU|4|Great price! Purchased to sew into a nursing cover, which turned out very well. I'm most pleased with how breathable this fabric is without being see through. The busy print helps. Compared to my other muslin blanket this Spasilk isn't quite as soft as my Lulujo. However, the Spasilk two pack was a bargain.
B00EIGLTQ6|1|I bought this because I liked the size and simplicity of this product. However, am very disappointed in the quality and design. First off, everyone is right about the pieces falling off. My son pulls the mirror down with ease.    Secondly, the seat is not designed well at all in terms of safety and comfort. It is poorly designed, as the seat basically becomes shorter if you want to raise the height. Most products like these raise on the legs. This is faulty because as the seat shortens the baby's body is raised out of the seat and they can fall out if they lean over too far. This happened to us. Our son is 7 months and he pulled on the edge and leaned over, causing the bouncer to topple over and onto him. I am going to write the company as I find this a major hazard. Thankfully our son is ok but I don't think this should have ever happened. Very disappointed!
B005J58CV0|5|Perfect! It has everything a crawler/sitter/stand up baby needs.<br />Bought it for my baby at 7 months and at 9 months it's his go to toy.
B000BGJSE2|5|My daughter is 2 years old..She was very scared to use the potty. A friend of mine suggested me to try this. Trust me within a day she started to use the potty and is completly potty trained. Ofcourse I didnt need it for more than a week.But now I use it in the car as a potty for her so that I dont have to keep looking for restrooms when we go out..
B009YT026K|3|This is just okay. I was disappointed with the picture quality. The video is very very grainy and the color looks very dull. It does get the job done, meaning you can see and hear your baby, but the picture isn't clear like the description descibes and it DEFINITELY doesn't look like the picture.<br />The battery life on the parent device is not bad, it saves your battery life if you turn the picture off when you aren't looking at it.<br />Overall, this device is just okay, I would have kept it if the price wasn't so high. I went to the store and looked at the Summer Infant in person and that picture is much more clear and cheaper. I definitely recommend looking at this video monitor in person before purchasing if you can.
B00K5ZDTZI|5|Good
B00004TFLB|5|My son has played with this toy nonstop.  He is now 16 months old and it is one of the first things he reaches for when he wakes up.  When we travel I have make sure its packed.  Some kids have blankets, mine has the music cube.
B00D04R1MS|5|When switching away from a 5-point restraint system, I wanted something as secure as possible. I love that this seat uses the latch system (2 latches; apparently cheaper brands only use 1 latch). The lap belt positioner is good and bad. It's great in theory, but now that my daughter is a bit older and I don't usually use it, it's a pain for her to have it there.
B003VNKLIY|5|This Metal play yard is going to serve to purposes! It will first let my little chick be outside a little bit in the day and then it will be sanitized and it will be my grandsons Play Yard ! It arrived in good condition and was delievered promptly
B00BH0S8EM|4|Very cute. Fabric a little light and the ties are short. A suggestion would be to put Velcro on the ties.
B0043IS18I|3|I give this product 3 stars for the following ...<br /><br />Pros ...<br />Good air flow.<br />Easy to use .<br />Light weight .<br />Soft foam makes it safe for babies.<br />Compact .<br /><br />Con's ...<br />The foam blades rip easily.<br />Battery is hard to change. (Need extremely small screw driver to get into it.)<br />Have to change the batteries frequently . Get about 2 hrs of fan time before it dies.<br />The neck of it ripped apart from the base doesn't change the fans ability, but I have a 9 month old who I am worried could get hurt .<br /><br />I am going to try a different fan have had the blades ripped off by my baby twice and spent more on batteries than have on the fan itself.
B003HIXOTQ|5|This is my favorite &#34;mommy's little helper&#34; - My son absolutely loves this pillow. I even bought a second one for his daycare! I use it primarily for naptime, as it is safe and comfortable. The elevation also helps with his reflux issues. It is very well made and the slip cover is easy to remove for cleaning.
B00DNGLPB6|5|our last one got fried in the UK used by ignorance and laziness<br /><br />this new adapter has brought LITERALLY a new lease of life.<br /><br />thanks
B001FD3756|4|This is good make sure you do the right way
B001F43JTO|4|I got my daughter two Wubunubs just in case she dropped one of the floor/or got lost, I would have another to give her. She liked the duck option, but really loved the giraffe one because of the spots.
B003G2YUTG|5|Had a different style with first daughter and she just wanted to play with hers. This time we got this one, and my second daughter likes it.... just doesn't want to dirty ducky. So we're working on that. Great value, and sturdy. Would recommend for boys and girls!
B001LF3TRO|5|I was thinking of buying Graco first, but after visiting Buy Buy Baby store and checking all three carriers (Graco, Universal car seat carrier - forgot the manufacturer's name, and Maclaren) I found that handles of the first two were quite low (though Graco does come a little higher than the other one). Maclaren was a perfect height, though at first I thought it was a bit too wide. I still went ahead and bought the stroller. NEVER regretted it! It's great and VERY easy to maneuver even with one hand! Definitely great buy!
B000FT7NQU|4|4 stars because:<br /><br />it looks great when set up (even though it took 3 adults 2 hours to put together)<br />it didn't meet 5 stars because there were scratches in the wood from the setup (the veneer easily scratches)<br />it meets safety standards for baby<br />it will convert to a toddler bed
B005ACUOKO|5|Great price. Nice and firm. Wipes off easily. Love it. Priced well for a Serta. Love it. :) Can't beat the price and high quality matched together in this mattress.
B00PTL457Y|4|Substantial, height and cushioning, two level assistant arm rest, two pull out cup holders with great design. Great price.
B000YDFOPE|5|Excelente
B005UV0UEA|4|I bought this only to sleep in when traveling and to put my son in when I have to answer the door or run to the restroom.  I do not use it as a \\"play pen\\" so it does not get a whole lot of use .  The only reason I purchased this one was because it did not have a bunch of silly prints all over it, it matched my kitchen/den area, and it was inexpensive.  I did not purchase it for a young infant, so I did not use the bassinet.  My son was 8 months when we began using it.  Despite the mesh feeling cheap, my active tike claws and scrapes at it constantly and it has shown no signs of wear or tear. I also use it to pull in front of the door as a \\"gate\\".  It's nothing special. I would purchase something else if I were planning to have my child waste 2-3 hours a day playing inside of it. It's small and compact which makes it perfect for travel sleeping and a temporary deposit box to keep the little one safe.
B003KN279Q|5|My 14 month old will NOT keep the velcro bibs on. These are the only nice snap bibs I can find. I find that they wipe up easily, stay in place and have cute patterns. Worth the price, in my opinion. I haven't had any problems with mold, as other reviewers have mentioned. I toss them into the wash on hot after using them a few times and lay them flat to dry. They've held up nicely,
B007A2UAOC|5|This is a great accessory for the Britax it is a large bassinet that is comfy for baby. It lets them stretch out and sleep and in a pinch lets you use it as a changing table if you throw a changing pad down. My baby falls asleep in the bassinet and it stays nice and cozy when it is chilly outside. I also bought the sun cover and rain cover is that I can use it under a variety of weather conditions.
B000PRUAFI|2|This gate, when using the extensions, is ridiculous to put up.  The extensions are not held in secure to the main gate by anything, they simply fit onto smooth bolts.  What this means is that when you connect the extensions on to the main gate, they can slide right off. That makes putting this up a two person, frustrating job.  Imagine using both extensions (comes with total of two, one for each side) and trying to put this into place with each side wanting to slide right off.
B00BKF52A2|4|We bought the twin carrycot to go along with the indie stroller.  Getting the carrycot to clip in and out was a little challenging, hence the 4 stars, but worth it.  I really enjoyed walking with my son while we was a little man.  We started using this when we was about a month old.  Just to get some fresh air.<br /><br />I love the enclosure.  The canopy plus the zip on top keep the baby safe from the elements.  I also use to wrap him up in a blanker before zipping him in.  This also doubled as a sleeper while at nana's.<br /><br />Granted we weren't able to use it long since he got too big and no longer lies still, I really enjoyed having this product. This was one of my baby purchases that was more for my convenience and sanity.
B001OI237U|5|Very good !
B00C6CS8EU|5|Absolutely love it!! The material is very soft the blanket is very large I Love it.  I bought this for my newborn.  I will definitely be ordering again for my 4 year old.
B000FFL58Q|5|My 3.5 month old seems to like this better every day.  We rarely use the lights and music since she is so entertained by looking at the objects, toys & mirror, and she just recently started holding and batting at them.  As she learns to more purposefully hit them and understands that the noises are caused by her she'll find new things to like about it.  As I think is the case for most babies her age, she doesn't normally spend more than 15-20 minutes in it at a time, but she goes in it once or twice a day.  Although I was intially shocked at how much all \\"gyms\\" cost, I'm so glad we have one, and this one is great.
B009KAS94K|5|Our Springer Spaniel loves this and I don't have to spend hours playing with her using a laser pointer.  She recently was injured when she jumped out of a moving vehicle. She shattered the ball in her hip and it had to be removed. I didn't think I would ever be able to take her hunting again but this laser toy helped rehabilitate her hip and she is back in the fields. It takes 3 Aa batteries and although the will last several hours,  I do recommend buying recharageable batteries. Listen,  It is a good product. The price is cheaper here than any place else I have found and it shipped very quickly.
B0011MOVS8|3|The seat looks great in the living room - finally something that's not super babyish!  It doesn't do much other than vibrate, so it's Ok as long as my son is being stimulated/entertained by something else (e.g., watching Baby Einstein, interacting with Mom/Dad).  My son is content longer in a cheap little bouncy seat because his own actions bounce the seat & make the multiple dangling toys wave around.
B006NTY1HU|5|Holds up well.  Our child is able to stand up on the sides and we have no fear of it tipping over.  Well built, fun colors and party time.
B002SW3AXW|5|Love to swaddle my baby in this.  Her older brother has also started taking one to bed with him. lol!
B000HKY1GM|3|Our baby hated his crib, and as a consequence slept in our room/bed/bassinet for several months.  This co-sleeper was helpful for those first few months, but it always felt a little unstable.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Keep baby close by, makes it easy to breastfeed in those early weeks when baby wakes up every two hours.  I always felt more rested having him right there rather than getting up to get him<br /> - Baby slept better in the co-sleeper since he could always be touching me<br /> - Safer than baby sleeping in the bed with us.<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Slightly unstable - this co-sleeper always felt like it would tip over easily if the dogs decided to get curious about it.  Also, one of the sides would rarely stay in the locked position<br /> - Co-sleeper mattress is about 4 inches below the side that connects to the bed.  This always made it harder to move baby into the bassinet if he fell asleep while breastfeeding, since you had to pick him up and lower him into the co-sleeper.<br /> - After the first few months, baby will outgrow it.  It is a lot of money to spend on something for 3 months.  However, at the time I don't know what I would have done without it.
B004044LD4|5|Fits standard crib well. Baby sleeps well with this mattress and Millard 2 inch memory foam crib mattress topper.
B003VPZ43Y|5|Love love love this playard.  No funky smell like other reviewers seemed to experience.  We have a Graco Pack N Play also and we decided to get a second playard to keep at Grandma's house.  Well, we left the Graco at her house and kept this one at ours!  If you are choosing between the Graco and this Carter's product, here are the key differences:    I'm comparing this product to a Graco Pack N Play Playard with Newborn Napper Station and changing station.    Our Graco has the attached changing table but it is extremely wobbly and I refused to change our daughter on it once she got to about 9 pounds.  The Carter's product is much much better stabilized and can pivot out of the way when not in use.  Four stars for this feature.  It also seems to be much larger as I can change our now 15 pound daughter on it with no problems.    Our Graco has a diaper stacker but no room for accessories like wipes etc.  This playard has a nice roomy diaper accessories area that also has the bonus of being able to fold it up inside the product when you fold it to carry on trips.  The changing table doesn't fit inside the bag with the rest of it, but neither does any product that I've seen.  You can live without this on trips or either carry it in a separate bag.    This playard imo has a more appealing, plush look to it than our graco pack n play.  It's just cuter.    And my favorite feature....when you fold the Carter's playard the wheels stick out of the bottom of the bag....HELLO????  This is awesome.  Our graco does not do this although some other versions of the Graco Pack N Play might have this feature.  Neither product is light by any stretch of the imagination and the wheels make it doable for my 110 pound self to pack it up and roll it to the car without needing my husband.    Overall if I had it to do over again, I'd have two Carter's Playards and would have skipped the Graco altogether.  The price listed on amazon is a little ridiculous as we got ours at Babies R Us for 129.00.
B004EBRZYA|5|$27, but now it looks like it's going for $70 so i don't think you should buy it at that price unless cost is no object.  Comes with great instructions and is HUGE, Covers a little more than Half of a full mattress.  Easy to install, although I wish the piece you put on the opposite side to hug against the frame was longer or bigger, bc it did slide around and I had to play with it a little when putting the mattress back on.  I was doing it by myself and the side was against a wall though, so if you have 2 or more i'm sure it would be easier.  Bright and fun to look at it. recommend but not at $70
B00SWI7DRU|5|We have not used them yet but they look and feel amazing
B0028797PM|4|This hamper is so cute and I like how there is an inner mesh liner that can be popped out to be brought to the laundry room. The colors are nice and as shown in the picture but the stitching around the animals is pretty sloppy.
B0052QYLUM|5|Works great.  Portable.  Long battery life.  Screen is a little small for garnd parents.
B002R2BFVM|3|We have a wide space between our kitchen and living room and one of the walls is at an angle. I looked everywhere to find a baby gate that would work for this opening.  This was pretty much the only one I could find.  That being said, it does exactly what I need it to.  Even though it is not a rigid gate (plastic, wood or metal) the thick vinyl is heavy enough to make this gate sturdy.  It has stood up to our toddler and our two dogs for the most part.  When you install the gate, I recommend screwing it into a stud in your wall or directly into a wooden door frame.  The first time we installed it we did not do that and learned our lesson.  Our large, energetic dog got excited one day, jumped up on it and ripped it right out of the wall.  Oops.  Since then we screwed it into a stud we have had no more issues.  If you have baseboards you will have to raise the gate up a bit from the floor and use the special baseboard converter parts that are sold separately.  We did not buy those at first and then realized they were necessary so then had to wait another week for that order to come in before we could install the gate.  The way we had to install it, there are about 3 inches of space between the bottom of the gate and the floor.  This is just enough space for a toy to get pushed under or roll under.  That can be a bit annoying at times.  Also it is enough space for our small dachshund to squeeze under, so this gate is useless for keeping her out of the kitchen when we want to.  The gate is also difficult to operate when holding a baby.  You have to push down and turn the release button to pull the gate out or release the gate from the closed position.  I'm not sure how this could be improved but it is difficult to do with one hand, which parents often are.  Overall the gate does what we need it to do in a unique space where other gates wouldn't have worked I just wish it was easier to use.
B00COQGR00|5|My girlfriend 2 year old sister loved it
B00EELWQL2|5|Have used these before -- great product
B000306A3S|5|I purchased this mobile as a christmas present for my new baby. I could honestly say it was one of the best decisions I've made!!  She absolutely loves this.  I was able to clip it to her bassinet.  As suggested on the packaging, I first had the mobile turned towards the black and red pictures and now that she is almost 3 months I flipped them over and have the little stuffed toys hanging down.  The music is great and almost always puts her to sleep after a short time of playing.   I also purchased other Tiny love products and they have all proven to be terrific!!!  Unfortunately the weather has been so bad this winter Ihavent taken her out much in the car so have not had the opportunity to try this out with the car seat but Im sure it will work wonders.
B006VZ50BC|5|I love these. They are extra large leaving a good amount of fabric to get a good swaddle. Better than the tiny verisons you get at most stores for twice the price. Nice thin material and well made.
B00190LWRA|4|We wanted a compromise between a compact umbrella stroller and a large, durable, one.  This stroller gives us just that.  It's rugged and provides a smooth ride.  Easy seat adjust. Easy setup and collapse. Fits nicely in the trunk --smaller than a golf bag.  Only complaint is the canopy.  It can detach easily during stroller setup/collapse; and it only has 2 positions (expanded/collapsed).  The height of handles is fine for both my wife and I. I am 5'11\\" and she's 5'3\\".  I don't have to hunch over. Overall, this has been a great stroller.  We've had it about 2 1/2 months now.
B008TWGMBW|2|This is a poorly designed product - I bought it for the attractive lines and unobtrusive (white) color, but beyond the visual appeal, it is very flawed.  1) It slips off the faucet easily, even with a shower diverter on the faucet, hence... 2) my daughter was pulling it off as soon as she was able to reach it and immediately... 3) took a big bite into it with her new teeth (this is not necessarily the product's fault, but heads up - an eager teether can chomp right into this foam) 4) the middle seam is slowly splitting, making it even easier for the cover to slide off the faucet.  Because it is so lightweight and flimsy, I question how much protection it would provide in the event of a slip or fall - yes, that what parental supervision is for, but accidents can happen despite our best efforts.  This product is a near throw-away, and I'll be shopping for a replacement.
B004ZLLC70|4|I have several sets of the Trend Lab burp cloths and have been using them for 3 months. The cotton side is bright and the patterns are cute. The terry cloth side is nicely absorbent. The instructions say to hang dry, but who has time for that? I put them through the washer/dryer with everything else and they have shrunk a bit, but overall have held up well to repeated uses/washings. They are big enough to cover a shoulder or tuck under a chin, but they are not going to give you a lot of room for error. There's no beating a cloth diaper over the shoulder for value, but these are a cute alternative.
B001W2R6IY|5|These come with the white hard part, too not just the plastic valves. The description didn't explain. It's ok since I just need the plastic (transparent)venting part, not the white part. Love the born free bottles! Great products.
B008W1KB62|3|Finish is typicall of most mass produced chinese products, not good but not awful, the mirrors work as described and do fit well.
B000LXQVA4|5|BEST MONEY SPENT...SHE STAYS IN IT FOR T LEAST 20 MINUTES INDEPENDENTLY
B006T89X9Q|1|We bought this because of the claims that it would be easier for breast fed babies to use. Our baby breast feeds very well and we introduced this as her first bottle experience at 4 weeks old. She had a horrible time trying to feed from this nipple - she gulped in a lot of air and was spilling milk out of her mouth constantly. She was so fussy trying to use this nipple, but when we switched her to a regular nipple she was fine. This was her first bottle so there was no way she was used to using anything other than feeding from the breast. I wouldn't waste your money on this product when the regular nipples work fine.
B00GS1H9XG|4|Very simple but effective design.<br />It's light weight and quite secure with 3 latch points (one at the top and one on either side).<br />It reclines by swinging out a pendulum with a flat lozenge of plastic on its end underneath the seat.  If the seat is forward facing and the pendulum is forward, then the lozenge tilts the seat back.  Genius.<br />There's very little padding but the seat is quite comfortable.  My son cried bitterly in his last seat and in this one he's all smiles and sleeps a lot better.<br /><br />This one works forward and rear facing and the straps are nice, the buckle easy to open.<br /><br />With all the money I've spent on a safe vehicle it feels wasteful to then spend hundreds of dollars on a baby seat that can withstand a direct collision with a car on its own.  Too much fear-based marketing in play.  This seat is ideal and I'm quite happy with my purchase.
B0000DEW8N|5|This booster seat has been the most used item we received as a shower gift. From vacations at the beach to dinner out at a local restaurant it comes in handy. We keep ours in the trunk of the car to always have it handy. Its easily portable and light weight. You never have to worry about the cleanliness of the high chair provided at restaurants or even if they have one. A bib tucks neatly under the tray lid for convenience.
B004DFO57M|5|Work very well for little tiny baby fingers. I feel confident using them on my baby from when he was one month old and up.
B009DSTVLO|5|best diaper bag out there. I am telling everyone. It holds a whole day worth of stuff. Yes all 6 large size bottles fit, 16 diapers, three outfits, toys, wipes, my wallet, pacifier wipes, can of formula, bottle warmer and much much more. I have over stuffed it and the zippers seem like they will never break. Its comparable to the quality of an L.L.Bean backpack. I am sad they don't make these new anymore. Get them before they are gone. They are worth every penny.
B00277SWT0|5|Folds up with the stroller, even when full (unlike the stroller's undercarriage baskets). Used for a trip to Disney World and had no issues. Was invaluable for being able to cart around a bunch of stuff (e.g., snacks, cups, & shoes).
B00GRS9XEI|5|I bought this when my LO was around 6 months old! He loves it and still uses it at almost 9 months old. He got a hold of moving the sit around. My only complaint was that I wish it was foldable.
B00I3ZIE5W|5|Works as described. Good product.
B0011URFRE|5|Best seat we owned, I suggest it to all my friends.  Very we'll built, seven years and going strong with two of these seats.
B001T7NWOE|3|I bought this for my daughter and she likes it! Until she received a Sophie giraffe as a gift. She loves Sophie and prefers her over Chan.
B00HR5TYOO|5|I initially bought this for a plane ride. Perfect choice, and now my husband uses it all the time. It's one of the best purchases we've made and with another on the way, we might skip the big carrier and just go straight to buying another Boba Air, when he's big enough. We have no fitting problems, but sometimes my sons  cartoonish fat little legs get a line in them. I'm 5'2&#34; with a short torso and large chest and my husband is a slim 6', if that helps. We also used this on a 2 hour that turned to 6 hour hike in Arizona. Everyone stayed decently cool. Much better and more comfortable than some other carriers.
B003ULP59M|4|Sags a little more forward than I would like it too. But it still works just fine.
B009UOPHB4|5|I set this up by myself for my daughter when it arrived. It only took me about an hour and the instructions were super easy to follow and understand. She loves her new bed and so do I.
B001B1FHK0|5|One of my twins started crying very time it came time to rinse his hair.  For a while he would allow me to lay him across my lap with his head over the tub while I rinsed his hair out with cups of water.  For some reason, he no longer liked that and getting him to lean his head back was not happening.  He was pretty apprehensive about letting me put this on him but once I pointed got it on I was able to rinse his hair pretty well.  After a few days of me pointing out that there was no water in his eyes after I took this &#34;hat&#34; off he became less apprehensive about letting me put it on.  There's a little bit of conditioner left on the hair just above his hair when I'm done but that's no big deal to me since I usually apply a leave in conditioner to his hair after washing anyway.  Contrary to other reviews, the person doesn't need to tilt their head back for this to work.  My son refuses to sit down in the bath or tilt his head back and this works fine.  I just position the splash gaurd so that the handle is just below his hairline and it works fine.
B004HMQPJ2|5|I first came across this concept while looking at Boon's line of feeding products but wasn't wanting to pay $10 for a spoon. When I was browsing in a store I came across Munchkin's version for half the price and decided to get it for my 22 month old patient with feeding issues. This thing is solid gold. Everything comes apart for easy washing. You can lock the spoon to \\"closed\\" so if Mr. Grabby gets a hand on it while you have to get up he can't make an enormous mess. Also useful for travel, don't have to worry about it getting squished in the diaper bag, don't have to take a baby bowl, and a cap to keep messes contained until you get home to clean it. It's BPA free and it gives you the ability to quickly shovel food into the mouth of a very hungry or (in my case) a very distractable baby. This Registered Nurse gives it 5 stars!!!!
B002MXP3SM|5|These clips are fantastic. I have them hooked up to my double stroller and I can easily throw my gigantic and heavy diaper bag onto them. I never worry that it won't support the weight. I have a few other single strollers that I use when I don't have both kids with me and I am purchasing another pair for the other stroller. These are also perfect for paper grocery bags, reusable canvas totes and key rings. I absolutely don't know how I lived without these clips!
B000JOOGR0|1|This cup was recommended to me when I was transitioning my daughter off the bottle.  She definitely did the best with this cup over all other sippy cups (I have a cabinet full - of one of every brand), and I noticed her milk intake definitely increased when drinking from the nuby.  But the darn things leaks all over the place.  I thought I had a \\"bad batch\\", so I threw them out and bought new - just to find the same problem.  I'm planning to use them just a while longer until I am confident my daughter is used to the sippy cup, then all of them are going in the trash.
B001OM3YL0|5|This has been the most fantastic stroller!  We purchased it when we wanted to downgrade from the full size car seat stroller combo (the Chicco Keyfit system).  We originally purchased a simply umbrella stroller with the lap belt style, but our baby kept trying his hardest to lean forward and touch the ground so I was terrified at some point it would flip!  Also, there was no storage area.  The Chicco 0.6 capri has everything you could ask for AND it is so light and portable you can wake it anywhere!  The seat also reclines somewhat and sort of forms around your baby so that when they are sleepy they can lean back instead of their head flopping all around!  Great stroller!!!
B0033PRFZ2|5|I'm in love with this crib set! The wall hangings are bigger then what I imagined which is a great thing! I figured they would be tiny and pointless to hang on the wall. Everything is so beautiful and really great quality. The colors are vibrant, but no overwhelming and they all cordinate really well with one another. LOVE IT!!!
B007C52ZEA|4|Not a super big fan of the shape. Why aren't they just round? They're cute, but if they move at all they become ineffective.
B004CQGD7W|1|Do you see the kid on the box?  That was my boy after I proudly stuck his plate to the suction cup and walked away to get his drink.  We have a wood table, so it might work better on laminate or slick surfaces.  Very disappointed!
B00GJGA338|5|Cute, compact umbrella stroller.  Perfect to keep in the trunk for shopping trips.
B0012LZD5I|5|Anyone who complains about these is crazy! They aren't terribly thick and sturdy, but for the price, they are awesome! I would say my 5 month old has a pretty thick neck and they're not too tight at all! They have something like plastic on the back, but it isn't heavy. For a heavy slobbering kid, I can usually have one on for up to 6 hours. They have veto, but it is a very small area do it doesn't scratch the neck. This is just all around a great buy!
B003AO6ZQ6|5|When my baby started rolling and wouldn't stay in her bath chair anymore I didn't know what to do, because she couldn't sit up on her own unassisted yet (and I didn't love the idea of ALWAYS taking a bath with her). I found this tub and jumped on it! It assisted her sitting and she LOVED it! So did I. It's great for traveling too!
B00BSXH7RC|2|ok...
B00UXK5AQ6|3|Nice, but the packaging was not the best, the little book was not glued very well, and damaged the bottom piece.
B006I0R3EM|5|Great cup!  Works as described
B000V96W0W|4|mixar works well enough. but.. the motor does not last long. i got 3 months from my last one. for 5 bucks i cant expect much. i will buy another and it should last me till we are done formula feeding. expect to replace batteries every month and the unit every 3 months. dont worry about button difficulty just remember to hold it properly. trial and error will evidence that.
B0010SGZEG|4|I love those buddies and they add a lot of fun to the bath time. My son loves when I am spraying on him and giggles a lot. However one of the boddies didn't work properly. It was taking the water in but didn't squirt it out. But having so many, it's not a bog deal. Love them.
B00MJ8K092|4|Bamboo charcoal 5 layer is THE most absorbent stench resistant insert I've found. I love them. I decided to give these a try, and while they work, they're...... fluffy.  If you need inserts to go inside the diaper instead of as a pocket, you might like these, but they make his daytime diapers unnecessarily puffy. A bit awkward for a baby that has started cruising, but it doesn't seem to be impeding him at all.  Edit: I've tried them inside and out of the pocket. They still work fine, but they're still fluffy after several washes.  They lack the middle-ish stitching the Happy Ending's bamboo charcoal diaper inserts have and come out with a thicker feel for the same absorbency.  They are no heavier and are still fine for what they are.  I prefer my other inserts to the fluffy, though.  It's just more bulky feeling, and not just at the elastic part.
B001BX5154|2|For the price I paid (fifteen bucks), I could have made this myself and saved money. I didn't expect it to be a piece of paper that's laminated. Also, the manufactuer makes you stick on the velcro backing for the stars which was annoying. The \\"certificate\\" that's provide is just a flimsy piece of paper which you could print from your computer. It's not even made from card stock or certificate paper. I guess this would be good for someone who doesn't own a computer. ...And the book, it's a cheap 5 x 5 paper book. It reminds me of the free books they provide sometimes in a Chick-fil-A kids meal.  The story/illustrations is only mediocre. I won't be buying any charts from Kenson Kids.
B00A0FGIRO|5|Fits nicely on vista stroller with little adapter that come with car seat. Base installation is simple and overall this is quality product.
B00020L78M|4|arrived like the speed of light since it qualified for next day shipping.  Works great other than having to be careful when you fold it up. Be sure you fold the panels exactly like it wants you to or you will do like I did and break a piece at the connector.  Still works great though.  I bought it to use at the lake with my dogs.  Although no fault of the play yard, my 5lb dachshund can almost climb to the top of it.  However, my other (bigger) dogs cannot.
B00SCJOIU4|3|the look so cute on my daughter but in my opinion the bow is to small
B006V84MWM|1|This cup is by far the worst straw sippy I own, and I have tried pretty much every brand. I like the old version of this same cup, these new ones leak like crazy! The best straw sippy I have that is pretty close to leak free is the Think Baby straw cup! it's more expensive, but worth it in my opinion!
B0042D69WY|5|Found this on Amazon for much less then at local stores, very nice swing my grand daughter loves it it has six differant speeds and can rotate to swing in differant directions with music.
B001QIN6ME|2|in 2mo time I bought the warmer for disposible whips--it does not keep whips warm and then I bought this one. I loved it the first few weeks but then mold mold mold.  I cleaned it every week like suggested and I only used distilled water when making the solution.  I was even so careful I used gloves when making the sol and rolling up the wipes and putting them in the machine. If I did all of that and got mold I just don't know.<br />I love the idea of the warmer and for you out there I was using this baby product for an elderly person that was ill. Many baby products work very well for sick bed bound people.
B00B8EQ4IY|3|They are okay. When my son wakes in the morning, he's normally dry. These tend to get too hot for him and stick to him from all the sweat.  When he does wet, the pants are soaked from front to back and so is his bed. There is no way we could fit another layer in the pants due to them already looking bulky and he's already getting too hot. The pants also tend to keep the urine smell in them if you don't soak them prior to washing for awhile.
B000J6CDY6|5|I received this as a gift and my baby settles down amazingly with it. It's super soft and it looks so cute attached to his crib. His favorite one is the second one which is the stream (I think). Personally, don't buy the big one. This one is just as good. The only thing is it only plays nature sounds.<br />I purchased this one for my hair stylist who is expecting a baby girl.
B005XJ2VGE|5|Everything was great. Exactly what I wanted.
B00KC1JG2A|5|Love this necklace & so does my little one! Not only is it cute but it also doesn't snag my hair! Very happy with this purchase!
B00K7J7D3Q|2|I was very excited to use this because of the design, which I fell in love with, until I received it and realized that what they advertised is not what you get. I thought I was going to be the brown/pink shown in the image and I received a gray/yellow cover. It still serves its purpose but my expectations were a little high for this.
B001TIZCPK|4|Yes it turns purple but it never goes back to a normal color and it turns purple in the regular light inside my house. I still thought they were cool though!
B000A796WG|3|The concept for this product is good but it had a broken wall stopper and the only time I have used it my 6 pound dog managed to knock it down rendering it useless
B007ILOXA2|2|This item was much smaller than I imagined and broke within two days of getting it. Make sure you read description.
B0011MQLM2|4|The highchair is nice and pretty solid except for the tray. The tray is flimsy and comes off to easily.
B004DFO57M|4|These work quite well right from the start, as long as you can get those little hands and feet held still long enough to use them.
B00GEF7LMA|5|Great deal on the cups! This is the only cup my son will drink from. They did take a few weeks for delivery.
B008WNV4J8|1|I sent this back bc of the plastic exterior material. I thought the price was great but turned out to be cheap instead of a good value.
B001QVG9YS|2|My son hated this bottle. He would try so hard to drink from it, but the nipple would collapse in his mouth making it impossible for getting any formula. It also leaks...I don't recommend this bottle.
B00DZUU4QW|5|Great Product
B00428AKWE|3|Got this for a gift... It's cute, but the color was more see-though than I thought it would be.
B000ROO88O|4|I think this is a needed, necessary product for the stroller. I just wish that this came with the original stroller itself. Doesn't make sense to sell a twin stroller which just one of these.
B007UK1CDM|4|Works well, but has a vibration as it goes.
B00F020KM6|5|Best last minute thing I added to a shower I hosted for a co worker. The color matched her wedding and without these we would have had some awkward silence moments. It kept guests busy while eating lunch and having the bride read aloud was great. Some were hilarious others sweet but all guests asked where I got them.
B003P6PGZ0|5|It's cute, it's roomy, and convient to carry on your back or shoulder. Just wish the back pack strap was a little longer.
B00553XPMM|5|Love these trays!! So much easier to use than the bags and less waste!! Also love that they are good to the environment and safe from harmul toxins! I always buy these as a baby shower gift for mom!!!
B000FCW15U|5|My 3-month old grandson LOVES this mobile. If he is fussy I just have to put him on his changing table to look at the mobile. As soon as he sees the lion's face he starts to smile and coo! One of the best items I have boaught for him!
B00MJJJ6KA|4|I have 2 of these for each grandbaby and they work great. They still drool alot but they don't hurt as bad and don't cry as much.
B0042FWN40|5|I love the mooma! My 5 month old started tugging and pulling at everything a few weeks ago while he was nursing.  I bought a mooma  and he loves it! I've already bought another for a friend. :)
B005QU55EA|5|I got a lot of different baby proofing items and found the design of my cabinets was terrible for the typical plastic hook stopper things.  This string is so simple and has been the most effective of the items I got!  Plus being the easiest to install and remove and not being so ugly.  Baby-proofing tools are not universal.  It all depends on how your cabinets (or whatever it is you are baby-proofing) are designed.  This is great for the knobs.
B001GQ2P78|4|I use this every night for my toddler.  We used to have serious sleep issues and I feel like this played a part in helping us overcome those.  The blue light is bright enough to keep the room lit but is unobtrusive to sleep.  The songs are repetitive and can have some sharp sounds in them, but the kiddo doesn't seem to mind.  He knows when the light and music are on, it's bedtime.
B0006FHFYS|2|I had to rate this swing as a 2, because the motorized swing mechanism made a clicking noise that was so loud.  Before purchasing the unit in October 2005, I tried to operate the display model at Target, but the batteries were dead.  The swing had a nice fit and finish once assembled at home, but after putting batteries into the swing and turning it on, my wife and I couldn't believe the racket that the swing made.  Before purchasing this unit, make sure that you actually listen to one operate at the store before purchasing it.  After returning the unit to Target, we tried a  display model Ocean Wonders Cradle Swing at BABYSRUS and it made the same noise as the one we returned.  <br /> <br />We ended up purchasing a Graco swing at BABYSRUS and are happier with it.
B0038JDVCE|5|Thanks
B001QIN6ME|5|just buy it, your child will be happier, and you will get peed on less.
B002RIII48|1|The books are great but the feeders are not the feeders should have a flat piece that pushes the food up not a big round thing in the middle of it cause most of the food is wasted I do not recommend the feeders to anybody
B002GWW20Q|2|We bought this on a recommendation, only to find they weren't glass as expected. Make sure you buy the glass ones elsewhere!!! It is a much better product.
B004B6FJNC|5|I'm very happy with this purchase. I was looking for the stroller on many websites and at the stores. I'm so glad I decide to choose Roan Rocco Classic Pram. It's all you need. I don't want to repeat everything what the other customers say, just recommend it to everyone.
B001CWHRBA|5|My newborn likes to be close to me during the day, and this wrap gives me to opportunity to have her with me, but out of my arms so I still am able to do things around the house. As soon as I wrap her up she sleeps like a rock. I prefer the wrap over other carriers because her legs are tucked away and out of harms way, e.g. they don't get pinched at the kitchen counter-top, dangle into the sink or get bumped.<br />At first it was a bit cumbersome to get it right and to situate her comfortably, but know we're both pros at it.
B00ISS2JPK|4|It will get the job done for a child...so I am not complaining the price was good and the padding not so good but if you need a seat and bang for your buck this will do it.  The purple is nice after all.
B006ZVV0R0|4|This is great for my britax stroller (I'be never had to use it in a convertible car seat), but not for a hot day, my baby boy liked it, but when its hot and sunny - take it out - will make your baby feel more hot
B0078LO5DC|5|It is totally what I was expecting.  My niece was about to be born and I had been looking for one of these like crazy.  I found a few but they were all so pricey compared to this one.  This one is cute and the cover is removable which I found very convenient.
B00HIFM9NQ|4|Only the time of answer
B000LZDUJ2|4|Installation of these covers was a breeze on our '07 Toyota Camry.  Basically slip the elastic band over the seatback and affix the ties to the headrest - doesn't get much simpler.  For the price, they offer decent coverage/protection.  The only negatives I had were that the covers weren't nearly as wide as the seatbacks, and therefore leaves some of the seat partially exposed.  Obviously, these are a \\"universal fit\\" product, and cannot take seat width into account for each vehicle.  Secondly, I have concerns on their long-term durability in cold weather.  It seems to me that during the cold, winter months, the plastic material will be prone to freezing, and ultimately cracking should they get hit/kicked before the vehicle is warmed up.  Hopefully this concern will be unfounded, but only time will tell.
B00EQJ6D8O|2|I had the same issue as the other reviewer... the top buckle fit just fine but the bottom buckle didn't even come CLOSE to fitting around my son's torso, and he's only 15 months old! I don't know how the heck this is supposed to fit older toddlers. Other than that it is a nice backpack harness...  so if your kid is super skinny, then maybe it's worth a try for you.
B008D1F9MW|5|Bought for my soon to be granddaughter.
B00MYS3PCQ|5|The sheets are so soft! My son loves these sheets.
B000UO78TM|5|My little one likes to wear this as a backpack but the leash is a little too much for an early walker. Super cute though
B00EBCEOYQ|2|We received the Golden Yellow Twill fitted crib sheet as a gift from our registry.  The color is slightly more orange than golden yellow.  We had originally registered for 2 more of the sheets given the variety and colorful patterns, but after receiving one crib sheet, we were disappointed with the quality of the cotton percale fabric and unregistered for the other 2 sheets.  As a few other reviewers have commented, it's fairly rough fabric, even after a few trips through the washer/dryer.  We ended up purchasing jersey knit sheets from Target which are much softer.  The crib sheet does fit well over the Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams mattress, but I would not purchase again given the poor quality of the fabric.
B00569H3V4|5|The smell is more like granny perfume than baby powder, but it doesn't smell that way for long, so I don't guess it matters that much. I like these better than the Sassy sacks just because of the way they're packaged. These are in a roll, which makes them super easy to get out of the box.
B00008BR9S|5|We just had a grandaughter born in Sept and a granson born in Oct and are expecting another grandson in April. I bought the turtle, the monkey and trotter for them for Christmas. The 2 babies that are already here love theirs and so do I. These are the cutest toys for young babies and are so colorful and easy for young hands to hold. In fact, I'm so pleased that I purchased Celeste, the frog and the butterfly for them as Easter gifts. Also purchased the puppy, trotter and the fishbowl for my house. Wish they had toys like this when I was raising my babies.
B00I2IACI2|5|I love this sleep sack! I've owned 2 prior to this and have had no complaints. I've heard of great things of this company, and they hold true to their standards.<br />This tog is the right one for average temperatures all year round.
B0009RG8R8|5|This gate ROCKS! It is totally adjustable to fit any weird sized opening (such as we have) and my daughter does not even attempt to barrel through it as she does with our superyard. The swinging gate works awesome, though it takes some using to get loosened up and easy to close. The only caveat is the screws. I agree with the last review, ditch the screws that come with it and get some that are right for your wall. The ones they sent are too short and pulled right out of our studs. And the plastic wall anchors they send are useless!!!
B004GJXM74|5|These are so awesome! Only way my daughter will sleep through the night is swaddled.  These make swaddling a snap!
B007TB1ZN4|5|The 360 degree cup is really good, not their own water control for children that can be very good to prevent water from spilling.
B004GY8A58|5|Amazing
B004O6M4M8|5|\\"Perfect For Our Needs\\"<br />Purchased this mattress as our newest addition may be asthmatic and we read that this mattress has been tested and received the highest grades for air quality.  It also features a dual firmness.  One side is firmer than the other, which allows for great flexibility.  So far we have not had any issues and we are very satisfied with this mattress.  Recommend for any family.  And our little guy prefers the \\"firmer\\" side.
B000KI8XXI|5|My daughter is 10 months and exclusively breast fed and refused ALL bottles until this little gem!! Amazing!!!
B0057IQG4O|4|cute and comfortable but the zipper seems to thread apart with just minor tension
B008HPP7XA|5|Love the mattress.  It is firm yet soft.  My 2 month old Grandson will love it as I will be watching him when his Mom goes to work.
B001F913N8|3|We tried similar sippy cups from the grocery store before we bought this. The grocery store ones were cheaper in price and material but the holes were smaller so they leaked less. When I remember, I try not to let baby run around wih anything else other than water in the tilty because it easily sprays liquid when shaken and it will also leak more when tossed and left upside down on the floor.<br /><br />The tilty cups were better at letting baby reach more of the drink so less drinks are wasted in that way. Also because of the tilt it holds less. We would have to fill the other cup all the way to give baby good access to the drinks.<br /><br />Tilty cups were also easier to clean by hand washing especially with the spout. They are more annoying for the dishwashers sometimes because the underside would collect dirt and water even with the drain holes. The drain holes are so small, food would get stuck and block the water while in the wash.<br /><br />The grocery store cups came with this great stopped you put on the spout that I wish the tilty would come with. From reviews, it looks like he separate lid you can buy is not so good. I wanted to buy the other lid types also but I am discouraged from doing so because they are more expensive than the cups with lids!<br /><br />Lastly, baby is still confused sometimes about how the cup should go. Sometimes she tries to drink from it while it's upside down and she can't get anything out of it. I don't know if that's a good or bad thing. I just help her turn the cup around.<br /><br />Overall a good learning cup.
B00208KJ0G|5|If you've got teeth marks on the crib, this is the stuff.  We went from gnawed wood to undisturbed fabric in no time.  Doesn't seem like they like chewing on the wood when this is covering is.  Do keep in mind that this is just for the short ends, if you want to cover the three sides, you need to find the other guard by the same company.
B001OM3YL0|5|Great Stroller. Its not too short so my husband can push it too with out having to hunch over and it fits great in our car. I would totally recommend this stroller and I would buy this again. Chicco is a great brand.
B009036O3A|5|I absolutely love this piece!  I bought it for my 3 year old son's room.  We organized items in the drawers (pretend food, legos, flashcards and puzzle pieces).  He's able to dump the drawers and put them back when he's done.  It's sturdy and easy to assemble.  We also bought the t bin storage cubby and placed this piece on top.  We love it.
B0007GDOF0|3|This mobile doesn't fit on bigger cribs and it goes dead fast. EVERY remote turns this thing on and off! It is so aggravating to be watching tv and change the channel and the thing turns on and off. Make sure to have it in a room where you won't be watching tv. It is cute though and my son loves it.
B002FQKB2Y|5|Great way to store stuffies. good quality net and I love the chain. I was concerned about the clips being to cheap to hold the heavy animals but they actually work quite well.
B00AVV5DGO|5|Was exactly as pictured.  Bought this for my granddaughter who likes to feel the silky binding on her blanket.  This has silky ears and the entire inside is silky.  Love it and I hope she does too.
B00E8KJYNC|5|Works great! It is important to clean it daily as instructed, but otherwise is a must have!
B004VL2VRO|5|Very good baby monitor
B0072YIEQY|5|Excellent quality!  Much better than I expected.  I can't wait to use it.  I had an owl theme, so this was a perfect fit.
B00M9I6WW6|5|It's as cute as it looks and adjustable enough to fit me as well as my wife. Came with a little carrying pouch that it is impossible to get it back inside of though.
B00M2F0OYS|2|Not as good as the old model MBP36BU - which was discontinued (what a shame!) The video streaming seems to be disrupted all the time..
B003N49ML8|4|My 1-year old refused to drink from regular sippy cups, but liked using straws, so I got him this cup and am getting more of them right now. The straw is soft on the outside, the cup is easy to clean both inside and out - so far I found no crevice I couldn't get into to clean. Ease of cleaning is the main reason I got this cup and not the one with the flip-top lid, and so far I am happy with this choice (I mostly use the cup indoors where it can be rinsed quickly when dropped). My now 15-month old son has recently discovered that this is really not a no-spill cup - when he holds it upside-down and taps the straw on the sofa, floor or his highchair tray, the liquid makes pretty rings, splashes and puddles. :) He loves this discovery so much, and so far I haven't found a better way to handle this than to take the cup away when he gets to the most expensive furniture. Just a warning to parents - try not to let your baby discover this little trick!
B002V87MJQ|4|Good play pen and easy to assemble. My baby likes the activity board but she doesn't like the door closed. She started to cry if she found the door closed, so we decided to place the play pen around the window and cables connected a computer and printer. It is very helpful for us that our daughter cannot get close there. The picture on the activity board looks weird because the taste of each animals are very different.
B00AWLZDH2|3|I bought this right after having my baby.  I tried to assemble it according to the directions and in my sleep deprived state I inserted a piece incorrectly and I had to have my husband work at it to remove and then assemble correctly. I am using the Lansinoh breast milk bag and they work fine.
B009S2GRDA|5|Love this carrier!!!  Material is soft like your favourite T but strong enough to hold baby.  Many ways to carry baby depending on age/stage.  No hassle arranging wrap; its fool proof with its two loops.  Mostly Iove how compact it can be.  When I'm not using it I can roll it up and toss it into the diaper bag and its about the size of a small fanny pac.  Its easy to wash as well and I toss it regularly into my normal laundry.
B007CK2ST2|5|we have a bunch of these already for our first daughter - and she LOVES them!!! So we got a new set with different animals for our new baby to have and love as well... great gift too!!! I actually like the napping blanket more then the little lovies but that is just my and my daughters preference.. both great items and gifts
B003KMWATY|5|This product is quality we really liked me and my wife this will look good on my unborn child this, I hope to continue buying in the future with amazon
B0035RQF54|4|Worked great for French doors that I didn't want to penetrate with my drill bit.
B001TK32M8|2|i like it but had to return it since it had a small hole in it
B0030INRF4|5|This is a great basic and inexpensive changing table pad.  It is not a great size/thickness for our changing table and it is hard to find a cover for it, but we use it on the floor of our living room for changes away from the changing table, so those things don't matter to us.  It holds up well and we're able to stash it behind the end table or tv cabinet when not in use.  It is soft for the baby and wipes clean easier.  If you're looking for something to use on a changing pad, please measure first and realize that the covers you own will likely be too big as this is flat.  We're happy with the purchase!
B001RNV6NO|5|My baby never took to pacifiers which was a real bummer. I can't tell you pros and cons but I gave it 5 stars because it's still really cute.
B00S0RF7IK|5|My 4 year old loves this seat. He feels cool, and I feel confident he's safe.
B000066CMV|2|This really is a great pump! It works very fast and easily, with no pain. However, the pieces that connect the bottle to the pump handle break easily after just a month or so of use. The plastic is brittle and that area takes a lot of stress. I have now broken two pumps. You can't imagine the frustration I felt when I struggled to pump a bottle for my screaming son, and the bottle spilled all over the rug as it snapped off (twice). <br />I would highly recommend this to someone who doesn't plan on breastfeeding long, but would like something for emergencies.
B003V6V4EQ|4|I loved this baby blind. I found it very easy to use. However, if you want to watch you baby feed, it is not the most convenient. It usually folds down so that I cannot see my baby's face. This is not a big deal to me so I think it is great.<br /><br />I did not use the storage bag since I had to reshape it to get it to fit in the bag.
B00H4NYB56|5|Very easy to clean, no leaking and great for colic babies.  Love the design.  Recomand this product for all the moms!!!
B002UD65XQ|5|Very nicely made!
B00C64L39A|5|color, size, material all great.  Only thing that a didn't expect was they were not exactly round at the bottom - whole shape just slightly off to one side.  Probably never be notice by someone walking in the room.
B002UD65Q8|5|This fit my Graco Pack N Play perfectly. Not sure why others said it was too small or too tight? it is meant to be stretched tightly over the mattress for safety reasons.
B005O1IU8O|3|My lil one still likes this toy a year later. Hope it holds his interest for a lil longer. Good price.
B0012J1ZZM|5|Great little recieving blanket. Although my grand son has already out grown it he won't leave home with out it. Like Linus from Charlie Brown.LOL!!! Excellent quality and price. Highly recommend.
B00KSAV506|4|We are a little disappointed in the fact the yoh cannot fill the baking dish more than 1/3 of the way full or it leaks everywhere.  We tried 3 different times using the directions and came out with only one cake gtantrd my 2 year old ♡it
B000CS7S8W|5|These spoons are great for our baby's hands.  Due to the wideness, we waited until she was about a year old so they will fit in her mouth. They hold up well, too. We have a set that our five-year-old still uses, and they are in good shape after going through the dishwasher 2-3 times weekly for the last few years.
B000056W4V|5|Concerned about the chemicals in plastic bottles?  Me too!  I was thrilled to find that Amazon had these glass ones in stock.  Now I don't have to worry about warming my breastmilk for the babysitter or my husband to give my little one.  A great buy!
B005PK1G76|5|This fits really well on our city mini.  It works well for keys, pacifiers, burp clothes, sunglasses, toys and a soda for mom.  The holder we had on our old stroller always caused the liquid to spill.  This seems to work much better.
B00F5DXIJC|3|Im bummed because my son likes this specific flavor and I cant always find it in stores. But when I received the item, it was the blue one that was a different flavor, and not the pink one. Im annoyed because I opened it before realizing it was different. WIsh it was the one that was pictured. Hope to return and get the correct one.
B0009OLSYO|5|Got this potty today and I am so glad that I am finally able to throw the old one in the bin. <br /> <br />This potty is a simple design and so easy to keep clean. <br /> <br />My daughter is just 3 and small for her age, but she fits on it fine. She loves her new potty! She doesn't sit on it for ages, just sits down does her business and off she goes. <br /> <br />Thank you for saving my sanity. Finally potty time clean up is simple and easy.
B0031E1GEG|5|We have tried what seems like dozens of different sippy cups in our quest to wean our one-year-old off of bottles.  Most sippy cups require a lot of suction to get any liquid out, so our daughter would just give up.  Other sippy cups have to be tipped up at the right angle so that the liquid will come out.  We were about to give up altogether until we tried this ZoLi BOT sippy cup.  This cup is a wonder of design!  The straw means that our baby can get the liquid out of the cup without having to tip the cup upwards.  But, at the same time, the weight on the bottom of the straw means that the straw will still work even if she tips the cup all the way upwards.  The genius of the weighted straw is that it follows whereever the liquid is in the cup, so the baby can always get some liquid out.  Brilliant!  We also love that the straw is soft because our baby really jams the straw into her mouth, and a hard plastic straw would cause scratches to her mouth.  Additionally, it doesn't take much suction to get liquid out of the straw.  At last we found a sippy cup that our baby likes!

B008PUQ1JQ|4|My baby is 7lbs, 21 inches and 5 weeks old. The infant carrier insert works well with her as long as I  fold and tuck the top part below the top portion of the outer layer of the carrier to give her head more support. I live in Phoenix and even though it is only March, the insert is a bit hot and I need to take my baby out after 1 hour. But the quality of the material and the feel of it is great and baby seems to like it.
