0345350499|5.0|This book is an excellent fantasy epic and is written extremely well except for many repititions in the story line.  As the only plot is the rise and fall of the court of King Arthur; I think that Ms.Bradley did an excellent job on the recreations of what it must have been like.  I would that we had proof that the Court and reign of Arthur did exist.  I thouroughly enjoyed reading The Mists of Avalon and felt that the feelings expressed by all of the characters are written so that they seem very real.  I think that any person who enjoys fantasy, history, and good books would appreciate this work.

0875847706|4.0|The Zander's redefine the way you look at things and view situations.  I found the book to be a combination of art/creativity and psycho-analysis. Some of the principles I had a hard time really owning.<br />It reminds me a bit of Zen or Tao.  Being in the present, not assigning blame, recognizing that is the way things are...<br />I couldn't read the book in one sitting.  I found that it requires a lot of thought and reflection.  Parts that I found inspirational were the white papers that were written by the musicians in response to a request from the conductor.<br />Some of the principles seemed to really line up well with the popular book from a few years ago &quot;7 spiritual laws of success&quot; by Deepak Chopra.<br />I would like to hear the authors read this as a book-on-tape, because I found myself thinking about things while I was trying to read.  In a nutshell, the book says &quot;put your life into a different playing field, Don't think win-win, think about making a contribution or about making a difference.&quot;
0800141849|2.0|Well' [cough]' it's not bad' [hem. Haw.] OK. I'm a Streisand fan. Funny Girl, Yentl, The Way We Were' knocked me off my feet. But Mirror left me' empty. It begins well enough. Streisand's character, Rose, is a frumpy, popular university professor. I have to say I breathed a sigh of relief because I am tired of seeing her play this parade of oh-so-glamorous women (Nuts, Tides). I mean, Babs, you're not Cindy Crawford. Deal with it. So here she is, at last, playing this off-beat, smart, funny gal. And, I mean, this isn't Shakespeare, but it's fine romantic comedy stuff. Jeff Bridges, Laruen Bacall - the whole cast is playing along great.<br />Then we get to the last twenty minutes when the ugly duckling turns into - Well, she turns into Barbra Streisand. I mean, Barbra Streisand the Beverly Hills movie star. And I'm not watching the character anymore; I feel like I'm seeing Barbra doing an interview on Entertainment tonight. The whole picture stopped working for me at that point.<br />And what's the message of this movie - anybody can be beautiful if you're willing to spend enough money? Because the only difference between Rose A and Rose B. is a $10,000 investment in health clubs, stylists, colorists, manicurist, couturiers, and make-up. Sorry, Barbra, you lost me on this one. Let's try something different next time.
0743201140|3.0|I'm happy a book makes it so high on the bestseller list explaining to people that they are better off focusing on strengths (both for themselves, as for the organizations they work for).  At jobEQ.com, we have been &quot;educating&quot; our customers to do the same, and as the authors of this book acknowledge, only 25 to 40% of persons will grasp that notion immediately.  I also appreciate that the authors explain how a manager can use the knowledge of these strengths (or themes) to manage their staff better.<br />If the authors would write a second edition, there are some things that I would recommend them to address.  My first remark is linked to the writing style: this book is written in an &quot;imperative&quot; form: it contains a lot of sentences with &quot;you need to do this&quot;, &quot;you should do that&quot;, ... This style tends to put of people, risking that they miss the message.  Secondly, they have WRONG, OUTDATED notion of the brain: contrary to what people used to say 5 to 10 years ago, the good news of recent research is that brain cells that die of ARE replaced (even if you get older) and you remain capable of forming new connections between brain cells (maybe unless you get a disease, such as Parkinson, ...).  Thirdly: the book does not really address what kind of job would be good for you.<br />Finally some feedback about the test: don't take it BEFORE you read chapter 3 in the book - at least then you will understand how they built it.  Still, I have my doubts about the way it is built.  Using the amount of interviews as a &quot;proof of credibility&quot; didn't impress me: Often for scientific purposes, it doesn't matter much if you did 5.000 or a million interviews - all that matters is that you can validate the test.  Also, I know that most people probably have MORE than 5 strengths, which is just an ARBITRARY number Gallup chose.  Given the importance they address to these 5 strengths, just imagine what opportunities you will miss by ignoring these 2 other strengths.  I would rather prefer to get a FULL picture, getting all my strengths and weaknesses, and having this information ordered from strongest to weakest.  <br />Patrick E.C.

B00001U0DP|4.0|A family's tragedy in Italy during German occupation is told by adding comical elements While exbiting the merciless of the German concentration camps during World War 2, the relation of a father and son is emphasized by the acting talent of the players. This subject has been the theme of many movies for many years. We can't see a different approached in this one. The things the father does for his son are not extraordinary. Every father can do the same things for his son. In my opinion Roberto Benigni as the director and performing the leading role stands out.<br />   He was very successful in making people smile and create a comedy and joy for life in spite of such gruesome conditions. Benigni has proved that an ordinary theme can be transformed into a successful movie by bringing an epic tale of love and the human spirit to the screen. The film by itself doesn't deserve the Oscar but Benigni's acting talent gets the reward.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I bought Beatles 1 in November, the day it came out, after constant nagging from friends and relatives to buy a Beatles CD. I was skeptical. I had one John Lennon CD already, Wonsaponatime (certainly not the best one to pick for your first), that I never listened to, and I didn't really appreciate the Beatles that much, anyway. But if I had to hear one more aunt or uncle say to me that the Beatles were FAR better than the Monkees, I was ready to get very angry...<br />Buying 1 was a good choice... in November, as my first Beatles CD. I listened to only a few tracks at first, but gradually eased into everything, learning to appreciate such oddities as &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot; just as much as the classics, like &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;She Loves You.&quot; But within two or three weeks, I had already outgrown the CD, already rooting into the later singles with the Past Masters collections, and then burning basically every one of my friend's original albums.<br />My point is this: 1 is great for the newer fan, as it was for me, but hardcore or even relatively casual fans will get nothing out of it. You don't get the great B-sides like &quot;Rain&quot; or &quot;Old Brown Shoe,&quot; you don't get the classics that weren't singles like &quot;Michelle&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; and there's no sense of consistency between each of the songs. You can hear the Beatles' evolution far better by buying each of the albums, whether they have a hit single or not.<br />Think long and hard before you buy this one. Either do it as a very new fan, or a hardcore completist.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This movie gets better every time I see it (It should really be viewed twice so as to not miss out on some passable events that really add depth to the story.)    This movie slowly pumps you with adrenaline, giving you some excitement at the beginning then easing the rest into your soul. It's chilling and just as mentally disturbing as the first. True Jodie Foster was EXCELLENT, however Julianne Moore offers a new, stronger Clarice. Hopkins however is violently playful and remains cool and calm regardless of his surroundings. He is disturbing and evil. He is better in &quot;Hannibal&quot; than in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and should definitely be rewarded with an Oscar for this blood-curdling role.     In Short, this film is exciting, scary, mentally disturbing (It will get to you) and is directed beautifully (The scenery, music and general flow are amazing) See this movie, buy this movie IT IS THAT GOOD.
B000002UCQ|5.0|All Things Must Pass was George Harrison's first work after the dissolution of that &quot;B&quot; band, and God only knows where the Beatles would've been if they would've recorded some of this work!<br />With lush instrumentation by mega-producer Phil Spector and some of Harrison's finest lyrics and melodies, this album proved that the quite Beatle could do it on his own, without Paul, John, and Ringo.<br />Granted, I'm only grading this CD on its first disc. I've listened to the second disc 3 or 4 times, the whole way through both, and found nothing earth-shattering. The first disc is the one I have with me at all times, but 2 I basically ignore.<br />The opening track, &quot;I'd Have You Anytime,&quot; is a gorgeous, bluesy love ballad co-written with Bob Dylan -- definitley one of my favourites on the entire album. The two hit singles, &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;What Is Life?&quot; are both catchy and rocking, but also have a touch of oddity to them that keeps them apart from sweetened pop that one of Harrison's former bandmates so liked to make. Both versions of &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot; are eye-openers, and &quot;Awaiting On You All&quot; is another one of Harrison's magical pleas for people to really stop and think. But the one of the best tracks is the most simple: &quot;Apple Scruffs,&quot; about the then-unnamed groupies who stood outside of Savile Row and the Abbey Road studios in the Beatles later days. With its rough and charming harmonica and engaging harmonies, &quot;Apple Scruffs&quot; is a real winner. And so is All Things Must Pass.

They, in turn, find themselves motivated and energized to action.  Gotta love it!
B000002UAI|5.0|Beatles for Sale is consistently put down as the Beatles worst by fans and critics alike. True, considering the triumphant A Hard Day's Night soundtrack which it followed, and the supreme pop of Help! that it preceeded, BFS can sound a little weary and tired. But that shouldn't make you give it any less consideration.<br />The covers on BFS are generally a mixed bag. &quot;Kansas City / Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey&quot; is probably the best, closely followed by Ringo's turn on Carl Perkins' &quot;Honey Don't.&quot; And even though I'm generally defending this album, &quot;Mr. Moonlight&quot; is... well, pretty bad. I mean, it's been voted the worst Beatles song of all time how many times, so... let's just leave it at that.<br />But the real classics of Beatles for Sale are the originals. Though there are fewer originals here than on the AHDN soundtrack, they hit the bull's eye more often. The first trio of tracks: &quot;No Reply,&quot; &quot;I'm a Loser,&quot; and &quot;Baby's In Black&quot; show John Lennon's obvious disarray of affairds in late '64 in early '65, and &quot;I Don't Want to Spoil the Party&quot; obviously continues this pattern. Paul is in fine form on the album, contributing the mellow, yet upbeat, &quot;I'll Follow the Sun,&quot; the intriguing &quot;What You're Doing,&quot; and the heartfelt &quot;Every Little Thing.&quot; George Harrison's only vocal, on another Carl Perkins cover, &quot;Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby,&quot; leaves a lot to be desired, but all is forgiven.<br />On the whole, Beatles for Sale is probably my fave Beatles album, if not a very close second behind Abbey Road. The originals are stronger than ever, and by this time, there's already signs of evolution. Skip With the Beatles and buy this instead.
B00005LMBK|1.0|I had high hopes for this CD, and the first track started off lively and rich, but very quickly descended into the numbing, droning anti-music that constitutes the rest of this CD. Its disappointing to see such structureless, shallow din from Albarn, who is capable of turning out incredibly rich music otherwise. Thankfully none of these tunes were released on a Blur album and I hope their music never takes such a mindless, worthless detour.
B000000WCX|5.0|My uncle was constantly bugging me to listen to Bowie albums as I was growing up. It wasn't until this one that I actually sat down and did, and now I have heard every CD that David has released. This one however, still stands out for me, with it's incredible rhythms and vocals. I'm no Bowie expert or anything, but I feel that this CD is one of his greatest ones. I've read where people have said that his last great album before Hours and Heathen was Scary Monsters, but I definitely wouldn't skip over this one and exclude it from the great album list. If you are a Bowie fan, then you probably will like this, but that's just my opinion. It is drum and bass so if you don't like that you might not particularly like this Bowie album. But for a 'drum and base' type recording, it still has soaring melodies and outstanding vocals that I think put it in a class of it's own.
B000001GS0|5.0|I have loved the Brahms symphonies since I first heard them over 30 years ago, and over time, I have bought nine complete sets. I have Jochum's EMI recordings of symphonies 1-3 (the 4th is coupled with an inferior performance of the &quot;German Requiem&quot; conducted by Tennstedt which I returned due to a defect in the pressing). I have enjoyed his EMI Brahms, which I would place above the Solti set, but below Bruno Walter on CBS/Sony. <br />But Jochum's EMI recordings pale in comparison to this earlier mono set on DG, which is definitive. For one thing, he's leading the Berlin Philharmonic here, as opposed to the London Philharmonic on EMI. Granted, the mono sound of the DG recordings is slightly compressed compared to modern stereo, but surface noise and recording hiss are both minimal. Compared to the Toscanini Brahms set from the same era, the sound of the Jochum set is superior. (However, the Toscanini performances are quite good, in spite of allegations that they are &quot;too fast&quot; or &quot;too driven&quot;, and the latest remastering has cleaned up the sound). <br />With Brahms, more than some composers, the conductor must have a convincing and consistent emotional involvement with the music. That's why the Toscanini recordings work so well. Even listeners who don't like his readings are left with no doubt that he's totally involved in the music, not just marking time. <br />With Jochum, the listener also gets the beautiful sound of the Berlin Philharmonic led by a gifted conductor whose love for the music comes through in every note. Simply put, there are no &quot;wrong&quot; moments here, no sections where you wonder what the conductor was thinking, or if the music eluded his skills or sensibilities. Instead, it all sounds completely right, and as another reviewer noted here, it &quot;may be as close to what Brahms heard&quot;. You have that sense as you listen to these recordings, that this was what Brahms meant all along, this was how he wanted the music to be played. <br />There are many moments where it's as if you're hearing this familiar music for the very first time. Particularly in the 3rd Symphony, where some conductors become lost or are otherwise undone by the music, Jochum is able to hold the entire thing together, with a performance that is so overwhelmingly powerful that it may very well be the standard against which all others must be judged, mono or not. <br />As a lifelong lover of this music, I would not be without these revelatory recordings. While most listeners will also want a stereo recording of the symphonies, the Jochum DG set is indispensible. Buy it, enjoy it, and be prepared to be pleasantly surprised at what you learn about this music.
B00000K3D4|5.0|The puppets are very realistic and you can see them as real characters and identify with them in a way. This movie is great for anyone, young or old. This is a story of a girl who learns that she must start taking on responsibilities and grow up. She is annoyed with her little brother one night and wishes that the goblins take him away. So they do. And then she realizes that that wasn't such a good thing to do and then she must go and get him. She must travel to the goblin city where the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie!) has the baby and will turn him into a goblin if Sarah doesn't get to the castle in the center of the Labyrinth within 13 hours. She meets many different characters and must befriend them to get to the center. Some have different motives however and Sarah must be careful. David Bowie is fantastic, he is why I originally saw this movie. Bowiefan or not, if you like Jim Henson movies, fantasy movies, sci-fi stuff, you'll enjoy all that this movie has to offer.
630027179X|5.0|Along with other great fantasy films (Clash of the Titans, etc) Excalibur is a visually stunning and well-acted film that is sure to capture fans and non-fans alike. Boorman directs a sublime retelling of Thomas Malory's age-old epic of King Arthur and his knights, Camelot, and the corruption of the Round Table, the final conflict with Mordred and Arthur's glorious death. This version is at once colorful, seductive, and sweeping. For some younger viewers, be aware of some nudity, sex and violence. The music, taken from excerpts of Wagner's incredbile Ring of the Nibelung opera i.e. Siegfried's Funeral March, Prelude to Tristan and Isolde, and Carl Orff's incredible chorus piece &quot;O Fortuna&quot;, it is wonderful music appropriate to the tale of passion, darkness, magic and drama. You will find no other film version nearly as enticing as Excalibur. For hard-core fans, read Malory's Morte D'athur and White's &quot;The Once and Future King.&quot;
B000000WCX|5.0|My uncle constantly was bugging me to listen to Bowie albums as I was growing up. I was thirteen when this cd came out and my uncle bought it for me. It sat around for a while and I never listened to it because I liked stuff like Madonna, Guns'n'Roses and Garbage (now I don't like them as much). I thought my uncle was crazy and that Bowie would surely be crazy although I had never heard any of his songs or even seen his face. Well, it was one summer night early in the morning about 5 or 6 o'clock and i was in my room drawing. I put on the CD because my uncle kept asking me if I had listened to it yet, and the 15 seconds of music was ok. Then, David's voice came in. I remember just sitting there. Being like, &quot;Oh my god, this is beautiful.&quot; As the CD went on, I just sat there, mesmerized by this man's voice and music. It was very drum'n'bass techno like stuff. The sun was coming up and the room was glowing all golden and it was so beautiful. It was a turning point for me. I knew that I wanted to do this. I wanted to be a musician just so I could know David Bowie. The CD ended and I flipped through the CD booklet, just to find no pictures of David except his back on the cover so I just stared at that. Madly in love with this 'Bowie' man. His voice and music. I know own all his Cd's, my walls are covered in Bowie (and Angelina Jolie, Iman, and other stuff. It's not like bowie wallpaper or anything...yet) i have Bowinet, bowienet mousepad, bowie dvd's.... I love him. When I first saw his face, it was on the internet, and I thought he was absolute perfection! I was very surprised that he's about 38 years older than me and now I get teased at school for loving an 'old man', but no one that says that has ever heard him. I have changed many minds. N'Sync? That can't touch the love I have for David and his music. He is very talented and has the most beautiful voice. This was my first Bowie CD and has been the biggest influence on me. Clearly I highly recommend it toanyone who has not heard David's music, or longtime Bowie fans.
6305428271|3.0|Michelle Pfeiffer plays LouAnne Johnson an ex-Marine teaching a inner-city school. I thought the movie had a good message but, I saw a lot of \\"Lean on Me\\" elements, and that's what didn't make it very original in my opinion. I thought that Michelle did a wonderful job, and it's a very inspirational movie. I guess that I just expected more than that. I can say that it is based on actual events that happened so, that's a plus.
B000002U9L|4.0|David's work for this movie is perfect. But  tracks like 'The Goblin Battle' are ok at first but a little drawn out. I usually skip it. The whole CD is kind of 80's sounding (of course) but that's ok. I love 'As the World Falls Down' and 'Magic Dance'. And even though there are a few songs on here that I don't like and skip, (Chilli Down is another one) songs like 'As the World Falls Down' and 'Underground' and 'Within you' take up for it. They are why I bought it. David's amazing voice is always worth it.
0767819594|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I think Sarah, Reese, Selma, and Ryan rocked the screen. I watched \\"Dangerous Liasons\\" with veteren actors John Malkovich, Michelle Pfieffer, and Glen Close. I must say that this movie really isn't all that different from that, they just gave it at modern day twist, and put a few teenagers but, still basically the same tale.

6305171769|4.0|H20 was a perfect ending to the whole &quot;Halloween&quot; series because it finally ended with Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee) facing off with a nightmare that has haunted her for years. I loved it when Laurie called out Micheal, and then it was on. Laurie had to finally face her monster, and put an end to his reign of terror.
B000055WIQ|4.0|&quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a classic scary movie in my opinion. I was scared when I first witnessed this movie because I had never saw anything like this before. Linda Blair plays Reagan, a atheist who gets possessed by a demon. &quot;The Exorcist&quot; is a timeless masterpiece that never gets old.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Russell Crowe was definitely at his best in \\"Gladiator\\" playing the fierce warrior Maximus. I thought this movie had some of the most mezmerizing fight scenes and special effects ever mastered on the screen. It is a story that has been told for ages obviously but, not quit told like this. I especially loved the whole arena atmosphere it took place in. Joaquin Pheonix also does an outstanding job at being a tyrant in this movie. I have to give this movie 2 thumbs up!.
B00000IO4J|5.0|Josh Hartnett rocks in this movie. &quot;The Faculty&quot; is a good movie that definitely made my flesh crawl. I also found it to have some of the movie &quot;Class of 1999'&quot; characteristics. I remember when Cody Culp (Bradley Gregg) was doing battle with killer cyborg teachers. Different formula same equation. This movie is definitely not one of a kind but, I do like the teachers are aliens aspect of the movie. I would definitely buy this movie if I didn't already own it.
B00003CX8I|3.0|This movie was pretty good. I definitely have seen worse however, I expected the fight scenes to be greater than they were. I didn't really see Storm, Cyclops, or Wolverine utilized to their fullest capabilities, and certainly not like the cartoon.
6305095566|2.0|This movie is a total fluke to me. There isn't anything scary about it. I think it is more so stupid than anything. I actually found it to be quit amusing than scary. Those zombies where a crock in my opinion. This movie is so chessy it's pathetic.
0792841344|2.0|I really hated this movie. I guess it's because when I saw \\"Phantasm\\" in the late 80's when there was a lot more to horror movies than that. I thought the plot was a crock however, I did watch \\"Phantasm 2\\" when it came out, and in my opinion it was way better than the first one.
B0000542DG|5.0|I actually loved this movie because it was different, well written, and very innovative.I can can only speak for myself when I say that I have never seen anything like &quot;Final Destination&quot; .I didn't want to miss a moment of this movie because I just had to know who was going to die next. I love the whole &quot;Cheating deaths design&quot; theme. Devon Sawa was great in the movie, and I thought the whole movie was great.
B00003CXFU|4.0|This movie is a very sublime fact based drama in telling the story of Erin Brockovich. Julia Roberts puts on a riveting performance in this movie. This movie is based on real life events, and Julia did a fantastic job in portraying the real life hero Erin Brokovich. I would buy this movie if I didn't already own it.
B00004RFFU|4.0|I loved that movie especially when Lestat goes &quot;Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it, For do not doubt you are a killer Louie&quot;. I know you all probably saw the movie too but, I just love that part. What can I say when you have Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise on one screen together you can't lose with 2 men as beautiful as they are.
B00000K2SC|4.0|I thought the special effects of this movie was outstanding. The story was well-written, mindblowing, and very original. It got me to thinking that if we were really in a &quot;Matrix&quot; for real, &quot;Would I want to be unplugged&quot;?. I think this movie is definitely one of Keanu's best movies, and it will probably go down as one of the best movies of all time. I really loved the fight scenes because Trinity and Neo both rock the screen. I have never saw anything like &quot;The Matrix&quot;, and I doubt if I ever will again.
6305718903|4.0|I liked &quot;Stigmata&quot; not only because Gabriel Byrne and Patricia Arquette are very good actors but, the storyline was good. I did see some of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; characteristics within this movie but, I thought that it was a very good thriller because it definitely wasn't horror for me. It had some great special effects though.
B00005J6T1|5.0|Before Madonna went for a more mainstream pop sound on the &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and &quot;True Blue&quot; LPs, &quot;Madonna&quot; sounded nothing like either one of these albums.  Therefore this album wasn't as commercial as her 2nd and 3rd albums.<br />There is no concept involved, the album is simply pure dance fun.  It's a mixture of early 80s underground disco (Holiday, Everybody) and lots of funk (Borderline, Burning Up, Physical Attraction).  Also included on this remastered CD are &quot;Burning Up&quot; (12&quot; remix) and &quot;Lucky Star&quot; (New mix), which are basically extended versions of the songs with more bass and instrumentals used.  If you recall, 80s remixes didn't detract much from an original song like today's remixes do.<br />While &quot;Holiday&quot; is her biggest hit off this album, &quot;Burning Up&quot; is very underrated.  &quot;Burning Up's&quot; lyrics are the epitome of what Madonna is today: &quot;I'm not the same, I have no shame, I'm on fire&quot;.  Now that's classic Madonna.  <br />Madonna's raw vocals on this album aren't as developed as they are today, though they are still enjoyable if you enjoyed her 80s hits.  Madonna was also the sole songwriter on 5 of the 8 original tracks.<br />Last year Madonna released &quot;Music&quot; which was a return to her raw dance sound that was in &quot;Madonna&quot;, although the former is cranked up several notches in experimentation.  I recommend listening to both albums if you want a more light-hearted, party-going Madonna.
B00005JCA9|5.0|The Academy Awards really missed the boat on this one.  The bias against comedies at Oscar (insert registered trademark here!) time blatantly sends the message that comedies are not to be regarded as &quot;great films&quot;.  Too bad, because as any great actor will tell you, comedy is a lot harder to play than tragedy.  And &quot;Notting Hill&quot; is a perfect example of a cast of actors playing the truth in comedy.<br />This is a film where you care about each chracter (the mark of a great film). Julia Roberts does splendidly as &quot;Anna Scott&quot;, showing the human side of fame as the world's biggest star.  Hugh Grant is great as &quot;William Thacker&quot;, the British bookstore owner who Anna falls for (and he for her, in a wonderfully Bristish sort-of way).<br />And this films ultimate greatness is in the details: the friendships, the slice of life in Notting Hill, the wonderfully rich relationships between people. Screenwriter Richard Curtis crafted a wonderful story, with truth and wit.<br />If you love this film, this Ultimate Edition is worth the $$.  The cast interviews, the walk down Portebello Road, and the music clips are a real treat that makes the movie viewing experience a great one!

0792846338|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. Kathy Bates takes insanity to another level. I cringed when she hit Paul Sheldon (James Caan) with that sledgehammer. I guess in her warped mind Misery Chastain cannot be dead.

I am a huge Stones fan but you must give respect where it is deserved. Following that its the Alman brothers live from the filmore east. Then get your ya-ya's out. If it wasn't slopy it would be #2 it just doesn't equal the power that The Who put out on Leeds. You do have to consider the fact that it was the Stones first live gig of that size in a while but still its a great album and one of the best live albums. Wish groups would make more one like this. A must have for any rock fan and Stones fanatic
6302516919|2.0|This movie really wasn't that great because a whole hour goes by before the car really does anything special. Christine could have had the potential to be a good movie but, it turned out to be kind of, to be frank: BORING!. I won't lie, I liked the part where Christine got revenge on the guys that tore her apart but, as a whole the movie just didn't measure up to my expectations.
B00003CXSP|4.0|This movie was excellent all the way around. I had never seen Silence of the Lambs before this but after seeing this movie I went out and got the movie. I love both of them!<br />The only thing I found wrong with this movie is the ending in the kitchen. Just seeing the first movie, I wish this one hadn't ended the way it did with Lecter and Clarice coming together.<br />This movie is a great movie overall and I highly recommend it to everyone. At time's it is funny and at others it's down right horrific. This movie will offer something for everyone!
B00004WIBW|4.0|Tim Burton has definitely outdone himself with &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot;. I loved reading The Legend of Sleepy Hollow but, the movie is just incredible. I also found it kind of funny especially the number of times Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) passed out. Christina Ricci also puts on a spectacular performance as the lovely Katrina Van Tassel. I give &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; 2 thumbs up.
B00001MXXG|5.0|This movie is right up there with my all time favorites! I've always loved the movie, but when the DVD came out it added so much more to it. <br />This movie is great, a timeless classic and a recommendation for anyone into 80's teen flicks or John Hughes movies in general. I can promise you that you will not be disappointed! 5 stars here!
B00000JGEN|5.0|Shwarzenegger is  at his best in &quot;The Running Man&quot;. I loved the action sequences that take place in this movie. It is blatantly clear that Maria Conchita Alonso is definitely not the best actress in the world but, Arnie is still the man that's the important thing. I would have to say that the movie as a whole is fantastic though.
B000001EYW|5.0|Worth the wait!  With the exception of the awful &quot;Closer Than Closer&quot;, this album is better than good.
0060194995|5.0|My mother first handed me this book when I was thirteen years old, and one day I was bored enough to give it a try, and I am so glad I did.  It was such a moving, realistic story of a bright young girl's interesting adventure.  Once I started reading this I couldn't put it down.  It is beautifully crafted and emotionally deep.  I give it a perfect 10!
B00005M989|1.0|First, I love music by Prince.  I'd go so far as to say that he is the best songwriter of our generation hands down.  His music is so varied and his genius shows through on so many different songs.  I DO NOT recommend anyone buying this CD.  Here's why - If you just want to get a few of Prince's songs - buy the Hits (3 CD package).  After that, take a trip to explore some of his best work and buy his CDs.  Parade (especially Girls/Boys &amp; Anotherloveholeinyohead), Sign of the Times (cudios for Forever in my life &amp; The Cross), Controversy (love Sexuality &amp; Private Joy), Dirty Mind (check out title track  &amp; Head), Symbol CD (favorites: Love to the 9's, Morning Papers), Love Sexy (Anestasia!!), Rave UNTO The Joy Fantastic (Baby Knows and the cut with Chuck D....slips my mind right now).  Anyway, enough rambling....if you like Prince, buy the Hits, if you love Prince, buy ALL HIS WORK.  But whatever you do, DON'T BUY THIS.  It's just so obvious what's going on here with Warner Bros.  Come on guys....you've made your money off of him.  You are making yourself look very greedy.  - &quot;If a man is considered guilty for what goes on in his mind then give me the electric chair for all my future crimes!!!!&quot; - Prince &quot;Electric Chair&quot; Batdance CD......
0440219078|5.0|the giver is one of my top ten books.  i read it first when i was in fifth grade, and every year I read it at least once.  it really makes you appreciate the society we live in now.  the ending is left unexplained, and it haunts me when i finish reading.  this books will make you think..it is sad and creepy.  But I recommend this book to everyone!
B000000WFF|5.0|I remember buying this CD in January of 1998.I was so excited to listen to it.I loved the first CD so i knew I would love this one.I got it home and put it in the stereo and fell in love with it.Every single song on this CD is excelent.The girls prove that they can have a fun time and make great music.I still listen to this CD after all these years.A must have for any pop fan.
B000059MEK|4.0|This CD is a good one but not one of my absolute favorites.  I really like what they've done with certain songs like &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; which makes me think of a turning machine and &quot;Something About Us&quot; is kind of romantic.  You could listen to it on repeat for a while but that doesn't mean you'll keep going after the fifth time around or that you haven't tuned it out by then.  I'd try and describe it as some calm techno but Daft Punk doesn't really fit well into a music category at the moment.  If you like &quot;One More Time&quot; and &quot;Aerodynamic,&quot; I'd say this is a good investment.
B00004WEJZ|5.0|I think you know the story behind this film! Kevin Mclory, Ian Fleming and Jack Whittigham wrote a film screenplay (starring James Bond 007) that introduced for the first time SPECTRE and Blofeld. The screenplay, had 10 different variations. But when Fleming adapted one of these variations of the screenplay into a novel named &quot;Thunderball&quot; and saled a lot, Mclory sought out to get the rights for any treatment to the storyline of this book, and any film adaptions. Meanwhile, Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had already began the James Bond 007 series with Dr. No, FRWL and Goldfinger. So they had to co-operate with Mclory to make this film a reality. Mclory's plan with them included a possibility for remake of this film, 10 years after its first release. Nobody believed he would do such a thing because most didn't even believed that the series would continue that much. In 1975 however he tried to make a film based on a screen play written by himself, Len Deighton and, yes, even Sean Connery. But it was delayed because of 1977's TSWLM. Then in 1983, the phenomenal &quot;Double Bond Duel&quot; happened....<br />Now, lets go into a more detailed review of the film itself. The film's plot, similar to &quot;Thunderball&quot;'s, has two nuclear missiles steal from the newly re-appeared SPECTRE (as I like to put it), and blackmails NATO and the UN to hold the world for rensom, if they are not given share of the UN's anual payment from their oil fragment. So the MI6 operations are sending James Bond 007 to clear up the case.<br />To that matter, I don't think this film is a total REMAKE of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, but a some-sort-of-variation of the theme, that happened to follow THUNDERBALL, as well as the other Bond films. The two films are no way similar. NSNA was much more exciting and amzing Bond film, maybe because it was done by others than Broccoli and co. Even thought it's not an original movie either (the plot remains intact with &quot;Thunderball), thefilm had elements that provided a different take of the theme and thus a differently presented film. This movie marks the re-appearence of the original (and still best) Bond, Sean Connery, thus the return of an edgier 007 (no offence to Moore, but only in LALD, TSWLM and FYYO Moore showed his edge). Here, Bond must use his brain and body to get out of trouble, and not rely only to Q's gadgets (as in most of the Moore's Bond films). Also, there's some kind of aknowledgement of Bond's age, that has never been shown in the EON films. But aside Connery, the supporting cast is brilliant. Klaus Maria Brandauer is excellent as one of the most original villains of the series, Max Largo. Thought it is supposed, as in any remake, to follow the original character's performance, but in this case, Klaus Maria decided to create his own, unique representation of the character. In fact, he acts really different from the original '65 Largo - he acts like a cousin or brother or something like that (meaning he is different). His Largo, even without the characteristic Celi's scar, is far superior. He shows a menacing, intriguing face of the absolute lunatic in every sence of the word, a very dangerous side of evil, gleefully insidious, that when it is &quot;in trouble&quot;, he shows his real face, rather than a quite wealthy gentleman, the public mask of his personality. He is the first of the neuro-phychic, realistic modern day villains we see in the present Bond films (such as Alex Travelyan, Frank Sanchez, Renard etc.)- he's a three-dimensional villain in a way that only the few great Eon/Bond supervillains (Goldfinger, Scaramanaga, Zorin) truly are. Compare Brandauer's Largo to the original, or even later bad guys like Drax and Stromberg, and you'll see what I mean. Elegantly nefarious Max Von Sydow, even for his limited on-screen time, certainly ranks as one of the best Blofeld's, and while not the best, he is the only one who actually borrowed the style, charm, charisma and coolness from the novels' Blofeld, giving him an air of danger, polite menace and fear. He had the potential to be the best. Unfortunately, his short appearence doesn't let him to be voted as the best Blofeld, but certainly one of them. Barbara Karrera is, well, the archetype of the femme fatale of the series, and certainly the inspiration of Xenia Onatopp of Goldeneye. Kim Basinger, in the beggining of her carrer, seems to be the most succesfull (on her further carrer, as I note) Bond girl, since she had the oppotunity to expand her carrer aside the Bond femme, unlike other Bond girls. She is blatant, more of pupil of Largo's in the beggining, and, as in ANY Bond movie, she falls inlove with Bond. In fact she is the one to put him on retirement (for awhile, of course). As for the MI6 cast, well, they not be as  memorable as the prototypes, but they succeed on creating something unque. Edward Fox is wonderfull as Bill Taner (yes, as Bill Taner, because, for me, as M, he is awful and totally out of character!), he shows the leadership that a chief of stuff must have. Alec McCowen as Q Algy is, for me, exactly what R was in The World Is Not Enough, an inferior officer, and as the original Q is missed in here (propably for a short vacation), he is the temporary head of Q Branch. Anyways, he is wonderfull! Rowan Atkinson (Bean), well, he is the comic relief in this film, and he works it out as the incompitent agent.<br />The pacing of the movie is fine. Irvin Kershner (the only american director for a Bond film) gives an exciting thrill-ride, and while the script is somewhat flawed (yes, it could have been better), Kershner comes up and makes up for it. The plot is not allowed to &quot;thicken&quot; too much before Bond is allowed to save the world with his usual blend of savoir-faire and (not too much)gratuitous sex and violence. Overall NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a class act. In my estimate, Thunderball was really over-the-top because overdone/extended underwater sequences(particularly the battle finale) made the fourth Bond outing a bit &quot;soggy&quot;. NSNA is a better picture than Thunderball because it does not try to be an epic. Having Sean Connery back in action was supposed to carry the day as he put this solid 007 adventure through its paces. I think it worked. To fans this &quot;remake&quot; with the real Bond is a &quot;thrilling prospect&quot; that won't let you down and NEVER could...<br />So, what we have is a very entairtaining Bond film (and certainly one of the best), that needs to be in the canons. For me, the Bond series has two Phases: The first includes the first 14 official Bonds (6 with Connery, 1 with Lazenby and 7 with Moore), and ends with this one as 15th (7th with Connery), and the second Phase started with the last 5 ones (2 with Dalton and 3 with Brosnan-so far). But how can NSNA be accepted in the official series? Well, its simple: Take  M, make him Chief of Stuff Bill Taner, who again replaced M, who was again on leave, delete some M references, and take Q Algy and make him the TEMPORARY replacement of the Q Branch ('cause Q is ill here or he is also on leave). Make the film take place in 1986, a little time after A View To A Kill. So, with that way, we'll have the end of the &quot;old ones&quot; era (old ones, meaning Connery, Moore, Maxwell, Lee, and in any cases opening the door for a new generation of Bond, M, Moneypenny etc.), so that the circle would be completed, and to be followed by a new start - The Living Daylights, Licence To Kill, Goldeneye and continue... If you liked my ideas, send me an e-mail to supbat4@hotmail.com and tell me your opinion.<br />In any cases, this is the most underrated Bond film of the series. What needs to be done for now, is a Special Edition DVD-vhs that will include the open-narrel opening, will re-arrange the training exercise in the beggining as a pre-title sequence, include newly created title sequence with the traditional way, will include some important deleted scenes within the film-not in a deleted scenes section (such deleted scenes as Blofeld's death etc.), and will in any cases improve the picture and sound, and in this case the movie itself, like in the other ones, now that its rights were bought by MGM/UA. As for the current DVD, lets not talk about it. I think it is obvious, how much MGM respects this &quot;really underestimated Bond picture.
0441003257|5.0|If you thought that by simply leaving Discworld Terry Pratchett's ability to make you laugh out loud would somehow change (Ok Ok, I know, but I thought it somehow would...or maybe I just didn't think about it and read this one on faith too), guess again!  This story had me laughing out loud, to the consternation of family members who just don't get it, and that is Ok by me, because I have found a writer in whom I can trust when it comes to spending a moment in a world a little bit to the left of my own--or to the right...I don't know, I love him though!
0451197968|3.0|To this point in the Bachman Books (where I originally read the story), King had been steadily improving as his alter ego.  This was definitely a step back.  King himself said that he thought that this was probably the strongest piece from the collection, since it didn't bother itself with a message (an outright lie, since there are obvious criticisms of America's voyeuristic society contained within the piece), a statement which really puzzles me.<br />The story here isn't told exceptionally well--I don't see it as being up to King's usual standards.  The chaptering is actually a little hokey, and has almost nothing to do with the actual plot of the book (a minor problem, but something which bothered me to no small extent).  The story itself is uniformly depressing--there is no catharsis in this work.  Just like at some points in the Talisman, the bad just builds and builds until everything comes to a bad conclusion.<br />All things considered, this isn't a really reprehensible work, but it disappointed me, after seeing just what King is capable of.  This is a story that most authors probably wouldn't have written, for that matter--it would seem to conform better to the dimensions of a short story.  As a read for a short airline flight, it fits the bill, but if you're looking for meat, it's just not there to be had.
B00004Z459|2.0|This sound has been done to death time to move on. It would be great if a metal band learned to write a song that didn't mumble some whining about &quot;my reality&quot;. These guys are a little lamer than most. &quot;I'm crawling in this skin/and the wounds won't heal.&quot; What the hell are they talking about. The heavy metal crowd does more whining than acoustic folkies these days. Pompous, empty and limited musical ability. Some music.
0451197879|5.0|There are really two classes of King readers.  The first are the early-career lovers.  These are people who like suspense (though I have yet to learn how you get that from a forum where the subject controls the pace) and raw plot motion, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it's definitely not a very rich or complete approach to take.  The second group are the late-career fans of work like Hearts in Atlantis and Desperation, who generally give a more deep and introspective read to the work and aren't as concerned with things moving along at a brisk clip.  For those who may be wondering, I am probably best classified as one of the latter.<br />The first group will hate this novel.  Rather than being a continuously moving story about a collection of things happening to people, Roadwork is essentially an examination of the destruction of one man.  And let me tell you, that character examination is SUBLIME.  The only character that I have read in a King work who was clearly better defined was Johnny Smith from The Dead Zone, and this book would best be compared to that earlier work.<br />There is very little to be bored with in this book if you're not worried about things always happening.  If you are, you might be better advised to move on and leave this one alone--there aren't a lot of bodies or explosions.  The atmosphere and characterization, however, are superb.  I read this as part of the Bachman Books, which have regrettably been taken off the market as a set, and I was impressed by the depth and expression that King managed in this side-project (not reflected in his other work under the pseudonym).<br />There are problems with this book, though.  For one thing, it is absolutely mired in the seventies.  Younger readers may get lost trying to relate to such a thing as an oil embargo.  To some extent, that intrinsic association holds back the novel by keeping the contemporary reader from truly getting a feel for the environment, but it didn't hurt me too much (and I was born after the whole embargo thing was resolved).<br />I find nothing more refreshing than seeing an author liberating himself from a genre where he had previously been caged up, and King does that in this book.  Instead of incorporating elements of fantasy, as he is so often wont to do, he stuck with reality in this story, and it pays off.  You can see the faces of some characters you encounter further down the line, as well, particularly in the mobster (who later became a character in Thinner, after a name change and some tweaking, I imagine).  This is a masterpiece of TRUE Stephen King writing, and I don't miss the usual fantastic elements at all.  I'd recommend this for anybody looking for a good read.
B00005LB50|1.0|I'm sorry. But we seem to be talking about two things here; the music of Buffalo Springfield, and the box set. All the reviews here rightly praise the group and their music, and award the box set five stars *because* the group was so great. Therefore, the box set *has* to be great, doesn't it?<br />Read the reviews again; they all point out that there's no live material, there's massive song duplication, there's no revelatory unreleased recordings, and there's a slew of demos. No extended &quot;Bluebird,&quot; and some of the songs on the third album (which I always liked) don't make the cut because (duh) it wasn't an &quot;officially sanctioned&quot; release.<br />Demos are demos. They were never intended for release. They're sketches for the finished songs. So whatever their merits (and yes, they are interesting) they're NOT AS GOOD (your criteria, unless you're a lo-fi nut) as polished studio recordings. Not more natural, either. I like demos, but I don't like paying top dollar for them. I felt ripped off by this set. I've got all the original albums, and I'll play those in preference to digging for the good stuff in the box.<br />Ten years? For this? Keep your money. Or buy the original recordings, if you don't have them. This set gets it so very wrong, and we're all scared to say so because it was such a great group.<br />Nuts.

1558908382|5.0|Take my word for it; this is one of the most funniest and original comedies ever made.  The laughs just keep on coming and never seem to cease.  Also, this is a movie you can watch over and over again.<br />In &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot;, John Cusack plays Martin Blank, a hit man who's always on assignment.  Always dressed in nothing but a black jacket and tie, Martin goes all over the place, doing the dirty work for others.<br />Martin decides that he wants to stop being a hit man and settle down.  Knowing that he has to do one last assignment, he decides to go to his high school reuninon, and patch things up with his lost love.<br />Sounds simple, right?  Wrong!  When Martin gets to town, he finds out that there two FBI spooks just waiting to plug him full of lead as soon as he does something illegal, a creepy thug who wants him dead, and a another hit man who has completly lost it who wants him to breathe no longer.  Will Martin be able to patch things up with his true love and make it to the reuninon, or will he end up in a body bag?<br />This movie is filled with nonstop comedy, twists after twists, and some really cool shoot outs.  &quot;Grosse Pointe Blank&quot; is a phenominal dark comedy that doesn't fail to make one laugh.  If you want an original comedy that doesn't rely on the stupidity of others to get cheap laughs, this movie is for you.

B00005JHAD|4.0|Gangster genre films are as predominant these days as westerns were in the 50's, and like those westerns, not all gangster films are worth watching.  But \\"Snatch\\" is worth watching (again and again and again) because of vivid, colorful characters (realized perfectly by an ensemble cast), clever, humorous dialogue and confident, stylish direction.  To be sure, \\"Snatch\\" owes much to Tarantino's films, but it's much more ...and stands up well on its own as a fun, entertaining film.
B00004S875|4.0|Billy Joel's &quot;52nd Street&quot; continues Sony Music's release of 5.1-channel (multichannel) SACDs. &quot;52nd Street&quot; is the second disc in his recording catalog released in the multichannel SACD format, following &quot;The Stranger&quot;. The multichannel version has catalog number CS 69385. <br />The disc is presented in 5.1 channel packed DSD sound as well as stereo DSD. There is no CD layer, so the SACD is only playable in an SACD player. Multichannel requires a multichannel SACD player such as the Sony SCD-CE775.<br />Unlike early DVD-Audio discs, the mixes and mastering process on this early multichannel SACD are all excellent. The disc is extremely easy to use. Unlike a DVD-Audio disc, which acts like a glorified DVD-Video disc, a multichannel SACD acts like a CD. Press 'play' - it plays. Track skipping is easy. As a bonus, the name of each track appears on the player's built-in display - no video display required.  The packaging is a standard CD jewel box.<br />The sound quality is not as good as &quot;The Stranger&quot; multichannel SACD.  While it is close, the snare drum, which is prominent in all tracks, is duller and less realistic than what was heard from the previous release.  Dragging out an old LP record version of &quot;52nd Street&quot;, the same snare sound is heard.  It is likely that this snare sound is a recording decision made in the late-1970s rather than a mastering problem.  The extreme clarity of the SACD just makes it more prominent.  <br />Despite any criticism, the SACD is still much better than the CD version.  The finger-snaps on &quot;Stiletto&quot; are very impressive.  It is one of the best uses of multichannel effects I've heard.  &quot;Until the Night&quot; also make effective but not distracting use of the multichannel effects.  It is also enjoyable to have all of Joel's vocals strongly anchored by the center channel.<br />While still an excellent multichannel SACD disc, &quot;52nd Street&quot; isn't as well done as&quot;The Stranger&quot;.  This may be the result of a 23 year old decision, but it still ends up in a duller sound.  The real rating should be around 4.5 stars.  Unfortunately that isn't available, so we'll truncate to 4 stars.<br />Overall, &quot;52nd Street&quot; is still recommended as a multichannel SACD, but just not as much as &quot;The Stranger&quot;.<br />Note : Some earlier SACD versions of &quot;52nd Street&quot; were stereo-only.

B00003CY5K|5.0|This is the one that's going to finally do it for Reese Witherspoon.  A slight variation on her darkly brilliant comedic turn in the satirical ELECTION, Witherspoon plays Elle Woods, a blonde bombshell concerned as much with her social calendar as her scholastic one.  When her boyfriend dumps her upon his entrance to Harvard Law--he wants a &quot;Jackie, not a Marilyn&quot;--Elle is determined to win him back--so she applies and is accepted to Harvard(upon first witnessing her on campus, her ex remarks&quot;YOU got into Harvard Law?!?&quot;, to which Elle retorts, &quot;What, like it's hard?&quot;).  Among the supporting players, Matthew Davis strikes a nice balance between weasel and nice guy, and Jennifer Coolidge is very funny as Elle's manicurist friend(and used to much better effect here than in the insipid AMERICAN PIE).  Also funny is Alana Ubach as one of Elle's old school chums(she delivers several funny one-liners, including a brief, but hilarious, dialogue with an Asian manicurist--spoken in the manicurist's native tongue, no less). As Davis' new fiancee, Selma Blair, that most nondescript of actresses, continues her seemingly endless string of playing one-dimensional, one-note characters(though she's not bad, she has yet to find a role that distinguishes her as anyone with some talent).  Witherspoon, of course, literally owns this movie, and hopefully this will serve notice to the uninformed of this actress' stunning comedic skills.

B000002U9Y|4.0|In some ways A Saucerful Of Secrets is Pink Floyd's most important album, and a very transitional one at that. What we have here is the only Pink Floyd album which both Dave Gilmour and Syd Barrett play on, and it shows too. The best track on the album by far is &quot;Jugband Blues&quot;, a song that is essentially Syd's farewell to Pink Floyd. It is a song that sounds like nothing else in popular music, and is a worthy epilogue to the Syd Barrett era of Pink Floyd. There is also the emerging of the style the would make the band megastars in the 70's. Dave Gilmour's guitar on &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot;, Roger Waters lyrics &quot;Corporal Clegg&quot;, and of course &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot; probably the biggest signpost to where Pink Floyd were headed post Syd. This is a good album, but certainly not one of Pink Floyd's more commercial efforts. But that is no bad thing.
B00003CXN4|2.0|Ugh. Like most people who had a problem with this film, my biggest disappointment came from the entire American User/abuser part involving Douglas' character and the spoiled brats high on smack. I despise movies that only serve to rile people up for no good reason. Soderbergh used the oldest trick in the book: Make the white middle-aged guy with an exceptional daughter totally ... out by showing her being shot up with Heroin and then ... by a violent black man. How ... racist and insulting to black people can you be! Then there was the scene where the daughter's boyfriend gives his indignant dissertation on the state of the drug war to a Drug Czar! Huh? I would have slapped the ... of that kid! I found it most interesting also that Catherine Zeta Jones could become so well-versed in the conversion of high-impact cocaine into powder form in such a short time. Cheadle did a fairly good job as did del Toro. Douglas was lazy, Amy Irving was plastic, Steven Bauer has never done good work and Dennis Quaid should be doing infomercials. This was obviously another contrived, Hollywood liberal view of the drug world and why you should be skeptical of any movie involving Michael Douglas, Steven Spielberg, Martin Sheen, Robert Redford, James Brolin, etc. If you want to see a good movie about a real life drug dealer, go see \\"Blow\\". In my humble opinion, it's the best work Johnny Depp has ever done and I never felt preached to.
6305358567|5.0|Cinema audiences do not look to Hollywood for an accurate portrayal of anything, much less History. We do not want them to. We want entertainment: the full splendour of magic as woven by intriguing plots, sumptuously designed sets, and an over-indulgence of inspired acting. Nothing less.  <br />The rebirth of Human Thought of the past millenium was ushered into the world fraught with pain and many false starts. History witnessed the end of the Middle Ages three quarters into those thousand years, and although it claims Florence as its embroiled center of emergence, England was certainly one of Europe's greatest proponents of the Renaissance.<br />One finds an excellent treatment of the ascendance to the British throne of this film's title subject. Shekhar Kapur is an expert magician, carefully managing into a fluid package the steamiest bits of the Queen's early reign, deftly helming the ship round an elaborate and exquisite set, and orchestrating the magnificent cast to a fine-tuned performance. One is offered a musing and attractive interpretation of the famous story, and the result is wholly enthralling.  <br />Chief among its many wonders is its star performer, Cate Blanchett. If not a direct descendant of the Muses, she then comes scandalously close to the claim by steeling the entire show; and it is nothing short of what she, whether by accident or design, is wont to do. She is a fascinating actor. Her credits prove it.  Go to PARADISE ROAD, OSCAR AND LUCINDA, or her contribution to THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY, and it is obvious why she was awarded this role. That she was not awarded the Academy honour is yet another scandal, but we are patient. She shall be granted a place in that stellar coterie, and that with lavish and deserved praise. <br />Great advances in the Age of Discovery came to the world as brought forth by the English and their Queen.  She was a staunch patron of the Arts (theatre, the fine arts, artisanry), the maritime sciences, and certainly Literature.  By her leave and her purse, the world was bequeathed the jewels of the one of the greatest languages of the West, giving England a proper place in the enlightening advance of the Renaissance.<br />Look to ELIZABETH, not for the important development of that story, but for a glimpse into how it started.  This telling is as diverting and encompassing a version as the whole tale.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I wasn't too wild about &quot;Kid A&quot; to be perfectly honest. With that in mind, I was a bit hesitant to buy &quot;Amnesiac&quot; for awhile. I was afraid I would be left a bit dumbfounded like I was with &quot;Kid A&quot;. Then one day I decided to acquire &quot;Amnesiac&quot; after thinking about it for a long time. I must say that &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is far better than &quot;Kid A&quot;. It may not be anywhere as brilliant as &quot;OK Computer&quot; but that is fine with me. I would soon not have one of my favorite bands not to sound redundant on each album they put out.<br />&quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot; has a more guitar rock sound, the closest to any of the songs found on &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot;. There is a haunting quality to the songs on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; that harkens back to &quot;OK Computer&quot;, particularly songs such as &quot;Packt Like Sardines In a Crushd Tin Box&quot; and &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;. I do find that the songs on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; more accessible than half the songs on &quot;Kid A&quot;. There is more of a pop structure to the songs without losing the band's interest in pushing the boundaries of music by sounding more like Aphex Twin and less like their earlier albums, including &quot;OK Computer&quot;.<br />All the songs on &quot;Amnesiac&quot; are fantastic. Radiohead continually challenges their fans by putting out some of the most unpredictable music around. They are one of the few bands that consistently pushes the boundaries of pop music. I like that Radiohead refuses to maintain one particular sound and strives to put out some of the most challenging music to date.

Take away Dave's voice from this album, and I guarantee you wouldn't be able to recognize the songs as being played by DMB.  You can't say that about ANY other DMB album.  It's as if Glen Ballard took the musicians and locked them in a 1x1 ft. box and made them play within it.  Too bad.  Get the Lillywhite Sessions. They're awesome!  [....]
0553213105|5.0|This is probably one of the wittiest and most delightful books I've read in a long time. I recall reading Jane Austen several years ago with Northanger Abbey and I absolutely despised it. But after, adoring the miniseries for Pride and Prejudice, I figured it would do justice to read the book. Pardon my disastrous attempt to sound sophisticated, but it is sometimes amusing to mimic another author's style while reviewing her book. I can hardly wait for Burgess.:P<br />The book certainly renewed my love for the movie as well as literature of the Victorian era. I've never been a big fan of literature from that time period, despising books like Oliver Twist, Phantom of the Opera, Wuthering Heights and Frankenstein because they dragged on and on with melodrama. Jane Austen varied in the sense that her book was light-hearted and full of comedy and wit.<br />Her characters were lovable. Elizabeth was well-rounded and respectable and if I could have but half her wit in her replies, I would be much indulged. Jane possesses good nature beyond what one would deem natural. Mr.Bingley was good natured as well. And finally, Mr.Darcy who had that air of mystery about him soon grew warm in my heart with his charitable acts. And as the book progressed, I became more and more interested in their well-being and future happiness. However, the most memorable characters would be the secondary characters. Mrs.Bennet was absolutely hilarious. I was equally embarassed as Elizabeth of her mother and her immaturity and lack of understanding. Mr.Bennet on the other hand, with his odd and wry comments provided even more amusement. He has the dryest sense of humour. Lydia is virtually insufferable with her youth and fails to understand any of the pain she has caused her family. Poor Miss Bingley seemed to be such an annoyance to Mr.Darcy with all her attempts to win his attention. And Mr.Collins was a laughable mess. I could not help but love to hate him.<br />Unfortunately, having seen the movie first, I had an irreversible tendency to think of the scenery and the characters in terms of the movie. However, I found it rather pleasurable since this was perhaps the first time I've read a book with a concrete image of the characters and the scenery since I usually ignore such facts and descriptions. The descriptions were never excessive either as they tend to be in Victorian novels. Scenes were never described beyond half a page. Comments were often made on the characters but they never dragged on for pages on end. Usually, at most, they lasted about half a page. As for the emotions of the characters, Jane Austen did not linger on them for long. Enough indications were given to entice the reader, but not excessively as to bore.<br />The dialogue was the most memorable and quotes of Austen popped out everyone. I was disappointed to find that at certain places, Austen merely described the coversation instead of actually carrying it out through dialogue.<br />I find the book is still nevertheless romantic in nature and more redeeming to females as it would be to males. But I suppose all you guys are just missing out! I'm not normally a fan of romance but the book pursues it with such intelligence that I could not help but like it. I'm still a bit unconvined of the actual plausibility of the marriages in the story but they seem so satisfying, you might as well take them to be true. Romance books are nice in the sense that in the end, that undeniable happy ending is always guaranteed to be there to satisfy. And overall, Pride and Prejudice and satisfied me at the end with a warm and happy ending but nevertheless leaving me wanting to know more of the characters. It is book whose charm lies in the style and the characters and could be easily read over and over again. This book definitely will be one of my favourites.<br />My goodness, I am embarassed by my own review. I sound like such a ...!
B00005B4GU|5.0|An amazing band with unprecedented talent, Radiohead has taken over the industry with this emotional triumph. As Thom Yorke removes his mouth and his aches from the sour lemon, he and the late On a Friday delve into the world of beautiful music. Nothing on this disc is even questionable for its presence. Every song transforms the listener into a work of art, based on their interpretations of the songs.<br />The intro song, Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box is a scratchy, mildly electronic song explaining how Thom just needs his space. The melody will get stuck in your head for days. Pyramid Song is one of the most beautiful tracks on the disc, with dissonant piano chords and a look into the depths of the subterranian mind of the band. You and Whose Army is also gorgeous, where the band provokes the listener and their roman empire. Nothing compares to Kinves Out, by far the best song on the album. Lif In A Glass House is also very well made, with guests on the trumpet, trombone, clarinet, double bass, and drums.<br />This album is one of the quintessential Radiohead albums, and should be the start for new users, though there is no doubt that every album is spiritual, deep, and rediculously enjoyable. Start your collection with this if anything.
B00005KHJT|4.0|Halloween is a masterpiece in horror and something that should be seen for anyone interested in horror. The 'Extended Version' does not inclue scenes that were deleted, but added a few years after the film was released.<br />While John Carpenter was working on Halloween 2 the first film was set to be shown on network television for the first time. Some content was forced to be deleted and the running time was significantly shorter than the normal two hour time slot. John Carpenter used the some of the second films cast and filmed a few additional scenes to boost the running time, and to connect the film with the revelation in the sequel. You can notice why Jamie Lee Curtis has a towel on her head, in the film she has obviously just come out of the shower, but that was done because she was actually forced to wear a wig during the second film because her hair didn't fit with the way it appeared in the original, that is most likely why she is wearing a towel on her head.<br />The scenes add little or nothing to Halloween, and actually don't drag it down from its high point. I can recommend the 'Extended edition' simply for fans of the series because the scenes link the film to the sequels, unlike the theatrical version.<br />THEATRICAL EXTENDED VERSION 31/2 stars<br />A limited and standard edition have both been released, the standard containing no extras, and the limited containing a still from an actual theatrical reel of the original Halloween. That alone should sell the product for fans of the series as it is a true collector's item.<br />PLEASE READ THIS. THE LIMITED EDITION WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE THROUGH BEST BUY STORES, NOT ANYWHERE ONLINE, IF YOU ORDERED THIS CANCEL IT BECAUSE IT IS VERY LIMITED AND AMAZON.COM WON'T BE GETTING ANY OF THEM IN, HURRY AND GET ONE FROM AN ACTUAL BEST BUY STORE BEFORE THEY ARE ALL GONE.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I initially avoided seeing \\"Mononoke\\" is theaters, not because it was animated (far from it), but because it looked a little too artsy for me. At the time, the only anime I cared about was brainless ninja stuff with super powers. But after seeing the DVD, I'm kicking myself for not experiencing this on the big-screen. In a weird sort of way, the story is actually more political than theological, even with the gods and demons and talking animals.<br />This is the kind of movie that should really be held up as a shining example of Japanese animation.  It has a beautiful story, realistic characters, and a great mix of cell and computer animation. Even the English voice cast was terrific, which is something I almost never say. It also doesn't hurt when the original script is adapted by comics legend Neil Gaiman, who has a real respect for the work.<br />It's unfortunate that \\"Mononoke\\" wasn't as big a success over here as it was in Japan (where it was narrowly beaten out by \\"Titanic\\"). It could have opened a whole wave of anime movies being released theatrically over here. All I can suggest is to buy this movie, and maybe let Miramax know how much you enjoyed it.

B00004U30D|2.0|How do you win a boatload of Academy Awards?  Just use this formula: 1. Pretentious dialogue.  2. Banal symbolism.  3. Overacting to the point of earnest emotional farce.  Unless you enjoy the \\"Angst Ridden Overprivileged White People With Problems\\" genre of films, then this film isn't for you.  Funniest moment that wasn't supposed to be funny: Annette Benning's emotional breakdown following her merciless cleaning of a house she was showing.  While there are plenty of cultural products that elucidate the boredom and banalities of suburban life (like Daria on MTV and the music of Sonic Youth), this movie fails in the delivery of its message.  Instead it wallows in its own diminished self-worth.  Boomer navel gazing has never been so funny.  Like I am supposed to care for any of these characters?  At least the characters on Daria are appealing.
6305205620|4.0|I've never seen Metallica in concert, but this gives me a pretty good idea that it's one hell of a show. Pretty much everything was awesome about this. Each member of the band got equal camera time and the cameramen captured the whole performance very well. I also enjoyed the bonus features, especially when they showed how they pulled off the destruction scene. I only have one minor complaint about this. It doesn't have enough of 80's Metallica. Pretty much every song came from the Black Album and everything after. I still like them and all, but they were at their best back in the beginning. Anyway...if you're a Metallica fan, chances are you're going to love this DVD, just like I did.
B0000214F2|1.0|\\"The horror!  The horror!\\" as Marlon Brando once said in Apocalypse Now.  These last words, summing up the carnage and absurdities of the Vietnam War parallel the emotional pornography doled out here with all the soulfulness of Agent Orange or a landmine.  Although I am a fair weather Williams fan (I liked him in Good Morning, Vietnam), he is relentless in laying on the shmaltz.  General Kilgore in Apocalypse Now was more subtle in his use of bullets on a Vietnamese village than Williams in his \\"message speeches.\\"  I'm sorry, being slapped in the face with a side of beef is more nuanced and humane than listening to speech after bleeding heart speech.  By the end of the film, I was the one who wished I died, instead of the patients who were subject to the humor of this latter day Jerry Lewis of the gas chambers.  Pretentious, pompous, and emotionally overwrought to the point of absurdity.  Buy another movie like the Deer Hunter, at least that's funnier.
B00005JK93|3.0|&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; is good, but not great.  Due to the cross-dressing element, there are many comparisons to &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show,&quot; but I feel that these are two very separate films. A closer comparison is &quot;Cabaret,&quot; in the way &quot;stage performanceas a musical&quot; is used to interweave character's stories.  Like &quot;Cabaret,&quot; the musical is much changed in it's transfer to screen.  Characters are re-written and the all important &quot;feel&quot; goes missing.<br />It was difficult to decide if the director was aiming for mocking the main characters by showing how seriously these pathetic people took themselves, in the vein of &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Guffman,&quot;  or if he was going for something along the lines of &quot;Tommy&quot; where a savaged character found art within himself and transformed the people around him.  It is a difficult line to walk.  We are introduced to Hedwig in the bar scene, where he/she was an obvious object of ridicule, with the silly hairstyle and rock star performance in a small &quot;Denny's&quot; style restaurant.  Then later on, we are supposed to respect the plight of the same character that we had been trained to find humor in.<br />  Ultimately, I found no connection to any of the characters, and didn't particularly care whether or not Hedwig succeeded or failed.  I was sympathetic towards Hedwig's wife, and hopped that he/she escaped the vortex of Hedwig's self-fulfilling failure.  I was happy to see this character transformed at the end, and carried away from Hedwig (in my own mind, I am hoping that the hands carried him/her off to a staring role in &quot;Rent.&quot;)
0783116934|5.0|This has everything you could ask from a film; excellent performances with characters you really end up caring for, an interesting plot and a background that really illustrates the feel of a time and a place.  It's a flawless movie really, and it should be seen.
B000002IPZ|4.0|My first contact with TESTAMENT was totally positive. Without having other albuns to campare with, I fully enjoyed SOULS OF BLACK as a perfect example of expertly crafted metal. The singer is very good, altough sometimes the melodic of the vocals is exactly the same from one track top another.
B00003CXN4|1.0|First off, what's the deal with the yellow tint for scenes in Mexico and the blue tint for scenes with Michael Douglas anyway?  Sorry, it was like all those black and white cuts on the Playboy channel - forced artistry is just annoying.<br />And the plot, I mean, what was the point anyway?  Douglas quits as drug czar - why?  Because the drug way is pointless?  He doesn't really come out and say that.  It ends with him supporting his daughter in some kind of touchy-feely group session dealy, which is swell, but if he was so committed to treatment, why didn't he say so when he had a public forum?  He just mumbles and walks offstage.<br />I liked the Mexican officer, but I completely missed the point as to what he wanted and where he was going.  At first he seemed like a good guy, then you couldn't tell and finally he ends up being some kind of official.  OK, so what?  Again, what is the point?  Just a mess.<br />This is one of the best films of the year?  Doesn't anyone write anymore in Hollywood, or do they just dream up ``theme'' movies over lunch?
0471381985|5.0|A highly readable addition to the value-investing greats that manages to impart a great deal of the &quot;details&quot; while still remaining an easy-to-follow, literate book.  Only drawback is that the investor profiles are not consistent -- they were evidently written by different authors and their quality is sporadic.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|From the second that this movie took off, I knew that I loved! From the camera angles, to the exotic colors. Now, this would be a bad choice for those of you who don't like musicals, but the music, AND ESPECIALLY SINGING in this movie are fantastic. The way that they tie famous songs into the story line is finominal, and it is also extremely nice (for a change) that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman could keep you liking their relationship on a non-sexual level was amazing! The complex characteristics and charm to all the characters is also amazing! Satine, the exotic, (but fragile) can-can dancers/cortisan, Christian, the sweet, bohemian spirated penniless writer with an obsession with love, the duke, though not totally complex, is appauling, and Zidler, who though he wants the best, tries to stay out of any trouble. The set's, story line, characters, and music to this movie are awesome, and I would recomend it to anyone who has a love to theatre, or good movies!
6301954947|4.0|This film is a good old-fashioned spectacle.  The only way you'll see comparable battle scenes in contemporary films is when they use computer duplication/creation of masses of people.  Dino DeLaurentis chose Sergei Bondarchuk to direct, based upon his work in the even more massive Russian production of War and Peace.  Bondarchuk does a good job, and the production values are great.  Segei sometimes indulges in some artsy surrealism, but this is kept to a minimum. Rod Steiger as Napoleon is fun.  Steiger has been described as everything from a genius to a ..., and he runs the gamut here.  At times he IS Napoleon, at other times he seems like George Costanza having a bad day. Christopher Plummer plays Wellington.  He is charming, witty, and warm.  In other words, nothing like the real Duke of Wellington, who was a stern, haughty and brilliant man.  This is not Plummer's fault, he does a fine job.  The script and direction simply created a very sympathetic Wellington.  Other characters in the film are underdeveloped.  There are too many of them, and this is one of the film's flaws.  A cameo by Orson Welles adds little. Generally speaking, the film is historically accurate, although it does take some shortcuts.  The Prussians(Germans)are hardly in it and come off as the bad guys, even though they saved Wellington's army.  There are other minor errors that Napoleon buffs will spot (eg., the Lancers fighting the Scots Greys should not be Guard lancers) but that's nit-picking.  This film should be enjoyed for what it is -- a BIG spectacle.
B00000IPAX|5.0|I had not been interested in punk or Blink 182 before I listened to this. It changed one taste of my music dramatically. I heard &quot;All The Small Things&quot; on the radio and instantly thought that i had to hear more. Even though I don't think it is there best song on the album, it is still a cracker.<br />&quot;Dumpweed&quot; couldn't have been a better track to start off an album with. This being the first song you listen to gave a very strong and powerful sense to the album, which is what i want in a new cd, but not too strong which it wasn't.<br />I like Blink 182 and Enema Of The State because it is not heavy and not light but just right. Being too heavy can just ruin it, I think and turn it in to New Metal, which I can't stand, but hey that's just my view.<br />&quot;Don't Leave Me&quot; is another strong track and another favourite of mine. This keeps the tempo of the album up high. &quot;Aliens Exist&quot; also continues this but not so much, which is good to hear. Everyone who doesn't like punk or Blink 182 might well say that all there songs are just the same but to me they are totally different and are all masterpieces, which you can listen to over and over again. The tempo of the tracks changes throughout, and the use of a wide variety of drum beats and guitar structures changes for each unique track.<br />&quot;Going Away To College&quot; really does bring out great memories of childhood at school/college, just makes you think about it when listening to the line structures and the words themselves. I have noticed when listening that &quot;Going Away To College&quot; and most of the other tracks seem to have a very tasty instrumental intermission type thing in each track which is a really nice effect i think. Its not a heavy intermission but a quieter break from the rest of the track. I do like a good calmish instrumental from time to time and this album knows where to put them.<br />This puts me nicely on to &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; Which isa favourite of mine not just for Enema Of The State but Blink 182. It's just so catchy; you want to sing along to it. I also think that it is a much calmer song of the album, which is what i like because i don't want them all to be heavy or all calm but a variety of each. Travis' great rim beat after about one minute in to the track is top stuff and matches a great guitar piece to go with it. The guitar piece is not really blurry like other times but clear and tuneful, you can notice each chord played. <br />&quot;Dysentery Gary&quot; is a bit heavier but worth the wait. It keeps you on your toes all the way through, having quite a nice pace to it and another catchy tune. It keeps you going as it only has 20 seconds of quieter theming. Pity its only 2:45 though.<br />Now on to my best song of the album - &quot;Adam's Song&quot;. You might say that you haven't bought a punk album to have the pace and volume brought right down to have some dull punk track but that is the beauty. After hearing this track over and over again it made me want to be a drummer and buy a kit. I know that it is a simple beat but it is very catchy and dominating most parts of the track. The guitar pieces are very clear again and probably very simple to play but the tune stays with you.<br />&quot;The Party Song&quot; is another pacy track to get you going again. It is a great &quot;before you go out&quot; track to get you ready for a good time. It gets you going and makes you want to learn the lines because they are being said rather quickly at times. The vocals are just of a typical party that you and me might go to.<br />A big intro leads you into another classic &quot;Mutt&quot;. This track combines both fast, slow, strong and weak, all in just 3:23. Having had this played on &quot;American Pie&quot; it is aimed at the right college audiences.<br />Bringing me towards the end of the album &quot;Wendy Clear&quot; is very muggy and compressed throughout most of the track with an overplay ofstrong and deep guitar play.<br />&quot;Anthem&quot; is a great ending to the superb album. The first thirty seconds just sound like something is coming to an end, in this case the album. It is a very nice pacey end to the album. At about 1:36 it really kicks in to becoming the last final track, and what an ending indeed. At about 2:23 it goes quiet which is a great touch to the speedy and strong finale.<br />So what can i say, i just loved and still love this album and Blink 182. <br />Even though each track is only 2-4 minutes long, thats what makes them special and well worth it. <br />Even though the compositions may not be that complex they perform then stunningly.

1573225517|2.0|I had heard a lot about this book, and about Nick Hornby, but High Fidelity disappointed me in many ways.  The characters all seem to be part of Hornby's &quot;clique&quot; who like his music, go to his hangouts, and so on.  Fair enough, one writes what one knows about; Woody Allen movies are full of screenwriters and Bruce Springsteen sings about working class New Jersey, so why can't Hornby write about his milieu?  The hero in this book (Rob) is the owner of a used record shop, and he has love life problems, and feels as if life is passing him by.  He has a great passion for the music, and much of the book is reconciling this passion with the realities of his life in his 30's.  Unfortunately, I didn't care if he got back together with his girlfriend or not, or whether he turned a corner in his life.  He was just too unlikeable.  The only characters who interested me much were his co-workers at the record store, if you can call them workers.  They are depicted bang-on.  I have been to record shows myself and Hornby knows that bunch well.  <br />The most annoying thing about the book was Hornby constantly drawing the line as to what is good music and what isn't, as if he was telling us what is cool and what isn't.  That was very irritating, maybe we all don't dig Solomon Burke or whatever else Hornby beats us over the head with.  It's a very snobbish writing style, either we're in or we're out I guess.  I saw the movie later and it worked better.  I've read several novels from young British fiction writers, the best being the Football Factory by John King.  High Fidelity was fun for awhile but it lost me halfway through when I stopped caring about the characters or the plot.
B000053VAF|4.0|I liked &quot;Dogma&quot;  With it's star studded cast of Ben Affleck, Matt Damon, Chris Rock, Salma Hayek, Linda Fiorentino, Alanis Morissette, and Jay and Silent Bob.  What could go wrong right?  The film was funny but to cluttered.  The filmmaking was cluttered and not up to par.  Kevin Smithis a great director but he made this film cluttered.  Here is the plot:<br />Two banished angels (Affleck and Damon) find a loophole that would get them back into Heaven so they set off to go.  The only problem is that if they got back into heaven it would prove that God (Morissette) would not be perfect and the world would end.  So a girl (Fiorentino), the 13th Aposile (Rock), an angel (Hayek), and Jay and Silent Bob set off to stop them. <br />Seems like a good plot, right?  It is and the acting is great, especcially by a very funny Rock and Jay and Silent Bob, but Kevin Smith makes the movie cluttered and sub-par bringing this funny and good movie down to four stars.  This movie is incredibly funny, with jokes about sex and religion including Rock saying Jesus was black.  Rent it but the directing wasn't the best because it was to cluttered.<br />Rated R for humor, language, violence, nudity, and drug content.
B00004Z459|5.0|Hybrid Theory is one cool CD.  Im not quite sure how to classify this. Alternative Rap?  Dance Metal?  It doesn't really matter because the music is great.  The guitars are crunchy, the lyrics are cool, and beat keeps you grooving.  This is a fun CD to listen to while driving.  Although its a short 38 minutes, its still a better listen than a lot of the stuff out there right now.<br />Put this one on your must buy list!!!<br />Highly Recommended!!

6305910103|3.0|For most fans, including myself, this is the favorite Star Trek movie. The Wrath of Kahn is much superior to the previous film. The actors ages are acknowledged and William Shatner gives a good performance. The film starts with a young officer commanding the Enterprise to rescue a ship on the Klingon side of the neutral zone, which is not to be crossed. The Enterprise is defeated by the Klingons, then we learn it is a simulated exercise. The young officer is Lt. Saavik (Kirsty Alley), a Vulcan. Admiral Kirk (Shatner) is the only person to win this no-win scenario. The Enterprise launches as a training cruise for new officers, with Captain Spock (Leonard Nimoy) in command. The starship Reliant is searching for suitable lifeless planet for the Genesis Project, a device that creates life from lifelessness. They find a planet with only small life signs. Captain Terrell (Paul Wingfield) and Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) beam down to search. They find the remnants of Kahn and his people, stranded there 15 years before (Star Trek episode: Space Seed). Kahn inserts mind altering creatures in them and takes over their ship. Kahn wants revenge because his wife (who joined him in the episode) died on the planet. When he learns of Genesis he goes to Regula Station to get it. The lead scientist, Carroll Marcus and her son with Kirk, David send a message to Kirk wanting answers about Reliant coming to get Genesis. Because of this and an unclear signal, Admiral Kirk takes command and The Enterprise goes to investigate. They find Reliant there, not responding to signals. The Enterprise is fired upon in crucial points on the ship. Kirk raises shields and returns fire too late, Kahn has the upper hand. Kahn wants Genesis and Kirk. Kirk pretends to retrieve all the Genesis files, while actually looking up command codes for Reliant. Kirk's puts down Reliant's shields and does heavy damage. Both Ships retreat to different sides of Regula. Kirk and a team go to Regula Station. Kahn has killed the stations crew and Genesis is gone. The team finds Capt. Terrell and Chekov, who tell what Kahn did and where that the crew of Reliant were left on Ceti Alpha. They find the transporters used and beam to the same place the others had gone. They find Dr. Marcus, her son and Genesis. Once they locate Genesis, Terrell and Chekov give Kahn the location, the device is then beamed out. The creature removes its self from Chekov and Terrell kills himself. The team returns to Enterprise and Kahn continues to attack Enterprise, thinking she is in worse shape than she is. The Enterprise defeats the ship, but Kahn uses Genesis. The Enterprise is damaged to the point that it can't escape the blast. Spock, with his superior Vulcan physiology, withstands radiation to repair the warp core. The Enterprise escapes but Spock dies, which if you didn't before, the sequels tell you anyway. Genesis is a success and the Enterprise mourns its loses.
0452282152|5.0|I didn't know much about Jan Vermeer, except that he was a Dutch painter.  Based on Vermeer's painting &quot;The Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot;, the book is a fictional first hand account of that girl, who the author invents as a maid turned muse in the Vermeer household. There are enough facts to stir up interest, for me at least, in the works and life of the painter. The story told by the maid, Griet, speaks of the 1600's where Catholicism was suspect, the plague caused many deaths,and food was scarce.  You also glimpse the technology of the times;  the camera obscura, the boats with swolen holds in the harbor, the mixing of herbs at home for medicine, and the use of various plants and bones to make paint.  I think that Chevalier was inspired by Vermeer's use of light and shadow, and has researched this period, plus whatever scant personal information exists about the artist,and has written a beautiful, insightful, well thought out book.  It is as rich in color and light as the painter's work. I loved &quot;Galileo's Daughter&quot;, for much the same reasons as I love this book.  When I think of the 1600's, I have a hazy view of that period of great artisans, a crippling lack of technology, cold and damp houses.  I am always delighted to read about micro perspectives of that time that deliver me from this sort of hazy macro collage I have of the past.
6303979882|5.0|OH MY GOD IF U HAVEN'T ALREADY SEEN THIS FILM U DON'T KNOW WOT UR MISSING. I'M 15 AND I FIRST SAW THIS FILM ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO. AT THE TIME I COULD TOTALLY RELATE TO THE STORYLINES IN THE MOVIE. ALTHOUGH THE PLOT NO LONGER RELATES TO MY LIFE I STILL GET A WARM FEELING INSIDE WHENEVER I WATCH IT. ITS FULL OF COMEDY MOMENTS E.G WHEN THE GIRLS STEAL THE WORMERS CLOTHES BUT ALSO FULL OF EMOTIONAL MOMENTS LIKE SAMANTHA TELLING TEENY BOUT HER PARENTS DIVORCE. THIS IS DEFINATELY A FILM TO WATCH WITH THE GIRLS AND UNLESS UR ALIEN WILL DEFINATELY MAKE U REALISE HOW MUCH U NEED GREAT FRIENDS. I DONT THINK I WILL EVER BE ABLE 2 EXPLAIN HOW MUCH THIS FILM HAS CHANGED MY LIFE BUT I KNOW IT WILL TAKE PRIDE OF PLACE ON MY SHELF FOR MANY YEARS TO COME
B000050XEI|3.0|Don't get me wrong I love Enya, especially &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; and my all time favorite from 1987 &quot;Celts&quot; and the one that got her on the map &quot;Watermark&quot; with her only Top 40 hit &quot;Orinoco Flows&quot;.<br />But Enyas latest &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; is becoming to sound like the same ole', same ole' but more of a drowned out version.<br />I feel that since &quot;Celts&quot; Enya has been creatively losing her sound and style little by little, and it definitely shows now with &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot;.<br />My favorites are &quot;Silver Inches&quot;, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; and &quot;Fallen Embers&quot;, but that doesn't help the rest of this CD which fades into back ground elevator music.<br />It is not a bad album by any means, but it is just not her best effort.<br />I say if you want to get to know Enya purchase her earlier works first, especially &quot;Celts&quot;.
B00005BJPO|5.0|Bravo! The first time I saw Akira was in 1990. I was a boy in Japan, living as an Marine brat. I got my hands on a ... VHS copy from a friend, and I fell completely in love with it, even though I couldn't understand a single word. <br />The animation blew me away. It was revolutinary in its adult-based content. And it set the stage for a worldwide appreciation of Japan-imation. <br />The digital transfer is superb! The sound is first rate! Not only was the voiceover work re-done, but so were the sound effects. I can see how some people could become attached to the Orion release's pronunciation of names and voices. But having the true Japanese tilt to the read is a joy for the true fan.... <br />To belittle the work done here is to show just how incapable a person is of appreciating the clean-up. This is the same kind of person who gets upset over remastering classic Hollywood movies so they can be appreciated as the director originally intended. This film has the original director's sanction. Can we assuredly say the Orion release did ?<br />The extras are worth the extra cash. They probably could have given us more detail, but they don't disappoint as an inside look at a true cult classic. <br />I don't regret a single penny spent on this, and neither will you.
0192833618|4.0|There is no doubt how I doat upon Jane Austen's novels.  Add &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the list.  Her last finished novel, published after Austen's death, &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a mature novel in more senses than one.  Our heroine, Anne Elliot, is in her late twenties, by far older than say, an Elizabeth Bennet (&quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;) or an Emma Woodhouse (&quot;Emma&quot;).  In addition, Anne seems to have more freedom to move socially and personally than most of Austen's earlier heroines.  Within the restrictive pecking order that governs Austen's ficitional world, this is saying something, since Anne is often presented as limited by family and 'connexions'.  &quot;Persuasion&quot; is a subtle work, as Anne's actions generally take place outside of, and even in spite of, the fashionable circles her family frequents.  All of this combines to form a novel of understated depth and skill.<br />&quot;Persuasion&quot; begins in 1814 - turmoil unsettles the Elliot family of Kellynch-hall - Sir Walter Elliot and his eldest daughter, Elizabeth, live beyond their means upholding family and social pride, and are feeling pressure from creditors and friends to reconstitute their lifestyle.  Reluctantly renting their estate to an Admiral and Mrs. Croft, Sir Walter and his darling Elizabeth retreat to a smaller situation at the ultra-fashionable resort town of Bath.  Sir Walter's middle daughter, Anne, stays behind with an honored family acquaintance, Lady Russell, intending to join the rest of the family shortly.  <br />In retirement thus at Uppercross, Anne is shortly confronted by a change of society - including the return of two men of consequence in her past, a cousin and former heir to her father's estate, William Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, with whom she broke a long engagement eight years before.  Throughout the novel, Anne finds herself forced to negotiate her way through the flippant vanity of her father and sisters, the reserved judiciousnessof her adviser Lady Russell, and her unfortunate friend, Mrs. Smith, while contemplating the possibilities of reestablishing her family's estate with Mr. Elliot or rekindling her affections for Captain Wentworth.  <br />Having recently read &quot;The Romance of the New World&quot; by Joan Pong Linton, I found myself drawn in &quot;Persuasion&quot; to the overarching theme of middle class industry and social advancement versus the supposed inherent virtues of landed nobility.  With the exception of William Elliot, who only anticipates an inheritance, none of the novel's various suitors, Wentworth, Captain Benwick, Charles Hayter, etc., are directly linked to landed money.  Especially in the cases of Wentworth and Benwick, service in the Royal Navy is most often and most convincingly presented as an avenue for monetary, and increasingly, social advancement.  A brief scene in which the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple notices Captain Wentworth in a crowd is enough to show us the virtues and attractiveness of a self-made man in Austen's largely aristocratic (if minor aristocracy) fictional universe.  <br />There is in &quot;Persuasion,&quot; as in most of Austen, a good deal of time afforded to character development, especially in the context of what I like to call background-checks.  In &quot;Persuasion&quot; however, moreso than usual, Anne Elliot is largely left to herself to decide how to proceed in her own most sensitive matters.  That she operates outside of her family's regard, and that of her own trusted friend Lady Russell, makes her unique, strong, and more assertive and self-sufficient than many Austen heroines.  &quot;Persuasion&quot; is an excellent, intimate novel, with many exquisitely crafted moments of pain, pleasure, and humor.  It is one I cannot wait to read again.
1558808000|4.0|This is not really the drum I march to, but I do have to give credit where credit is due. First, I will say that this movie DOES NOT hide behind effects or excessive obscenities. Nor does it try to force feed us any politics. Well, let me start on the film's merits. Fox's first bit of ill fortune is dramatic BUT plausible. (Good!) His desperate run to his distant uncle is drawn well. Although he does not really state his frustraion at the job he manages to get, we can clearly see it. (Great!) The company is drawn well. To put this in civil language, the certain breeches of sacramental promises, the favors given of a PG 13 nature for promotions on the job, the suits who have the childish  'I'm going to tell' attitude, the suits who can never figure out what to do, and the rare suits like Davis who try to be honest and do their job right, all give us a very realistic picture of this kind of environment. The mail room is also drawn very well. Mel and Fox's boss are very well drawn! I was in a situation once where the workers on the low  end of the scale clearly had a higher sense of awareness of what was going on. There were the very few Davises (the more honest and honorable suits), but most of the suits did not fall into this category. Mel clearly shows us someone who has little if anything to lose; so he does not delude himself into going along with the present politics of the environment; he is aware of what goes on; he is cautious to avoid interaction with people better avoided; and his loyalty to Fox is clearly drawn. Fox's boss is also very well drawn. Unlike the suits in charge, he is not smooth. Rather he is quite loud. Somehow, we are given the impression that he is on the intelligent side. At one point, he displays understandable frustration at the suits: 'This is a messenger service! Not a car service!&quot; I DO NOT think it was an accident that this is the character who was the FIRST one to stumble across finding Fox's double game. I don't want to ruin the ending for those of you who have not seen it. So I will just say, it is a memorable fight between politics and reality. Chances are, you will never find this movie boring. The scenery may not be Franco Zeffirelli's, but it is surprisingly well done. If you see this movie, pick it up.
B00004XQ83|4.0|My copy sounds great. And so do the MP3's I ripped from it. It looks like Macrovision still has some homework to do. (Actually I think Mr. Dunn is an idiot).

B00005J9M1|5.0|&quot;Very&quot; has got to rank as nearly the best Pet Shop Boys album ever made. Perhaps &quot;Behavior&quot;, their 1990 masterpiece, has slightly more poignant lyrics, but it is &quot;Very&quot; which manages to meld together vocal, lyrical, and musical excellence. The re-issue, though probably a waste of money for the long-time collector, features some hard-to-find gems that are worth the extra few dollars, if you do not already own them.<br />  &quot;Very&quot; is a full-on, throbbing, delicate, fever-pitched album which flows together seamlessly. From the opening number of &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;, to the shameless &quot;I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing&quot;, to the somber &quot;To Speak Is a Sin&quot;, and the grand finale of &quot;Go West&quot;, the Pet Shop Boys have crafted a collection of nearly every emotion represented, every sound utilized. It is marvelous. The style of music is somewhat dated as early-nineties &quot;techno&quot; (sort of), but it is the quality of its production, lyrics, and sequencing which propels it into the stratosphere of sublime pop recording.<br />  Hmmm, wonder if I like it?<br />  The album has been re-issued in July of 2001, fully-remasted (though it didn't really need to be), and accompanied by a bonus disc entitled &quot;Further listening&quot;. The bonus disc comprises demos, various remixes, and alternate versions of songs from the &quot;Very&quot; period, some material making its release debut on the CD. This is part of the mass re-issue of the Pet Shop Boys' first six albums, &quot;Very&quot; being the sixth.<br />  The main problem is this: If you have been a Pet Shop Boys fan for awhile, as I have, the bonus disc for &quot;Very&quot; isn't anything new. It has, out of the five other re-issued albums, the least amount of 'unreleased material', and consists mostly of b-sides. The b-sides from this period were already released in 1995, and help to make-up their &quot;Alternative&quot; collection. There is nothing wrong with them, persay, it is just that they are some of the more recent and readily accessible works of the Boys. And &quot;Very&quot;, the most recent re-issue, really wasn't in need of re-mastering.<br />  If, however, you are a relatively new Pet Shop Boys fan, and do *not* have any of the material on the bonus disc, then by all means purchase it. It contains music of outstanding depth and quality, and if you haven't even experienced &quot;Very&quot; itself yet, then now is most certainly the time.
0140177396|5.0|As a California writer with my debut novel in its initial release (and a teacher in a rural high school for over twenty years), I am a true admirer of John Steinbeck.  Over the years, and on his way to the Nobel Prize, Steinbeck wrote many fine books.  OF MICE AND MEN is one of his best.  It tells a simple tale of George and Lennie as they travel together and face the challenges life throws in their path.  This novel is complex in its simplicity.  One must read it carefully or one will miss Steinbeck's crucial points.  It is deserving of the acclaim is has received in the decades since its original publication.  Once you have read it, memories of George and Lennie will not easily fade from your memory.
B000003CKH|5.0|this is definately cake's best cd. trust me. second best is probably comfort eagle. but buy this first if you just found out about this weird-but-cool band. so yeah, do it. There's not one song that I don't like on the cd. so yeah, do it. Yeah, damn good cd.
B00004U2G4|5.0|Hard rock albums don't come any better than this one. &quot;Truth&quot; came out sometime in 1968, right after Jeff Beck's stint with the Yardbirds. A great band in their own right who featured 3 great guitar aces in Clapton, Page, and Beck. But it was Beck who was miles ahead of these guys in his knowledge and confidence with the six string. He makes sounds come out of his guitar on &quot;Truth&quot; that I've never heard before or since. What adds fuel to the fire is the singing of a young Rod Stewart, who is in top form on here. He has that good gritty voice that, for my money, is cut out much more for singing this type of music than his later pop material. Some of the outstanding tracks here: &quot;SHAPES OF THINGS&quot;, a reworking of the old Yardbirds song with a little different arrangement, and a meaner and better version. &quot;LET ME LOVE YOU&quot; is a nice heavy blues rock tune with a riff in it that's probably been copied a thousand times since. But it's a Beck original. Great singing by Stewart too. &quot;YOU SHOOK ME&quot; is one of the rudest blues songs ever thrown on vinyl. It's 2:28 of pure angry guitar work. &quot;OL' MAN RIVER&quot; A great slow reworking of the old gospel song. Everyone sounds super on this one. Great drumming by Mick Waller, and quite possibly the best singing performance of Rod Stewart's career. Turn this one up to get the full affects. It's great. &quot;ROCK MY PLIMSOUL&quot; is a good mid-tempo blues shuffle that will never be improved upon from this version. The guitar of Beck and the voice of Stewart trading licks with each other is something to behold. &quot;BECK'S BOLERO&quot; easily makes my top 10 list of best instrumental songs ever. Very heavy stuff. &quot;I AIN'T SUPERSTITIOUS&quot;, what can I say about this old Willie Dixon tune. I still hear it to this day played on the radio from time to time. It's timeless. I think it's the best reworking of a standard blues song that's ever been made. I've never heard a guitar reach out and talk to me the way this one does. Beck's an absolute showoff here. And a genius with a six string. I would lay money that Jimmy Page was giving a close listen to this album before starting his venture with Led Zepplin. Along with most of the other 70's rock acts. I'm always surprised when my music loving friends tell me they've never heard of this album. It's a true classic, and Beck's best work. For me, it's the best blues rock record of the 60's. Fans of classic rock should give &quot;Truth&quot; a listen. I promise it'll knock your socks off.
B00005LMBK|4.0|this cd is great. too bad only six songs are good. but those six are some of the coolest songs out there. #2,5,7,9,10,11. so yeah, if you wanna spend 15 dollars for 6 songs, then go ahead, its worth it. thanks for your time and good evening.
B000001EHS|5.0|To be honest, before buying this cd the only Def Leppard  song i had ever heard was &quot;Poor Some Sugar on Me.&quot; But after listening through the whole album I've realized what a great band and great cd this is! I highly recommend this cd to anyone who's just lookin for some good rock and roll music!
1559408898|4.0|I saw this movie when I was probably a little too young to understand half of the things in it.  But, after subsequent viewings I can easily say that it is a fine piece of movie making.  While at times the acting can seem a little coarse, the story drives the entire film.  The movie automatically gets a bad rap for how violent it is, and probabally why it is kind of shrouded away from the spotlight.  But I know that if you aren't squeamish, you will enjoy the plot and characters very much.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is the real thing.  This album has so much energy and power that it is incredible.  Nothing comes close.  The lyrics are incredible, Steve Jones guitar is so aggressive, the lyrics snarling and right to the heart plus the politics were right on target.   <br />John Lydon was not an anarchist or bomb thrower or hate monger - he was and still is a libertarian.  The working class in the UK has been ... for 500 years plus.  Lydon was pointing out how the whole class system in the UK totally ....  The whole effort by teenage unemployed working class kids on their first album while being jerked around by Mal-cum McLaren and hared by the whole country was amazing. <br />Forget the hype, the BS and everything else.  This album still holds up and is rock and roll at it's absolute finest.  The Pistols made all the faux geniuses like Dylan, the Stones and just about everybody else look like total frauds.<br />This album is pure electricity and almost every song is great.  It is a shame they broke up after essentially one album but how could they ever top this record?  This is not just a great \\"punk\\" album but one of the greatest rock albums ever made - period. It blows away Sgt Peppers or Pet Sounds or anything the Stones ever did. Dylan was faux politics and BS.  This is the real deal.  <br />Holidays in the Sun goes right into your body like a 1000 watts of power. The Pistols changed everything and they changed nothing because the record companies never change.
630469878X|1.0|Ok look I know at this very minute that there are men out there doing bad things to women. But guess what that door swings both ways and do we really need a Movie like this one to enlarge the gender gap between men and women. I really hate the way this movie shows people abusing firearms, being a gun owner that just drives me nuts! When I saw Susan Sarandons character shoot that guy in the parking lot I just threw up my arms and said \\"Now that was really stupid\\"! Sure the guy was a dirt bag and he should be in jail but you can`t use lethal force like that if someone offends you . When she did that she might as well have shot her self because her life was destroyed at that point anyway She should have walked away and got out of there after she got Gena Davis away from him. Well that is all I have to say I am sorry if I offended anyone.

6304143184|5.0|This movie is the single best science fiction movie ever.  If your a movie buff and you don't like this movie then your not really a movie buff.  Some people may diagree but i think this movie is both a classic and an epic.  It has very unique story line.  I mean it probably has one of the most memorable scenes, I think you know which one i'm talking about.  The scene when there flying in at night and the bike goes past the moon.<br />If you haven'tseen it yet go to the video store tonight and rent it you wan't regret it.

B00000JGOH|2.0|Like so much Shakespeare I've seen on stage or screen for the last 40+ years, this is not William so much as it is Earnest Shakespeare, with little magic in the handling of the language but plenty of big music, spectacular costumes &amp; lots of nyah-ha-ha acting. A pity because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry that should be there. Today, it all seems to have become_show &amp; tell, you-are-there, reality-tv presentation. Interesting that Stoppard was involved in this and 15 Minute Hamlet which was far more in the spirit of the Bard.

0316776963|5.0|I bought this book a few weeks ago and my only regret is that I immediately lent it to my brother, who still has it, and I'm already wanting to read it again. I fell for David Sedaris when I saw the hilarious \\"SantaLand Diaries\\" in Denver (Gary Culig's performance was no less than brilliant). I really needed a good laugh again, so I looked up Sedaris [...] and shazam! this book delivered. But Me Talk Pretty is more than a good snort, it's refreshingly well written. Sedaris has mastered the personal essay format. In an age when the Self is overglorified and boring as hell, he leaves out all extraneous ramblings. His sense of humor is like a heat-seeking missile and I, for one, am grateful.
0385501560|5.0|This was one of the best books that I have ever read, with it's perverse sense of humor and an extraordinarily different outlook at the world, you feel like you have actually acquired knowledge after reading it. It's a book that you just can't put down. Unquestionably a must read!
B000002UZ1|4.0|I enjoy both of these cd's and listen to them often. I enjoy these two much more than the &quot;red&quot; ones-I enjoy the diferent sounds the beatles put into these. Beautiful tracks such as hey jude, strawberry fields, while my guitar gently..., and here comes the sun are joined by i am the walrus, back in the ussr, and songs like lady madona and obladioblada to make the cds have a little bit of something for &quot;that mood&quot; you happen to be in.

630027179X|2.0|This could & should have been so much better. One wonders how a really good director capable of making Point Blank & Deliverance created this.... First, there's the casting. While I have no problems with Terry, Lunghi or Clay in more contemporary parts, they're really in way over their heads as Arthur, Guinevere & Lancelot. Perhaps it's the curse of modernism that makes so many actors today so bloody self-conscious & low-key. It seems to effect the overall staging as well making the round table scenes look like a 1960s fashion shoot ...cocktail party. While on the subject, why are all the knights wearing their (brightly polished?!) armor to table? This looks like something intended for 5th graders. From Prince Valiant to Excalibur, movies haven't done well by Arthur. My recommendation: read The Once & Future King (White) AND Arthur Rex (Berger), two brilliantly written, enthralling books.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have heard. Any true Green Day fan...and even those who just like a couple songs...you guys will love this CD.
B00005LKHW|3.0|I have the 'uncut version'. What is the difference besides dishing out another $25? 5 stars for the movie and 1 star for the marketing genius who is out to suck more money out of the consumer.
6303477259|3.0|This video may have been longer than Delicate Sound Of Thunder but the musicians flat out stunk, including the only 2 girls back up singers, on Pulse the sax player, where did they get that mediocar musician, on DSOT the sax player was 5 times better and made a difference with his passionate playing, David Gilmour didn't even seem to be enjoying himself, as if he knew the band had no support from the others outside of the band it self.. DSOT is a lot more enjoyable to watch and the band actually seems to be having fun, several smiles from Gilmour, the band and the girls and the band and Gilmour nailed the songs with perfection!!.. This video PUlSE is far too overated..
B0000028VT|4.0|Wow, the old Mariah..This album was really one of the last truly great moments of her career(at this point). This was before the arrival of &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and the departure of most of her clothing(not that I mind that part, but still..). I was only a sophomore in highschool when this was released. As much as I would like to blame this appreciation for Mariah on a girlfriend at the time, I can't. I discovered her all on my own, a time when most of my peers were indulging in &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;, &quot;Nirvana&quot;, and &quot;Pearl Jam&quot;, but I'm not ashamed to say these songs have helped me through some rough times. As most have pointed out &quot;Hero&quot; is a truly wonderful song, sometimes I'm not in the mood for it, but it still can be soothing. &quot;Without You&quot; could possibly feature the most heart wrenching vocals I have ever heard, she puts' so much into that one, the angst can really be felt. &quot;Just To Hold You Once Again&quot;, very simple, no dramatic pick up in the music, just a great expression of desperation, and a missed opportunity for a single..As for the rest of the album, &quot;Never Forget You&quot; is one I have always liked, originally I simply viewed it as another ending of a relationship type song, but I believe this one goes a little deeper than that, to deal with the loss of a loved one. &quot;Dreamlover&quot; is some decent pop, but honestly, for the most part, I have never cared too much for the upbeat music Mariah has released, not that it's bad, but with this style, I usually am only drawn to the more emotional material. Well, I suppose that about says it all, this was before Mariah &quot;Jumped The Shark&quot;, but I still believe she has it in her to be this good again. Even her last couple of releases have contained some powerful performances. She has a beautiful voice and is a talented songwriter, and this album is the perfect example..Maybe someday she will quit selling herself short.
0440234743|5.0|This one is my favorite of Grisham's so far. I really like the plot and the way the story was written.  The Testament is about an old man who was very rich. So rich, infact, his self-made fortune was 11 billion dollars. Now, the whole story is about who his fortune will go to. The old man's name is Troy Phelan and a few minutes before he dies, he re-writes his will, naming the sole-heir of his fortune Rachel lane. No one knows who she is and Troy's 6 children are furious when they find out!   Josh Stafford, Troy's lawyer needs to send someone to find this Rachel Lane. He finds out she's living in the jungles of brazil and sends nate O'Riley, a lawyer who was in rehab for alcohol addiction. Now, Nate must go to Brazil and face alligators, anacondas, and tropical diseases to find Rachel Lane.  Excellent book, except the ending was a little fast and he could have slowed it down a little but other than that, excellent!
0375703764|5.0|I heard of this book when I saw the author on stage with his sister performing the song, &quot;Hey Pretty.&quot; I bought this book and was just sucked in from the very first page.  I have been told this is a very eccentric book, but I didn't expect the tone to be set on the first page.<br />I finished this book in just a couple of days.  It took me a long time b/c of the complicated narrations and structuring of some pages. But the way this is presented really emphasizes the eerieness of the story.<br />this is a haunting book and will give you goosebumps!
B00005B4GU|5.0|If you haven't been dissapointed by radiohead by now. This album won't change your opinion. I don't see the need for 420 reviews of an album that should definitly have been picked up by long time fans by now (in limited edition form!), and would be a definite addition to any music fans collection. Every body here seems to be reviewing this album for the sole perpose of comparing it to the other Radiohead albums. I certianly don't feel the need to pick a favorite since I would never be able to pick between ok computer, the bends, or Kid A anyways. It just should go with out saying that their is actually a very small amount of music out there that sounds like this. You should be so lucky that we didn't wait 4 years for the follow up to the last 3 albums. This is a wonderful radiohead album that does seem to get back into more accoustic work and a little more drum work than Kid A while keeping the far out sound the made Kid A sound so different from the others. If you haven't liked radiohead after the last couple albums you will probably hate this too.  One of my top ten albums of the year.
B000002TPS|5.0|This is a great album to have if you know you like Megadeth, although I favor RIP over this one. Megadeth is one of those bands who you can't really get the full gist of their music with only one CD- They have many albums that complement each other, this being a crucial one to have. Oh yeah, just to let everybody know- Dave Mustaine DIDN'T write all of the leads that you hear on Kill 'em All, but just the 4 seconds or so that each solo begins with (because the guys from Metallica wanted Kirk to start them that way) 95% of those licks on Kill em All are Kirk's (oh wait, I'm reviewing a Megadeth CD)- bottom line is this is a great album that you should buy if you know you like Megadeth- you'll know what I'm talking about after you listen to it.

B000059R8Y|4.0|I am a big eric clapton fan, but i must admit that his recent work lacks an edge, the edge that attracted me to him during his cream days.  But this album is delightful, just nice easy listening that has enough little touches to keep the stuff interesting.  The material is varied, but the sound is definately clapton.  The opening title track is a upbeat coffehouse jazz type instrumental, which has a great clear sound and a catchy rhthym and great playing.  On the other songs Clapton's voice is strong and very bluesy-his best vocals ever on this album.  The best songs of this album are &quot;Reptile&quot; the infectious &quot;Ain't Gonna Stand For It&quot; &quot;Got You on My Mind&quot;-great blues slide, and &quot;Travelin' Light&quot;.  This album does somewhat lack an edge but in this case it makes the album nice easy listening on a summer day.  Superb album from a suberb musician.  Highly recommended
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather collection is something that goes beyond words. Your really have to just experence it.  Its Majestic, dramatic, and powerful at all times.  But the most important thing is that it teaches us about power. Francis Ford Coppola created a masterpiece!
B000002JSP|3.0|In Through The Out Door is definitely Led Zeppelin's weakest effort. It's not bad by any means, but it's not up to Zeppelin's previous standards of excellence. It's not even up to the level of the previous album, Presence, which wasn't exactly a great album itself. Overall, the album is pretty good, but it's marred by Carouselambra, a TERRIBLE track, which also happens to be the album's longest! Ten torturous minutes of horrible synthesizers. Other than this stinker, the album is good. Fool In The Rain is the album's best song. All My Love is good, too, but would be better without the excessive synthesizers. This is far from essential Zeppelin, and should be sought out only by completists and hard-core fans. Newcomers should start with Zeppelin I through IV.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Wow!! What can i say about Play except its one of a kind!!!!! There are not many artists who can mix so many different music genres and come out with an outstanding album! From mellow dance to pumping rock to spiritual gospel, Moby manages to produce an album that gels together seamlessly despite the varied musical spectrum it adopts. For this reason it is such a UNIQUE album.   It took time for me to appreciate the quality of Play at first, with 18 tracks and each one having its own character i felt somewhat bewildered by its nature. You really need to keep on listening to it to fully appreciate it, it is a slow burner but in a good way. I find the great albums are ones where the longer u listin to them  the better they gets.  There is not really one obvious weak track on Play, however I do have many personal favorite ones 'Why does my heart feel so bad?', 'Run on', 'Bodyrock' and 'Everloving' to name but a few. However, my personal fave and i think a lot would agree porcelain is the ultimate chill out track!! It expresses the emotions of jeolously and remorse with vocals by moby himself. I just love the intro to this song, it really sets the vibe for the album!!!!   Top stuff Moby! Cant wait for the new stuff!!!
B000002UEB|5.0|&quot;Operation:  Mindcrime&quot; is one the few CD's (and I have a few) that I can listen to backwards and forwards without skipping a single track.  Although Queensryche achieved even greater success with their next album, &quot;Empire&quot;, 'Mindrcrime' is definitely an album worth plunking down a few bucks for!  You will not be disappointed!  My favorites are the title track, &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot;, &quot;Speak&quot;, and &quot;I Don't Believe in Love&quot;.  Like I said, the entire album is absolutely amazing and probably somewhat underrated in the metal world.
B00000IAU3|3.0|Im glad Dido sells many records. She has a beautiful voice and also she cowrites her songs. But \\"No Angel\\" only has a couple of  very good songs: \\"Here with me\\" and \\"Thank you\\". There are another good songs; for example, \\"Dont think of me\\", \\"My lovers gone\\" and \\"Isobel\\". Even so, after a few listens you realize that \\"No Angel\\" is not a hot cd. I hope Dido grows up as a singer. I am absolutely sure she can do it.
0441172717|4.0|After reading both versions, one has to wonder why the 25th Anniversary rewrite was performed?  Was it to produce more sales? Quite possibly.  The 25th Ann edition looses significant character development and intensity from the original.  <br />If it is the only version that can be found, by all means read it.  I would though suggest that one look for Herbert's original version of Dune.
B00003CXPD|5.0|While there were some funny monments in Billy Elliot, on the whole it was a bit dark.  That said. I very much enjoyed this movie. From the dark beginnings in a minning town in Britain in the midst of a violent strike, to the inspirational ending.  With just enough funny monments salted into the mixture to take the sting out of the overall heavyness of the place and time in which Billy lives.  You will walk out of this movie feeling great!  It is one of those &quot;Anything is possible type films that is well worth your time&quot;
B000056V73|5.0|This movie was very entertaining. It grabs your attention at the beginning and doesn't let go. My favorite scenes were William's mother's talk on the phone with Russell (&quot;You can still make yourself into a person of substance,&quot; &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot;), the scene in the bus where the cast sings Elton John's &quot;Tiny Dancer&quot;, and the end. Kate Hudson is a very beautiful and amazingly gifted actress, and I hope to see Patrick Fugit in some more movies after this. Very inspiring film.
1878574590|3.0|The art in this title is amazing.  The plot was very cool.  The characterization however could have been a lot better.  Marv seemed to be innconsistant.  He would jump back from idiot to  to fearless barbarian to cowering child to long winded narrator.  I didn't get Marv, in his stupid obssesive barbarian mode he shines but all others he annoys.  If Marv had been more consistant this would be a 4 1/2 star book.  If the rest of the characters had more character(Goldie, Roark) a 5 star book.  Art was very unique and the plot was fun yet Miller should have spent more time on the characters and narration.  The narration was lacking.  Most will still enjoy but maybe not fall in love.  Check out &quot;Kabuki: Circle of Blood&quot; by David Mack.
0385501560|5.0|I actually picked this book up in the &quot;How To&quot; section of my local bookstore. No lie. I could spend hours trying to decipher the accidental or intended implications of such a placement, which stinks of either conspiracy or revolution, I can't tell which.<br />Anyway, seeing as Fight Club is my all time favorite movie, it only seems logical that I'd gravitate towards ol' Chucks work. Why it took me so long I can't say. Having read none of his other books, I can't really compare them. I can say that I will be purchasing them shortly. Choke is brilliant and extremely funny. It's not often that a novel can make me laugh hysterically in public, but this one did. <br />The premise of the book and one of it's strengths is the theory that if you make someone else into a hero, they'll love you forever. The protagonist repeatedly fakes choking to death in restaurants to pay his dying mothers hospital bills, but at the same time, he demonstrates that even the most ordinary people have the capacity for the extraordinary. It's sick and beautiful at the same time. Peppered with addiction, sex, insanity, medical references, urban legends, and a ton of Oedipus issues; Choke is about confronting your past, or being consumed by it. Like Fight Club (the movie that is. I know, I blaspheme.) it's about tearing down who you think you are to find out who you really are. It's about rebirth and redemption, perception and illusion. <br />It's about all that stuff and more, but bottom line, it's just a blast to read. If you like Vonnegut, Irving Welsh or David Foster Wallace, chances are this book is for you. It will probably make you laugh, it might even make you think, but it will definitely entertain you.
B00005AAFS|5.0|I cannot think of any single CD from which I can extract more fun than from Rammstein's new Mutter.  Sometimes I buy one CD if it contains just one good song but here every song is incredible.The guitar play is superb and is unlike any artists I have encountered.  You can listen just to few songs for hours.  <br />So far this is my longest lasting CD.  Usually it takes one to two weeks for a good CD to lose its appeal, but this one is going and going almost like its recycled.  <br />One thing I love about Rammstein is just how angry the music sounds. When my friends listen to this music almost all of them remark on how angry Till's voice is.  One of my frineds says : ... Thats true I think that this is one of the most aggressive albums they have released yet, but I love it.  Somehow the anger in Till's voice puts the message to a greater height.  This is especially true with the songs like Zwitter, Links 234, Ich Will, and Spieluhr.  The anger  in the voice adds to the intensity that is offset by powerful guitar rhythm.<br />In short, this is the most fun that listening to music is. This is a real bad a** album and a must have for anyone who likes Rammstein.
B000003S0P|5.0|KC as power trio, add cello, trumpet or sax and you have a period of King Crimson which is perhaps my favorite.  More avant-garde sounding than the prog of their past, and not the pyrotechnic fireworks of the 80's incarnation.  <br />Some say this is a heavy metal record.  Not having much use for metal, I just imagine the hair metal bands of the 80's trying to equal this musically.  What a joke!  There may be some kindred elements, but whereas the metal ilk always seemed to be a bunch of posers, (whether it's the big hair pose or the Dr. Death pose) this stuff is true musical artistry.<br />Once in the 70's I gave a party, (this was during the reign of disco) and everyone wanted to hear dance music.  As I didn't own any, my roommate and I put this on, as this was perhaps our favorite album at the time.  The crowd wilted immediately--Hah!  <br />KC was always filed under &quot;progressive&quot; and there are people who dismiss all prog as overblown and ridiculous, (when they think prog they think of something like Styx--egad!) and as such have missed out on some fantastic guitar music, as Robert Fripp, the leader of this band, is a virtuoso.  A friend told me that Kurt Cobain was greatly influenced by this album.  Good to see that younger generations acknowledge those who came before.  To quote Mark Twain, &quot;the ancients stole all our best ideas.&quot;
B00005BJPO|5.0|This double disc is a must of Akira Fans. Remastered and redigitized (enhanced colors) this movie is a joy to watch.<br />I guess the non collectors edition must be ok too, but come on this is AKIRA! Who are you kidding you know you NEED the two disk version....
B00001SIES|5.0|Very Simple. Muse are Great. I have seen them live. I love all the songs on both CD's. Buy the god damn CD people...please...for your own good. Give in to your wanton capitalist nature, live life in the fast lane for a change, don't be so tight. Buy, Buy, Buy.
0345350499|5.0|If you saw the TNT movie that aired recently then you most definately want to read the book.  While I thought the movie was good, the book is just so much better!   Many of the motivating factors behind the characters actions were left out of the movie.  You get to know so little about the lives of the characters in the movie, that they appear flat, often foolish, and none are particullarly likable.  While in the book they come to life, filled with passions, and rich personal pasts that direct each of thier downfalls.   The book may appear long at first glance, but there are so many vibrant characters, many left out of the movie, that you will feel it was far too short when you reach the end.
B0000560XI|4.0|I bought this to try the 5.1 audio capability.  I have a sony dvd w/ built in 5.1 decoder.  When playing this disc, i get good sound in the 5.1 mode but no center channel sound!  I can get 5 speakers w/ the dolby pro-logic setting, but it is of reduced quality compared to the 5.1 sound.  Possibly I don't have the right type of player (Sony DVPS560D)or the mix intentionally leaves out the center channel.  I could access the &quot;Making of BVSC&quot; section.  My advice is to check closely the disc/player combo's you buy.
B00005A1PR|5.0|After hearing many recommendations for this album, I decided to give it a try and buy it. And I am SO glad I did! This is undoubtly once of the best r&b/neo soul albums released this year, the album is full of beautiful, moving songs which touched my heart, especially \\"ready for love\\". \\"video\\" is not the best track, it is merely a taster of what's to come. I was lucky enough to see her and Musiq Soulchild perform a concert in Shepard's Bush, London, and THE VOICE!! Her voice was so powerful they had to adjust the microphone setting! She sung every track she performed with perfection, the only negative aspect was that she wasn't on stage for long enough! And to top it all off, she was really funny and down-to-earth. So there you have it. You now have no reason WHATSOEVER to dislike the girl. Unless you are jealous of her natural talent (and beauty) which is possible. So, to sum it all up, the album's a must ...
B000002LND|5.0|Duplicated (hear that Britney!). The Immaculate Collection showcases Madonna at her best. This is her best music to date. Here's a breakdown (not neccessarily in order):<br />1.Holiday-Madonna's best dance tune. A Classic. 3.5/5<br />2.Lucky Star-An amazing track. Brings back memories for anyone who grew up in the 80's and wanted to be Madonna *raises hand*. 3.5/5<br />3.Borderline-Another amazing track, great dance tune, fun to sing along with. 3.5/5<br />4.Like A Virgin-Like A Virgin/Touched for the very first time/Like A Viiiirgin/When your heart beats/Next to mine. Classic. How can you not like Madonna? she just rules. 4/5<br />5.Material Girl-Great track. Another sing-along song. 5/5<br />6.Crazy For You-Great ballad. Showcases Madonna's strong vocals. Originally a song on the &quot;Vision Quest SDRK&quot;. 5/5<br />7.Into The Groove-Another great dance song of Madonna's. How can anyone not want to dance to this song? Impossible. 5/5<br />8.Live To Tell-Great song, but a little to slow for me. A song during her Sean Penn days, I believe from Shanghei Surprise. Great ballad. A man could tell a thousand lies/I've learned my lesson well/Hope I Live To Tell the secrets I have learned till then/It will burn inside of me. 4/5<br />9.Papa Don't Preach-Forget her belly button, this song got alot of criticism, as it advocates a single women keeping her baby. Great song. 4/5<br />10.Open Your Heart-One of my all time favorite Madonna songs. From 86's True Blue. This song brings back alot of memories. I wanted to be Madonna, from wanting to dance like her, to just wanting to sing and dress like her, Madonna the goddess. 5/5<br />11.La Isla Bonita-Great song, another great dance song. 5/5<br />12.Like A Prayer-Slightly different version than the original, but nonetheless awesome. 5/5<br />13.Express Yourself-Come on girls/You believe in love/Well, I've got something to say about it/And it goes something like this.....nuff said. Madonna rules! 5/5<br />14.Cherish-Great song! 5/5<br />15.Vogue-What you looking at! again, different than the original, but still great. Ladies with an attitude/Fellas that were in the mood/Don't just stand there/Let's get to it/Strike a pose/There's nothing to it...Vogue!....5/5<br />16.Justify My Love-Very sensual.....the video is even steamier, as Maddy got into the 90's, she got more and more daring and controversial, which is why this video got banned by MTV....facists! Co-written by Lenny Kravitz with additional lyrics by Madge, JML is a great song.5/5<br />17.Rescue Me-Great song, one of the &quot;new&quot; songs (at the time anyway, along with JML), not as good as her other songs on the album but still a great closing to a wicked album.4/5<br />In conclusion:Great songs, with NO filler. My only complaint is some songs that are missing like:Dress You Up,Causing A Commotion,True Blue,Where's The Party,Who's That Girl,Burning Up,Oh Father and Angel. Plus, some songs are remixed while some songs are shorter than the originals, otherwise AWESOME greatest hits from Madonna, if you are a big fan of her 80's early 90's stuff, then this is a must have for any Madonna fan. Madonna is the best....no one will ever take her place as the reigning Queen of Pop, even as she approaches middle age and is a wife and mom, she will always be beautiful inside and out, she's been entertaining us for 2 decades (going for three) and there will never be a more daring public figure than Madonna. Even after her all the controversies, she will always be the best Pop star that ever lived (don't laugh, she is). Madonna:The Pop Goddess!<br />Madonna:Often imitated,NEVER duplicated.
B00000G3Q4|5.0|This movie provided more scares and laughs while launching the career of a very stylistic director. This film demonstrates how scares can be pulled from the audience without the need for excessive violence, then offers up excessive violence in an almost mocking manner. Sam Raimi provided this cult classic to the world, and I while I can't represent everyone, I think it's safe to say that the world thanks Sam.<br />The DVD offers a few bonus materials. The commentary by Bruce &quot;Don't Call Me Ash&quot; Campbell is interesting and funny, providing glimpses into the errors that made it to the final cut as well as providing humorous insights to the making. The commentary by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert is very intersting too, although I would probably say I preferred Bruce's. The Behind the Scenes and alternate takes were interesting at first, but after a while, hearing someone scream can get old. 20 minutes just downright hurts. But don't let that deter you. Get this DVD and stay groovy.

6305537798|5.0|This movie can get enough good things said about it.I'm sure you all know the plotline, but the comedy and romance doesn't keep it boaring.Julia Stiles is a talented young actress and she shows it more in this film than in any of her others.To tell you the truth, Heath Ledger was at first the only reason i saw this film,i mean what more can you say about him besides HOT!The film really lives up to its expectations.Its got great music, i do suggest that you pick up the soundtrack after you see it.This is definatley not another one of those teen movies or another chick flick.Its defiantley worth buying.Ok i hope i've said enough.

B000002A33|5.0|No words are appropriate enough, when you want to describe &quot;Dust&quot;, the final masterpiece by the Seattle-based band, Screaming Trees. It's a real highlight of all-time psychedeia, a collection of wonderful songs like The Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;, or like Led Zeppelin's fourth album. The Trees were always a totally &quot;old-fashioned&quot; (I use this phrase now as one of the greatest compliments)band who played spaced-out garage-psychedelia from the early years on, which had really nothing in common with the disillusioned whining of the ragged Grunge anti-heroes. The record starts with the &quot;thunderful&quot; &quot;Halo Of Ashes&quot;, a powerful sitar-rocker which makes you feel like the lover of the sexiest tantrika. Then comes &quot;All I Know&quot;, a pure rock-anthem-Do I have to say anything else? &quot;Look At You&quot; flies you to the secret forest of love,while &quot;Dying Days&quot; brings you colourful dreams about the &quot;ghost town&quot; of your soul. &quot;Make My Mind&quot; is a fantastic dance-rock song like Shocking Blue's &quot;Venus&quot;, spiced with enough eroticism to make you jump onto your girlfriend immediatelly. &quot;Sworn And Broken&quot; is the song of harmonic union (despite its melancholic title), but as soon as it ends you take the motley hippi-train of rock 'n' roll with &quot;Witness&quot;. &quot;Traveler&quot; is the highlight of highlights: a psychedelic ballad with the most beautiful mellotron-playing I've ever heared, spiced with one of Lanegan's strongest vocal performances. It's a sheer orgy of melodies, undoubtedly the &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; of the Trees. &quot;Dime Western&quot; is the march of space-cowboys, which kicks off with an amazing version of Jesus Christ Superstar's starting-riff. The journey ends with &quot;Gospel Plow&quot; and you're finally one with the universe. I know that I wrote almost nothing about the music itself, but I believe that if you love the afore-mentioned moods, there's nothing better than &quot;Dust&quot; in the whole Galaxy. Have a nice trip!
B00005ABIP|4.0|I don't know if cake knows what it's capable of, but a few more years of living will reveal the complex layers.  The talent is immense.  To me there's more words being spoken in the music than the actual lyrics.<br />Their use of trumpets and (the mandolin?) are the answer to the stale guitar/drum rhythms that plague the norm... brings and international mediterranean &quot;ska&quot; flavor.<br />Every song that means anything to me has a story attached.  &quot;Where would I be&quot; brings the desolation of being an American broke in Poland (stolen purse).<br />Cake is no where near filling it's hard drive capabilities.  Just a matter of letting &quot;The Cure&quot;-like experimentations go and committing to quality lyrics worthy of it's kick-@#5 music.
038533348X|5.0|Vonnegut's dark comedy masterpiece is one of the best books I've ever read.  He successfully blends philosophy, science fiction, and humor to create an interesting and hilarious novel.  In my opinion, this is the best book Vonnegut wrote, which is saying a lot considering his other triumphs.  Anyone looking for a plot heavy book should probably look elsewhere.  Vonnegut's novels focus much more on the characters and their traits (flaws, many times).  This is a wonderful story about the nature of man and his tendencies towards destruction.  The ending (while trashed by many other reviewers - perhaps they didn't get it) is one of the funniest and most chilling things I have ever read.  This book is wonderful for its ability to make the reader look at oneself and laugh.  A must read.
0792156684|4.0|I intentionally avoided seeing this when it first came out beause of all the hype. And I doubly avoided seeing it when it won all those academy awards. As a Titanic fanatic for more than thirty years, reading and whatever I could about the great ship, even teaching it in high school, I was sure it would disappoint me. Then, one night, on a whim, I decided to rent it with my wife.<br />I have to admit I was blown away.<br />It gripped me from the first moment... and never let me go. I was disturbed I reacted so emotionally to the movie. I dislike Leo (something about him just irks me) and didn't want to admit I was sentimental about something he was in that was so hyped and popular. But I couldn't deny the way I reacted.<br />About a year later I rewatched Titanic for the first time since that original experience and it got me again. Damn. I must be a sentimental fool. But what can I say? Shoot me. That's the way I reacted.<br />Now, in the retrospect of time, I think I can identify, for myself at least, some of the movie's strengths and weaknesses. The strengths of the movie are:<br />1) special effects,<br />2) musical score (I purchased the sountrack and played it in my car regularly for a year till I became pretty much sick of it),<br />3) fascinating historical setting extremely well recreated<br />4) epic feel<br />5) some really good supporting performances<br />6) and, yes, the love story (I know this is where I'll lose some people)<br />The weaknesses are:<br />1) Some stilted dialogue<br />2) some stilted acting of stilted dialogue<br />3) Leo's arrogance (sometimes appropriate, admittedly, but sometimes nauseating)<br />4) hype surrounding the movie<br />It is my opinion now, given the perspective of time, that if viewed in a vacuum without the hype and expectation (if that's possible) it's a good movie, even a darn good movie, that can be moving. Heck, seeing the Titanic in computer graphic flesh alone would have been enough for me. And the music is literally out of this world. But even the love story, if you let your guard down, can work. And, believe me, I'm no Leo fan. Still, when he sinks away into oblivion, or when he and Rose are reunited in her dream/afterlife vision at the very end, something touches me and gets my emotional juices going.<br />Call me a fool. An idiot. Love -- lost and otherwise -- tends to make idiots of people. Here's to having more such idiocy in our lives!f this world. But even the love story, if you let your guard down, can work. And, believe me, I'm no Leo fan.

B000002A33|5.0|No words are appropriate enough, when you want to describe &quot;Dust&quot;, the final masterpiece by the Seattle-based band, Screaming Trees. It's a real highlight of all-time psychedeia, a collection of wonderful songs like The Beatles' &quot;Revolver&quot;, or like Led Zeppelin's fourth album.

0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a powerful and interesting re-telling of King Arther's court. The book gives a very unique point of view because it was the first to be narrated by the women of Camelot. Much more exciting then the TNT movie, this novel is exciting, poetic, and a definite page turner. I would recumend it to anybody with an imagination.
6305807086|5.0|I gave this film five stars, and there's nothing I want to add to the other reviews.  If you haven't seen this movie, it's best to just see it without reading reviews because they all contain spoilers.  This is such an outrageously original movie, it's best to see it without knowing much about it.  If you're the type who is willing to buy rather than rent if a film is &quot;known good,&quot; this is definetely worth buying.  I saw it first on a rented DVD, then saw it later on VHS and I was stunned by how VHS' poor technical quality detracts from the enjoyment of the film.  This is one movie that demands the quality of DVD.  And this movie is so delicious, it's worth buying a DVD player just to treasure it.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I had heard about India.Arie for awhile, but was not familiar with her music at all. This past weekend when I went to see Sade in in concert, she was the opening act. All I have to say is that she is wonderful....immediately went the next day and bought the album and it does not disappoint. The hook for me was when she sang &quot;Ready For Love&quot; as an encore...the album version is just as good. Try to listen to this album without experiencing chills several times. I'm not going to dissect the various songs, as I have only listened to this about 3 times. Read the other reviews and you'll see that this is definitely an artist to explore and watch.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a classic 90's cd. It's one of those cd's you have to own. There are very few bands of the last decade that can be placed in that &quot;classic, go down in history&quot; group of elite bands and Nirvana is one of them. Despite the fact that MTV, as it always manages to, caused overkill with the &quot;It Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; video and everything else, Nirvana puts almost anything else created in the 90's (especailly the late 90's pop ...) to shame. This cd has been a favorite for years and I don't think I will ever get sick of it. Kurt Cobain and the rest of Nirvana was amazing and they rightfully have a legacy that will be remembered.

0312932081|5.0|this book is not just a regular science fiction book.  this book actually has some depth that i have not seen in any other type of science fiction book or movie.  this book did not make the reader feel like a kid for reading it.  the use of grammer in this book made the me feel that i wasnt reading a childrens book.  i would really like to see this book series made into a movie someday
0060273224|3.0|Though enetertaining (I read it in two days) some things were a bit too predictable. For example, Touchstone's identity. He himself gave the clue by leaving something out of one of his explanations. But it wasn't bad.
B000002J1F|5.0|_Fragile_ is a very good album for those who are wondering what Yes album to start with.  For starters, it was the first album with popular keyboardist Rick Wakeman &amp; it contains several very well known radio tracks (&quot;Roundabout&quot;, &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;/&quot;Fish&quot;).  It also contains two of Yes' best pieces - the hard rockin' &quot;South Side of the Sky&quot; and the beautifully arranged and aggressive &quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot;.  In addition, each member (Anderson, Bruford, Wakeman, Howe, and Squire) gets a chance to have their own &quot;song&quot; to showcase their abilities on their respective instruments.  Highly recommended!
0060278234|2.0|Though I finished the book in 2 days, it wasn't great. For starters, it gets about halfway through the story and leaves you hanging. We have to wait for &quot;Abhorsen&quot; to read the ending. Mogget, though always dangerous, has changed a bit in personality, for the worst. I liked him better in Sabriel. Other parts were predictable, ESPECIALLY if you've read  &quot;Sabriel&quot; (Lirael's other Blood-type, Sameth's destiny--the biggest clue to this comes through Touchstone's own blood...). So, the best thing to do would be waiting until &quot;Abhorsen&quot; is out, so that you can read them both, one right after the other.          It is a good story, though, don't get me wrong (with very loveable characters, such as the Disreputable Dog). I'd just rather have been allowed to see the outcome, instead of being &quot;suspended&quot; in time.
B000001DYY|4.0|The first Tears for Fears album without Curt Smith, _Elemental_ is basically Roland Orzabal's baby and it's quite good. As the first Tears for Fears album of the 90's, it contains excellent, bright production and solid songwriting.  Standout tracks include the title cut, &quot;Break It Down Again&quot;, and &quot;Fish Out of Water&quot; ( a rather direct jab at Smith ).  In addition, it contains &quot;Goodnight Song&quot;, an interesting take on the inevitable 'encore' performed at concerts.  Orzabal is an excellent songwriter, and handling most of the duties on _Elemental_, he proves that he is a very talented musician that seems to have not gotten the attention he deserves.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This CD lives up to all the strange spooky hype surrounding it. It's funky and fine, trippy and tripped up. Being an old geezer of 31 and raised on classic rock, I am not familiar with Blur and/or Cibo Matto. I was drawn in by that stunning MTV clip. (Watch the channel at 7 am, they actually play music!!!) I am stoked by the weirdness the group has surrounded themselves with. And the production of the music itself is both subtle and earthshaking. As the type hype says, this is the music of the future, baby. Hop in your ship and go....
B000002J1I|3.0|_Tormato_ is a mixed bag of songs.  There are several excellent tracks (&quot;On The Silent Wings of Freedom&quot;, &quot;Onward&quot;, &quot;Release, Release&quot;) and there are several songs that are very good but are knocked down a few notches because of the weak production and uncharacteristic-of-Yes subject matter (&quot;Arriving UFO&quot;, &quot;Circus of Heaven&quot;).  Other songs such as &quot;Madrigal&quot; and &quot;Future Times/Rejoice&quot; are strong but, as has been mentioned before, Wakeman and Howe often seem to be trying to play too many notes.  This album is often regarded as one of Yes' weakest, but it's worth getting if you're a big fan of the band.  If you're a casual fan, there are better places to start your introduction to Yes.
0451191153|5.0|While I am by no means an objectivist, The Fountainhead is one of my favorite books. Why? Because its theme reflects and glorifies my deepest values of art.<br />This is the story about two architects. One, Howard Roark, is a brilliant yet radical artist who wishes to design buildings strictly to satisfy his own desire to create. His uncompromising and unusual designs get him kicked out of school, and he heads to New York to start a career. Roark is pensive man, impossibly confident, proud, and never sees himself or his work in relation to others. He judges himself strictly according to his own values. Truly an independent man. He endeavors to please no one but himself.<br />The other architect is Peter Keating. Keating is also a brilliant young man, but he lacks Roark's sense of assurance and individuality. Lacking self-confidence, he feeds on the flattery and can only exist on others' opinions. His designs are unoriginal menageries of past architectural conventions, and he must compromise artistic integrity for satisfying everyone else.<br />The book spends much of its time following these two men and their careers. Keating meets with easy success thanks to his mainstream designs that make everyone happy. Roark often struggles to find work with his atypical designs, and his refusal to accommodate the desires of the client makes things tricky. The Fountainhead's objective is to show why Roark is the hero and Keating is the \\"bad guy.\\" (There's other \\"bad guys\\" that come into the plot later with their own complexities, but let's keep the review simple.)<br />One problem is already evident. Architecture is largely comparable to any other business...it's about serving the customer. If someone wants a \\"lame\\" Greek- or Renaissance-style home, an architect isn't necessarily inferior as a person because he's trying to do good business.<br />But this book is not about architecture. To me, it's about a heroic artist. Architecture is just the vehicle with which Roark's story is told (Rand could have made Roark a musician, or something). In any case, The Fountainhead makes Rand's case (that man's ego generates the desire to create) in a striking manner. I think the ideas in this novel have tremendous impact, especially today.<br />...<br />You see, The Fountainhead, despite the faults of Ayn Rand's philosophy (more completely explored in Atlas Shrugged, another good book), is a powerful story because of its credo on art and some other themes that can be extrapolated through Roark. And Roark is a fantastic hero. Yes, in standard terms he's a self-absorbed sociopath (although he does get friends later), but he has many great qualities. He's honest, he knows what he wants, he's a genius, he's individualistic, and perfectly happy with himself. Is he the perfect man (as Rand would have it)? Probably not, but in The Fountainhead he's the perfect hero.<br />Many have faulted The Fountainhead for being a naive projection of ideals, for its unrealistically black and white characters, and didactic writing. The didactic thing bothered me -- later in the book there's parts where Rand loses that narrative objectivity and gets a bit pushy instead of just letting the character convey the ideas and letting the reader see things himself. But as for the romantic and black & white elements, I think those are part of makes the book so much more powerful. The message would have been suffocated by characters possessing a mix of good and bad qualities. With Roark being \\"white\\" and Keating and Ellsworth Toohey being unambiguously \\"black,\\" Rand makes her message remarkably powerful.<br />And I also think Rand's a great writer. She can get more out of a person's physical description than any author I've read, and the way she captures that lucid sense of greatness in Roark's buildings is pretty magnificent. As for Roark...I wouldn't want to be him, but he is a great hero. One that I'll never forget.is told (Rand could have made Roark a musician, or something).

0793518326|3.0|I will say that an undertaking of transcribing all the Beatles songs is quite a difficult task. This book does a fairly decent job of getting things correct.  2 Complaints First ,the format makes it difficult in some cases, to read. I have ( or had prior to getting this book)  good eyes, but I find myself squinting at many of the pages. I'd rather pay a little extra if this was in a larger format with bigger font.  Second, If it says complete scores, then all the notes should be there, I have found many errors in just the first week that I have had this book, most notably in the bass parts. Look at  &quot;While my Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; what is written sounds fine, but it's not what on the record. <br />It is a fun book, but don't think you are getting complete accuracy, and be prepared for a little eye strain.
0375703861|4.0|Like most of the reviewers, I read 'White Teeth' because I wanted to know whether its author was deserving of all the critical acclaim or whether it was just hype.  Glad to say, Zadie Smith should be proud of her first novel; its merits greatly overshadow its flaws.<br />As for the story, 'White Teeth' is a rather elaborate tale of two interracial couples and their children in north London from the mid-1970s until the present.  All the characters are a bit odd, each one suffering one form of neurosis or another in coping with life in a racially mixed environment.  It is these characters which are memorable, not the plot (which is actually a collection of rather whimsical and unbelievable travails these characters get into). <br />Where Zadie Smith fails most is her inability to contain her enthusiasm for writing.  'White Teeth' is a joy to read, for the first four hundred pages.  However it then seems Ms Smith doesn't know how to tie all the subplots into a satisfactory conclusion. And the author has a tendency to view interracial issues through rose-coloured glasses (..not sure if this was her intention all along). Yet all of this is forgivable since 'White Teeth' does contain wonderful prose, insightful looks into the London melting pot, and memorable characters.<br />Bottom line: a very good read.  Short on realism, long on enjoyment.
0684867184|2.0|Having read and enjoyed &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; and after having heard Stephen Ambrose speak about the building of the transcontinental railroad, I really expected more than this book had to give.  I thought it was a very lame attempt and that it was hastily thrown together.  I doubt that it would have been published had it been written by anyone other than Mr. Ambrose.  This book is not a good example of his talent.
B000002J09|3.0|&quot;If you don't like Led Zeppelin's music, you have to respect them as musicians. It's the law. And if you don't, in all sincerity, the world would be a better place if you killed yourself&quot;.<br />Speechless. That review stunned me. &quot;the world would be a better place if you killed yourself&quot; just because you don't like Led Zeppelin?????? By all means click on the &quot;no&quot; button below, but ask yourself if the reviewer who wrote that is taking the right attitude.
B000059QWJ|3.0|Metropolis Pt. 2 is one of the best albums I've ever bought. I watched a bit of the Metropolis 2000 DVD, and it looked good. Not owning a DVD player, I bought the VHS and sat down for an evening's entertainment.<br />My god, this video was SO not worth ...(Canadian) I paid for it. Technically it's well-done, but the content is simply not that much more interesting than listening to the album. Video clips that serve to get the plotline across are strewn so thickly that you really don't need the rest of the concert to understand what's going on.<br />On top of this, the concert is a rather boring affair, consisting of mostly: Shot of Labrie, shot of Petrucci, shot of Portnoy, shot of Myung, shot of Labrie banging his tambourine, shot of Petrucci again... and so on. Oh yeah, and Rudess is in there too. He gets about 1/4 the screen time of everyone else, even during his godly ragtime solo in Dance of Eternity.<br />To anyone thinking of buying this video: DON'T. Get the DVD or you will regret it.
B00005ASOC|3.0|I think I expected a little more from this Gus Van Sant directed movie.  There were tons of similiarities between this and Good Will Hunting (troubled young man taken under wing by brilliant tutor) though there's a little more role reversal here (the student helps the teacher at least as much).  As if to remind you that this is a variation on the Will Hunting theme, Matt Damon even shows up in a cameo.  The movie is shot much like Good Will Hunting as well -- those sweeping shots of the teacher's bookshelves look a lot like the ones of Will's bookshelves at the beginning of the movie.<br />But I enjoyed the story if for no other reasons than the performances.  Connery was appropriately gruff but lovable, and the newcomer (whose name I forget -- probably because he hasn't done anything big since) was wonderfully subtle.  Rent this if you've already seen Good Will Hunting and looking for more on that troubled kid/helpful mentor theme.  Or if you've ever had a really arrogant arse of a professor who you wish you could've outsmarted.
0679731369|5.0|You have to have read Madame Bovary (or maybe Cliff's notes on Madame Bovary) to understand the plot. You don't have to have read &quot;Un Coeur Simple&quot; but you probably will after reading this. It's not until three-quarters of the way through that you suddenly realize there's a plot. Until then it's a series of very clever biographical essays about Flaubert. Then you understand why the narrator it obsessed with Flaubert. Then you get equally clever essays about the nature of love and grief. Wonderful insight into the poignancy of bereavement combined with sharp and erudite wit. It may be too erudite and clever for some. It demands a certain amount of francophilia and anglophilia, and understanding phrases like &quot;I might let the TLS have it.&quot; I'd always thought it was Nabokov, not Starkie who accused Flaubert of getting mixed up about the color of Emma's eyes. I think he did get get mixed up about the color of Loulou's wings in Un Coeur Simple- at least in the English translation I read.
B00000BKE1|2.0|I bought this cd in hopes that it would follow the same style I had seen in other maiden albums I own (Brave new world,Ed hunter, Piece of mind). However, the first time I listened to this one, my first thought was that maiden has gone soft. The only songs I enjoyed are &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot; and &quot;Be quick or be dead&quot;. This one seems very mellow and pales in comparison to other albums.
B000000HSU|5.0|This CD rocks! All the way from Big Takeover to Jam, this record stands out in my collection.  My favorite songs are Right Brigade, I and I Survive, Banned in D.C., I, How Low Can a Punk Get, and We will Not.  H.R.'s vocals are just incredible as well.  He can shriek like a banshee one momment, then roar like a King Lion the next.  Dr. Know also knows how to get people moving with his perfect instrument playing, on both the hardcore numbers as well as the reggae ones.  I hope more people can get a chance to listen to this awesome group and see what an influence they have had.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Most people consider Billy Wilder's best film to be SOME LIKE IT HOT, but while I love that movie, THE APARTMENT has not only been my favorite Billy Wilder film ever, but one of my favorite movies, period.  Few movies have managed to blend together so many tragic, humorous, and romantic elements so completely and so well.<br />Over the years I had managed to see THE APARTMENT five or six times.  Each time I had seen it either as a TV broadcast film or on VHS.  Therefore, I had never seen it in widescreen format.  Seeing it for the first time in its widescreen version brought the film home with greater power than ever.  What a great movie!<br />The acting in this movie is utterly beyond reproach.  In my opinion, this was Jack Lemmon's finest role.  It is impossible to imagine anyone else playing C. C. Baxter.  Cast anyone else in that role, and you have a lesser film.  Although Fred MacMurray today is primarily remembered for his role on MY THREE SONS, he was also a highly capable villain, and he was never nastier than he was here.  Shirley MacLaine was never more adorable than as Fran Kubelik.  Unbelievably, she lost the Oscar that year to Elizabeth Taylor (for BUTTERFIELD 8.  Although no one today would compare either Taylor's performance to MacLaine's in THE APARTMENT, at the time of the voting Taylor was seriously ill and appeared to be in danger of dying.  Unfortunately, from time to time Oscars are awarded less on merit of performance, but for other reasons.  For instance, in 1940, Jimmy Stewart won the Oscar for THE PHILADELPHIA STORY primarily because voters felt bad that he hadn't won the previous year for MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON.  But Stewart's winning meant that one of the greatest performances in the history of American cinema, Henry Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad in THE GRAPES OF WRATH, was not recognized with an Oscar.  (Far from being cutthroat competitors, Fonda and Stewart were best friends.)  In the spring of 1961, Elizabeth Taylor's health apparently was a greater factor than Shirley MacLaine's much stronger performance.<br />Having seen this movie several times, what strikes me is how many memorable though apparently everyday moments remain vivid over time:  Jack Lemmon using a tennis racket as a spaghetti strainer; the way that Lemmon quickly rifles through cards on his desk; the game of cards that Baxter and Kubelik play in his apartment while she recovers; the toothpicks and olives arranged in a circle in a bar; the quirks and mannerisms of each of Baxter's immediate superiors; Lemmon starting to shave only to realize that he had earlier removed and hidden the blades in his razor.<br />I don't buy many DVDs or videos, but I bought this one the second that I saw that it was available in widescreen.rently was a greater factor than Shirley MacLaine's much stronger performance.<br />Having seen this movie several times, what strikes me is how many memorable though apparently everyday moments remain vivid over time:  Jack Lemmon using a tennis racket as a spaghetti strainer; the way that Lemmon quickly rifles through cards on his desk; the game of cards that Baxter and Kubelik play in his apartment while she recovers; the toothpicks and olives arranged in a circle in a bar; the quirks and mannerisms of each of Baxter's immediate superiors; Lemmon starting to shave only to realize that he had earlier removed and hidden the blades in his razor.<br />I don't buy many DVDs or videos, but I bought this one the second that I saw that it was available in widescreen.

Years ago they would have never put an average &quot;date&quot; movie on their list of nominees. The film starts out interesting and good. It seems mysterious and it's like a disney cartoon only real life. Then you realize it's nothing special and you are dissappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, it just isn't a best picture nominee (neither is Erin Brockovich for that matter).
B000001EL3|4.0|The raw rock of the first three Kiss albums is still to my ears their strongest material, although they were cheaply recorded with little or any real production. Destroyer is slicker, more commercial and occasionally orchestrated. Bob Ezrin did for Kiss sorta what he had already done with Alice Cooper making detractors compare the two all the more. Destroyer still has some great classic Kiss material of anthemic quality. &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot;, &quot;King Of The Nightime World&quot;, and &quot;Flaming Youth&quot; (often forgotten) are my favorites.&quot;Do You Love Me&quot; somes up the 70's arena rock groupie scene.&quot; Simmons is at his most evil on &quot;God Of Thunder&quot;, unbelievably actually written by Paul Stanley, out of character for the starred one.&quot;Sweet Pain&quot; is a sleeper that groes on you with repeated listens. Peter Criss' &quot;Beth&quot; was a huge hit and similar to some of Cooper's later 70's fluff; I don't care about hits anyway. Radio never played a lot of the better Kiss material, which didn't do a lot for their image either. My main gripe with Destroyer is that it was the beginning of outside &quot;song doctors&quot; infiltrating the bands music. It doesn't seem as pure as the initial three, and I guess Kiss was never the same afterwards. Like Blue Oyster Cult and Rush, their earliest, heaviest, nastiest, raw material was better than what they put out once they became popular. Once Kiss became successful their live playing began to suffer despite the awesome theatrics. When you hear early concerts they are both tighter and hungrier sounding.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie. It ranks right up there with Crouching Tiger and Europa Europa as the best foreign films. I don't want to spoil anything for those who have not seen it, but don't be discouraged by the kind of cheesy beginning, it turns into so much more.
B00003CWL6|2.0|I have to say honestly that this movie upset my stomach.  I know that many will say that the symbolism and lighting among other production qualities were magnificent, but when you get right down to what the characters are doing--the plot, I was pretty disgusted.  The dream scenes and the reality scene were basic child molestation.  I believe this movie was nothing more than art for art's sake.  I liked the music, but found the story to be very cold and distant, definitely not a touchy-feely-feel-good kind of movie.  I find it disturbing that a film with the subject matter as this one has won top honors.
6305807086|5.0|Bested only by American Beauty as the best film of 1999. Featuring a great cast and an insane premise, Being John Malkovich is one of the most innovative films in a long time. Malkovich himself (as himself) is a marvel. He keeps impressing me with each new role he gets. The dvd is well done and includes some interesting extras.
6305308659|3.0|If you enjoy \\"serious\\" films that offer a great deal of social satire and commentary, then you'll probably like \\"Pleasantville\\" - but only if you agree with filmmaker Gary Ross's point of view. On the surface \\"Pleasantville\\" is a gentle comedy-fantasy film in which two modern teenagers (Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon) are magically transported to the world of a classic black-and-white television show from the fifties. As with \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" or \\"Father Knows Best\\", the town of Pleasantville and its' residents are basically perfect - everyone is friendly, the high-school basketball team never misses a shot, the library is full of books with no words (thus no chance to be \\"disturbed\\" by \\"liberal\\" ideas), and no one seems to know anything about sex. Naturally, these two teens from the nineties immediately begin to disrupt things. Witherspoon's character immediately dislikes the goody-goody attitude, social conformity, and sexual restrictions of the town, and she soon begins \\"converting\\" the town's teenagers to her way of living. She starts her crusade by sleeping with the star of the basketball team - whereupon he goes from black-and-white to color and starts missing his shots in basketball. She also tells her fifties-style mother (Joan Allen) about sex, which prompts her to realize how unhappy she is with her Dagwood Bumstead hubby (William H. Macy) and to start a love affair with the local soda jerk (Jeff Daniels). Maguire's character at first disagrees with his sister - he initially enjoys the \\"simpler\\" values and lifestyle in Pleasantville - but he eventually comes around to his sister's viewpoint and decides that the town needs to shed its old-fashioned values and innocence. As the people of Pleasantville begin to have sex, read books, and experience \\"real\\" emotions, they change into color. However, some of Pleasantville's residents - the older white male elite - don't like the changes and try to force everyone who has become \\"colored\\" to change back toblack-and-white. This leads to a showdown between the newly \\"colored\\" liberated folk and the black-and-white Old Guard in the town's Perry Mason-style courtroom, where Maguire's character prevails over the angry town leaders. Although this movie is beautifully filmed and the acting is good, I thought that the film's creator, Gary Ross, was far too heavy-handed with his symbolism - the film comes across as preachy, especially at the end. Ross is a liberal Democrat (I'm not just saying that, he's made other films such as \\"Dave\\" in which the heroes are always liberals and the bad guys are always conservatives). Basically, this film is an unintended parody of how sixties-style liberals see the 1950's - the people in Pleasantville are conformist, emotionally dead, and \\"unfulfilled\\". However, when these modern \\"liberated\\" teens get to Pleasantville, they teach everyone how to \\"fulfill\\" their potential, usually by having sex, breaking the rules,  and opposing the conservative white bullies who run the town (any similarities to modern politics IS intended). As a creative comedy-fantasy movie, \\"Pleasantville\\" is a \\"pleasant\\" and charming, if rather slow-moving film, but as a social satire it's too heavy-handed, preachy and superficial to be really effective.
0380973650|3.0|Perhaps this was an overly ambitious subject -- I thought the book was swamped by it.  The premise is a terrific idea, but I didn't think the plot and characters were nearly as well-developed.  The lead character was vague and uninteresting to me, and the story was very slow-paced.  I found it easy to put down.  It struck me more as an &quot;important&quot; work than a fun one.<br />Also, I didn't care for the bad language and explicit sex.  The author was probably trying for a grittier feel in this book, but for me, it was still a turn-off.<br />Neil Gaiman is one of my favorite writers, particularly for prose, but this book was a disappointment to me.
0345350499|5.0|I could not stop reading this book...finished it in three days, on very little sleep, and I was sad that it had to end. The characters become very real to you and you care what happens to them, almost as if you know them personally. As a follower of the Goddess path, with an interest in the Arthurian legends, the book touched me deeply. Everyone should read this book!
6304936362|3.0|During the real 25th mission of this aircraft, she had, on her a film crew, that made the Documentary, Memphis Belle, which is one of the most amazing movies ever made... Go see that... it is only forty-five minutes, is historically accurate, and is more intense, more exciting, and real.<br />This movie, while visually entertaining, does not do this aircraft, or the members of the 8th Airforce justice.
B00005JSGK|5.0|Hatari has a familiar plot but it is a wonderful movie. John Wayne is one of the greatest Hollywood actors of all time and his performance although predictable is funny and good. He's getting a little old for the maidens (and it shows in this movie) but nobody from Redford to Grant can kiss a woman like the Duke.<br />The outdoor scenes are gorgeous. Not much extra on the DVD, but the clarity of picture and wide screen make this a worthy purchase.
0345350499|1.0|Maybe this is meant to be a woman's book and that is why I don't like it (I am a guy).  I found it boring, overly mellow dramatic, I found the characters uninteresting, and the story dragged.  While I often like the Fantasy genre, most of it is mush and this book is an excellent example of that.
0380715430|4.0|I enjoyed the humour and lightness of this book but I have read too many books on linguistics and, especially, the English language to be really informed by Mr Bryson's book.  But having said that, the book is certainly not arduous to read. (My favourite books on language are the series Pelican Books published in the 1970s or 1980s - I remember especially 'Stylistics' by G Turner, but there were great books on phonetics, semantics, grammar, syntax etc etc - a fine indroduction to the study of language.)<br />The first half of Mr Bryson's book seemed to me to be well formed and had direction and inner logic that drove it along.  But the latter half seems to be more of a grab-bag of bits and pieces (although I did enjoy the very last chapter on word games a lot).  I was also disappointed at the emphasis on American English.  Important though it is there are many other Englishes that ought to be considered.  Unfortunately the small concessions to Australian English were often incorrect (for exasmple, Australians still call cookies 'biscuits' - although we may use the term cookie as well - we never call scones 'biscuits' as the American's do - this is certainly the mistake of an American perspective, not a British one!)
0679721037|4.0|When the A-bomb hit Hiroshima at 8:15 AM on August 6, 1945, Hatsuyo Nakamura was observing a neighbor through her kitchen window as he patiently tore down his home for the sake of the city. In a flash of light and a matter of moments, Nakamura and her three children were scattered across the home and buried in piles of rubble that had, just moments before, been their home. In the aftermath of the bombing, Nakamura, a tailor's widow, and her children were left alive, albeit destitute, and were forced to rebuild their lives from scratch like so many others across the city. Nakamura's response? The bombing had been her fate, which, according to Japanese tradition, must be accepted.   In the aftermath of the bombing, it was reported that 78,150 people had been killed, 13,983 were missing, and 37,425 had been injured. Nakamura was one of the lucky ones. She was a survivor. Or, as the Japanese people preferred to state it, Nakamura was \\"an explosion-affected person.\\" In Hiroshima, John Hersey tells Nakamura's story as well as the stories of five other individuals who were fated to experience the bombing. Hersey begins with a description of the humid August morning through the eyes of each \\"explosion affected person\\" that he interviewed and continues to follow his characters lives in the years after the explosion. The most recent version of Hiroshima includes an extra chapter, written 40 years after the event, that reveals the fates of Toshinki Sasaki, Masakazu Fujii, Wilhelm Kleinsorge, Terufumi Sasaki, Kiyoshi Tanimoto and, of course, Hatsuyo Nakamura. All six of the characters in Hiroshima lived very different lives, both before and after the bomb, yet all were bound through the horrors they experienced and their inexorable drive to live and overcome.  For some, the motivation to live was personal. Nakamura lived only to support her children. Father Kleinsorge, a German priest, was compelled to work beyond his injuries in an attempt to rescue his fellow priests and friends. For others, motivation stemmed from a desire to serve the mass population. Dr. Terufumi Sasaki was the only doctor in his hospital to survive the explosion completely unharmed. As the dust settled over Hiroshima, he quickly became aware of his good fortune and managed to provide medical care for thousands of injured victims using only the scattered array of supplies before him and a pair of glasses borrowed from an injured nurse. For days, Sasaki worked with little rest to save the lives of those who had been more unfortunate than he had. Years later his medical practice flourished but, despite his success and his contributions to humanity, he died regretting that he had been unable to do more. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, also helped hundreds as he worked tirelessly to transport wounded and bring supplies to and from Asano Park.   For most, though, the motivation to live was simply human instinct. Dr. Masakazu Fujii was injured so greatly that he was unable to attend to patients in the direct aftermath but later went on to fight for peace and raise funds for a variety of endeavors in the name of the Hiroshima victims. Toshinki Sasaki remained pinned under a pile of books for hours before being dragged out and left in a makeshift shed for days. She suffered for months from the pain of a badly mangled and broken leg that was never properly set. Later in life, she became a nun worked through her physical and emotional scars guided only by the light of faith.   The six individuals whose lives were documented in Hiroshima overcame unfavorable odds and went on to live successful, happy lives.  Hersey delicately weaves the details from the life of each character into a bittersweet account of the Hiroshima bombing. Hiroshima is unusual and wonderful because although it is a non-fiction piece, the emotion of the event is not lost in an overwhelming amalgamation of facts.  Hersey's descriptive account of the tragedy overflows with agony and pain but leaves the reader with a greater understanding of human capabilities and the knowledge that the drive to survive cannot be bounded by language or by nationality.
B0000042MY|5.0|I loved the movie &quot;Last Of The Mohicans,&quot; and a huge reason was the soundtrack.  Most movie soundtracks come and go without a second thought, but this one is different.  Much different!  The music is so touching, it seems to capture the mind, body, and soul of the listener instantly.  I don't think that I've ever enjoyed a movie soundtrack as much as I enjoy this one.  My favorite compositions are the &quot;Main Title&quot; and &quot;The Kiss.&quot; These musical entries are truly outstanding!  This is particularly true of &quot;The Kiss,&quot; which has to rank as one of the best pieces of work ever done!  It is an extremely powerful and beautiful musical expression of passion.  Enrich your spirit by adding this musical gem to your collection today.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This was the first Kevin Smith movie I ever saw, and instantly, I was hooked.  From beginning to end, this is the funniest movie since Joel Coen's &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot;.  &quot;Clerks&quot; is a departure from the mainstream Hollywood hoo-ha, not sporting any big-name actors, high production values, and superficial characters.  Heck, this movie cost about $27,000 to make and was filmed in the same Quik Stop that Smith was working in at the time, taking advantage of meal breaks and off-hours to film the movie.  The film was edited in the nextdoor video store where the character Randal was employed in the movie.  So don't expect breathtaking cinematography, flashy special effects, or revolutionary surround-sound technology.  The &quot;plot&quot;, so to say, is a day in the life of a convenience store clerk, Dante, who has been called in to work on his day off.  It portrays how dealing with picky and sometimes downright rude customers can drive even the simplest person to the brink of insanity.  If you work as a cashier at a convenience or grocery store, like me, this film lets you know that you're not alone.  The antics the customers pull off are hilarious, ranging from the man trying to find the &quot;perfect dozen of eggs&quot; by emptying all the egg cartons, the elderly man who takes an adult magazine into the bathroom, only to die while looking at it, and of course, Jay and Silent Bob, who tape comic book-style voice bubbles containing pleas for homosexual sex favors to the entrance door so that when Randal opens the door, it appears he's actually saying it.  Jay (played by Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (played by Kevin Smith himself) have appeared in all of Smith's films, proving to be possibly the funniest on-screen duo ever.  While this film is non-stop, rolling on the floor, teary-eyed comedy, it also has a very strong yet often overlooked moral that I got from it: Make the most out of every day, and if your life is in a rut, don't let it stay that way.Now I'm not going to say that was the point Smith was trying to get across, because I have no place to dictate his artistic vision.  It's just what I got from the film.  The humor in this movie is all pretty much what you would call high school locker room humor, but the way in which it is presented (the black and white film makes it seem much more human), makes it impossible not to laugh.  So, all in all, &quot;Clerks&quot; is an extremely funny movie that proves as a nice abandon from the recent string of superficial pre-pubescent bubble-gum flicks and over-the-top &quot;Die Hard&quot; clones.  Also see Smith's other gem, &quot;Dogma&quot;.
0966638328|2.0|The work by the now defunct arm of Cheskin research, the Color Research Insititute is much more insightful than anything in this book. Unofrtunatley the scientific research undertaken by this insititute is not available to the General Public and is only available through Cheskin.<br />The color schemes and patterns shown in this book may have been all the rage a few years ago but they definitly do not age very well and are way too bright and gaudy.<br />The author unfortunatley does not give examples of color schemes that work well and have stood the test of time such as Coca Colas color scheme and IBM's &quot;Big Blue&quot; which is a type of blue which has a very powerful effect on the subconscous mind of the viewer and this color alone was shown to actually increase the sales of IBM products once it was widely implemented in their adevertising campaign.<br />This book comes across as a marketing tool for the author pitched at large corporate clients, its deliberate attempt not to give any worthwhile information to readers of this book seems to validate this.<br />Giving this book 2 stars is being generous considering the price. If you know absolutley nothing at all about color then perhaps you will find this book helpful. If you are an interior decorater dont use any of the color scemes this book recommends unless you wish to send your clients to a mental asylum. If you are a markeing manager dont waste your money on this book
B00004U2HK|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies because it is so optimistic. Every lyric reflects this. Rogers and Hammerstien were truly inspired when they wrote the words and music for it. This was the last musical they wrote together before Hammerstien's death in 1960. Just watch and you'll agree that he saved the best for last. Enjoy!

B000009EAD|5.0|There's only one thing you need to know about this album.  It is the best album ever.  When I first heard this album, a couple of years ago, my favorite album of the time was Queensryche's &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot;, and I thought nothing could ever top that.  Well, I guess I was wrong.  This is amazing.  You've got heavy songs to bang your head to, ballads to chill out to, and even an instrumental.  It's a cornucopia of goodness!  Jon Schaffer is the master of rhythm guitar, and Larry's solos are awesome.  Okay, so he's not as good as Randall Shawver, but remember, Larry was only 18 when they made this album.  That alone is quite impressive.  I myself am an 18 year old guitarist, and I know I could never keep up with Jon.  Now, onto the songs: &quot;Watching Over Me&quot; is probably the greatest ballad ever, and it could have been a big hit, if people weren't obsessed with songs about &quot;nookie&quot;.  You gotta love it, I can almost play the whole thing.  &quot;Consequences&quot; kinda sounds like something a hippie would sing at a protest, but I like hippies, so it's okay.  This is another fun one to play.  &quot;Disciples of the Lie&quot; is THE most brutal song ever written, no joke.  Yes, I've heard all the death/grind bands, and this is still the heaviest song ever.  &quot;Blessed Are You&quot; is a song written just for us, the fans.  How many bands do you know of that write songs specifically for their fans?  Not many.  Then, there's the Something Wicked Trilogy.  Nothing in heaven or earth can ever match the brilliance of these songs.  Just check out &quot;The Coming Curse&quot;.  Can you say &quot;best song ever&quot;?  It starts out with a cool piano intro (I have to get my sister to learn it), ends with eerie choir singing, and in between is nine minutes of kick-@$$ heavy guitar.  There just aren't words to describe it.  If you love heavy metal, you must buy this album.  It is one of the greatest things mankind has given us.  Also, buy albums from Iron Maiden, Blind Guardian, Dream Theater, and Queensryche.  Like Iced Earth, none of these bands have put out anything less than perfect.  Jon, Matt, dudes, you've gotta come here and do a show.  I'll let you borrow my car!
B00003CX9E|5.0|&quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is often called the best film ever released, and today's audiences may find little in it to justify the legend that surrounds it.  That is not surprising given the generations that have grown up with &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Godfather&quot; - certain contenders for the top spot.  To be sure, many films since &quot;Kane&quot; have made use of its novel editing and camera angles, and yes, many more flicks have aspired to its phenomenal staging and screenplay nuances.  But never before or since its release has any film captured the ESSENCE of filmmaking as &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; did, does and continues to do even 70 years after its release.<br />From its opening frame, to its flashbacks and Xanadu sequences, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; created unforgettable images that remain with the film viewer for decades, if the viewer opens themselves up to Orson Welles' majestic point of view.  The tales of lost innocence, coupled with the lust for raw power and the tremendous symbolism of its sets, lightling, cinematography and editing are forever imbedded in cinema's short history.  I cannot say that another film won't one day capture all of these elements in such sure-fire ways.  But, as a film lover, I cfan say not a single film since its release has truly come close.<br />Is &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; the best film of all time?  Forget the critics, forget the hype and judge it for yourself.  If you remain open to what it has to say and bring with yuo a childlike innocence rather than a tired point of view, you will agree that &quot;Kane&quot; redefined cinema in its day, and continues to surprise today.  A brilliant film, an epic on the order of &quot;Ben Hur&quot; with the intimacy of &quot;All About Eve&quot; and the passion of &quot;Godfather,&quot; &quot;Kane&quot; will live forever!
B00000JCOV|4.0|This is cool stuff!  Okay, so it's nothing special, you can't really compare it to Slayer or Cannibal Corpse, but it's way ahead of Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, or any of that stuff.  There are no solos, and not many riffs, but what there is is really fast, psychotic music with really wicked vocals.  Corey Taylor is by far the most talented vocalist in nu-metal, and maybe one of the best ever.  Check out that song &quot;Spit it Out&quot;, that song rules!  That has got to be the greatest rapmetal song ever (except for maybe Anthrax's cover of &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;), Corey goes effortlessly from singing to screaming to rapping, and it all just fits together.  Wow.  &quot;Sic&quot; and &quot;Eyeless&quot; are nothing to shake a stick at either.  This is not thrash metal, or death metal, or even hardcore, but it's certainly not awful.  They've got a new album coming out, I can't wait to hear it.  I think they need to ditch the masks and get some better guitarists, but other than that, this ain't too bad.
B00003CXD0|4.0|Dustin Delivers a performance of a lifetime in this half-drama, half-farce that deserves its place in Cinmea's pantheon of Best Films of all Time.  There have been better cross dressers on film (in &quot;Some Like it Hot&quot; and &quot;Garp&quot; and &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;) but rarely has the viewer been broguht into the farce surrounding the comedy as they are here.  Jessica Lange is bland, I think, in an Oscar winning performance that was justified only by her Best Actress nomination the same year for the superb &quot;Frances.&quot;  And Terri Garr is....well, Terri Garr...that is, hysterionic and laughable, yet never fully developed as a character.  Only Hoffman, doing what he does best - ACT - achieves greatness here....and the script that it.  It's a wonderful tour-de-force that also teaches us something about life in general.  Some of the sequences are phenomenally funny, while others fall flat, but Hoffman shines in every single frame.
B000002TPS|5.0|Don't get me wrong, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; is a masterpiece, and the new album is nothing to sneeze at either, but I believe that this album here is the utmost.  This is Megadeth at their best, and one of my favorite albums ever.  Dave is really multitalented.  He can play the guitar like nobody's business, apparently he speaks French, and I think he knows karate too.  He may not be the best singer on the planet, but he's Frank Sinatra compared to most of the nu-metal vocalists out there.  How can you not love songs like &quot;Reckoning Day&quot;, &quot;Addicted to Chaos&quot;, &quot;A Tout Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Victory&quot;...well, the whole thing, really!  This album is nearly perfect.  Just listen to that solo in &quot;Victory&quot;.  He must have broke the sound barrier when they recorded that!  I got this album way back in '94, and it still hasn't left my player.  Even Het. and Co. can't match this.  If you like heavy metal, you need this album.  Buy, I tell you, buy!
0060392886|4.0|These guys are shackled to each other, for better or for worse. Opportunities in life don't come by the dozen, they certainly caught the train when it came calling, and then spent a large part of their career fighting against their fate: its one for all and all for one; or not at all (sic). Have toured with a punkband many years ago myself, I know the exhilaration, the booze, the dope, the [girls], you name it. Motley Crue certainly do all that to excess enabled by apparently limitless supply of dollars that comes with success in the US. But there are bigger forces than they themselves at work; ruthless record companies, crooked managers, the fans . The book evokes all this very well. As one reads on, a sense of melancholy creeps in culminating in the horrifying and truly sensitive account of Vince's 4 year old daugther Skylar's death. What is it all worth then? As Vince says:\\"It's against the laws of the universe man\\" Particularly that episode give the book unexpected depth. But there are plenty of laughs too, self depreciating humour (rare for rockstars), hilarious bitching, and an endless stream of big titted parasitic Daisy Dukes. Go read it.
0807281956|4.0|I'm very much a fantasy reader. I love magic tales, fairies and  through the looking glass types of stories. This story hinges on  how many children feel like misfits in their homes and schools. The escapism of a totally magic world where none of our physics applies and amazing things are ordinary is just so nice and for a scientist it is relaxing, because the pressure to be always  right/ correct isn't there. Spells and curses, mythical creatures and the blackest of evil make this just so much of a fun read!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Don't buy into the hype of hating this movie, it truly delivers on everything that made the original trilogy so great.  The story on the surface dumbfounded some, and completely enlightened the true Star Wars fan, the ones that realized what the &quot;real&quot; story is: Palpatine's rise to Supreme Chancellor.  And finally we get this amazing film on the far superior format of DVD.  I would have been happy with just the feature, but check out those extras!  The Force is strong...
B00003CXN3|4.0|Obviously this is first and foremost an entertainment.  We don't want to be confused about that.  But director Steven Soderbergh does have a didactic point, and it's one I agree with.  The &quot;war&quot; on drugs will never be won with guns or law enforcement.  We can see this in the extraordinary sequence in which Michael Douglas, playing the newly appointed drug czar of the United States, steps away from his job and returns to his family.  He stops his speech and simply asks how can we fight a war in which the enemies are members of our own family?<br />Better yet, he might have asked, how can we fight a war when the enemy is ourself?<br />Soderbergh carefully avoids the appearance of taking sides, but the ending makes it clear that the &quot;war&quot; will go on; indeed the war has become institutionalized, a way of life for us and those involved in it.  In some sense the war on drugs has become an entertainment for couch potatoes napping in front of the TV, as well as a patriotic rallying point for others.<br />I thought Michael Douglas gave one of his finest performances, and Benicio Del Toro as the Tijuana cop torn between what he believes is right and the reality of his situation, was excellent.  The hauntingly beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones was chillingly effective as a woman without morality, a sociopath with the survival instincts of a hyena.  Dennis Quaid, hardly recognizable without the grin, was competent as a sleazy lawyer who gambled big time and lost.  Don Cheadle as the &quot;solider&quot; in the war who loves the battle, the &quot;war lover,&quot; so to speak, was intriguing.  Erika Christensen deserves special praise for her compellingly true portrayal of an insecure teen who finds escape in the little death of heroin.<br />But I wonder if the average person seeing this movie realizes what the message is, that the war on drugs is a fraud.  Like the war in Vietnam it is a war that is, without changing the very nature of our society, unwinnable.  It is a bureaucratic monstrosity that we have created because we need an evil we can hate.<br />There is no &quot;solution&quot; to the &quot;drug problem&quot; because there is no solution to human nature.  A better approach to keeping the problem at a manageable level would be decriminalization and a massive program of education.  Why doesn't this happen?  First, because the entrenched bureaucracy that has a vested interest in maintaining its position.  Second, because the old &quot;moral majority&quot; in this country, people who imagine that they know the truth, and have the right to regulate the morality of others, will not allow it to end.  They need a target for their hate.  Note well that Douglas came home and renewed his efforts as a father because he realized that that is where he failed, as a father, and that is where we as a nation are failing.  Education begins at home.  If you don't know what kind of drugs your children are doing, then, as a parent,  you don't know anything.<br />Soderbergh tells this tragic story in a somewhat simplistic, but ultimately, very effective way.  The use of tinted filters to lend atmosphere and perhaps to help orient the viewer did not bother me, but I agree with those who found them unnecessary and not particularly effective.  On the other hand I thought the use of hand held cameras lend an intensity and immediacy to the action.  Note that one of Soderbergh's techniques is to show just a partial view of the action, such as just the guns and the hands and arms of the killers as Dennis Quiad puts down the phone.  We know what is going to happen from seeing only that much, and so does Quiad.  In fact, this is the way we sometimes view the world, the salient objects in our view register and we act.  Soderbergh's technique of showing the &quot;war&quot; at various levels and in differing environments and from differing points of view was obvious but nonetheless very effective.<br />But Soderbergh did not go far enough.  Insteadof showing the vulnerability of a judge with a junkie for a daughter, he might have had the local police catch her trafficking out of her house and had them unconstitutionally seize his property.  Maybe then the message would get home to the American people that the war on drugs has the potential to become a threat to our democracy and our republican form of government.of showing the vulnerability of a judge with a junkie for a daughter, he might have had the local police catch her trafficking out of her house and had them unconstitutionally seize his property.

0060392886|5.0|Read this book, and understand why Tommy Lee is no longer a part of the band. The book takes you from the earliest days of the Crue, and gives valuable insight into the personal lives of all four original members. All four have amazing life stories to offer, and we see the people behind the rock stars. But once they hit superstardom, the book is simply impossible to put down, as the reader learns a new definition of the word &quot;decadence&quot;. The Crue has done it all, including a lot of hot female porn stars, the sexiest celebreties, and the hottest Playmates. Read about the indescribable &quot;gross out&quot; contest with madman Ozzy Osborne. Read about Nikki flat lining twice, and his escapades with Prince protegee Vanity. Read about Tommy's &quot;dream life&quot; with Playmate Pam Anderson, and the hell he had to endure while incarcerated for beating her. Read about the concerts, the parties, the orgies, the incredible women, and one of the most notorious, obnoxious, and greatest rock&amp;roll bands of all time...Highly recommended.
0380973650|4.0|I have been a Neil Gaiman fan back to his days doing graphic novels.  Unfortunately, I have found that his prose, while excellent when paired with vivid art, often don't stand up on their own.  American Gods demonstates that he is matureing as an author and growing beyond the need for multi-media.<br />Many reviewers have given far too much of this book away.  That is unfortunate and I will not repeat their mistakes.  The book is intersting and fun.  The philisophical conflicts that it embraces harken back to some of Gaiman's best work in Sandman.  The subject matter is engrossing and his strong central character is one that the reader wants to follow.  While I do not think the writing is great, it is good enough to be entertaining and carry a very imaginative story.<br />Gaiman has a gift for vivid imagry and a seemingly endless collection of interesting factoids that continue to peek the readers interst.  This work represents a leap forward for a matureing author.  As such, it a worthwhile read.
0156421178|3.0|Whatever you think of Orwell and his two most famous works, 1984 and Animal Farm can be set aside when reading &quot;Homage to Catalonia&quot;.  The book's most valuable asset is that it lends credibility to Orwell's rather strong political views that are so eloquently expressed in his other works.  It is one thing to rail against Communism or Totalitarianism, it's another thing entirely to pick up a gun and do something about it at great risk to life and limb.  The book in and of itself is not a great book.  It is a description of a rather banal civil war that at times is pathetic, comical, and as with any war, ultimately sad when taken at face value.  That it is a non-fiction account of the author's participation at Catalonia sets it aside from Orwell's other work.  It has made a few top 100 lists, however, I struggled to find a justification for such a lofty ranking.  If you are a fan of Orwell, Huxley, etc or are a fan of European history then this book will appeal.  Absent such a range of interests, the (potential) reader is probably better off searching elsewhere for an engrossing novel.  Ultimately, I enjoyed this book to the extent that it allows for a much deeper perspective on Orwell and his philosphies.
0790740249|5.0|Amidst all the suspense, shocks, and chills of this superbly made thriller stands the awesome performances of Sigourney Weaver and Holly Hunter.  Ever since she pioneered the &quot;female buttkicker&quot; in the Alien movies, Sigourney has stretched her range to show the immense amount of talent she possesses.  Her role as agoraphobic Helen Hudson is one of her finest; she lets us feel every nuance of her frustration, her terror, her anger, her intense ability to be strong even when she admits she's weak.  Matching her performance is the understated portrayal of cop M. J. Monahan by Oscar-winner Holly Hunter.  Hunter's bravura etching of this likeable cop is extremely effective in counterbalancing the tormented Weaver. Although the fate of Dermot Mulroney as Monahan's partner is questionably appropriate, it does serve as a motivating factor in Hunter's pursuit of the serial killer.  William McNamara's performance as Peter Foley may seem underplayed, but it serves to heighten the normal-ness of this obviously demented young man.  Like life, the good guys don't always come out unscathed.  The film is dark, brooding and its ending is chilling in that Harry Connick Jr.'s imprisoned psycho is obviously going to continue his quest for revenge on Weaver.  A sequel would have been nice; I would have also liked to have had at least one scene with Weaver and Hunter after the explosive ending.  But, as far as thrillers go, this is a great addition to a small set of classics.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Ok, here's the deal: &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is one of the most innovative films to come a long in a long time. As for the soundtrack, it matches and at times exceeds the film in its genius and daring, even though it does miss some songs from the film. Sure, there are some misfires (Bono's &quot;Children of the Revolution&quot; is flatter than the soda I drank in the theater during &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;), but there are songs like &quot;Elephant Love Medly&quot; which will blow your mind more than any absenthine hallucination. Another track to check out: &quot;Hindi Sad Diamonds&quot;, one of the best songs I've heard in a long time, it combines Indian rythms over Nicole Kidman's satin voice.
B00004R99U|4.0|After the first film was left a little unfinished although moving me to tears I was desperate to know the future of pocahontas and whether or not it would be true to history. Now i know that all turns out well for my favourite disney heroine. At first I thought the conflict between the two Johns (smith and Rolfe) may ruin not only this film but any enjoyment of the original feature. Imagine then how delighted I was to find that John Smith was replaced with feeling compassion and with a character so easy to like in his short comings. Side characters such as meeko and the loveable tea lady mrs Jenkins added the comical relief and the good people at disney kept Pocahontas true to her disney roots even though the film was a little sugar coated to be historically accurate. The best disney sequel I've ever seen!! ***

I love the style it's written in,a dairy format always gives a novel a personal feel. If you're looking for a fun, straight-up read, this book satisfies without being deeply profound.

B000001GY9|4.0|Schumann, in my opinion was not one of great orchestrators in music. Yes, his piano music is of the highest quality, but his orchestral works are simply above average. As many composers of the early romantic period, Schumann was greatly overshadowed by his predecessor Beethoven, and it seems as though in his orchestral works Schumann is trying to transcend Beethoven's unequaled ability to write orchestral pieces. Schumann obviously falls short, as did most composers who tried stepping out of Beethoven's long shadow and outdoing the master. Still, Schumann's symphonies are rather enjoyable and of good quality. This recording is a good set of Schumann's complete symphonies, played by the Vienna Philharmonic under the baton of Leonard Bernstein. Bernstein, as usual, wrings out every little bit of emotion from these works that he possibly can. Unfortunately, to do so, he treats these early romantic symphonies as if they were from the late romantic period. This results in some very fast or slow tempos and some parts where the playing is very heavy. Still, though not authentic, the performances are still very good ones, and at a budget price(17 dollars for two CD's is good) this album shouldn't be passed up. In reality, it is only this lack of an authentic, early romantic style performance, that prevents me from giving this set five stars. The sound is excellent, completely digital and exceptionally clear for a live performance. Sure, Schumann isn't the greatest orchestrator, but you'd never know that when listening to this album.
B00004SU5J|4.0|This fine album is often looked to as the harbinger of musical styles \\"for the new millenium,\\" and as marking a shift in the creative epicenter of path-breaking jazz from the US to Europe.  (A long-time fan and admirer of Manfred Eicher's pristine and challenging Scandinavian-based ECM [Editions of Contemporary Music], I have seen Europe as a creative center for innovation for a few decades.  Check out any album led by bassist Dave Holland, for example!) Having read a recent New York Times essay describing Tourist as perhaps a watershed in jazz history, , I was eager to set Saint Germain loose on my musical compass.<br />This music is inventive and complex, and captivating to hear -- accounting for its tremendous popularity in Europe and growing following in the US.  As a listener who almost always finds musical interest primarily in harmony more than rhythm, I rarely respond very well to music with few chord changes; the chord changes are what most easily touhces my heart.  Yet Saint Germain's pieces work within one (or very few) chord(s) & central tone/pitch, and are nonetheless compelling for me in the extraordinary range of riffs and improvisation they can find in even a single chord.  As the other reviews here accurately reflect, Saint Germain's \\"action\\" is in its rhythms and instrumental texture.  Electronically-generated \\"synth\\" sounds and repeating rhythm loops are interwoven seamlessly with acoustic and more familiar electric instruments, both melodic and percussive.  These elements combine in each tight and tasty piece to present a distinctive texture and sensibility, and instrumentation often changes dramatically, but with no rhythmic demarcation, as the piece proceeds.  The non-synth elements are prominent enough to clearly distinguish this fine music gfrom techno-jazz or techno pop (which can be as icy and alienating as the Brave-New World/Blade Runner techno-trailer -- complete with its thousands of 2-dimensional humanoid patrons -- currently now running at all United Artists cinemas).<br />I am surprised I like this album quite so much.  I dearly hope the new millenium will not focus overwhelmingly on rhythm rather than harmony (and its progeny, melody).  But if that is the direction of the future, I'll take my trip on albums like Tourist.  Clearly recommended -- both for its intrinsic beauty, and as a marker in the evolution of jazz.ng at all United Artists cinemas).  <br />I am surprised I like this album quite so much.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem For A Dream is one of those rare films that leaves the viewer totally drained.  This story of addiction and broken dreams pummels you with imagery that only director Darren Aranofsky can pull off.  Many of the camera effects he honed in his movie PI, are perfected in &quot;Requiem&quot;.  The cast, down to the smallest part, is flawless.  Ellen Burstyn's methodical descendance into dependence is one of the all-time greatest performances by any actress.  How the Oscars passed her over is beyond me.  Wayans even turns in a dramatic performance of unexpected caliber.  Jennifer Connely's rich-girl romantic turned  junkie/prostitute should serve as a wake-up call to any recreational drug user.  Jared Leto is convincing as the waste-product son with a good heart.  The hallucination scenes are half Andy Warhol/half Marat Sade.  Rarely does a film disturb/amaze everyone who sees it...but this one does. I understand Aranofsky is going to direct the next Batman movie.  Hopefully he can rescue the franchise from hacks like Schumacher.  In the meantime, &quot;Requiem&quot; should be required viewing for every aspiring director.  You must see this film!

B000002AGM|4.0|A case can be made that Miles Davis is history's most significant jazz artist.  He wasn't a technical genius on his instrument or a fiery virtuoso, but the unaffected sound of his trumpet is unmistakeable.  The term &quot;cool&quot; wasn't invented for him, but it should have been, and indeed his &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; sessions represented the first of many occasions during his career when he was directing traffic as jazz reached a crossroads.  Sometimes his contemporaries must have felt like they were being dragged along, but ultimately, most of them came.<br />Four stars for this CD may seem sacreligious to Miles fanatics, which are legion.  Understand, however, that this review is being written by one of you.  To judge this CD against music made by mere mortals would require a five-star superlative, but by those criteria rating the entire Davis discography would wear out the asterisk on one's keyboard.  To put it simply, an average Miles Davis CD is like an average Rembrandt painting: by any other standard an awesome achievement.<br />In comparing this Davis CD against others, a case can be made that it deserves to be placed slightly below Davis's other masterworks.  Indeed, it is only the third best Davis/Evans collaboration, behind &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot; and &quot;Porgy and Bess&quot;, and one could also debate its stature against &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, which is nearly as beautiful, but unquestionably more significant.<br />For those who typically enjoy Davis's work but don't have this CD yet, you will most likely greatly enjoy this recently remastered album.  It sounds wonderful; Davis's warm flugelhorn is in a perfect setting with Evans conducting brass and reed instruments behind him.  (Yes, there is an inherent inconsistency in describing Davis's sound as &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; simultaneously, but when you hear this you'll understand.)<br />Then again, if you want to hear the best of Miles Davis in five CDs or less, there are other Davis offerings, like the three mentioned above, that are even more astounding than this one, hence the missing star on this rating.

But no reasonable student of history or statecraft can dispute that this is a master work by a man of great genius.  The scope of his knowledge of history is rivaled only by his keen analysis and insightful opinions about foreign policy.  This book is a must read, not only for students of diplomacy, but for anyone interested in the last 400 years of Western history.  Do not be put off by the scope of this volume. The book is clearly and engagingly written.  Five stars are not enough.

If u are a fan of tool already, this is a great new cd by tool, if u want to get into tool, buy undertow or aenima.

0375703764|3.0|This is a fun thriller. It's not particularly original, and it doesn't experiment. The only real envelope it pushes is that of how explicitly derivitive a book can be of other works of literature. Is this a justified part of the pomo/metafiction gimmick/theme? Perhaps. But regurgitating previously used ideas (in abundance) as main themes allows Danielewski to look much more clever and creative than he actually is. Want spatial paradoxes? Houses with impossible rooms? Obscure old scholars who appear only as secondary sources and in bizarre, extensive footnotes? Read The Third Policeman, by Flann O'Brien. All those elements are there, in one book, written around 1940. Then of course there's the content borrowings from Borges (the ruminations on labyrinths and the minotaur, the character of Pierre Menard) and Lovecraft (the book that drives you nutty), and style borrowings from many others, as mentioned in a few previous reviews.<br />To those who are impressed by the innovative ideas and style of this book, really, I suggest you look into the literature that it's being compared to. There's a lot of great stuff out there, done better. And you'll be a little surprised at how faithfully a lot of it is reproduced in &quot;House of Leaves.&quot;<br />All that said, though, the book's not bad for a light thriller.
B000001F3C|4.0|Live releases notwithstanding, this is U2's most impassioned recording of their career.  Made when they were still just a group of kids from a country torn apart by civil war, this album is full of strong drum beats, haunting lyrics (like on the track &quot;Drowning Man&quot;) and it even features the Edge singing lead vocals on &quot;Seconds&quot;.  The album's most recognised track is, without a doubt, &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday,&quot; which is a plea for peace between the North and the Republic of Ireland.  One of the bootleg tracks for &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; begins with Bono introducing the song. He says &quot;This is a song we sing in the hopes we'll never have to sing again.  This is a song about our country.  This is Sunday Bloody Sunday.&quot;  The track that I would have to recommend the most, however, is &quot;Like a Song&quot;.  It's another cry against war, this time maybe not restricted to Ireland, but certainly including it, all around the world.  The lyrics are amazing but it is Bono's voice and the full backing of the band which bring the song to its full potential.  I highly recommend this album for anyone just getting into U2's music, or for people like myself who have been enjoying them for a long time, and continue to.
6304595247|5.0|I am so surprised to see that some people found this version to be inaccurate.  I have a feeling they are only comparing this to older movie versions and not to the book.  This is the most accurate version ever made!  All actors/actresses were fantastic.  Sinead O'Connor, donning a wig, looks eeringly like the few and rare drawings of Emily Bronte, and cleverly introduces and finishes the story for us, in the author's eyes.  The music will stay with you for days-very haunting and beautiful.  The ending was very clever and makes you teary-eyed.  One minute you hate Heathcliffe, his brutish nature and brooding, and the next you feel his pain deeply.  The whole movie, scenery, cast, music and dialogue was well put together and certainly worth owning and seeing over and over again.  Enjoy!
B000001FTQ|5.0|Wide Awake in America is an amazing follow up to a good album. The live versions of Bad and A Sort of Homecoming (esp. A Sort of Homecoming) outshine the album versions by far.  I've always been partial to live recordings, especially U2's, because of the clear emotion that shines though when Bono is singing on stage.  It's  a kind of raw edge adrenyline that you don't get in the studio, and it is exhibited fully on the first two tracks of this album. Along with these steller songs, there are two B-Sides which didn't make the Unforgettable Fire cut, Love Comes Tumbling and Three Sunrises.  They're both good songs which couldn't hold on their own, but they compliment the two stronger, live recording tracks on Wide Awake in America very nicely.
B00005KFUN|5.0|I never believed I'll think so myself, but it's true. Radiohead's Amnesiac was a good album, but not good enough- As opposed to The Bends, OK Computer &amp; Kid A- All of which had a direction, even if a sparse one (Kid A's directionlessness was the direction for me), Amnesiac didn't have one. On Amnesiac Radiohead tried to keep up the eerie moodiness of Kid A whilst offering a tad more &quot;friendly&quot; tunes alongside- You don't have to be a musicexpert to realise that this is just missionimpossible. &amp; I like Amnesiac. A LOT. But Muse's sophomore album, Origin Of Symmetry, appears to be having the cohesion that Amnesiac lacked so deplorably. &amp; this is one cohesion! OOS is hitherto the best album of 2001. Period. The abrasive guitars that, notwithstanding their thrash, leave room for the pungent melodies; The vocals, or shall I say the persuasive tortured howls; &amp; the lyrics- Teenageangsty as they are, they don't fall short to hackneyed cliches- @ least not customarily. Instead of that they appear candid &amp; heartfelt, something I can't really say of America's ragerock/metal bands which desecrate all the rock charts nowadays. Muse heralds the return of different, REAL rock bands- The profound &amp; sensual ones the world appears to be beseeching for in recent times. Many compared this album to Queen for its incontrovertible pretension &amp; melodrama, but try to think of Queen meets Radiohead of The Bends/OK Computer epoch in attempt to get the full picture. Whereas on their debut Showbiz Muse wore their Radiohead influence on their sleeves, on this effort they upgrade it, making this (Once again, hitherto) 2001's best album. I would list my favourite songs but that's what the tracklist's for... (Hint hint)
B000002BYD|5.0|This album is an excellent piece of artwork that displays Pearl Jam's musical versatility, as it has rockers like Brain Of J, MFC, Do The Evolution, etc; and ballads like All Those Yesterdays and Faithful.

By the way, to [those] who accused Pearl Jam of trying to sound like Creed, Pearl Jam's first album was released in 1991. Before that, the members had already firmly established their sound in other bands. Creed's first album came out in 1995. Creed is trying (failing) to sound like Pearl Jam, not the other way around. Thank You.
6305126062|2.0|This long, overblown drama is a dreary experience with the only redeeming quality being the beautiful scenery and cinematography. When a young girl and her horse are hit by a truck, her mother enlists a &quot;horse whisperer&quot; who can bring her daughter's horse back to health and he ends up healing the whole dysfunctional family. Why it takes almost 3 hours to tell this story is beyond me but by the end, about the only character I had any feeling for was the horse. Robert Redford is his usual cardboard self and Kirsten Scott Thomas is a distant unattached actress who brings little here. The excellent Diane Wiest is totally wasted and seems out of place in the whole mess. Be warned, this is a &quot;Lifetime&quot; movie in disguise!
0767817486|4.0|This movie is as close as you can get, without actually being in a Turkish prison.  Having lived and worked in Turkey for 6 years, My job has forced me to go to various Turkish prisons to retreive American citizens.  The movies depictions of the living conditions in the prison are nearly 100% accurate.
0345440757|5.0|This was by far the best baby gift I bought for my new daughter.   She was eating every hour, spitting up after every feeding (LOTS!!!) and wouldn't seem to sleep unless I was holding her or the blow dryer was running!!!  We tried everything and even went as far as having an Upper GI performed since she wasn't gaining much weight and was so fussy.  I bought this book one week after the UGI was normal and kicked myself for not purchasing it earlier!!  Since following Ms. Hogg's E.A.S.Y. plan our household has been so much more enjoyable.  I have learned to LISTEN and UNDERSTAND my daughter which has made her happier and the rest of our family.  I treat her like I would like to be treated and see things from her perspective and we are now all living, breathing and sleeping in a happy household.  Thank you Tracy Hogg for helping me understand and connect with my daughter!!!!

B00000ILBK|2.0|I have allways loved Star Trek ,but this one I am sure can't be a real Star Trek movie it must be a fake made by satan to torture us trekies . Or Maybe the &quot;Q&quot; had something to do with this movie,Because it's bad ,simply put.   If you doubt my review than rent it or just watch it.. one of 20 times a day its on cable . However one redeaming quality of this movie is that Star Trek X has got a good shot at being a better  movie than the previous film. One way to improve on the movie would be to have Mystery Science Thearter 3000 Have go at it.

B000002J2F|5.0|People like me need to have albums like these. My current state is one of lonliness, depression, and confusion. It helps to know other people feel the same way. Furthermore, they took time out to create brilliant works describing their feelings. Phil Collins voice seems the most sincere on Duke. I get the feeling Genesis is trying hard to convey the human experience the best they can, and I believe they get the job done on this album. Anyone feeling lost in the world, or just needing \\"a shoulder to lean on\\"; Genesis is truely comforting, Duke in particular. This feeling of finding comfort through other mediums besides directly interacting with people is expressed beautifully in the song \\"Turn it on\\". With all of todays technology: tv's, interenet, and the slightly ancient radio; Genesis geniusly hits home with the idea of lonely people turning on the tv to get human interaction, and the longing to get to know the tv star or the voice on the radio. Duke captures the human spirit in all it's honesty and wonder. It makes life just a little more plesant, and that's what music is all about.
B000002IGV|5.0|Certainly not the greatest musicians but certainly great entertainers. This is eighties flash, great fun and tongue in cheek. This CD broke Twisted Sister into the big time although the UK was on board from the first release and a series of killer shows at the Marquee. Still possessing a lot of the punk attitude on previous releases only this time given a little more spit and polish by big time producer Tom Werman. Certainly some of the attitude has been replaced with a more cartoon aspect. The songs are basically sing a long party anthems....You would have had to be an ostrich with your head in the sand if you don't remember the hits 'We're Not Gonna Take It' and 'I Wanna Rock' both of which got played to death by MTV and the like. Both had suitably comic videos based around high school life and teenage rebellion. Anyway this set of songs are familiar as an old friend each time I give them a play. Oh and remember..PLAY IT LOUD MUTHA!
B000002MUN|4.0|Worth owning, for the incomparable &quot;It's Good To Be King&quot; which, with the much older &quot;Free-falling&quot; stands out as Petty's signature masterpiece of American male guilt and regret.  Both share a lyrical self-delusion, and both have transcendently pretty tunes.  &quot;It's Good to be King&quot; is jaded, hypnotic, tired and heartsore, and it ends with a remarkable 16-bar orchestration by Michael Kamen that absolutely leaps out at you. The first time I heard it, it reminded me of another lovely orchestration, that of &quot;Diamond Dust&quot; on Jeff Beck's &quot;Blow by Blow&quot;--, with much the same tone of edgy remorse.  <br />The rest of this CD is pleasant but unremarkable.  Tom Petty hasn't changed his haircut nor his sound in decades, but that's not a bad thing.  As he ages, I find I enjoy his wisdom and simple tunes more and more.
B00000ADG2|5.0|ExFactor has the most true, honest and beautiful lyrics and most poeple can probably relate to it. To Zion is beautiful too, a really soulful track. Doo Wop That Thing has a funky beat and it really gets you dancing, Lauryns rapping is good too. Everything is Everything has THE best bassline ever. I Used To Love Him is a good blend of Hill and Bliges excellent voices. The two hidden tracks are two of my favourites, Cant Take mY Eyes Off You is a beautiful cover and Tell Him can make you cry with its emotion! You must buy this album because it has pure soul and emotion.
B000050AME|5.0|Making what is a great album even better Moby has released the Japanese Bonus Track CD along with this imported version of Play.  While many people may not think that a small three song CD (my only complaint is its length) is worth all the extra money one only has to listen to the melodic styling of Rob Dougan (Rob D) on the Porcelain remix as well as the beautiful music of all the mixes to see just how worthwhile this extra CD is.  If, however, you are not willing to spend the extra money the CD Play is still amazing and worth buying for any music enthusiast.  I highly recommend checking out at least one of these awesome CD's and while your at it check out some music by Paul Van Dyk.
B000056HRZ|2.0|Actors were pretty stiff in this movie. If you believe that uttering words is equal to acting, then this movie will not disappoint you. I could never understand how these actors could be so indifference and dead(!) while their dialogs supposed to be passonate and lively. I was very unconvinced watching their theoretcially romantic moments.  I didn't think that they really care for each other.  The real stars here are the screen writer and the song writer. And that is all you will get out of it. I keep this tape just to remind me that I should always rent the movie before buying it even it has great reviews.

0156421178|4.0|George Orwell, in his usual &quot;live free or die&quot; mentality, tells his personal experiences during the Spanish Civil War. Although, interesting, it was, at times boring.<br />One of the most ironic points Orwell explains in the book is how the USSR essentially sold out its &quot;fellow socialists&quot; in pursuit of its own best interests. You'll have to read to understand. And you should if you are at all interested in the Spanish Civil War.
0553579908|5.0|George R.R. Martin's first book frustrated me to no end. He killed the &quot;good&quot; guys, made you cheer for the &quot;bad&quot; guys, and then killed them too! I couldn't stop reading it! This latest installment is even better than the first. Martin's no-holds-barred writing is pure...humanity. He doesn't shimmy around all the dark issues. As a matter of fact he embraces the dark issues and makes them his own. If you like happy endings and &quot;true knights&quot; frolicking through the battles then this is not the book for you. If, however, you enjoyed the first book of the series and the author's realistic manner of writing then you will love this book. The plot is even thicker than before, with all the plotting and conspiring and killing that you came to love in the first book. If anything, it's even darker and more brutal. This guy is writing some great stuff!
0446310786|1.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; was without a doubt one of the worst novels I've ever read. There's about 50 pages of good writing, and the rest is garbage. The book is riddled with strange, boring sub-plots that lead nowhere. Its just wasted time.
0553274503|5.0|one of the best books i've read.  amazing how the author creates the acension of the character, gradually giving us so many verisons, so many levels of charlie, shows how his intelligence reaches a level that makes all others seem mentally-challenged,(sic?) then takes charlie back to down, showing all the fears and frustrations along the way.
0140186409|5.0|This book was quite simply one of the most powerful novels ever. Any serious reader will be moved, inspired and humbled by Steinbeck's emotional, rythmic masterpiece.
6305089957|4.0|This movie was definitely a good sequel to the first \\"Scream\\". I think that Sidney was a fighter, a lot more bold and brave this time around. This movie really compliments the first one, with a shocking ending on top of that. I would definitely buy this movie if I didn't already own it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I think that this is a major break-through in this music style.  It has gained the right to be one of my few frequently played CD's.  The music is written great and the lyrics always fit in the beat and music.  They use clever lyrics that may make you think a while.  All and all this is one of the best CD's I have ever herd.  I suggest all go out and buy it.
B00004UEDQ|4.0|Gwen (Sandra Bullock) enters rehab (for alcohol), court ordered (either rehab or jail) after destroying part of a house, after she steals a limo from her sister's wedding, after Gwen pretty much ruins her sister's wedding. Gwen eventually admits up to a drinking problem while in the rehab center. And eventually becomes 'free' of the addiction to alcohol, even while her boyfriend visits and instigates use of alcohol (as in...not being supportive). A good movie all around.<br />As far as the DVD features are concerned...I loved the 'making of...'. I didn't like the Santa Cruz soap (that is featured in the movie). Too cheezy for me to laugh at. But if you like Sandra Bullock, I suggest picking up the movie and other than the 'the making of...', pick up the VHS as the Santa Cruz is nothing special.
630027179X|4.0|The Arthurian legend (see, it's a \\"legend\\", synonymous with \\"myth\\", as opposed to \\"history\\"), which exists in different versions, is an amalgam of several myths dating from various periods, and this film is just bringing them together into a whole that's fancifully fictional, majestically mythical, and dreamily dazzling.  So what if we're seeing intercourse in full armor, over-the-top combat scenes, and weaponry that wasn't copied from a museum exhibit?  Really, who cares?  In fact, I think the film's refusal to  \\"truthfully recreate\\" period props, from armor to outfits to architecture, is rather a plus. Lancelot's shiny aluminum suit is quite fetching, and Morgana's breast plates put Madonna's old Gaultier bra to shame. The movie has some fine actors, not a few funny lines, and breathtaking scenery, but what I love most is the film's gloomily mythical, indeed wagnerian, atmosphere, which is largely thanks to its soundtrack. The Wagner score works perfectly (the Excalibur theme from Goetterdaemmerung, heavy with foreboding, is an especially brilliant touch). In fact, you might start listening to Wagner after seeing this. (I did.)
6304675348|5.0|it's one of my favorite horror movies. I love the humor in Scream (1). It's better than Scream 2 and 3 combined. If you like humor and like horror, I recommend this movie-however beware, it is not a horror movie where you jump when something happens (at least I didn't).
B00004XONN|4.0|When I was in college as a music major, I was required to attend a certain amount of performances a semester.  I grew weary of chamber concerts and after awhile, I tried to choose roads less traveled.  By this I mean that  I began looking for more modern and possibly unconventional options to fulfill that requirement.  eventually I attended a computer music \\"concert\\" in the college's media center.  It was \\"performed\\" in (at least) quadrophonic surround-style stereo.  The audience sat on the floor, as there were no seats, and was encouraged to move about to experience the performance from different perspectives.  Although today I could not hum a tune from that evening's concert if you paid me,  the experience was a turning point in my perception of music.<br />There are parts of Kid A that make me think of that concert.  There is a definite and deliberate ambience to it.  They capture an atmosphere that describes the '90's in the same way the Moody Blues did the '60's.  An icy, arctic soundscape, if you will. The best words that I can come up with is to cite Angelo Badalamenti's work on the &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me&quot; soundtrack, but a version that has been infected with some sort of Borg virus.  It comes off as very high-tech, but high-touch as well.<br />I was a little worried when I heard the preliminary rumors about this album.  I heard that they were working with a big band and using lots of electronic sound experiments.  If &quot;The Bends&quot; was their &quot;Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; was their &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;, then it would stand to reason that &quot;Kid A&quot; could be their &quot;Zooropa&quot;.  A scary idea.<br />Well, of course, Radiohead pulled it off.  The track with a &quot;big band&quot; turned out to be a cacophonous Ornette Coleman-style fadeout in which Thom Yorke pleads &quot;Turn it off!!,&quot; to almost terrifying effect (The National Anthem).  The electronic sound effects turned out to be soundscaping in the style of Robert Fripp's Frippertronics (Treefingers), and an organic techno feel reminiscent of classic Brian Eno.  \\"Kid A\\" turned out to be the exact opposite of my worst expectations.  Instead of self-indulgent, it turned out to be genuinely innovative.<br />When people got &quot;The Bends&quot; after &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, they were surprised, and similarly I think I remember Thom Yorke saying that Radiohead must be crazy to release a \\"mess like `OK Computer'\\" after so much success with &quot;The Bends&quot;.  These days,  &quot;OK Computer&quot; seems downright tame, and this is good.  As confounding as it may seem,  &quot;Kid A&quot; has the same innovative leap forward.  You may listen to it thousands of times and not \\"get it\\", but you will most likely enjoy yourself along the way.aping in the style of Robert Fripp's Frippertronics (Treefingers), and an organic techno feel reminiscent of classic Brian Eno.  \\"Kid A\\" turned out to be the exact opposite of my worst expectations.

0316920045|2.0|I've rarely laughed out loud reading any novels...and this book was no exception. If I had read this novel when I was in High School I might have thought differently about it. I may have enjoyed the sophmoric humor or marveled at the descent of a drug addiction.So what? Wallace never convnices me that he has any more profound a view of the world than I did at sixteen...and that's the waste. I can appreciate new and novel approaches to even the most tired of experimental fiction but, his is neither. I believe he's decades behind his time. Don't listen to those that are fighting to be the first to proclaim the next Joyce, Faulkner or Pynchon. Even the novel mocks itself...and for good reason...a long, bad joke.  By the way, I also used to think that the &quot;Doors&quot; were cool...then you grow up.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool's Lateralus and Weezer's Green Album came out the same day, and two weeks later Radiohead's Amnesiac was to come out.  At the time, Lateralus was very low on my priority list.  You see, years ago I bought Undertow and enjoyed it, but it did not draw me in.  I can't really say why.  Even today I find it a good listen, but all I really hear in it is potential.  I did not follow Tool after that.  I knew a lot of people liked them, but I did not buy Aenima or any of their other stuff.  I just always liked what I heard and let it be.<br />Thank goodness one of my students insisted I listen to Lateralus (thanks again, Mike). It makes a compelling Yang to Weezer's Yin, and  totally stomps Amnesiac in terms of adventurousness and experimentation.<br />Immediately I noticed that Tool had broadened their sonic and dynamic palette and matured .  The general atmosphere is very angular and claustrophobic, like the soundtrack to some cavernous journey (maybe Rick Wakeman should have given them a call).  There are times when Maynard whispers sweet secrets in your ear, then allows the band to explode when you are at your most sensitive and vulnerable.<br />As you could probably guess, I am an old-school prog-rocker, but not by way of the classic groups (i.e. Yes Genesis).  Although I became a diehard fan of all of those bands, my first musical love was Rush.  They were the first band I ever fell in love with.  Thier intensity, intelligence, and aggressiveness shaped my personal musical concept, and even today as a conductor these elements are present in the way I like for music to be played under my baton.  If you wish Rush would party like it was 2112, immediately get up from your computer and lay your hands on Lateralus.  Everything I ever liked about Rush is present in Tool's audio landscape, except better (that's right, everyone, I said better - it's evolution, you know!)<br />The same Zeppelinesque guitar-bass hooks abound, but with more adventurous time signatures and more intense drumming (imagine Neil Peart with King Crimson chops), a better vocalist (Peter Gabriel for the new millennium), clever, possibly even enlightened lyrics (the words your soul speaks to you when you stop talking), and the coolest package for any CD ever made (I heard that guitarist Adam Jones worked for Industrial Light and Magic in a past life).  If I were to suggest one track, I would tell you to listen to Parabol / Parabola as a singular track.  Its smart, emotional, and explosive.<br />I have since listened to Aenima and like it, but I find Lateralus to be a much more mature project, so I think that it is an excellent introduction to Tool.  In his diaries, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp (who doesn't admit to liking much) says that he feels that, as of now, Tool is better at being Tool than King Crimson is at being King Crimson.  High praise from a man with over thirty years of musical experimentation under his belt.  I, personally, have listened to Lateralus daily for the entire summer and am still challenged by it from beginning to end.  I want to play in a band again because of it.  If a better album comes out this year, I'm not sure if I want to hear it.more intense drumming (imagine Neil Peart with King Crimson chops), a better vocalist (Peter Gabriel for the new millennium), clever, possibly even enlightened lyrics (the words your soul speaks to you when you stop talking), and the coolest package for any CD ever made (I heard that guitarist Adam Jones worked for Industrial Light and Magic in a past life).

B00004VXF2|5.0|Indeed, Metal Machine Music is one of the most genuinely scary recordings ever  released to the general public by a well-known artist on a well-known label. As this cd consists of nothing but  impenetrable guitar feedback, there isn't any structure to the music. It is just random bursts of noise, which twist and blend and shake and  disappear into a sea of  endless cacophony. Melodies do happen to seemingly appear and vanish, moments of beauty do slither across this disc. In fact everything on this cd is beautiful, but in a very ugly and jarring way. I consider the sound of Metal Machine Music to be the sound  of true torment, making this one of the earliest  and greatest albums of the black-metal underground.
B000001ESN|5.0|No matter what RUSH fanatics may say: this is far better than anything released in their new &quot;phase&quot; after &quot;EXIT STAGE LEFT&quot;. Just that.
B000002U82|5.0|Chances are, if you're reading this, you've either heard this album before and is a Pink Floyd-fanboy jumping to see some reviews. However, if you are lucky enough to be a distraught-with-rock teen needing direction or inspiration and have never heard this album before, take a seat, it's time for a lesson.<br />Dark Side of the Moon is the most overrated album ever made, but it's deservingly so. This album today is considered a landmark in rock history. If you want numbers, it has sold 15 million copies in the US alone and has been in the Billboard Top 200 Album charts for more than 14 years consecutively. Dark Side has been covered by countless amounts of bands and its influence ranges from Radiohead to Phish. Classic rock radio stations have played tracks on this album as often as it rains in Seattle.<br />All this attention, however, is quite deserved.<br />Dark Side of the Moon starts with a heartbeat. Then you hear, faintly, dialogue, coins spilling and clocks ticking. It then becomes louder and louder, with a constant pressure being added as the sounds get louder and louder, a roller coaster going up is also in the background until finally, just as you reach the top with maniacal laughter and screaming and all the sounds overwhelming your senses, the music starts and a calm fills your speakers. That was 1a. Speak to me. This track is 1b. Breathe. The song is slow and steady with the slide guitar of David Gilmour. 'Breathe, Breathe in the air' is what settles you into the album. The rest of the song is calm and soothing.<br />Just as you relax, 'On the Run' takes over and is another sonic experiment with a constant synth riff backs running footsteps and a diving airplane. As you follow the action the running and dive-bombing increases until it all comes to a climax with an explosion and the track ending, but in the faint distance you can still hear running footsteps.<br />'Time' takes over with a surprise. You might hear the ticking clocks first, but the alarmsthat ring are still a surprise to any first-time listener. This is how Pink Floyd rocks. Roger Water's lyrical talent is exhibited here with words like ''and you run to catch up with the sun, but it's sinking, racing around to come up behind you again.' Breathe Reprise kicks in, a resurgence of the start of the album before finally ending.<br />The track doesn't really end, however, as much as it segways into the next track, which is also what makes Dark Side famous. The Great Gig in the Sky is an instrumental, but before you get restless and skip this track, sit back and listen. It's a beautiful composition with the vocal mastery of Clare Torry. You'll also notice dialogue in the beginning of the song. Another Dark Side trademark. You'll hear that often.<br />After 'Gig in the Sky' puts you in a trance, 'Money' cuts in to take you out of it. It's not a normal beat song. It's actually a rock piece with seven beats. Nick Mason's drum work fits the seven beats as Gilmour lands a perfect guitar solo in the middle of the song. Money's lyrics are also fantastic if you give a listen.<br />Next after the jumpy song is 'Us and Them,' which relies once again on the mellow beat of the previous songs. This song, however, is fully orchestrated and includes a guitar riff that is the song's signature. Richard Wright, keyboardist for the Floyd, performs a perfect piano solo in the middle, making the track even more soothing and beautiful.<br />Shortly after this song, another segway occurs and 'Any Colour You Like' is next with a synth and guitar solo, showing off talents of both Gilmour and Wright. This is also an instrumental, but more rock-based that its more soothing counterpart.<br />The beginning of the end occurs with 'Brain Damage.' Waters comes back in with his trippy lyrics, 'the lunatic is on the grass,' and with subtle guitar and steady beat. The song then cuts into chorus, and the line 'I'll see you on the dark side of the moon' comes up and is probably the only lineyou could ever sing to a climax like that. Again, this song doesn't end as it goes into the finale, 'Eclipse.'<br />The last track is filled with cymbal-bashing and excellent drum work as you feel the end is near. As the song progresses, lyrics symbolizing the forthcoming end are sung ('All that you *this* and all that you *that* and all that you...'). Meanwhile the voices get louder, the organs get louder, the drums get harder, and the music comes to a thunderous climax with 'everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.' And just when you think there's nothing left to hear, the heartbeat returns to end the album, a faint voice saying, 'There is no dark side of the moon, really, matter of fact it's all dark.'<br />This album is mellow and dark, and at first you may not fully appreciate the songwriting because it isn't hard or fast like the fake-commercialized punk of today. When you're able to sit down and listen to an album, take this for consideration. There's a reason why most of today's respected musicians will tell you this album is in their collection, and it has nothing to do with the band member's antics or the stories behind the songs, it has everything to do with the music.<br />Nobody says you have to like this album, not everyone has to be forced to accept it, either, but if you want to understand why people always speak of this album with high praise, look at the flawless musicianship, incredible ingenuity and superb organization that makes Dark Side not just nine tracks, but one legendary song.
B000002IWQ|1.0|Im an old RUSH fan. I survived and enjoyed fully when they changed their sound, adding a lot of keyboards, synthesizers, etc, forever. It was a new way, but the point was: the energy of true rock and music was always there, always at their side in all kind of songs. But in this COUNTERPARTS it seems everything went wrong !!!!! Its &quot;cold&quot;, heartless, overproduced, flat. Of course there are few tunes, but production (by Peter Collins) ruined the good part of them. If you wanna know, I gave (for free) my copy of COunterparts to a friend of mine. I really tried to enjoy it, but that was not possible, so bad that album is.
B000002UJQ|5.0|In 1999, I was a die-hard Pink Floyd/Police fan. A friend of mine urged me, no, forced me to listen to OK Computer from Radiohead to get me &quot;in the now.&quot; I had liked the songs &quot;Karma Police&quot; and &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; beforehand, but never gave them serious thought. When I listened to the album, however, it became perfectly clear just how magnificent the songs really were.<br />OK Computer shows the incredible writing and composing talent of Radiohead. It also displays the genius they had behind strategically placed electronic mixes and voices. The songs on the album were all unique and worth listening to, and not one spot of filler. I could easily place this album next to other greats like Dark Side of the Moon and Sgt. Pepper. Simply put, this is the best rock album of the late 1990's.<br />Opening OK Computer is &quot;Airbag.&quot; The musical arrangements include guitars a-plenty with scant bass and heavy drum. Thom sings through the mess about the super-human feeling of being saved by something mechanic. <br />As much as the song drives home an introduction hard, it is fast to be replaced by &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; which was an MTV staple back when they played videos. The song is very reminiscent of the three-part mega-songs you would hear from bands like Led Zeppelin and Queen in the 70's, as it clocks over six minutes. The 90's twist to the old format includes raging guitars and android voice behind Thom's vocal. Though lyrics are quite undecipherable they are still sung excellently to the tune.<br />&quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien,&quot; is a rather dreamy track with lyrics that speak of a man who wishes aliens would take him away. The music includes the same distinct harmony and force of the chorus that you'll hear throughout the entire album. Next on the play list is &quot;Exit Music (for a Film).&quot; With depressing tones aside, the track is beautifully sung and includes more electronic filler to keep in interesting. Themost notable part is when Thom breaks loose into the ending and the band plays harder with him, making incredible stereo-busting flair, though still in its manic depressive tone.<br />&quot;Let Down&quot; follows. It's much like &quot;In Limbo&quot; on Kid A as it is very moody. Within the wordy mumbo-jumbo is the incredible musicianship. Words are sung like Thom is in a trance, though he breaks through in the song's climax. Around him are a great surge of guitar plucking, steady bass drum and bass guitar, and an occasional play with synth tones as they &quot;sparkle&quot; through the middle and end of the song. This track leaves you rather satisfied after it ends.<br />My personal favorite, &quot;Karma Police&quot; is next. For those wanting the hard edge that Paranoid Android had, this song brings it back with a much more mature, organized and beautiful sound. Phil Selway's hard hits are once again the feature as the song marches its way to soft interludes of &quot;This is what you get when you mess with us.&quot; The song also features a piano through all of it, giving the song its needed sophistication. You hear the song in its hard edge up to the climax, where out of nowhere the song changes tone, becoming hopeful and more upbeat. Thom is ready to increase the intense sound of the mood with &quot;Phew, for a minute I lost myself,&quot; sung in his amazing wail. Warped and in-tune guitar feedback comes in and takes the song to its close. Though weird and somewhat abstract, it's a fitting end.<br />&quot;Fitter Happier&quot; has always been argued as being filler, but what else are you going to follow &quot;Karma Police&quot; with? This isn't even a song, more of a poem in the forefront and spoken by the android voice that was subdued in &quot;Paranoid Android.&quot; In the background is somewhat of an awkward piano and strings combination, though you barely notice them as you try to concentrate on the lyrics. <br />&quot;Electioneering&quot; is hard and it's fast. If you ever wonder why people commonly associate this band with Pink Floyd, this song certainly has its similarities to their style. It uses the Floyd's trademark 4/3 jumpy beat and uses guitar crush through most of it. If anything, this is Radiohead at their most careless, but dynamic. The track ends rather quickly, but its still a remarkable listen.<br />To even out the hard/calm/moody tone to the album comes the heavily depressing &quot;Climbing Up the Walls.&quot; Thom's vocal is muffled throughout the song but in the chorus you can hear him loud and clear. In the middle, the song goes into a musical fanfare that is bombastic it begs to be played at high volume.<br />&quot;No Surprises&quot; is an excellent song, sounding more like a lullaby than a rock song. Featuring soft guitar plucks and subdued drums, the song exposes Thom's excellent lyrical delivery in its highest form. If anything, this song is all about him. He delivers harsh lines like &quot;bring down the government,&quot; without breaking his calm, soothing voice. It could be the vocal, it could be the music itself, but something certainly makes you tear in its simplistic beauty.<br />The last two songs, &quot;Lucky&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot; are both slow and calming. With excellent lyrical content, they are somewhat fitting to the end of the album.<br />I never thought any band in the 90's was significant enough or capable of making a powerful and attention-demanding album. OK Computer completely proved me wrong, and I still thank my friend today for introducing it to me. Experience this yourself or do the same favor for one of your friends, you'll see why critics call Radiohead &quot;the band that saved rock.&quot;
0783225849|5.0|The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock shocked audiences with his vision of a man, torn between his duty and loyalty to freakish Mother, and his own misgivings about life. <br />Still, after 40 years, Hitchcock's shocker masterpiece gives the intended effect on audiences.

0743420373|4.0|The millionaire nextdoor is pretty straightforward in that it makes it clear that people get rich by being prudent and cautious with their expenditures.  I think that Stanley and Danko have a number of valid points.  Most people become wealthy by focusing on keeping and growing what they earn regardless of their income.  This book should be taught in schools because many people believe in spending as much or more than they earn.  The reason I do not rate this book a &quot;five star&quot; rating is because the author goes overboard in his description of millionaires as &quot;tightwads&quot;.  Afterall,  most millionaires would rather be called &quot;conservative&quot; rather than &quot;stingy&quot;.  Also,  in the Bay Area, where I live,  I have never seen a millionaire that is compulsively stingy.  Again, being conservative or frugal does not mean that a person who earns $240,000 a year must drive a 1960 ramblar station wagon to save money.  With that aside, however, the authors drive home the fact that not all millionaires drink expensive champagnes, live in Beverly Hills, Drive Rolls Royces, and wear Rolexes.  Many of them become rich by living below there means.  In conclusion, I reccomend the millionaire nextdoor to those who are serious about their future.
B00000J631|4.0|&quot;101 songs?&quot; I thought. &quot;No way.&quot;<br />Amazingly, the CD ALMOST pulls it off! A minority of the tracks can't really be described as songs... they are just strings of obcenities or noise with no real structure. However, these are the minority... the rest clearly show that anyone who says that punk bands don't contain musicians have never really bothered to listen. Further, the composers of the best tracks on this CD display great skill in that they manage to present a complete work within 30 seconds.<br />Featuring tracks from superstars of the genre to some pretty obscure acts, the album is part survey, part damn cool novelty collection.<br />At about 2/3rd the price of many other CDs as full as this one, it is an excellent value! (Heck, if all the disc contained were tracks #8, #9, #10, #12, #20, #28, #29, #33, #35 [I really love this one!], #40, #41, #42, #43, #49, #51, #52, #53, #55, #58, #59, #80, #83, #89, #90, #98, and #99, #100, and it would still be a better value than lots of CD singles and even many albums. The tracks listed above are all great mini-songs and many of them are darn funny to boot.)<br />There are about 8 or 10 rather weak tracks on the disk--hence the 4 star rating instead of 5. But, they go by so fast that you may not even notice them.

Rating is the last thing that matters. <br />Marlo Morgan's book. <br />It's not a cry of despair, although I cried when it came to an end. <br />What made me write a review was Mr. Christian's review, stating in a first sentence his professorship. Who cares, Mr. Christian??? Despising everything connected to Mrs. Morgan. <br />I strongly feel that the purpose of the book is fulfilled in its every reader. One picks out what matters. I'm not saying that we have a fine example of master writing but it's not what it is about. I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgan, I owe you an apology for a previous sentece. I know it's pointles to talk about the style and such things. That's not what your book was about. And I'm also sorry for the people who don't see it. I was very, very deeply touched and am very content that I could sense it. I have a strong aversion to a society I live in presently (the USA) and your book revealed many answer to my queries.

George Lucas should really be ashamed because of this pile of puke. It is mainly about Ankain Skywalker as a pod racer. The battles are nothing spectacular and are better done in movies Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or The Seven Samurai. The Special FX are nothing compared to The Matrix. I wanted Episode 1 to be about The Sith Wars, not about Pod Racing. WHO CARES?!?! And anyone who think that this is better than Empire Strikes Back needs to rewatch the original Trilogy. I am not looking forward to Attack Of The Clones (sounds like an Ed Wood movie, doesn't it?). I suggest waiting for the MEGA BOX SET to come out if you want Star Wars. Because if you have seen the original trilogy and haven't seen this, you will be disapointed from this.

0062502174|4.0|It is a short story spread just below the hook.  It is a good Novel with good hooks. The bad side to this is that when the hook of the story reels you in, and you are expecting something more from the story, it goes flat and than all of a sudden you begin to lose interest.  For example, The book is about a boy sheperd that drops everthing follow his dream.  But it takes Paulo Coelho to long to get out what he is trying to say.  It gets better towards the end so all I have to say is stick with it.  Overall I'd have to say that it is a worthwhile Novel.  I hope that you find my review helpful.

0440219078|4.0|I thought that the book the giver was vary intriguing. It was set in a time of peace and health ware the society that a boy named Jonas lived in was perfect. Jonas who was a who was a young boy was given at the age of 12 just like every other child at 12 an ability to get him by in his life kind of like a job. Jonas was given the gift of memories and he was able to feel unlike any other child in his society.  The fact that the society was perfect in the book was probably the most interesting to me. That is not of the norm that it grabbed me right away it took me in to the book and made me imagine a society totally and completely different form are own it kind of in a way made me wish that that was how are world worked also because it was so well written. When Jonas was given the gift to use memories and was able to feel like all of the humans in are world feel every day it was kind of like some sort of culture shock to me that every on but him could not dream or feel. It was vary sci fi also and I enjoy books that have to do with the abnormal the interest me the most. It was kind of like reading what another alien type society might be like on another planet. I felt that this book was vary well written any book that can catch a persons attention who normally dose not read that much like it caught mine disserves a great book review. I felt that it was vary exciting from the begging to the end and I never stopped paying good attention to the reading. I enjoyed it a lot and I realized that this book was not like any other of Lowis Lowrys books and was written a lot different it kind of unique in a way I enjoyed it a lot and I give it 4 stars.
B00005BJ2O|2.0|Perhaps you have to be of the right mindset to enjoy 'Mouline Rouge'. The movie was definitely offbeat, though charming in its own eccentric way, and the soundtrack has fulfilled its visual leader's vision in being every bit as hodge-podge, though with less successful results.<br />   The 15 tracks which comprise the 'Moulin Rouge Soundtrack' suffer from an overall lack of cohesion and quality. Like I said, maybe you have to be of a certain mindset, but I prefer my music collections to have a particular flow, and there *is no* flow on this CD. There are cover songs aplenty, some done well, others not. There are techno, R&amp;B, music hall, and acoustic styles represented, and they all add to the utter feeling of dis-jointedness.<br />   David Bowie's &quot;Nature Boy&quot;, which gets *two* treatments on the disc, is rather lackluster. The regular version contains nothing too inspiring - it is basically Bowie re-hashing Bowie. The second version, remixed by the techno/electronica group Massive Attack, is a little more rhythmic, but that really doesn't save it. The &quot;hit&quot; song is a cover of LaBelle's 'Lady Marmalade', by four of today's &quot;hottest&quot; singers. It is solid, but almost overly-produced. Fatboy Slim's entry is nothing more than a boisterous dance beat with the line &quot;Because We Can&quot; repeated a hundred times over. Ewan McGregor's take on Elton John's &quot;Your Song&quot; is quite theatrical, and fits well into the film, but outside of the movie it sounds a tad too boisterous. There is also a cover of Sting's &quot;Roxanne&quot;, blended with another song, which left me NOT wanting more.<br />   Nicole Kidman, the star of 'Mouline Rouge', has a beautiful, if thin, voice, and her singing is nice. Unfortunately, the songs she has to perform aren't that special, so the effort is almost lost. There was a song from the movie, a cover of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, which I wished they would have put on the soundtrack, but I don't want to hear it badly enough for them to put out a SECOND 'Moulin Rouge' disc.<br />   An interesting experiment. In the movie, it pretty much worked. As for the soundtrack, ah, well.....
B00000JR29|4.0|This is a remastered edition of the group's second album (originally released in February 1985). It contains the original eight tracks plus seven bonus tracks (including two special remixes).<br />The sound is big and bold, and the music of Tears For Fears is timeless. The group thrives on confronting psychological issues within the context of their music (the album was inspired by the movie &quot;Sybil&quot; starring Sally Field -- the &quot;Big Chair&quot; is what the character called her analyst's chair, and was a place where she felt safe) and their life-affirming message comes across clearly through this material.<br />4 Stars...sixteen years later and this group can still bring down the house. I especially love the remix of SHOUT included in the bonus tracks.<br />Enjoy.
B00005K3OT|3.0|'Chocolat' is like any other fable - it features a message, disguised in something which draws you near so that you can experience the message, and hopefully learn from it. The only problem here is, instead of the &quot;tempting&quot; thing (in this case chocolate) drawing us near and seducing us with its almost magical rejuvenation, we are hit over the head with the &quot;theme&quot; of the picture. But, then again, what exactly *is* the theme?<br />   The movie is set in a small French town in the 1950s. It appears to a quiet, almost idyllic little village, where everyone is polite to one another, and the streets are safe. There are, of course, a few not-so-nice things occuring, most notably an appalling wife-beater scenario, and many of the townspeople seem to be suffering from an over-abundance of child-like crushes, but do not have the nerve to act upon them. Apart from the wife-abuse aspect, I found myself enchanted with the village.<br />   But I was apparently in the wrong - at least, in the filmmaker's eyes I was.<br />   A woman and her daughter come to town. The woman, Caroline (played dryly by Juliette Binoche), sets up a chocolate shop, and it is apparent that her confections contain elements which release the desires within most people. Soon, the crushes become realized, and the abused woman leaves her husband, moving in with Caroline and her daughter. Comte de Reynaud, the head of the town (played well by Alfred Molina), soon becomes suspicious. About an hour into the movie, a river-traveling gypsy named Roux (characterized rather blandly by usually splendid Johnny Depp), arrives, and things go from bad to worse.<br />   I suppose the &quot;message&quot;, or &quot;theme&quot; of Chocolat, if indeed a message or theme can be discerned, is that you should live life to the fullest, don't hold back. Well, I don't disagree. What I found disturbing was that chocolate was used. The scenes where people were &quot;changed&quot; by its powers were odd, even evocative of being sinful. But nothing wrong went on. All these people did were to realize certain hopes and desires (and not bad ones). I guess what I'm getting at is: This is a French town not very many years after WWII. I'm sure it would *not* have been as repressed as it was, given what they went through with German occupation. None of that is touched upon here. Instead, we are led to believe that they are almost Eden-like, untouched by evil, and that only this traveling &quot;chocolate lady&quot; can save them. The transformation the townsfolk go through is supposed to be oh-so-big, but it really isn't. And I'm sure chocolate wouldn't have been necessary for it to occur.<br />   'Chocolat' isn't really a *bad&quot; movie. The acting, though a little uneven, is pretty fair, the locale pleasant, and the storyline sturdy. It is just the actual &quot;theme&quot; of the storyline which I disagree with. This film was nominated for a 2000 Academy Award for Best Picture. Like I said, it is a fair movie, but NOT worthy of a Best Picture nod. Perhaps some of the Academy members tasted some chocolate and......

B00005J9LZ|4.0|'Actually', the second proper Pet Shop Boys album (not counting their remix CD 'Disco') is a pretty well put-together musical odyssey. Though Neil Tennant, the duo's lead singer, says in the booklet of the 2001 re-issue that he doesn't believe it to &quot;hang together&quot; well as a complete album, I find myself disagreeing. It is a production definitely of its time (1987). The sounds of eighties keyboards and synths are readily audible, and jabs against Margaret Thatcher and melancholy over the terrible AIDS epidemic are poignantly referenced. There is also the sublime duet with Dusty Springfield, &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve This?&quot;, which helped re-launch her career (at least in England).<br />    The songs of 'Actually' are filled with catchy hooks and wry lyrics. It gets off to a good start with the 12&quot; version of &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and proceeds on a steady course, running through everything from commercialism to 'sinful' love. There are fast and there slow songs, and all in all, I think it &quot;holds together&quot; rather well.<br />    The 2001 re-issue version of 'Actually' features a nice, 36 page booklet that contains the Pet Shop Boys' background and viewpoints on all the songs, as well as a bonus disc full of extra nuggets. There are a few 'previously unreleased' tracks on the second disc, as well different versions (or mixes) of songs that are on the abum, or were b-sides to its singles. Most all of them are worth the listen. Especially satisfying are the multiple takes of their popular cover of Elvis Presley's love churner &quot;Always On My Mind.&quot;<br />   'Actually' is one of the better, dare I say it, *classic* albums of the nineteen-eighties, with its wonderful hooks, irresistible beats, and observant lyrics of the decade of decadence. The 2001 re-issue is definitely worth the purchase.
6305363668|5.0|this is a cool movie. i admit i was confused when the dude said to deckard that there were still four remaing replicants after he already had killed on. (thanks to amanons quotes and triva i discovred and deckard himself was really a replicant. woh. man. they should've made a sequal). really cool movie and pris looks so freaky in makeup. i especailly liked the scene where the doctor is showing pris his &quot;friends&quot;, these odd objects with body parts from different things. like a teddy bears head in i think a generals uniform. it was so cool because it looked so real.
B00004XONN|1.0|Yes, I bought this the day it came out. Still, I found it, and still find it, to be one of the more boring and pretentious CD's I've heard. It lacks real adventure (not to mention guitars), instead pandering to rock critics who &quot;get it&quot; and their &quot;real fans&quot; who are too stupid to know when they are getting duped. <br />The best thing about Kid A is the Roger Dean-inspired cover, which hints promisingly at a progressive rock opus ala Yes, Genesis, or Pink Floyd, beneath. Unfortunately, the contents are anything but epic. Doesn't even resemble anything Tangerine Dream-y (the first band to master keyboard and synth washes) either.<br />Kid A is easily the most overrated album of 2000, and Radiohead, talented though they may be, are the most overrated band in contemporary rock. Far superior bands in the same genre (Porcupine Tree, Transatlantic, Pink Floyd) are being overlooked while Radiohead enjoys bewildering critical acclaim. It's just not right.<br />I still have not bought Radiohead's newest release, Amnesiac, and I don't plan on buying future releases until: they bring back the guitars, let Thom actually SING again, stop pandering to the critics, and start respecting their audience.<br />One star.
B00005KHJT|4.0|I think any version of Halloween is great but I have always liked the television version better. This DVD is the one version I have been waiting for, although I wish it had a bunch of extras on it maybe we will get it one day right. Anyways the scenes with Loomis in the asylum talking to Micheal is a classic and I feel just heightend the story between Micheal and Loomis. All in all a classic no matter which version you like best. Now how about a Halloween 6 producers cut DVD.

Even though I consider myself a Java programmer (using UML), I still continue to use this book with examples in C++. The patterns in this book have stood the test of time, and are relevant in any object-oriented language.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I recommend you get the sound track to this movie before seeing it.  Listen to it carefully, even if you are not a bluegrass fan.  Although not a traditonal musical I can think of no other movie in modern times that is so closely tied to the music.  I will not try and explain all symbolism and references to Homer or other works.  I just have to say that this movie is remarkable and I do think you have to watch it at least twice before you make a judgement about it ( I have watched it about 5 times in the last two weeks).  I can not recommend this movie high enough!
B00003CXPD|5.0|I almost didn't rent this DVD and I would have missed out on a very beautiful and touching movie. The character Billy Elliot is a young boy who is man enough to stand up for his passion. The setting is quite simple, county Durham and the characters are so well-written, well-acted. But the revelation is the young actor Jamie Bell. His portrayal of Billy was so touching and so natural. The most touching scene was when BIlly's father caught Billy and his young homosexual friend dancing; Billy was able to silently stand up to his father by dancing in an angry, rebellious manner that left not just his father, but myself, speechless. I couldn't help but cry and root for Billy all througout. <br />I live in the Philippines and the movie industry here is in such a sad state. I wish our movie producers could come up with such a simple, moving film, so different from the so-called &quot;serious&quot; films on prositution, etc. sent as Philippine entries to film festivals abroad.
0425180638|2.0|This book picks up where Cornwells last one left off. I really not not like much of the book. The first many, many pages were very boring, talk, talk, talk. The middle was pretty good, then the ending was bad again. I could not believe just as Scarpetta was about to be done in the action stops and the next page says. \\"Two weeks later!\\" Bad ending Patricia. I have read all of the Kay Scarpetta books, I may not read another one. I really like Marino, Lucy I can do without, but I have come to feel like I am part of this group of people. Sad to leave them. I nearly put this one down before I finished it and that is rare for me. I know Patricia Cornwell can and has done better. ...
B000002UJQ|5.0|I first heard OK Computer in '97 and I am still amazed and perplexed by it.  In late '97 I saw Radiohead in a live concert on MTV playing &quot;Let Down.&quot;  Because of my instant fascination with this song I decided to buy it.  When I first listened to the album I found it rather hard to swallow because I had never heard anything like it in my life (and still haven't).  At first my favourite song was &quot;Let Down&quot; and then it changed to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; then &quot;Karma Police&quot; and now it is &quot;Airbag.&quot;  All of these songs I deem to be modern classics because of there excellent timeless power.  As with the rest of the CD all the songs are pushed to the furthest possible creative level in terms of everything.  Every song on the album is a masterpiece from a lyrical, musical, and emotional level, even the weakest song &quot;electioneeering.&quot;  Every song sounds very deep and layered with incredible sonic power that makes OK Computer an indisputable &quot;feast for the ears.&quot;   <br />Each individual song on OK Computer is an irreplaceble piece of a puzzle that, when looked at as a whole, forms a picture of a world gone mad because of over-reliance on machines and computers.  This is a concept album about a dehumanized world of machines.  It is a warning to those who place to much of their needs on computers.  Radiohead is saying that technology has the ability to rob us of our freedom (of thought and actions) if we rely on it too much.  There is listening evidence on the disturbing &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; in which a human has turned into a machine and is trying to vocally amend himself.  <br />This album, along with &quot;Automatic For The People&quot; by REM and &quot;Nevermind&quot; by Nirvana, are the best 3 albums of the nineties.  REM's Automatic belongs in this category because of its sweeping emotional landscapes, and Nevermind for it's social significance.  As for OK Computer, it is one of the greatest albums of all time because...well...you'll just have to buy it for yourself to find out.  On a personal level, I love this album I'm extremely glad that I bought it.  Highly Recommended.
B0000019HU|5.0|Every once in a while there comes a record out of nowhere which just blows your mind. One of those deliciously obscure albums that the pretentious indie kids mull over like the Scriptures. One of those hidden treasures in which a single copy lies buried on the shelves long forgotten. Spiderland is an album that lives up to all its critical hype and hipster gloating. It's been a while since an album has moved me this much. I mean you have your great albums, and then you have your GREAT albums. Spiderland is a GREAT album. It's flawless from beginning to end, literally right down to its precise song structures. Rhythms fracture and reassemble before your ears, melodies dissolve and slip through your fingers the moment you think you have a grasp on it. Slint take their sweet time winding through eerie spoken word poetry, slowly building tension, then letting up a little, but rarely releasing the listener from its hypnotic hold. But when they do, Slint explode with punk rock ferocity. &quot;Nosferatu Man&quot; creeps along a psychotic high wire of seething restraint with a thin horror guitar squealing until the Sonic Youth-like punk chorus gives the song a swift kick into high gear.  &quot;Washer&quot; features the most haunting melancholy guitar melody along with bare naked vocals so imperfect and pitiful that it breaks through all your defenses. The fact that the song drones on, sparing no comfort, drags you into the world of the singer. This song almost moved Steve Albini to tears, I broke down crying while driving. &quot;Good Morning Captain&quot;, featured on the soundtrack of the movie Kids, is a fantastic song with one of the most spectacular climaxes ever recorded. I cannot say enough about this album without getting repetitive. I usually refrain from the salesman pitch at the end of a review, but I'm not going to this time: GO GET THIS ALBUM. NOW.
B00005K9LN|4.0|I've spent the last couple years revisting albums and bands that I thought I would have never listened to.<br />Regrettably, &quot;British Steel&quot; is one of those albums, and Judas Preist was one of those bands. They had long hair, wore tight leather pants, and sang about rockin' out and metal gods, therefore, I could not like them.<br />The most recognizable track on here is &quot;Breaking The Law,&quot; which (watch the metal purists pile up the &quot;not helpful&quot; votes) is, in my opinion, 1980's great lost punk rock anthem. Clocking in at 2:33, sporting a speedy tempo, no guitar solo, and lyrics that could just as well have been on Black Flag's &quot;Damaged&quot; album (check out that screamed &quot;You don't know what it's LIKE!&quot;), &quot;Breaking The Law&quot; could have easily been a legendary punk anthem along the lines of &quot;Red Tape&quot; or &quot;Runnin' Riot&quot; or &quot;Nervous Breakdown,&quot; had it been performed by a bunch of kids wearing studded leather as opposed to um... a bunch of longhairs wearing studded leather.<br />Never mind.<br />Otherwise, &quot;British Steel&quot; is a very fine hard rock/heavy metal album of the era, mixing elements of Motorhead (&quot;Rapid Fire&quot;), Thin Lizzy (&quot;Living After Midnight&quot;), and AC/DC (&quot;You Don't Have To Be Old To Be Wise&quot;), While it's no &quot;Nighway To Hell&quot; or &quot;Overkill,&quot; it's certainly no &quot;See You In Hell,&quot; either. Pick it up if you have even a morbid curiosity for heavy metal, 1980-style.
B00000DLUO|5.0|The first time I play this CD...its wonderful...It was such I have a new girlfriend.....I was impressed by the opening of First song ' What are we doing the rest of our lives'.....its such a treatment from this Bill Evans album....to give me an afterwork enjoyment. Its bliriant,, inovative...&amp; High Beauty..... I calmost can not sleep cause I want to enjoy this CD.
B000003TAR|5.0|To start off, Nirvana's first three albums I think were not what they wanted to express...but this album is one of the best I have ever listened to. They express their true meaning of their idea of music, trying to bring off what they called 'false fans' that were addicted to 'Smells like Teen Spirit.' Other than that Nirvana in my opinion had recorded the best album in the music industry. I think most other bands in the music industry write music that will attract fans. But Nirvana didn't do that...and that is why I love this album
0062502182|4.0|Nick Schuneman  The Alchemist Paulo Coelho<br />   The story of the Shepard boy Santiago was a story of a boy with a <br />Vision, a young man who was drawn to a place he had never even seen. His journeys are<br />Depicted in Paulo Coelhos book The Alchemist, an adventure story based on a youth who <br />Goes in search of the thing he knows not of, of spiritual land marks that draw him to <br />Them with overwhelming intensity. On his journey Santiago meets characters that <br />Influence his life directly, one of which introduces him to the alchemists a group of <br />Individuals who combine different elements to make gold.

Santiago eventually meets one of these alchemists and studies under<br />Him were he learns true spiritual meaning.<br />   This book was not the easiest book for me to get into, but once I <br />Really started reading it I found it fascinating. It takes a tale that ha been retold for <br />Generations and buts a new meaning to it to make a new classic. I would stress this book <br />To Anyone who enjoys sci fi, fantacy novels, or anyone who enjoys books with a <br />Spiritual lesson to be learned. A good read all around.
B00003CY5K|3.0|I think that this movie was a discrace to mankind.  I think that some blonde's would take it offensively to see a movie based on a dumb blonde who went to college chasing after a guy.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone especially someone who was blessed with blonde hair!
B00003CXSP|3.0|This movie was definitely entertaining and good by many people's standards, but it pales in comparision to its predecessor.  In an attempt to outdo \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", the director made every character more extreme and therefore less believable.  Clarice Starling was tougher and smarter (like that part with the perfume).  Hannibal Lecter was waaaaay smarter, crueler, and more all-knowingish.  The obligatory sexist pig police officer was way more piggish and dumb.  Etcetera etcetera.  In taking all the characters to these extremes, they removed much of the credibility that was so key to the terror of the original movie: for something to be truly horrifying, you have to believe that it could be real.  Real people have many sides, and are alternatingly tough, scared, frightening, confident, stupid, or smart.  These characters came off as pretty one-dimensional because they lacked the contradictions everyone has in them.  I had a hard time believing that anyone could be as quick as Starling, or so collected while remaining so evil as Hannibal.  True, these were the things that made Hannibal so scary and Clarice so endearing in \\"Silence\\", but they were successful because they were within the realm of reality.  \\"Hannibal\\" ignores any sense of being realistic when it comes to characters. The only other flaw I found was the climactic scene, which I won't spoil for any (who obviously haven't seen the movie, if they're reading a review of it).  I thought it, like the characters, was taken to such extremes that any credibility was removed, therefore taking away was makes it so scary.  Instead it became almost laughable, but mostly embarrassing - for whoever tried so hard to outdo \\"Silence\\" - perhaps too hard - and failed. Aside from these two elements, though, it is a very entertaining and somewhat scary movie.  But thanks to the directing, it remains just that - a movie - not, as \\"Silence\\" became, a masterpiece.
B00003CXRO|4.0|This film is unquestionably worth seeing for Tom Hanks' amazing performance as Chuck Noland, a time-obsessed, globe-trotting Federal Express executive whose world is shattered when a plane crash strands him alone on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific. The middle part of the movie, chronicling Noland's struggle for survival and sanity on the lonely outpost, is far and away the most effective portion, not the least because of Hanks' startling physical transformation from a doughy, somewhat overweight landlubber to a lean, tanned survivor.<br />It is also effective because there is very little or no dialogue in this part, and therein lies the problem with the rest of the film. Too often the rest of the script is content with banalities and cliches that sink rather than buoy up the inherent drama in the situations; Helen Hunt, as Hanks' patient fiance, has the worst time of it, particularly in the last portion, after our hero is unexpectedly rescued and must cope with the shock of re-entry into the land of the living. The action here is hurried and superficially treated as well, calling for a separate film to make a truly moving effect. Still, one can applaud &quot;Cast Away&quot; for a fairly realistic depiction of the grim realities of a man struggling against nature, and for its refusal to settle for a pat happy ending.
B00005LB9O|5.0|I had heard of the band Travis and read a few things about them in various publications and websites, but had not ever heard their music.  I am glad that I now have.  The first song I heard from Travis, was ironically, a cover to Britney Spears' &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;.  The band was having a good time with the song, but their version of the song actually made it a very good song.  I decided that I needed to check the band out.  I bought &quot;The Invisible Band&quot; and have loved the whole CD.  I now have purchased their last release, &quot;The Man Who&quot;, and have enjoyed that as well.  This is a great band and a great album.  The first track, &quot;Sing&quot; is the first single as well - great song.  &quot;Side&quot; will definetely be a single and my favorite track right now is &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot;.  Great song and great lyrics.  The song actually reminds me of one of my favorite bands, The Connells.  &quot;Flowers in the window&quot; is very catchy with a Beatle-esque sound to it, and another favorite is &quot;The Humpty Dumpty love song&quot;, a great song.  All in all, this album is great from start to finish and has made Travis one of my favorite bands.  Some of my other favorite bands are Train, Matchbox Twenty, Third Eye Blind, The Connells, R.E.M., U2, Barenaked Ladies and The Cure.  If you like any of these bands, you will more than likely enjoy Travis.  Go pick it up!
B000002MP2|5.0|when i come around is probably the best song but all the songs are AWESOME. long view, tropical paridise and basket case are the other stand out tracks. i have to admit that i was a little dissapointed with green days new cd warning. it just isnt the same. if i could i would give this cd a lot more stars then five. nimrod is good to but it comes up short of dookie. if u are thinking about getting this then GET IT. u wont be dissapointed. blink 182 over shadows green day but i think green day tries harder to make good songs. (i like blink 182 anyway.)because in blinks new cd they have one song which is pure cussing and i guess some people like that. ABOVE ALL GET THIS CD. U WONT BE DISSAPOINTED. I GUARENTEE IT.
B000001E29|5.0|Ah, how soothing to listen to a few broken pianos in this age of synthesized pop. A previous reviewer has described this recording as post-beat apocalypse, and that really is it. Those looking for a Burroughs-piece have to be satisfied with a couple of tracks, though his influence circles throughout the recording. This is definately Tom's project, and might stun those that aren't adapted to his style. I would recommend purchasing this albulm only after listening to his previous albulm Bone Machine, which should introduce you to the hard edges and scratch. <br />Those who know that albulm can expect an explosion of the themes and sounds addressed there. Imagine Bone Machine transformed into an opera, performed on a cold, cloudy day in a German ruin, and given the mordant tones of a Burroughs monologue. The distant beauty of public ruins, symphonies of chains and accordions, dirt in the ground.<br />If you devote yourself a little to this recording you will pine to see the play is scored. After a while you may be able to imagine it yourself...
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is one of the finest films ever made. I know that sounds obsessive, excessive, and cultish, but it's true anyway. If you've never seen it and feel a little put off by it being an old movie or a long movie, dont worry, you'll enjoy it. It's an easy movie to like. But it also has an incredible amount of depth to examine closer and closer on each viewing. You just may end up watching it 5 or 6 times in as many months.
0425104052|5.0|As a mystery writer with my debut novel in its initial release, I always appreciate the classics of the mystery genre.  Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works are among the best of the genre, and THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES is Doyle's best novel.  Those readers expecting to find in this book the famous Holmes line about the dog that didn't bark will be disappointed.  That nonbarking dog isn't here.  It's in one of the Holmes short stories.  What we have here is a moody work set among the moors with a strong and obvious Gothic influence upon Doyle by the mystery genre's founder, Edgar Allan Poe.  Holmes and his supporting cast are all in fine form.  The plot works, as does the setting and the tone.  THE HOUND OF THE BASKERVILLES has endured.  It will continue to endure in the future.  It is a classic that people actually read.
B00004SC3M|3.0|I believe that this movie and The Thomas Crown Affair came out the same year. This is the weaker of the two, but still enjoyable. Sean Connery is not equalling his performances in Finding Forrester and The Untouchables, but he brings some fun to the part. Catherine Zeta Jones is fine, but this movie is supposed to be a fun old caper, and it lacks some of the flair that Crown had in excess. Whenever the two were stealing something the movie was fun, but it was just about a half-hour too long. It was okay, but so was the DVD. The deleted scenes had no audio, but the studio made the right choice cutting them. The alternate ending was the regular one with the mess of dialogue at the end deleted, which would have been better, I think. Anyway, if you have patience you will get a lot more out of this. I thought it was average.
B000000OMB|3.0|Asia were a band I had eagerly awaited. The vibes were good: you'll never have a more impressive quartet of CVs than Messrs Downes, Wetton, Howe and Palmer. Wetton's closing bass lines in &quot;One Step Closer&quot; sounded awesome in my headphones, when previewed by Tommy Vance about 3 weeks prior to the album's release back in Spring 1982. I bought the album on the day it was released. I've played it countless times since, both on vinyl then on CD. My wife absolutely loves it! Problem is...I don't. There's something missing! The album's production is first class. On the face of it the songs are fine also: all the band members are able to express themselves and play to their full capabilities. It's as if the whole thing is too good to be true...or natural! Nowadays Asia could be classed as a Boyzone or Westlife, albeit with infinitely more talent, ie the songs are synthetic: there's nothing real or deep in them. The album and band lack soul! Later on I bought Alpha then Astra. Same story. The only one I swapped vinyl for CD was Asia, if only for nostalgia, or old times sake. It wasn't because I loved the music. Best compliment I can pay Asia is...it's okay...no better than that. Sorry, my dearest darling wife.
0451527712|2.0|I watched the movie with Helena Boham Carter first, and I thought it was a wonderful movie, so I decided to read the book.  The book was a terrible book.  I couldn't relate to any of the characters, except the creation.  Everyone, except the creation, was so perfect!  Elizabeth was Barbie incarnate!  She was smart, talented, kind, loving, honest, loyal, beautiful (looked just like Barbie).  Victor was the same, except he made something that wasn't beautiful.  So an ugly thing crashes Victor's perfect world.  Boo-hoo-hoo.  The only thing that made sense in the story was the creation.  The way he explained how he was so lonely, how if Victor made something, why would he want to make it suffer so.  I felt so bad for the creation.  Victor made absolutely no sense in why he wouldn't make a companion for the creation.  He said something about evil, and how there would be more killing, but the creation explained to him, more than once, why he did what he did (the little boy, the friend, etc.)  And he even warned Victor that there would be more destruction unless he had a companion.  The ending was good, how the captain understood the monster.  I felt contempt for the characters in the book.  The creation was the only character who had any depth.  Victor and Elizabeth and everyone else was so involved with their perfect, beautiful world that it was dumb.  They were so flat, one dimensional characters.  I know that Shelley wanted us to understand the monster, which I did (thus the 2 stars), but the rest of the characters were mindless.  Real life isn't like Victor's world.  Real life is like the Creation's world.  Searching for something, searching for a part of you, searching for the meaning of why we were put on this earth because life is vicious and cruel.  I would recommend reading this book only for the sake of the character of the Creation.  It was such a small book, but I got so annoyed by the dumbo characters.
B0000033OZ|3.0|Hindsight, they say, is of great benefit. May be I'm unfairly criticising this album when compared to Tarkus or Trilogy, but however, so be it. To cut a long story short...it's too bland by far.To me it smacks of too much record company pressure for the band to go in to a studio and produce SOMETHING. This, unfortunately, is what we got! 'Barbarian' and 'Tank' could have been absolute belters if better recorded and more time taken, and did you ever hear a more tinny drum solo than at the back end of 'Tank'? Album padding, I'm afraid, lads. 'Take A Pebble' is also an exercise in filling up vinyl space so that the album (which is short anyway) in general becomes a padded out job. The song itself has a great intro and finale, but the middle..yyeeugghh!'Knife Edge' is more like it. Welcome, ELP, to the ranks of excellence in prog rock releases. 'The Three Fates' has our Keith doing what he does best...classical music. I love it. The final number, 'Lucky Man' saves the album from total dismissal. A beautiful little ballad from Lake, and the opportunity to introduce himself to the hordes of waiting ELP fans. I had expected more, possibly, from the band, following on to the culmination of The Nice (Rondo etc)and the majestic overtures from KC's Wake Of Poseidon and ITCOTCK but was let down, basically. Sorry lads.
068817776X|5.0|As those that survived HaShoah become older and realize the need to share with the younger generations the trials they went through, the story of what really transpired becomes clearer.  This was an excellent example of an individual with courage and imagination.  And the book is well-written for the average reader rather than the historian.  I read it in less than two days.
B000002J1B|5.0|It's a great pity that Patrick Moraz only hung about for one album with Yes. It was Yes's loss and The Moody Blues' gain, I suppose, however at that particular time no one knew what masterpiece was to follow with the re introduction of Rick W and 'Going For The One'album. I remember queuing in a record shop in Glasgow to buy the album the day it was released. There was music being played in the background and I remember thinking what the hell kind of racket it was. It subsequently turned out to be the battle sequence in 'Gates Of Delirium', so the album got off to a good start...not! After several plays, however, and I had better understood the music my initial perception had been totally changed forever: 'Relayer is a CLASSIC! The battle sequence, where Howe and Moraz basically knock hell out of each other and then on in to 'Soon'is incredible. 'Sound Chaser', is jazz par excellence, and 'To Be Over' reminds us of what had gone before us in 'Close To The Edge' and is a prelude to 'Going For the One' It would have been nice if Patrick M had stayed around for one more album at least, to build on the direction Yes were headed at that time, but we'll never know now what the outcome might have been.
B000001OAA|5.0|I gave a friend a list of CDs that I'd like to borrow from her -- at the last minute I added &quot;Garbage&quot; to the list, and almost crossed it off.  Good thing I didn't!  I listened to Garbage and absolutely LOVED every single track.  It didn't leave my CD player for over a week, and when my friend demanded it back I went out and bought it and it's follow-up &quot;Version 2.0&quot;.<br />All the tracks on this CD are amazing.  It goes from fast-paced dizzying tracks, to slower, sad songs and back again.  Overall it's a CD that I can listen to at anytime, over and over again.  Go out and buy it. :)<br />--Rachel
B0000033P0|5.0|The very first ELP track I ever heard was on Radio Luxemburg, Kid Jensen. It was 'Only Way'.Tarkus had gone straight in to Radio Luxemburg charts at number 1.The opening intro - St Marks Organ - took my breath away.I'd never heard anything like it before. Next one up was 'Mass' Initially I wasn't all that impressed with this track, and then with side 1 of the album. After a couple of plays however it had joined the ranks of the immortals, and still is to this day. Eddie Offord's production, coupled with three musicians at the top of their class, makes this one of THE albums of both 1971, and the '70s in general. The first side seamlessly flows from 'Tarkus', through 'Eruption', 'Stones Of Years etc to the majestic culmination numbers of 'Battlefield' and 'Aquatarkus'. The second side exhibits the band's sound ability to write and play a variety of styles. Apart from 'Only Way' my favourite track is 'Time And A Place'.This should have been the final number, however the sting in the tail is a really good rock'n'roll funny, just to finish things off. Emerson is (obviously) the main man, in the absence of a guitarist, but is more than ably backed up by superb bass lines from Lake and drumming par excellence from Palmer. I remember getting thrown out of a party, somewhere in Coatbridge, back in Easter Sunday 1974 for continuously playing 'Only Way' - just for the pipe organ intro. 27 years later I still tend to do the same. Funny 'n it? It's the best of ELP's early years (probably of the bunch)
0375703764|5.0|This is one of the most terrifying books I've ever read. Unconventional would be the understatement of the year when describing House of Leaves. Some people are so put off by the strange layout of the book that they don't read it. MISTAKE!! I have to say, even though this is a difficult read at times (long footnotes, backward and upside down text) it's a total reading experience that you will not regret when it's all said and done. This book is so far beyond JUST horror. The dark and abyss-like house can be equated to secrets, fears, all the dark parts of ourselves that grow and can get out of control if not dealt with.
630589938X|3.0|Actually a fairly good Stephen King translation, I remember being genuinely frightened a few times when this played theatrically. But my fondest memory of the movie was its poster: a beautiful sun-bleached drawing of a very east-coast summer house, surrounded by a picket fence splattered with blood in the form of Cujo's name. Warner home video used this artwork when intially releasing the video over a decade ago, and now? This picture of a clownish lip-sticked overly-reddened St. Bernard and his teeth is clearly not even a shot from the movie! I have always questioned/doubted the wisdom of revisionist cover-art for video releases, but this one takes the cake as the most artless piece of junk I've ever seen.
0061008079|5.0|The first time I read A Woman of Substance I was about 13 years old, and I think I've probably read it at least once every second year since (and it seems to get even better each time). I am now 27 years old and I will always enjoy this great book, simply because it tells a unique story of a woman who succeeded against all odds and whose dignity, strength and perseverence should be an example to every woman who is afraid to fail and to be different. This book is truly addictive, the language is brilliant and the storyline completely compelling. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story full of love, power, success and most of all an incredibly strong woman. Read it when you feel lost, down or weak, or just read it anyway!
B00004U8DS|2.0|This is a masterpiece...that never was. I am sorry but the opener: Tell all the People, has got to be the most pretencious song on this album. It really goes beyond cheesy. Touch me, well now there is a song to match anything Sweat, Blood and Tears ever did. Actually, the entire Soft Parade struggles to be the Doors and at the same time Sweat, Blood and Tears. Why? It is obvious why Jim Morrison did not want his songs orchastrated..they would loose their raw sensuality. The songs that lack punch here are Robbie Kriegers. They inspire only a subtle muse. Shaman Blues and Wild Child, both by Morrison, clearly display the only direction in this shallow album. But it is not enough to carry the weight. The Soft Parade is weak..tell all the people.
B00003CXRM|5.0|The ultimate feel-good movie!  Thank God DVDs don't wear out!  My wife and I have watched this DVD over twenty times (matter o' fact, it's playing right now)!  Our friends come over and ask to see it multiple times!  Joel and Ethan Coen &quot;Direct within an inch of their lives,&quot; according to Tim Blake Nelson (Delmar) in a featurette on the DVD.  Delmar's got it right!  This film is the work of masters!  I've spoken my piece, and counted to three!
B00003CX8J|5.0|Normally when I watch a movie based on a comic book I cut it a bit of slack when it comes to things like character motivation.  After all, we are dealing with characters who are larger than life.  Heroes wear white and are motivated by a sense of justice, villains wear black and do their evil deeds basically because they are evil.<br />This sort of basic motivation has even snuck into mainstream movies.  Gladiator and The Patriot both had villains who, when asked why they do the evil deeds they do could be expected to reply, &quot;Because I'm the bad guy and that's my job.&quot;  The heroes of these movies are motivated by revenge rather than justice.<br />Here comes X-Men and shows them up with style.  On one side we have Normal Human Senator Kelly, out to register Mutants because he is afraid of them.  He is afraid they will make him obsolete, afraid they have the ability to destroy him at will and he has no way to protect himself from them except by marking them as dangerous beings.<br />On the other side is Magneto, a mutant with the power to control metal and a survivor of the Holocaust.  He sees this as an attempt to bring back those bad old days and is ready to fight it at all costs.<br />Both of these villains have motives that are wholly understandable.  In today's movies that is unusual.  In a movie based on a comic book it seems remarkable.<br />In between these two forces are the X-Men led by Professor Xavier who is out to keep the peace, prevent Senator Kelly's Anti Mutant law from being passed by legitimate debate and similarly try to keep Magneto from killing Normal Humans.  His team rescues Wolverine (Hugh Jackman in what should be a star making performance) and Rogue (The lovely Anna Paquin) from an attack by Magneto.<br />Purists to the comic book may balk at the variations from the original, but these things almost always happen when translating a story from one medium to another.  Even a simple origin story like Superman went through variations when translated to film.  The fact of the matter is that this movie treated the source material with respect in a quest to make a decent movie and the result is a movie which should have been hyped as an event when initially released.hen translated to film.

0060254920|5.0|This is the first book I ever read by myself (many years ago!)  I found it on the shelf of the school library and at about 6 years old fell in love with it.  I purchased this book in my third month of pregnancy as well as a cute little Max doll (my copy was very tattered after many years of use and I wanted my child to have a fresh copy.)  My daughter is just turning 4 and she has started to take an interest in having it read to her again and again and again!!!  The nice part about reading this one over and over again is I actually know it by heart and can read it to her while doing other things.  If you have children this book is a must  it has definitely withstood the test of time!

6305648522|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the most beautiful, passionate, well-made movies I've seen in a long time. The story of a young boy who falls in love with movies, escaping the sadness of war that has taken his father. As a huge movie lover, I can honesty say that this will be a film that I will hold in my heart for a long time, and defend it if need be. As I said before, this is an absolute astounishing film!
0671042858|2.0|I should've known something was amiss. Here was an SK paperback that weighed under 5 lbs and felt more like a novella (though touted as a novel). But, once again, I fell for the &quot;critical praise&quot; the preceded the forward. I now realize that the acclaim dished out to pump an author's work is as dubious - if not more so - than the crap slapped on movie posters. Just once, I'd like the peer reviews to be honest: &quot;King at his mediocre best!&quot; or &quot;King walks to first base! Again!&quot;  Don't get me wrong. I love SK. And because I do, I'd bet dollars to donuts that the time he spent on this book was equal to or less than the time it takes to read it and say, &quot;I want my 15 minutes back.&quot;  The story begins interestingly enough. A girl gets lost in the woods. Cool. Trouble is, neither she nor the story make inroads thereafter, no pun intended. The only obstacle King gives her are the inhospitable woods. Duh. Oh yeah, and he keeps reminding us that &quot;something is stalking her.&quot; Over and over. Each chapter (or &quot;inning&quot;, in keeping with the baseball substory) goes around in circles. She's lost, and &quot;something's&quot; following her. By the &quot;7th inning&quot; we're saying, &quot;OK, I get it already. She's lost and something's following her. Do something with it.&quot; Somewhere around the 4th inning, King introduces a crank caller who tricks the search party. A cool twist, but it goes nowhere. I was really hoping that King would dial up the intensity like he used to. I wanted the little girl to run into the cast of Deliverance. But she doesn't. Not even her imaginary friend, Tom Gordon, is interesting. And he's imaginary fer chrissake! Finally, the 9th inning arrives and King reveals the thing that's been &quot;stalking&quot; her (which we guessed the minute he introduced it) and it's as climactic as a bus trip to Buffalo. Then it dawned on me. This &quot;novel&quot; is actually a young adult book. By that I mean it's for girls between 9 and 15 -- the kind who don't get asked to dance. This book should be in the Young Adult section, not leaning against CARRIE. And in case you hadn't guessed, I'm not a young girl. I have hair on my knuckles. And if I'm gonna read a book about a young girl who's lost in the woods, she better damn well run into a chainsaw or Slingblade or both. Maybe it has to do with the whole baseball thing which ain't that exciting to begin with. It's too bad King isn't into hockey. He could've called the book, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Phil Esposito&quot; and thrown in some good fights as a gesture of good will to those who, unfortunately, didn't lose themselves reading the thing.s for girls between 9 and 15 -- the kind who don't get asked to dance.

0452282152|5.0|This novel is wonderful for anyone, but especially appealing for those of us who are in book discussion clubs. The novel is open for personal interpretation on many levels. Ms. Chevalier's presentation of life in a very difficult time is tempered with one girl's strong sense of identity even as she responds to duty imposed by family hardship. There are many levels to this story, and while Griet is the main focus, the fear of Vermeer's wife and her insecurities about her place in her husband's priorities are very interesting, as is the character Vermeer himself. A wonderful novel!
0440178002|5.0|Despite what some reviewers say, Shogun is one of the better crafted historically based novels.  What some people forget is that this book is of the fiction genre.  Yes, that means the author is bound to take some liberties with the historical matter.  If certain, rather minor historical inaccuracies really bother the pseudo historian in you, you might want to look elsewhere.  But if you are in the market for one of the most complete novels ever written - Shogun might just be your book.  This book takes a fabulous love story, lots of action and intrigue and wraps it in a torrid period in Japan's history.  Lord Toranaga's character is actually based on the last true Shogun of Japan, Ieyasu Tokugawa, who conquered all the other territories, creating for the first time in centuries - a unified Japan.  Many of the other central characters are based on true historical figures as well.  I completely recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Asian culture and in a terrific read.  Clavell in my opinion is one of the best western authors ever to catch the true &quot;asianess&quot; of the Chinese and Japanese cultures he writes about.  His attention to minute details of the culture is what really creates a lasting and sincere portrait of Japan in this novel.
B000008M54|3.0|When the Waterboys stick to a more traditional sound, on songs like \\"And a Bang On The Ear\\" and \\"Has Anybody Here Seen Hank?\\" they create music that is a pleasure to listen to. But on songs like \\"We Will not Be Lovers\\" with its repetitive screeching violin and an ill-fated cover of Van Morrison's \\"Sweet Thing\\", the band's strengths are lost in amplified volume and annoying vocals. The qualities of the good songs outweigh the bad so this is not a mistake if you like the band, but beware; this is an example of why the \\"next\\" button on your CD player was invented.
0345298349|3.0|Mine was a hard cover book.  After reading about 1/3 of the book, I almost gave up.  However, after completing the book, I must admit that it was very interesting and different from anything I have ever read.  My husband has read the long, long Russian novels so he encouraged me to persevere.<br />The plot was a wonderful mystery with great character development.  I found myself reading very slowly.  Often, I read sentences over again.  Sometimes, I never understood what was going on but isn't that the way the world really is for most of us?<br />For me, time will tell as to whether or not it was 'worth getting through it,&quot; as I may read another novel by this author.  If I do, I'll be interested to find out what I think then.
B000002J1S|5.0|If you want to know what Peter Gabriel-era Genesis was truly capable of, listen to this album. True, song-for-song the album might not be as consistent as some of their other works, but this album can't be taken as individual pieces. Peter Gabriel had just been asked by William Friedkin (\\"The Exorcist\\") to work on a screenplay with him, and the collaboration apparently fired up his imagination. While the longer songs on the band's previous albums featured Gabriel's unique brand of storytelling, \\"The Lamb\\" ups the ante with a continuous narrative running through the album's 23 tracks. The complete story is printed in the liner notes of the album and it is absolutely necessary to read the story in order to understand just what is going on. The tale focuses on a Puerto Rican kid, Rael, living in N.Y.C. The opening title cut acts like the exposition of the story, describing the bustling streets of the city and the troublesome tendencies of the main character. Beginning with \\"Fly on a Windshield,\\" something happens to him and he embarks on a journey full of colorful characters, tough decisions, and reminiscings of his earlier life. It's been suggested that he dies in \\"Windshield\\" and his adventures represent purgatory and \\"It\\" is heaven. I tend to believe this and many things in the story point to it, but Gabriel has never fully explained his narrative - at least I don't think he has. I suppose he left the meaning a little vague to leave the storyline open for analyzation. Either way, it's very entertaining reading.<br />Which brings me to the music. The concept album formula was a catch-22 for the band. The story idea forced them into making a bunch of concise songs, with the music in each matching the mood of the particular point in the story. The band pulls this off effortlessly (the whirling suspense of \\"In The Cage,\\" the whimsy of \\"The Grand Parade,\\" and the haunting, mournful adventure of \\"The Lamia\\" to name a few.) However, after all the songs were written, therewere still a few gaps in the storyline. Rather than just leave them go, they produced some mood music, with sound effects to match the action of the story - the downright scary \\"The Waiting Room\\" painfully recreates all of the details of the narrative. Sometimes this works very well. \\"Hairless Heart\\" is a gorgeous instrumental featuring great guitar work from Steve Hackett. But the 5-minute streak that begins with \\"Silent Sorrow\\" and ends after the first two minutes of \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" can be a bit much. Yes, it parlays Rael's sadness of losing the lamia, and segues nicely into his discovery of the otherworldly slippermen colony. But, at the very least, it could have been a bit shorter. <br />Still, this is a small complaint for an album as good as this. The way the songs segue is very impressive and the sound quality is stunning for an album released in 1974. It's not going to be easy listening at first, but once it sinks in, it will never cease to amaze you, no matter how many times you play it. A '70s album that uses all of the excesses of the decade to its advantage and remains the best album Genesis ever made to many, myself included.<br />\\"It's only knock and knowall, but I like it.\\"

B00001OH7P|5.0|Jammin' good with Weird and Ghillie and the Spiders from Mars.&quot;<br />&quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; found Bowie really hitting his stride in the early 1970's.  This album remains an all-time classic.  Every cut is unique, yet they all fit together -- but not in the same fashion as a rock opera.  (Kind of difficult to explain ... and this from a long-time Bowie fan such as myself!)<br />&quot;Five Years&quot; is best described as post-apocalyptic bubblegum.  &quot;I saw you in the ice cream parlour, drinking milkshakes cold and long&quot; is a rather odd line to find juxtaposed with swirling hard rock guitar by the late Mick Ronson.  &quot;Moonage Daydream&quot; is, in many ways, a previous of &quot;Loving the Alien,&quot; from the mid '80's &quot;Tonight&quot; album.  Of course, the title track is marvelous, telling its tale of a band's rise to stardom and fall from grace.  One of my personal fave cuts is &quot;Hang On To Yourself,&quot; with its catchy guitar riffs.  &quot;Rock and Roll Suicide&quot; can be seen as oddly comforting despite it's title:  &quot;I've had my share, I'll help you with the pain.  You're not alone.&quot;<br />Any fan who found Bowie during the &quot;Let's Dance&quot; period and has *not* investigated his older work really needs to give this album a listen.  There is a reason why it is perenially listed as an essential recording -- and why the songs from this outing continue to earn huge cheers and ovations at Bowie concerts.  Not to be missed.
B000002OX3|4.0|On their second album The Who experiment with a number of different sounds, creating a hodgepodge of good songs and interesting failures. Entwistle's contributions \\"Boris the Spider\\" and  \\"Whiskey Man\\" are two highlights and Moon's  \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\" is a truly different sound for a rock band (or any band for that matter). Many of the other songs on this CD are instantly forgettable; (\\"Run Run Run\\" `I Need You\\"  \\"Don't Look Away\\") songs that could have been recorded by any mid sixties \\"British Invasion\\" band.  An early \\"rock opera\\" concept \\"A Quick One\\" is the highlight of this CD. You can see the early gleams of ideas that later came to fruition on Tommy and Quadrophenia. The rest of the CD is composed of songs collected from The Ready, Steady, Who EP and B-sides all worth a listen for the real Who fan. Quirky covers like \\"Batman\\" and \\"Barbara Ann\\" are included along with an acoustic \\"Happy Jack\\" and alternative version of \\"My Generation\\" make these useful additions to the original recording, unlike so many other \\"padded\\" CD's
B00004YKUY|4.0|As a devoted fan of both Journey and Steve Perry, I'm the first to admit that I refused to even consider that Journey's new lead singer should be given a chance.  Replace Steve Perry?  No way!  I've seen Journey at least four times in concert, all when Steve Perry was the front man.  I recently bit the bullet and sat down to listen to Journey's newest CD, Arrival.  OK, I'm eating crow.  The CD was fantastic.  No, the new singer is not Steve Perry.  His voice is close, but there is more of an edge.  The music is very similar to the old Journey, a relief to me.  It makes me wish I had gone to see them in concert last month in New Jersey.  If there is anyone out there who thinks that the new Journey line up isn't worth a listen, take it from me:  You'll be pleasantly surprised.
0782008372|5.0|&lt;this is the goodest movie ever&gt; <br />I find that Russel Mulcahy is able to momentarily suspend our disbelief to the point where we say to ourselves, &quot;there can be only one...and the show must go on.&quot;<br />&lt;i liked it so much that i had to eat my leg to survive.&gt;<br />Especially notable is the authentic QUEEN soundtrack, it really is a kind of magic.

B000002H2H|5.0|A natural follow-up to Metallica's &quot;Kill 'Em All,&quot; this album proves that Metallica wasn't about ready to give up the 1980's underground metal revolution.  The band matured from &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; with &quot;Ride The Lightning,&quot; where they showed that metal could be more than obnoxious and could actually have social and political messages. Ranging from nuclear war to the Ten Commandments to an Ernest Hemmingway novel, Metallica showed they weren't your average Spinal Tap. The music on this album is utterly amazing, with classical and acoustic intros, pounding rythmic sections, and solos that are earsplitting at times and bluesy at others.  An all-around great album with a beautiful instrumental partly written by Dave Mustaine ending it as a masterpiece.
B00001OH7T|5.0|&quot;Young Americans&quot; is a real landmark album in Bowie's career - it gave him his first American #1 hit, &quot;Fame,&quot; for one thing.  However, there are many other wonderful tracks to recommend this venture into soul music.  The title track, for example, has an infectious rhythm and extremely clever lyrics - as well as the trademark &quot;Ain't there one damn' song&quot; line.  Another great track is &quot;Fascination,&quot; featuring backing vocals by Ava Cherry and a very young Luther Vandross.  &quot;Can You Hear Me&quot; is one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard (as an aside - Bowie did a duet of this number with Cher on her variety show).  Bowie's cover of Lennon/McCartney's &quot;Across the Universe&quot; adds an interesting twist of angst to the love song.  Of course, &quot;Fame&quot; (backup vocals by John Lennon) is absolutely brilliant.  <br />Unlike many albums released today, &quot;Young Americans&quot; is consistently tight.  The mix of songs flows beautifully, and no cut disappoints.  I would consider this an essential in any well-balanced music collection.
B00000IFWE|4.0|Mixing quiet ballads with driving rockers is a Petty trademark, and this CD doesn't disappoint. Fun songs like \\"About to Give Out\\" with its mention of \\"Karaoke Kate\\" driving the crowd wild by \\"singing Delta Dawn\\" and the single-mindedness of \\"I Don't Wanna Fight\\" are balanced with the plaintive lyrics of \\"One More Day, One More Night\\" and other more thoughtful tunes. Petty has consistently shown an ability to discuss love and loss in a clear and concise fashion; this CD continues this legacy.
0790736918|5.0|John Wayne's finest hour, simply put. O ye of little faith in Duke's acting abilities: who else could have pulled this role off -- Ben Affleck? Brad Pitt? (Get my drift?) The world can be divided into two groups: those who think that Duke can act, and those who don't. It took me 40 years of livin' to realize that he could. Watch a John Wayne film with the sound off. Where do your eyes fall? On Duke. In short, he knew what he was doing up there, folks -- and so did John Ford, for that matter. This film, to me, really shows off Ford's genius in Putting the Camera Exactly Where It Belongs. The Cavalry Trilogy (etc.) are pleasures to watch -- stories aside -- because they are beautiful to behold. &quot;Did John Ford start out as a painter?&quot; my wife once asked. Orson Welles has more rewarding things to say about Ford's interior shots than I do, for sure. (And it seems to me that a lot of &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; is a tribute to Ford (who did his interior shots better than Welles). There. I said it!) Ah, but I drift, drift. I could never write a perfect review of &quot;The Searchers&quot; -- and Homer left Helen's beauty to your imagination. First viewing: great movie, but am I missing something? Second viewing: I think I'm getting it. Third viewing: eureka! (I also read a few articles in between 2 and 3.) Ethan's &quot;change of heart&quot; -- I can't see him talking about his every move before he makes it. Suspense. Maybe Ethan didn't know himself how he'd feel when/if he met up with his niece (or is it his niece). Wait and see. If someone spent 6 or 7 years searching for me, heck, I'd likely go with him or her too, no matter how welcome the &quot;Comanch&quot; made me feel. As reading Joyce's &quot;Ulysses&quot; taught me much on &quot;how to read a book,&quot; watching (reading) &quot;The Searchers&quot; taught me how to read a film. Many of today's films sadly aren't worth the reading. &quot;The Searchers&quot; takes effort to realize, and I guess people don't want to think to make the puzzle pieces fall into place. But what I like most about this film is that it's an unbridled journey into one man's soul; nothing is held back. Duke unleashed! He never made a better film. For those who don't like Vera Miles's performance: how the heck would YOU have acted? like a refined, urbane teenager? (Just how old was she?) Sure, 10 minutes could be shaved off this film, but let's not quibble. It's a Work of Art, and should be treated as such. A towering, if slightly flawed masterpiece by John Ford is better than most others' utter successes. Watch &quot;The Searchers,&quot; and tell others to do so.
0618135871|5.0|This is a work that is needle-sharp and poignant - and almost frightening in places. I read it in one sitting and was deeply moved. There is great tenderness and an aching acceptance of people and their confusions and inevitable weaknesses (and power) in it. Its several digressions (from its loose plot) are trenchant and valuable - and come as something of a pleasant surprise. As in so many of Roth's books several erotic themes predominate: they are Roth's currency, and  his way into his psyche, and into the hearts and minds of his interesting characters. (For example, Roth never confuses sex with food.) In this layered story Roth takes on sickness, aging, and impending death.  He intimately explores people who refuse to go quietly, who rail and protest and want to hang on to life and all of its exquisite pleasures - which for Roth, are frequently erotic. Rothian eros is so much more than sexual acts, but rather is so often at the heart of the matter, and the vantage point from which his readers might begin to understand the world. <br />A great book that is thoroughly worth reading.
B00005AFMT|5.0|Some think this is a good  bridge from old Crimson to the new, some thought Fripp &quot;sold out&quot; when they first heard this.  However, as a huge Red fan, I couldn't get enough of this album at the time, and it provided the soundtrack of my first year in NYC.<br />My best friend and I had just moved here and we learned Crimson was playing at the Savoy (a now-defunct concert hall).  It was the Discipline tour, marking Crimson's return after years of everyone thinking the band was a thing of the past.  Playing most of the album, and even selections from Red, my friend (a Fripp fanatic) and I were absolutely blown away.  We ran out and bought tickets for several of the shows.  For two wide-eyed youngsters who'd just moved to the Big City, seeing our heroes was a thrill you can't imagine.<br />I can't stress enough the technical brilliance here.  Each of the players in the band are phenomenal musicians.  Fripp and Belew do the kind of dueling banjos thing (excuse the comparison) while the rhythm section absolutely kicks butt.  Tony Levin is probably considered the greatest living bass player among the art-school crowd.  Just as Stanley Clarke was the king of Fusion, I'm sure it's Tony Levin in Art-Rock.  And Bruford's talents go without saying.  The line-up is basically four titans and the result is powerful!<br />Recently I gave this album a spin again when I was introducing it to a Gen-Y friend with similar musical sensibilities as my own.  As I was listening, I thought, &quot;you know, this is really polished.&quot; (thinking for that reason he wouldn't like it.)  And it's true.  If you like a more rough-hewn or lo-fi sound, you may not like this.  However I'm inclined to think that it's not due to any sort of studio trickery (because they sound exactly like this live) but rather because the playing is near perfection.
B0000508U6|5.0|Brilliant and self-assured, Coldplay's debut album never takes a misstep.  It holds together as both a unified work and a collection of singles, and there isn't a bad song in the bunch.  &quot;Parachutes&quot; is one of my favorite music purchases of the past several years, and I can't recommend it highly enough.
B00000IQC8|5.0|I loved the DVD &amp; Kevin Smith is great.  But I can totally understand why he didn't use the scenes he had cut from the movie.  Some of them just don't add to the movie, or they just completely bomb.
B00005LMBK|5.0|This is the sounds of a new generation. This cd has a voice,  And that voice is the sound of a new erra of pop-rock. I call this Dark pop. This cd pioneers the first in the real combination of Rap/Rock/Techno/ and soft poetry like ryhmes. With songs like &quot;clint eastwood&quot; and &quot;tommorow comes today&quot;, the others songs are up to par with these powerful singles. The  rap aspect is in this cd are when it needs to be, and does not drive the whole of the  cd's songs with heavy rap. The songs which do contain rap (&quot;clint eastwood&quot; and &quot;rock da house&quot;) only makes the cd stronger. The rest of the cd is a look into a  whole underground of dark pop. The soft rock is supported by mind-melding ryhmes , and lyrics that leave you thinking.  The cd does a justice to music. Join the dark pop and become one of the gorillaz.
0385486804|4.0|I gravitate toward non-fiction--memoirs, bios, history,  literary journalism.  I suppose the reason is because I've always felt that true life is stranger than fiction.  That said, I could not put this book down.<br />As someone who was just starting to enter my teens during the turbulent late 60's, and was consequently impacted by what I saw all around me, I can definitely relate to this youth's inner urgings to try and find himself, as misguided as it turned out to be.  Back then, taking off, hitchhiking around, squatting somewhere and &quot;living off the land&quot; was much more common among youths seeking a rite of passage than it is today.  The young man came around in the wrong decade.  <br />These days his behavior would be deemed aberrent by many and this is reflected in some of the attitudes of the people in the book, (mostly by Alaskans) plus in some of the reviews I've read here.  I cannot understand why any person's reaction to this story would be disgust or anger at the young man's unwise choices or apparent incompetence.  How many of us have done remarkably stupid things in our youths, and had to learn things the hard way?  Fortunately many of us didn't have to lose our lives in the process.  <br />Maybe it's because I too like Thoreau and Tolstoy; I just wouldn't go about trying to find myself in the manner he chose.  Also since I don't have any children, I'm not reading the story from that perspective.  I just wince when I read of people's reactions that McCandless was an insufferable idiot.  The kid paid the ultimate price for his mistakes, he should not be scorned, but pitied.

B000053VAF|4.0|I thought that the entire DVD package was great, but there was one small problem.  In the director's commentary about the movie, and the deleted scenes, Kevin Smith kept talking about a commercial that was supposed to be produced and inserted into the movie, but it was cut for time.  He said that they &quot;may&quot; put it on the DVD, but I've looked all over and can't find it.  I'm assuming it's not on the disc.  That's the only problem I have.

B000002HIK|5.0|One of the marks of an excellent album is that each song has a distinctive texture that complements the texture of each other song. And even though this is a complilation of early works, these songs complement each other perfectly. 'Acrid Avid Jam' is a laid-back piece of electronic lounge that will fill your head with visions of bridges and automatic highways. 'Ventolin' is punk music from 2025; the story of an asthma attack done with an analogue synth. 'Alberto Basalm'? excellent and worth the price of admission.
0060168366|5.0|This is the latest from Paul Johnson, joining such notables as Intellectuals, the Birth of the Modern, the History of Jews, the History of Christianity, Modern Times...they are all wonderful, enriching studies brimming with quirky little known facts and cemented with the author's European classically liberal outlook.<br />What makes all his works so thoroughly readable are the tales of individuals he weaves almost seamlessly into the flow.  We learn new things about Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, Kennedy, Eisenhower.  Plus we learn about the unknowns - that throng of individuals who made contributions to the society and material prosperity and intellectual freedom we enjoy today.<br />The Story of America is basically an optimistic work as he sees this country as an experiment still percolating new freedoms, material products and leading the world into an American future. He writes that the American people are probably the most pragmatic in the world, relying on experience and tradition rather than some new-fangled theory as Europeans are wont to do. This basic foundation serves as a bedrock for our nation - both culturally and societally.<br />If you want one book about America, this is the one to get!
B000002MP2|5.0|Look, I realize that some people have it in for Green Day.  They single-handedly drew every suburban white kid with musical inclinations into the &quot;punk&quot; genre, and in that process gave rise to the present-day wave of it (bands such as Blink 182, Fenix TX, Lit, and Sum 41 owe them a tremendous debt). However, before you write this off as garbage, listen to each track.  Each one has an impressive hook, amazing rhythm, and an out-and-out shortness and sweetness that accomplishes a lot for a 29 minute record.  I don't know if the planets aligned back in 1994, but for some reason everyone had the urge to go out and buy this CD.  It's sold something along the lines of eleven million copies.  Believe it or not, high school kids between the ages of 16-18 will probably mark this as the first record they purchased.  It was my first CD, and every kid seemed to go through a phase where their favorite band was of course, Green Day.  People will look back on this and laugh, certainly people have moved on to other things, but eight years ago this was as good as it got.<br />I wouldn't be surprised if the kids maybe three or four years younger than me will look back this fondly on Blink 182's &quot;Enema of the State.&quot;  I have as much disdain for that CD as any self-respecting grunge rocker of 1994 must have had for these guys.  Still, for all the talk about this being immature music, there's a period in your life when you're so blatantly immature that anything serious seems stupid.  For people still locked in that epoch, I'd say this album is exactly what you need.
B000002LQR|5.0|BSSM is a great album, it's chalked full of well composed funk rock.  This album is highly enjoyable and very katchy, I discoverd this album at my friend's house, and i havent been able to put it down since! The thing I love most about BSSM is their high energy sound.  I have had this c.d. for about three years now and i still listen to it on a regular basis.<BR>One thing that I also love about BSSM is that there is a lot of it. With seventeen songs this album runs for about 1hour and 15 minutes. The only thing better about great music is a lot of it.<BR>Onother thing that's intresting is that when BSSM was released in '92 it was groung breaking, RHCP has a sound that not many bands have.  In todays modern day music most of the rock-rap or heavy metal sounds all the same.  RHCP are so talented at what they do, that no other band dares to emulate there sound.<BR>One of my favorite song's on this album Naked in the RAIN.  It  is a high energy funk song with awesome bass line's. Just about every song on cd is great. My advice is to not pass this album bye. The songs are all very enjoyable and very fun to listen to. A real bargain for your money, so buy it!!!
B00003CXP0|4.0|It is a strange thing to hear that this is a film about drugs;  actually, it is about anything you may dream of, like being a  celebrity or getting rich, and that is why this film is so harrowing and shocking, and to some, irritating.  It is a cliche  now after so many reviews to say that &quot;Requiem&quot; is a requiem for any  American dreams, but it is an inevitable feeling you get.  Anyway, that's how I think.<br />So, please do not think &quot;Requiem&quot; is just another &quot;Trainspotting&quot; because the latter has a sense of humor while &quot;Requiem&quot; gives almost nothing of that.  You will be  attacked relentlessly by variety of cameraworks, so in the end  you will feel really, really, exhausted.  And the acting  is all compelling; I would not dwell on it too long, but just  let me say, Marlon Wayans is so good that you forgive him for appearing in &quot;Scary Movie,&quot; and some film about dragons (though I liked it) and about Ellen Burstyn, she proves again that she is one of the most talented actresses in the world.  But you already know that for she survived the now legendary shooting of &quot;The Exocist.&quot; <br />Having said that, I point out several things that you don't want to hear.  Though &quot;Requiem&quot; is a fascinating ride to hell, director Darren Arnofsky shows, I think, too much visual tactics; for instance, the close-up of an eye (you can see that on the video jacket) and its pupil appears more than 5 times (I lost count), but the repetition is too much and unnecesary.  Of  course I know the point, his stress on the addiction of drugs,  but the repeated use of the same skill is generally bound to  lose its effects, and this film is the case.     The other thing I complain (though a minor one) is, we have seen  the same kind of story before, and though Jared Leto - Marlon  Wayans story is gripping, I couln't help remembering the masterpieces of the past; Al Pacino's &quot;The Panic in Needle Park&quot;  is the first to come up in my mind, and Jon Voights's &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot; next, and probably &quot;Scarecrow.&quot;  I don't say &quot;Requiem&quot;  is not good, but for those old fans like me, the comparison is  inevitable, and probably that is why Ellen Burstyn falling down  into her own fantasy world got deservedly Oscar nonimation while  the other story, though compelling itselfand, got less good  reviews.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I've always maintained that music is subjective, and there can be no absolute scale for rating it, as it will mean different things to different people.  Having said that, I give my highest accolades to Amnesiac as I have with other Radiohead works.  I will not attempt to &quot;rate&quot; the songs per se, but merely give a bit of objective info about them.<br />The album kicks off with the unconventional &quot;Packt...&quot; which sees the vocalist insisting &quot;Get off my case&quot; through a catchy, percussive, organ backed dance beat.  This flows into &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, the infamous odd-metered, piano driven opus which seems to have quite many references to ancient Egyptian culture (yes aside from the title).  Then comes &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot;.  The symbolic nature of doors is echoed through Thom's distorted, broken voice in this drum-dominated song.  Next is &quot;You and Whose Army&quot;, a song that starts with a slow, piano backed, sofly sung intro, but erupts as the full band/orchestra kicks in for a powerful ending.  There is a reference to the Holy Roman Empire (as is there one on the packaging to the LE).  Then comes &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, a somewhat conventional, guitar driven tune with a sinister undertone.  &quot;Knives Out&quot; follows with undeniably Radiohead chord progressions voiced distinctly through acoustic and electric guitars.  &quot;Amnesiac/Morning Bell&quot; is a completely redone version of the Kid A track.  It has a much slower, less methodical, more sonically thick tone backed by warm organ tones.  In &quot;Dollars and Cents&quot;, a song that paints a bleak image of capitalism, the early rhythm is provided by the bass and a cowbell, but this song gradually builds and the drums come in near the end with Thom screaming &quot;We are the dollars &amp; cents and the Pounds and Pence&quot;.  Next comes &quot;Hunting Bears&quot;, the beginning of the end.  This instrumental features a single harsh guitar riffed against a dissonant bass line.  In &quot;Like Spinning Plates&quot;, a sound blip sounding like a plate or disc spinning very fast plays in the background as Thom sings backwards at the beginning.  More conventional instruments enter as he cries &quot;And this just feels like spinning plates.&quot;  To close is &quot;Life in a Glass House&quot; which has been heavily redone from earlier versions and turned into a tragic quasi-jazz number.  This powerful piece features many wind instrumentalists, including a veteran jazz trumpeter.  The chorus, in which Thom wails, &quot;Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat... but someone's listening in&quot; is packed with riffs from the various parts and the song ultimately ends on a sad tone.<br />If you're willing to put in a few listens on this album, you will find that it is some incredible music and will never leave your soul (not to mention CD wallet).
0812550706|5.0|I thought that this was one of the best books I have ever read. I was assigned this book for my English class and I thought the usual: &quot;This book is going to be a drag!&quot; But, when I started reading the first page, I found myself drawn into Andrew Wiggin's mind. I &quot;watched&quot; him conquer his fears, prove his worth, and live out his childhood. It was an intense feeling! If you like books that give vivid enough details to be able to watch the story play out in your mind, then this is definitely the book for you! I don't think I have read a book by any other author, where I was able to picture the events so thoroughly and accurately, then I do when I read Scott's novel.
0671034065|5.0|Mr. Perfect was the best book I have read in a long time. I seriously did not want it to end. This book made me laugh out loud, cry and scared. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good romance story that is not set back in the way back when days. This is a book I will read over and over again.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I have written some reviews here on amazon, most of the times i have given the cd's 4 or 5 stars. But that is until i heard Sigur Ros. This music is completely amazing. Even though it is a bit alternative music i am positive that most people would like this. The special voice of the singer and off course the language, icelandic..knowbody knows whats he his singing, but who cares. The beautiful gitar sounds and all other elements included, listening to this cd is a journey. Though the whole album is very complete and all the songs fit together there are a few songs that really really stands out. The beatufil and slow 'Starálfur', the singels 'Svefn-G-Englar' and the darker 'ny-Batteri' and 'olsen olsen'. This probably haven't been the best or the most critical review, but if you listen to the cd i think you too will find it hard to actually write a review of it. As the title says..words isn't enough..
B00000IL1K|5.0|The first time I was exposed to Sarah Brightman's work was when I was sixteen. I'm seventeen now and find it strange how but a year ago I couldn't bare to listen to &quot;Eden,&quot; and how it made me cringe when she reached those high notes. But now, in fact, I do quite the opposite. I suppose being so young and so limited to what kind of music was presenting itself on mainstream radio that, in effect, it really blocked my ears to some amazing genres. I know it sounds a bit extreme, but the beautiful Ms. Brightman really did open many doors for me to discovering new, exciting music I didn't know existed until now. I used to generally listen to nothing but Alternative rock (which I still do), but now I've moved on to stretch my horizon of eclectic tastes. And &quot;how&quot; she did this, you ask? Because she's almost every genre in itself! I personally feel that &quot;La Luna&quot; showcases her diverse sense of sound better than &quot;Eden,&quot; which is either pop or opera, but she's also very talented in creating other types of music such as rock (Fly), ethereal pop (Dive), pure opera and Broadway (The Andrew Loyde Webber Collection), and even jazz and new age, which is conveyed best on the songs &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot; and &quot;Scarborough Fair&quot; from her &quot;La Luna&quot; Cd. What can I say? I am constantly amazed by her persistence of reinvention. It's always a surprise with her. You just never know what she's going to do next, and that suits me just fine. You never have to worry about her being redundant, dull or boring. Oh no... I personally feel that more opera singers should make the departure from same old aria after aria into the wonderful world of classical-crossover.<br />Now, true; in &quot;Eden&quot; Sarah uses her upper register more often than her normal voice, but--take this from a person who listens to heavy rock bands like Tool.... You don't have to be an opera-buff to live through this. It's like walking through &quot;Paradisum&quot; and ending up in &quot;Eden.&quot;<br />&quot;So Many Things&quot; (the third track which she wrote herself) is a short, soft ballad about her divorce with ex-husband Andrew Loyde Webber. And entailing that is my all-time favorite: &quot;Anytime, Anywhere,&quot; which mixes both classical vocals with pop. Then comes the first traditional piece: &quot;Bailero&quot; which is very soothing and sedating, almost making your eyes drift shut until a cover of Kansas's &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; rocks you like a storm. (Now don't let ANYBODY convince you that this song is corny, because it's anything BUT that!) And.... well I'm not going to go through every song, but the gospel-like &quot;Deliver Me&quot; is a beautiful pop addition, and &quot;Il Mio Cuore Va (My Heart Will Go On)&quot; is just as lovely, if not more, than Celine's version. Some of my favorites, though, would have to be Un Jour Il Viendra, Only An Ocean Away--which is a heartfelt ballad--and Nessun Dorma, which was made for a tenors voice but, like magic, was sung by an angelic soprano known as Sarah Brightman. But rest assure. No matter what your musical tastes are like, almost anyone can squeeze a little Sarah in. That is until you're ready for more....t; and ending up in &quot;Eden.&quot; <br />&quot;So Many Things&quot; (the third track which she wrote herself) is a short, soft ballad about her divorce with ex-husband Andrew Loyde Webber.

0345360338|5.0|The title of Sharon Kay Penman's novel is taken from T.S. Eliot's &quot;The Hollow Men&quot;, an apt borrowing, as Penman's novel presents us with the hollowest of them all--Henry III--and Simon de Montfort as the man who opposes his empty-headedness to his own death.  Not that Eliot had Henry III in mind.  But Simon de Montfort's life was not a vain sacrifice.  Nor was he the stereotypical hero in shining armor.<br />Simon de Montfort was arrogant, domineering, cunning, and pragmatic; he was pious, occasionally self-righteous, and impatient with those who couldn't keep up with him.  That said, Penman breathes magnificent life into him, making him a man who follows his heart wherever it leads--and it leads him headlong into danger.  From seducing King Henry's sister Nell, who married him in spite of having vowed her life to chastity, to calling Henry an idiot who deserved to be incarcerated for the rest of his life, Simon gives in to emotion and impulse.  And yet he is a passionate husband to Nell, a loving father to his children, a loyal friend, and an implacable enemy to Henry III, a man who only became King through the accident of birth.<br />The book is long; the language is well-woven but rich rather than heavy.  If you can bear the ending (&quot;the murder of Evesham, for battle it was none&quot;), you will not be able to part with the book at all.
B00003CXRM|4.0|This movie was kind of strange but then again so are most of the Cohen brother's movies.  It's no &quot;Raising Arizona&quot; but that is pretty hard to live up to.  It kept me entertained and although it wasn't laugh out loud funny, I liked it.  The soundtrack was a hoot!
B000002U9Y|4.0|For Pink Floyd's second album problems has risen to much in the band with there frontman Syd Barrett.  He was obviously in no condition to continue on with pink floyd so they had the brilliant David Gilmour step in his place.  Syd's condition got so bad that he couldn't even finish the album.  He is on possibly half of the album the rest of it is saved with David Gilmour.  This album is not quite as good as the masterpiece debut but it does have certain charms.  The opener Let there be more light starts of with a great rythmical guitar line buildiong up with percusion, keyboards, bass and finally we get into the song.  Remember a Day a good tune by wright which I hear he is not proud of because of the fact when Syd left they all had to start writing the songs for themselves and were very naive on how to do since syd wrote most of Piper.  Set the controls is ok but sounds way better when they played it Live at Pompeii.  Corporal Clegg is a song not very many people like and I have also heard Rick Wright say this is god awful.  All the kazoo noises with the salvation army background and the lyrics aren't great either.  It's probobly good that the band left this one alone and din't play it live.  The title track is pretty good but not nearly as good as it is at Pompeii.  I was pretty disapointed with it.  And of course we get to the end of the album where it syd's swan song for pink floyd.  Jugband Blues is neither jugband or blues but it has the classic Syd Barrett that we all know and love. Jugband is definetly one which is a great treasure on this album.  This album was kind of put together sloppily but the band was trying the best to keep it together by replacing there front man for good. And this begins the next chapter for Pink Floyd.  Not as good as The Piper at the Gates of Dawn or the latter albums but still a must have.
B00005LB50|5.0|Ever since I first heard that this box set was on the way, I have continually scanned the record store bins and the Atlantic and Elektra websites for information, feeling mild disappointment and resignation that nothing had yet appeared.  So when the E-mail from Amazon.com came to let me know that &quot;Box Set's&quot; release was imminent, naturally I was excited and relieved.<br />And happy to see that I am not, for the most part, disappointed with the box's content.  I said for the most part:  I agree with the other reviewers that the &quot;week-long&quot; psychedelic freakout version of &quot;Bluebird&quot; and the Neil Young vocal on &quot;Down to the Wire&quot; are glaring omissions.  We can always hope, of course, for a rarities disc that may correct these errors, and that will be a legitimate release rather than a bootleg.  If anyone from Rhino Records sees my review, please heed my request!  The only other places these tracks can be found is, in the case of the latter track, on &quot;Decade,&quot; which could do with a remix and remastering job itself, and in the case of the former, I had to search on Napster to find the track...and we all know what's happened to Napster in recent days.  (And yes, I am aware of the presence of Audiogalaxy Satellite, Aimster, Gnutella and the rest...but I digress.)<br />The demos are real treats on this box.  It's interesting to see which songs never made it past the drawing board (the very earliest demos like &quot;Hello, I've Returned&quot; and &quot;There Goes My Babe,&quot; and later tunes like &quot;Words I Must Say&quot; and &quot;So You've Got a Lover,&quot; any of which could easily be plundered by an itinerant acoustic performer seeking rare songs to introduce to the public, much as Dylan's catalogue was plundered); also to see how other songs developed through stages (&quot;Down Down Down,&quot; of course, began life as the melodic base that evolved into &quot;Broken Arrow,&quot; including some of the lyrical content, and was later reworked into a song suite that appeared on the first CSN&amp;Y LP, &quot;Deja Vu&quot;; &quot;The Rent is Always Due&quot; was the work in progress that finally became &quot;I Am a Child&quot;), and others that, though fully fleshed out, didn't quite pass the audition (&quot;Neighbor Don't You Worry&quot; and &quot;We'll See,&quot; both good tracks featured as demos and final mixes that were finally excluded from the official LP masters of the first album and &quot;Again&quot;).<br />And of course, it's eye-opening to hear the original versions of songs that appeared later in their writers' careers:  Furay's &quot;My Kind of Love,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;What a Day,&quot; all of which appeared on the first Poco album...and I actually like these originals, prefer them to the later versions.  Young's &quot;Old Laughing Lady,&quot; which appeared on his first solo LP, is much shorter here (as demos will be).  Also notable is the fact that the vast majority of the tracks on the first three discs are mono mixes.  They actually sound closer to what the band originally intended.<br />Finally, I noted the programming of the first LP on the fourth disc; this is actually the April 1967 reissue, with &quot;For What It's Worth&quot; tacked on as the opening track, replacing &quot;Baby Don't Scold Me&quot; from the December 1966 release (although this latter track is included as a bonus track).  &quot;Leave&quot; originally appeared as track 3, side 1 of the 12/66 release; on the 4/67 reissue, it's track 4, side 2.  And it's good to have both albums mixed at a level that sounds good.  (I had copied the 12/66 album from Elektra's '97 reissue CD featuring both versions of the first LP, and the original CD release of &quot;Again,&quot; to a MiniDisc, and noted the difference in sound level.)<br />This is quite likely the best box set that's been released in years.  Highly recommended.nt, and was later reworked into a song suite that appeared on the first CSN&amp;Y LP, &quot;Deja Vu&quot;; &quot;The Rent is Always Due&quot; was the work in progress that finally became &quot;I Am a Child&quot;), and others that, though fully fleshed out, didn't quite pass the audition (&quot;Neighbor Don't You Worry&quot; and &quot;We'll See,&quot; both good tracks featured as demos and final mixes that were finally excluded from the official LP masters of the first album and &quot;Again&quot;).<br />And of course, it's eye-opening to hear the original versions of songs that appeared later in their writers' careers:  Furay's &quot;My Kind of Love,&quot; &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; and &quot;What a Day,&quot; all of which appeared on the first Poco album...and I actually like these originals, prefer them to the later versions.

0792833201|5.0|As you may or may not know from my other reviews, I love films, pure and simple. Regardless of the subject matter, a good film is a good film. This happens to be a great film in the horror genre. It still astounds me that this film is PG, because if this film was released today, I am sure it would be hard R or NC-17 for intensity. If the MPAA can grill Wes Craven for making Scream too intense, this film will redefine the word for you. This film, I feel might just be the scariest film of all time. There are alot of great horror films out there and a lot of crap, but this film dares to get under your skin in the ways Something Wicked This Way Comes does or The Watcher in the Woods. The mood regresses you into a child state and a child's point of view towards horror and subconsiously we are forced to relive our own nightmares while viewing this film. It begins unforgetably and epicly with the Star Spangled Banner and contines bit after bit building suspense and humanity within the characters and us that by the time the film erupts in a frenzy of terror, we are drained and tired and scared to the bone. Closets devour children so do trees. Clowns attack and drag you under the bed. In the bathroom at night, a feeling comes over you and you feel the need to rip your face off. Demons jumping out of the closet, fathers being told to threaten to hit their children, maggots, dwarf women, etc--image after image is so frightening and yet clouded in a suburben neighborhood trying to lend credence that this is normal. At night in the dark, this film starts strobing on the walls with the flickering tv and puts one in a mood that makes you realize how tame so many of todays horror films are. This film was PG, so was Gremlins and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom--all were oversaw by Spielberg and all were reasons the PG 13 now exists, though by today's standards these films would be R if not NC-17. What terrible times we live in.
1878424319|1.0|1.  This book is supposed to be about ideas derived from Toltec mysticism but aside from a few vocabulary words (mitote, for example) you don't learn much of anything about the Toltec or what they believed.  Ruiz starts by using the Toltec beliefs as an introduction on what he means by the term &quot;agreement&quot;, but it appears he did it completely out of a need to make what he is saying sound credible and new.  But in all reality he doesn't really offer anything new, nor does he sound that credible.  His generalizations and promises (If you do this...this IS going to happen) sound more like a car salesman then a mystic.  <br />2.  The 4 Agreements are just that: agreements because almost every world religion agrees with Ruiz and puts forth some form of the four agreements in their dogma.  &quot;Always do your best&quot;?  I heard that one from my little league coach who's  wisdom was about as abundant as ice cubes are in hell.  I mean the stuff in the pages of the book are just platitude after platitude.  I am really shocked that I have heard good things from so many people about the book.  I have to be honest and say that i have lost some respect for the people who have suggested this book to me. Of course I don't have any problem telling them that they lost respect because they know &quot;not to take anything personal&quot;.   I mean...its like they watched sesame street and declared it the most profound thing on television.  Not that the truth has to be complex either but Ruiz has actually ruined the wisdom of the agreements by taking them too far and going from one extreme to another.<br />3.  The book is illogical and anyone with a healthy degree of skepticism is going to see that the book is irrational.  Take for example the third agreement:  &quot;Don't make assumptions&quot;.  Assumptions are not evil and very neccesary just to wake up in the morning  (gotta assume you aren't still asleep and dreaming right? of course ruiz will tell you that you are still dreaming); as a matter of fact you cannot read his book without making assumptions.  You have to assume Ruiz isn't just some lazy schiester who wanted to make a few extra bucks, and recycled a little mother's wit and marketed it as ancient wisdom.  You have to make the assumption that you understand the writer clearly and that he knew exactly how to express himself.  Don't get me wrong...there is a time and a place for everything but a time and a place to NOT do things.  The author does make a strong point for why assumptions get people into trouble, but we all know this.  Every episode of Seinfeld teaches what happens when we make assumptions.  the problem is that its not that easy.  We have to assume the sun is going to rise tomorrow or we won't plant corn and we will go hungry.  We have to assume that rain and inclement weather will come or we don't build shelter and we suffer.  We don't KNOW anything.  <br />4. Back to the people who find this book enlightening and life-changing...People want life simple.  They don't want complexities and nuances and uniqueness.  They want a simple moral code that they can print on a 3 by 5 card and use in every situation without having to think or feel fear or hesitation.  Just like the Bible, Torah, and Koran cannot be taken literally neither can The Four Agreements. (On a personal note I find this book to be very much like the Bible, Koran, and Torah  in one sense.  If you seek to argue with someone over the validity of the book...it contradicts itself enogh to give you plenty of evidence.)The first agreement asks you to be perfect (impeccable with my word and thought?) Sure it might be impossible, but its easy to remember eh?  The truth is that there is wisdom behind what Ruiz is saying but Ruiz fails to mention that its not really possible to be impeccable on a constant basis...the nature of us being human dictates that we cannot be perfect much less maintain perfection.  (perhaps it is possible to be perfect in some regard, but i have yet to meet a reader of this book who has accomplished it and I have a feeling that person would stand out to me).  Anyway, it just strikes me that people gravitate towards a book like the four agreements because they want it all easy.  And Ruiz gives them what they want.  People also have a habit of believing that the truly wise people all lived long ago...and died out...and that no modern belief system is worth paying attention to...and so they turn to an ancient belief systems with a blind faith that this ancient  belief system (which by the way was later replaced by Catholocism in the case of the Toltec in Mexico) is somehow superior...but the wonderful people who were using it at the time decided to let it fade to obscurity...and we modern folks are the only people smart enough to see what a mistake it was to let go of these ancient belief systems.  Hogwash.  Let that assumption go and you will being doing better than any dolt carrying around this book like its the New Age Bible.  I have a simple thought for everyone who reads this book:  All generalities are false.  I know its a paradox...but keep it in mind because Ruiz makes generalization after genaralization.  He sounds like a cocky 17 year old who has it all figured out.  &quot;All you have to do is never take anything personal.&quot;   Yeah right Donnie.  (Personal note:  As an African American man I am glad someone took slavery personal).<br />5.  Ruiz is just not a good writer.  I can tell his editor tried to keep it readable but this guy just doesn't have what it takes to convey what might be his personal thoughts in a way that make them seem unique.  its like he doesn't know how to use his individual experience to really bring forth his perspective and instead just comes off like Moses reading the ten commandments almost as if they aren't even his words.  Ruiz is probably a wise man but his ability to communicate his wisdom is limited.  I mean, who uses Forrest Gump as an example in their book?  Of all the real people who you can allude to when making a point, you pick a fictional character who was unbelievably unaware as an example of how we should try to be.  Talk about dropping the ball.  There is a small part of me that maybe thinks Ruiz intended for the book to be bad...like he is parodizing the whole new age movement.  He did a wonderful job if this is the case.
B000000XCD|5.0|Green River has always been a album that brings back fond memories for me. I first bought it on 8 track in 69 when it came out and it had &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, on the tape twice.  I still remember the first time that I heard &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;.  I just stopped what I was doing and listened to the song. Not many songs have gotten my attention that way. Those were definitely turbulant times and this album helped lighten the mood. For those of you who were there and to those who weren't, I would highly recommend this album as one of CCR's best.
B000000OE7|5.0|This was the first Queen CD I got after the &quot;Classic Queen&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CDs.  I've since picked up most of the rest.  In my opinion, it's one of their best.  Of the Queen CDs I have, it's one of the three I play straight through without skipping a track.  It ranks right behind &quot;Innuendo&quot; in my opinion.<br />I'd suggest not over-analyzing which song came from which solo album; listen to it on its own merits, the results are what count.  This is powerful stuff, especially if you know how some of the tracks were recorded.  It can bring a tear (or three) to your eyes.<br />I've since picked up the &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; CD, and so have heard the previous version of a couple of the tracks.  Hearing the two versions, you can hear how much more powerful they became with the full Queen treatment.  <br />My suggestion: play the samples on the web page, and if you like what you hear, buy it.
079073463X|5.0|This is the sort of film \\"they don't make any more\\" but really should. In Ladyhawke, horses just don't gallop or trot, they prance. The story, based upon a Medieval legend of a pair of cursed lovers-a knight who is a wolf by night, and a lady who is a hawk by day-is gorgeous to watch, not just for the fine acting, but for the wonderful Italian countryside. Rutger Hauer is a starwart as Etienne of Navarre, a man who can fight off battlions of the Bishop's Guards one moment, just ache so heartbreakingly for his lost love the next. Michelle Pfieffer, as Isabeau of Anjou, comports herself with touching vunerability, yet with a strength which sometimes takes ones breath away. And then, as now, hers is an etherial beauty for which men would go to war. Even Matthew Broderick, as the comedy relief thief Phillipe the Mouse, can bring a smile or a tear with equal ease. His charector oftentimes seems on the edge of madness as he slowly realizes what he had gotten himself into by escaping the dungeons of Aquiela. And the last scenes, with the battle in the Church, and the final confrontation with the evil bishop (and gentlemen, upon getting married, how would you like to see Michelle Pfieffer down the aisle?) is the big payoff. I wish this one had a sequal, if only so that I could see what happened next to these wonderful charectors.<br /><br />(...)
0393312836|5.0|'A Clockwork Orange' is the fourth Anthony Burgess novel I've read (after 'One Hand Clapping', 'The Doctor is Sick', and 'The Wanting Seed'), which is strange since 'A Clockwork Orange' is undoubtedly Burgess's most famous novel (thanks in no small part to the film adaptation).  I was hesitent in tackling 'A Clockwork Orange' because I knew it contained many invented expressions by the author and, I feared, it would make for difficult reading.  Thankfully my fears were unjustified.<br />Firstly, as most everyone knows 'A Clockwork Orange' is a futuristic story about a sadistic teenager causing havoc with his equally disturbing mates.  His behaviour is vile, with this futuristic society being portrayed as an ultra-violent hell.  Fortunately he is caught, imprisoned, then undergoes 'treatment' to cure him of his violent obsessions.  The story flows well, with both the characterizations and the description of this future world being very believable.<br />However it is Burgess's creative use of inventive gang-land slang which makes this book most memorable.  Of course initially it is all rather confusing, but after a bit it is rather easy to follow.  One is simply left over-awed at the author's ability to get away with such creativity - I imagine his publishers (back in the early 1960s) were rather disturbed at Burgess's creation.<br />Bottom line: violent, shocking and unforgettable.  While not for the squeamish, most everyone will be impressed with 'A Clockwork Orange' - regardless if they've seen the film.
B00000JCB2|4.0|Wow, what hits, rap gets a metal sound, experimentation leads to a crossover hit CD. There are several radio ready rap / rock hits, including N2 Gether Now, Re-Arranged and several big metal songs perfect for a live crowd or just listening at home like Nookie, I'm Broke, Show Me What You Got, and 9 teen 90 nine. The CD is a step into experimentation as singer Fred Durst takes on work with other musicians like Method Man (N2 Gether Now), John Davis (No Body Like You) and others, but Durst does not live off of them, he gels quite nicely with each guest on the CD to make a brand new sound. No Sex also offers a great look at Durst's remorse for some of the sexual acts he has done with girls best avoided. DJ Lethal offers some of the best beats that I have ever heard in the interludes and especially in the Outro track. The only downfall is that it sags with all 10 of the 30-second interludes. Over an hour of good stuff.
6302814359|2.0|That this poorly conceived sequel was from the man who made the excellent aquatic zombie thriller Shock Waves (aka Death Corps) makes it all the more painful to watch.  There are a few humorous moments that play off the first (and so superior) movie, my favorite being a dialogue exchange from the first movie recreated word for word (with the same actors), just the setting and emotional delivery is different.  Nice touch there, too bad the rest of the movie is not as sly and inventive.  It's just another painfully unfunny/unscary 'horror/comedy'.
B00004SX0T|5.0|Well, for those of you wondering what an import has that you don't already have, this review will focus on what you don't have. First off, the CD is great, then second within the jewel case there is a bonus disc, containing four tracks. Break Stuff which is already on the album. You get a new track called Crushed, their first hit Faith and finally a remix of Counterfeit which sounds better than the original with a new melody backing Fred's vocals. Finally, there is a huge CD Extra when you put it into your CD ROM, four videos, that are not full screen. The unfortunate thing about the videos is the lyrics are edited (no swears, no middle fingers like on MTV). There is an additional few seconds on each video from the originals on MTV, making this a true collector's item. Five star import all the way, one of the best imports in the world.

B000007MVX|5.0|The LP was a wonder, including a short booklet reminiscent of a playbill (intended effect!), and the piece THWLHS splits the recording into the two sides.  Although I don't play it anymore (can't!) I still keep this as well as the concert program from the APP Tour.<br />I could describe this as the others have, but suffice it to say, tastes have changed over the years.  Still some things improve with age - if only the appreciation for the past moment as it &quot;blipped past on the radar screen we call life.<br />APP is like a 1989 Silver Oaks Cabernet from Napa.  Subtle textures, amusing aroma, fresh, introspective finish.<br />Enjoy it.  In all modern music, there are none quite as rare or satisfying.<br />Keep on rockin', Ian!

B00005ATQI|4.0|All those years, you thought you were married to a fairly normal guy with a few problems here and there, then all of a sudden, you find out he's a NUT!  I could not have cared less about the axe... If the thought of stumbling upon pages and pages and pages of what you thought was blood sweat and tears of your spouse's work only to find that all it says is ALL WORK AND NO PLAY MAKES JACK A DULL BOY doesn't scare the pants off you, I don't know what does!  THAT alone was the scariest part of the film.  I had the same scared reaction to WHAT LIES BENEATH.  For me it's the whole psychology thing, not the bloody violence and &quot;Oh there's an axe murderer after me&quot;...  It's the realization that someone who was so close to you, that you OBVIOUSLY thought you knew turns out to be a first class freak...AND wants to kill you to boot...
0783240287|5.0|The title says it all. I have never seen a movie as utterly perfect as this. The characters, mainly Donny Osmond, Maria Friedman, and Robert Torti, are completely and totally enthralling! They all play their parts with such exuberance and life that you will never want to take your eyes off them. The songs are amazingly quirky and catchy-- you'll be singing them EVERYWHERE you go! And the over-all quality is awesome. You will not be disappointed you bought this DVD. Especially take note to watch the Go, Go, Go Joseph behind the scenes documentary. (only available on the DVD) It has a lot of fun interviews and stuff like that that any Joseph fan will not want to miss.
B0000033P2|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of all time. Elp at their best!!
B000002J09|1.0|Yes I know some people gave this album five stars but I've  seen some five star reviews for the movie Howard The Duck here. I urge everyone not to believe people saying how great this album is. I think it's AWFUL. When I first heard it in 1986 I thought it was awful and fifteen years later I still do. Buy something else.
0380002930|5.0|No one can resist a good adventure.  I was a little apprehensive of reading a book that had a rabbit on the cover, but I'm so glad I read it.  Not only it is a adventure, Adams brings in elements of teamwork, hierarchy of leadership, and problem-solving during crisis.  It's almost like a business seminar.  I fell in love with the rabbits that we followed from page 1 and I felt like I was on the roller coaster with them.  It's a simply heartwarming adventure of rabbits who have to leave home and deal with life in the real world.  It does not matter if these are rabbits or turtles or humans, the story applies to everyone.
B00003CXA4|4.0|I have to say that when I first saw this movie in 1982, I liked it a fair amount. However, since then I read Gandhi's autobiography (The Story of my Experiments with Truth), and when I saw the movie again recently it suffered a lot by comparison. Is it still a good movie? Yes. Does Ben Kingsley deserve praise? Yes. But, and it is a big one, does it capture the essence of Gandhi? and I have to answer NO. I think anyone who reads the book must agree with this.<br />If you know little about Gandhi or if you just enjoy good acting and if you liked &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; then you will  probably like this movie. I understand that to capture a man like Gandhi on film is not a task for the faint-hearted, and Attenborough deserves praise for the effort. I am giving it four stars mainly for that reason. If, after watching the movie, you feel interested in learning more about Gandhi, I urge you very sincerely to borrow or buy a copy of his autobiography.<br />I do plan to buy the DVD version when it comes out, because I see it includes some rare newsreel footage of the Mahatma.
6302719631|2.0|You forget how important sound is to a film until you've heard it done badly.  The music is so horrible that it ruins the entire film.
B00005NRO3|1.0|Not a  review as such more of an observation.<br />having bought Scream 2 already and the box set what on earth is there to get now. Surely  a collector is the person who buys the movie when it first hits the stores ? Maybe not - maybe a  collector means they know you will buy the same film again and again and can keep releasing different editions. Maybe that's why I now have two copies of Seven , terminator 2, Scream (trilogy ) and the Exorcist... naughty naughty
B00005BL2A|4.0|Those who loved &quot;Violator&quot; will enjoy &quot;Exiter&quot;. Just like other big bands (REM and U2) with their latest release, Depeche Mode seems to take a step back and return to a previously used formula. Some will be left with the impression of &quot;déjà vu&quot;, others will enjoy it happily. I'm part of the second category.<br />My personal highlights would be &quot;Dream on&quot;, &quot;When the body speaks&quot;, an hypnotic ballad showing some fragility, &quot;Comatose&quot;, where I find some traces of the 80's DM, built on nice rhythm changes and vocal twists, &quot;I feel loved&quot;, almost danceable (Saint Martin and Dave forgive me), the sad story of &quot;Breathe&quot; that I find musically close to &quot;Death doors&quot; and &quot;Walking in my shoes&quot; and the almost tender &quot;Goodnight lovers&quot;. The orchestrals &quot;Love theme&quot; and &quot;Easy Tiger&quot; bring some fresh air between two songs. Dave Gahan sings better than ever and Martin L. Gore writes about his favourites themes. <br />This is maybe not the masterpiece a fan is always expecting, but it is worth every cent. A welcomed return in good shape.
B00001U0DP|5.0|The first half of this film merrily leads you down a road of light, fluffy comedy - then with little warning it seamlessly melds into a deeply moving tale of a father's love for his wife and son, all held prisoner in a Nazi concentration camp. It would have been easy for this odd and daring approach not to work, but director, co-author and star Roberto Benigni has created one of the most touching films ever made. To appreciate this film fully, you should be aware of a film Jerry Lewis made in 1972, The Day the Clown Cried, ridiculed by critics and public alike (although it's never been seen by any of them). It's based on a similar premise, but it's locked in Lewis's vault, unreleased. Life is Beautiful is testament that Lewis's unseen and prematurely shunned film is a legitimate premise and could well be a great movie, as far as anybody knows. But until the day may come that Lewis decides to share his film with us, you won't do better than the flawless mastery that is Life is Beautiful.
0671027573|5.0|This book was great!!  I can't wait to read more of Linda Howard's books.  I instantly fell in love with Jaine and Sam.  I loved that they didn't jump in the sack immediately (like most books do) and they had a fun relationship every woman would envy.  The suspence was EXCELLENT with a neat little &quot;twist&quot; to it.  It's definately worth checking out.
0767849493|4.0|As a student at a Catholic high school I heard nothing but bitter diatribes against this movie for months and I have to say that this made me want to see it even more. Anyone who, like me, believes Smith can do no wrong will undoubtedly enjoy this movie for his classic tongue-in-cheek humor.  I have to say that the issues raised in the movie-the role of women in the Church, overelaborate hierarchy and ceremonies that border on superstition and Jesus' race amoung others- are valid questions .... Aside from the considerable hype, you don't have to be Catholic to understand the message-that religion isn't the same thing as God.  [most of]the actors are as impressive as the outstanding script. The dynamic between Damon and Affleck is as good as ever, Jason Lee is smooth as cream in his role as a crafty renegade demon, Alanis Morrisette is uncommonly beatific and seems to radiate natural serenity as God, and George Carlin is appropriately aggravating as the worldly bishop. I have to say that Chris Rock's twitchy bark makes him slightly unconvincing as a forgotten apostle but he's still hilarious. Silent Bob and Jay are their same slacker-with-heart selves and while Jay's antics aren't for the faint of heart, they make you love them even when they make you cringe. Smith must enjoyed such a large budget and, as evidence by the demon made entirely of feces, put it to good use.  You'll enjoy this movie if you have an open mind and a sense of humor.
0425107469|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best books ever written by Koontz. I started the book and could not put it down until I finished it. As a new Koontz reader, I can say that there was no other better book to start with. If you're not already a loyal Koontz fan, I'm almost sure you'll be one once you read it!

B00003CX5P|5.0|I have been dreaming, waiting, hoping, whishing - ever since I was 10 years old - that one day we could watch the STAR WARS saga at home on large TV SETS - well technology has caught up with the fantastic vision of GEORGE LUCAS from a long time ago....and now with my 54\\" SONY and SONY DVD - my dreams are coming true! STAR WARS on DVD - CLEAN - CRISP - CLEAR - true to the way George had meant it to be seen - A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE with a heart, mind, soul of a child looking up to the sun - searching for adventure and excitement.  THE FORCE WILL BE WITH YOU.....ALWAYS.
B0000541AM|5.0|Another one of Joe Bob Briggs' Monstervision classics, &quot;The Warriors&quot; revolves around the struggle of nine gang members trying to escape the Bronx and reach their home turf of Coney Island. Along the way they run into countless obstacles that threaten to keep them from attaining their goal such as police, subway fires, and rival gangs. Okay, so it's not &quot;Escape from New York&quot; or even &quot;Judgement Night&quot; but it's still pretty good.<br />The best part of &quot;The Warriors&quot; are the gangs. Every gang has a gimmick such as the Coney Island Warriors of the title who's &quot;colors&quot; consist of stereotypical Native-American garb, i.e. leather vests and pants and even in some cases headdress. Another example are the High Hats who all dress as street mimes. My personal favorites,though,are the Furies who walk the streets in baseball uniforms with their gang logo on the back and ridiculous face paint.<br />The dialog is quite entertaining at times. The gangs all have their own lingo which doesn't even seem to coincide with the parlance of the times. The film appears to take place in an indeterminate time period and the dialog, as well as the nature of the gangs themselves, would seem to support that theory. I guess the overall consensus is that this could take place in any city at any time. Leaves one to wonder if Walter Hill took his influence straight from Anthony Burgess' &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.<br />&quot;The Warriors&quot; though never truly gripping is still a good movie. Some of its elements over time have devolved into camp but on the whole it has survived pretty well. Unless you really like 70's action films or the &quot;will-they-or-won't-they&quot; theme, though, you might want to skip this one.
B00005JK93|5.0|An Oscar worthy indie film, one of the greatest alternative musicals in film history. Based on the stage play of the same title, the story follows the life of Hansel; who adopts his mothers' name Hedwig following a botched sex-change operation in order to escape the musically and sexually repressed East German state.      Hedwig follows his/her life in search of love, finding only disappointment and betrayal, from an American GI to her protege Tommy Gnosis. In the search for love, Hedwig finds not only its' origin, but its' destination as well.      Steven Trask gives the film its' soul in his musical compositions as well as lending his voice to the character of Tommy Gnosis. John Cameron Mitchell directed and stars as Hedwig showing a range of talent that it is hoped will be displayed in future stage and film work. Miriam Shor shines as backup vocalist  Yitzhak. Finally, Andrea Martin gives a performance that backs up her standing as one of the great comedians of our time.      All four of these performers deserve Oscar consideration one of the truly innovative film muscials of recent memory. Certainly the songs &quot;Wicked Little Town&quot; and &quot;The Origin of Love&quot; should be considered for Best Song.      This film isn't for everyone, and does have its uneven moments. The ending may leave you scratching your head, but is ultimatly satisfying with reflection. See it twice and add it to your video library when it's available. You won't soon forget this film!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I absolutely love Dido's debut album. It is mellow yet spunky, alternative but not too tough, provocative without being raunchy, and just an overall spectacular CD. It is like a blend of Sarah McLaughlin's voice with Alanis Morisette minus the harshness with notworthy accoustics. In my opinion there is nothing not to love about this one.The lyrics are fabulous as well, with Dido singing about a whole myriad of topics--not just love ballads. Here's a song-by-song description:<br />Track#1: Here With Me: Theme song for hit TV show 'Roswell', kind of about the isolation one feels after the ending of a love relationship, when you are yearning for that person to return.<br />Track#2: Hunter: Excellent, edge-powered song that could be about a woman in a controlling relationship, who feels that she is more valued for her surface than the content of her personality.<br />Track#3: Don't Think of Me: Another feisty composition about the alternative girl being dumped in favor of the 'She's-All-That' cheerleader, even though she cheats on him behind his back.<br />Track#4: My Lover's Gone: Moody melody dealing with the almost anesthetizing pain of an ended relationship.<br />Track#5: All You Want: A song about the devotion one has to the person they love.<br />Track#6: Thank You: I think everybody's heard this one, but if you haven't, it is kind of uplifting. Dido dedicated it to the gratitude she has for her fiance`.<br />Track#7: Honestly OK: An elusive song with interesting side-effects. I think it describes the way a person feels upon attempting suicide.<br />Track#8: Don't Slide: A dramatic hit, it has a fabulous rhythm and there is something about it that is really enticing.<br />Track#9: Isobel: An extremely tragic song that actually is about suicide. I don't know if it based on truth, but it is empathetic and speaks of regret in the memory of what could have been.<br />Track#10: No Angel: The track the album is titled after, and one of the best. Excellent accoustic rhythm; tough song about what it's like to be a feisty girl in a relationship.<br />Track#11: My Life: A Jazz-like hit about independence and defiance and taking control of one's destiny. Dido has the perfect voice for this one.<br />Track#12: Take My Hand: A techno-beat song which shows Dido going off in a no direction, pretty energetic compared to the mellow of the rest of the CD.<br />Given that Dido wrote all of these songs herself, you can see that she is clearly a talented music composer and poet. Enjoy!
0060934913|4.0|An enjoyable read which will make you an informed consumer when dining out.  I worked very briefly as a dishwasher, potwasher (chief potwasher), and waiter (recommend and push the snapper), and even visited the Fulton St Fish Markets, and found this book entertaining.  After reading the chapters about line cooks, weekend brunches, and the use of Thursday fish as Monday specials, I went out to eat on a Monday night, and guess what... all three dinner specials were fish and seafood dishes.  You won't be grossed out after skimming this book, but you will definitely become an enlightened restaurant diner.
B000002WU9|5.0|There shouldnt be a question on which Wu Cambino has the tightest solo adventure. &quot;Only Built For Cuban Links&quot; featuring Tony Starks a.k.a. Ghost Face Killa (an early intro of his rhyme skills for his soon to be released solo adventure) was one of the best hip-hop CDs to be released in the mid-90s period! If you didnt know, ask someone who bought it......or just ask any  real &quot;Wu&quot; head. Do you remember joints like &quot;Ice Cream&quot; featuring John Blaze a.k.a. Meth, Tony Starks and Cappachino a.k.a. Cappadona? ....&quot;watch these rap n#$gas get all up in your guts/ french, vanilla, pecan chocolaty deluxe/ even caramel sundaes is getting touched and scooped in my ice cream truck....who tears sh!t up&quot;. Yeah, that jam was on the Raekwon joint. This is Rzas best work next to the Genius &amp; Ghost 1st solo joints. &quot;Guillotine&quot; is no doubt one of my favorite track on this CD. Now here is an example of the meaning of creativity when sampling. These kats to took a sample from one scene in Bruce Lis film (&quot;Return Of The Dragon&quot;) and looped it to create one of the tightest Wu joints ever. This CD also features the tight remix to &quot;Can It Be All So Simple&quot; and other bangin tracks are: Knowledge, Criminology, Rainy Dayz, Ice Water........honestly......truthfully, you want go wrong on this CD from track 18 back to 1. like I said before..... CLASSIC MATERIAL<br />oNe
B00003W8NM|5.0|FIGHT Club is a great great great great movie. It has fantastic characters, a well written story, a disturbing theme, fantastic ideas, dark humor, and a mind-blowing ending. Watching this movie a second time, with the knowledge of what the ending is will only make it better. Tyler Durden played by Pitt is one of the best characters I have ever seen in a movie. What is wrong with the Oscar people?
B000002UR7|5.0|I decided, after hearing Creep on the radio, to buy Pablo Honey. I had never really heard much about the album because most &quot;true radiohead fans&quot; just sort of ignore it, because it was a much more poppy effort than their other albums. Despite the deemed &quot;poppiness&quot; or this album, I absolutely love it. I would go into depth, but it's not necessary. Every song is a masterpiece. I challenge you to truly find any flaws in the CD, although, like with any radiohead album, you must be very open minded when you listen. I implore you, buy this album!!!
B00003CY3W|5.0|This movie has two potential audiences.<br />1.  Seymours 99%, i.e., that segment of the population which he (or I) cant relate to at all.  People lacking any modicum of self-awareness, whose lives are spent in the mall or in front of the TV watching prime time network television.  People whose record collection may include the complete works of Ashford &amp; Simpson, and whose car radio is tuned to any cloying morning Zoo program.  People in this group may enjoy Ghost World to a degree.  They will find Enids green hair and Rebeccas cynical attitude amusing.  They will laugh at Seymours bland wardrobe and jagged brown teeth.  And when the movies over, they will leave the theatre quietly, walk to their SUVs, and head home to their quiet suburban existence.<br />But really, this movie is not for them.<br />2.  Its really for Seymours 1%, i.e., that segment of the population distressed by conformity, obsessed by weirdness, and repressed because of it.  These are the people who surround themselves with massive record collections, or H.R. Pufnstuf dolls, or Bollywood videos, in an effort to beat a different path.  They are lonely, frustrated, and on the verge of giving up any hope at a social life, in favour of a hermetic existence.  These are the people that will be able to relate to Ghost Worlds startling menagerie of misfits.  And feel tremendous sadness for themselves as well.<br />Terry Zwigoff mines much of the same material here that he did with his documentary Crumb, save for the emphasis on ill mental health.  Its an amazing turn for a man previously known only as a documentarian.  I suppose thats why the reality of the characters surrounding is so real.  Each scene is populated with mile and miles of personable knick-knacks and bland consumer products.  Seymour and Enids rooms perfectly reflect their personalities.  The screenplay, conceived with Ghost World originator Daniel Clowes, manages to tacklethe banality of suburban life, and the oppression of consumer culture with just the right amount of bite and bile.  Their collective sense of humour is put on display right away, by showing a high school valedictorian confined to a wheelchair and a monstrous neck brace, in a scene played for laughs.  If you dont giggle at the hypocrisy of this moment (her old intoxicated ways gave her a spiritual perspective on life while it was robbing her of the use of her legs), then I recommend avoiding the film altogether.<br />Another reason to avoid the film is if you are squeamish at the idea of a 40+-year-old man and an 18-year-old girl having a relationship.  One of Ghost World most powerful points is in Enid and Seymours friendship.  These are two kindred spirits, oddballs to the rest of the world, whove found each other and cherish each others oddness.  Sure, chronologically one may be twice the age of the other, but Enid and Seymour have so much in common that it would be a shame to keep them apart just for that.<br />Thora Birch, playing a similar character here as in American Beauty, is asked to carry the movie, and boy does she.  Even while showing Enids enormous extroverted ego, you always get a sense that she is as fragile and scared on the inside as the weirdoes she torments.  And Birch exudes an odd strength (both physical and emotional) that allows Enid to get away with more than she really deserves.  Enids relationship with Rebecca, played by Scarlett Johansson, is confusing at first.  These girls seem to be so much at odds with each other.  There are some tangible hints at malice bubbling beneath the surface.  Silly me.  Theyre supposed to be there.  Enid and Rebecca may or may not be nearing the end of their friendship, for adulthood is looming and its time to grow up.  Rebecca (Johansson does fine work, content with being subdued and allowing Birch to steal the show) wants to move out and get a real job; Enid is still obsessed with punk rock.<br />Seymour is an inspired creation.  Hes in the paradoxical position of desperately wanting female companionship, while simultaneously despising nearly every person he meets.  His passions rule him, bubbling up at the inappropriate times (like when he tries to pick up a woman in a bar, only to find himself yammering on about the difference between Ragtime blues and conventional blues 12-bar structure; his prospective score wears an expression of utter confusion).  Steve Buscemi -- the most recognizable face in the cast -- manages to disappear into Seymours everyman/loser persona seamlessly.  Buscemis Seymour hates his life immensely, but never becomes whiny or unpleasant.  He just goes about his business, allowing his undercurrent of anger to seethe gently to the surface in rare moments (e.g. Enid: Id kill for a collection like this!  Seymour: Go ahead and kill me.).<br />Ghost World isnt for everyone.  But it should be.  It gives a window into the world of the disenchanted, those of us who walk the streets and feel ill at the sights of the conformist and soulless masses.  So maybe there is, after all, a third potential audience for the film.  Those who pay good money for tickets, and walk out of the theatre befuddled at what they just saw, unable to relate to the wonderful characters on screen.  Which in an odd way reminds me of the old poker axiom:<br />If you sit down at the table, and you cant spot the sucker, its probably you.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I have a basic observation of the film vs. the original Star wars movies.  Why did Lucas choose to bring out the later episodes first, and episode one later?  All things in life have a beginning, middle and an end.  Logic should tell us that the first episode would set the stage, building on the entire story from there.  As time progressed the story, the characters, technology in the story, as well as the technology surrounding the making of the movie would progress as well.  As I watched the movie I found myself trying to piece the history and the characters together in reverse, but it didn't click for me. I don't think any sequel will have the same freshness and charm that Star Wars did.  You really cared about the characters in the original movies.  Did you care about these characters?  I didn't.  For me the mark of a good movie is one the involves the viewer.  Does it draw you in as a participant, or are you just watching a big screen video game. Episode I is a special effects masterpiece, not a great movie.
B00005LKIM|4.0|[*An image from the film that I think would make a better title than plain old \\"Hannibal\\".]<br />&quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; worked on every level it aimed for.  It was a perfect suspense-thriller, horror flick, character study, mood piece, and most effectively, psychological drama.  &quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't bother to try its hand at all of these, and who's to blame it for that?  The ones it does try for (thriller, horror flick, mood piece) are pulled off with aplomb.  It's full of blood and gore, all in the name of some serious campy fun (&quot;fun&quot; being the key word here).  And on top of that it manages to be a pretty gripping love story, too.  Well... within the context of the serial killer genre, that is.<br />&quot;Hannibal&quot; doesn't shy away from references to its frequently decorated parent.  We are played tapes of past Lecter/Starling interviews, are reunited with Barney the nurse, and are shown that Hannibal still fits into that gruesome green mask.  Knowledge of &quot;Silence&quot;, then, is mandatory.  But &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a different animal, so to speak.  It doesn't take itself so seriously.  For example, any suggestion of the sexism that Clarice must overcome in the FBI is over-the-top and cartoonish.  And, like &quot;Silence&quot;, it revels in its showstopper set pieces.  But where in &quot;Silence&quot; we weren't shown the violence and the gore, &quot;Hannibal&quot; leaves no stone unturned.  Witness the splattering on the pavement after Lecter disembowels then hangs a pursuer, or the finale featuring Ray Liotta (if you haven't yet been tipped off about this scene, you soon will) that leaves little for the mind's eye to fill in.  Whereas some have found these scenes distasteful and unnecessary, I beg to differ.  They serve two purposes: a distancing from the style of &quot;Silence, and a celebration of the campy fun that dominates the film's tone.<br />That's not to say that everything in the film is over the top and outrageous.  There are several scenes in which information is conveyed with shrewd restraint.  I'm thinking mainly of a quick scene that reveals what happened to Lecter's predecessor at a University library, and the chilling epilogue that resolves any unanswered questions left after the denouement (I'm loathe to give too much away here; please discover these scenes for yourself).  Those in the audience expecting to have their hands held throughout the plot will miss much here, if they don't pay close attention.  Kudos to director Scott for trusting his audience's intellect.<br />Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the good doctor, and does a superb job showing how the man has evolved over the last ten years.  He is still frightening as hell, but also more assured, jubilant, and especially playful.  Age has allowed Lecter to relax within his skin (would a &quot;Silence&quot;-era Hannibal have gotten away with giddily exclaiming &quot;Okey-Dokey&quot; when moving in for a kill?), while honing his ability to control his deviant instincts.  It has also made him restless, which sets the narrative moving. <br />Julianne Moore doesn't really get to do much here, except allude to and update the performance that Jodie Foster gave as Clarice Starling.  In that respect, she does a bang-up job, subtly recreating her erratic accent while giving her a touch of world-weariness.  But really, this is not her movie, and the underwritten part shows that.<br />The Lecter/Starling relationship, which did much to drive &quot;Silence&quot;, is somewhat of a disappointment.  Sure, an ocean separates the two for much of the film's first half, but much more could have been done to enhance the connection between the characters.  As it is, the audience is expected to do much of the work, by remembering what they had going in &quot;Silence&quot; and transplanting it into this film.  That's just lazy filmmaking.  Still, Hopkins has a familiar chemistry with Moore, as he had with Foster, so any blemish is easily forgotten.<br />The rest of the cast has very little to work with, mostly playing one-dimensional characters to various degrees of success.  Gary Oldman, under mounds of make-up, is at his scene-stealing best as the only victim of Dr. Lecter who survived.  Ray Liotta on the other hand, as Starling's sexist superior, is just too ridiculous.  He is a distraction from the campy fun.  The one standout in this one-dimensional dramatis personae is Giancarlo Giannini.  He plays Rinaldo Pazzi, an Italian police detective who unwittingly gets more mixed up in the Lecter affair than he originally intended.  Giannini infuses his Pazzi with dollops of sadness (witness his droopy eyes), bumbling cunning, and subtly concealed fright.<br />I have not read Thomas Harris' source novel, and don't intend to.  So I can't speak to how the film holds up in comparison.  I can say that in comparison with &quot;Silence&quot; it is not close in matching that film's classic status.  However, &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a fun, campy ride that left me with a feeling of adrenalized exhilaration on par with what I felt the first time that I saw &quot;Silence&quot;.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Simply put, this film will go down as a classic.  Tom Hanks did an excellent job as Chuck Noland in this film.  From a very real plane crash to life on the island and back again, he is able to catch the viewer from the beginning and take them on this journey.  Not only is it an exhaustive journey on a deserted island but it takes you on Chuck's journey to step back and take another look at his life.<br />How many of us are caught up in the rush of the day.  Most of us are controlled by the &quot;clock&quot;.  It runs our day and that is the routine that we get stuck in.  This movie shows that we have to stop and take a look around us and see what really is happening.  We need to evaluate our lives from a different perspective.  That may mean getting away from your current situation.  This film does just that via Chuck Noland.<br />The other wonderful thing about this movie is the ending.  When Chuck returns home, his girlfriend is now married and instead of having Chuck reunite with her in a romantic way, the movie puts it the way it should be.  She needs to get on with her life without him and he will go his seperate way and find a different path in life to take.<br />This is a definite must own movie.  I have purchased my copy and you should purchase yours.
6304508611|5.0|I am somewhat of a Brian DePalma fan and saw an edited version of the director's &quot;Carrie&quot; on CBS Network-television in 1978.  I recently saw an uncut version of this film.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is one of the greatest horror films and tragedies in movie history.<br />Socially awkward high school student Carrie White(Sissy Spacek)  uses telekinetic powers to get back at her vicious classmates and religiously fanatical mother(Piper Laurie).<br />&quot;Carrie&quot; rivals &quot;Dressed To Kill&quot; as Brian DePalma's greatest thriller.  This movie is the ultimate revenge fantasy for anyone who was picked on during their school days.  Both Sissy Spacek and Piper Laurie should have won Oscars for their magnificent performances.  Spacek gives an unforgettable performance.  Laurie is almost charismatic as the domineering and crazed Margaret White.  This character offered the perfect comeback role for Laurie after her fifteen-year absence from the big screen.  Nancy Allen's malicious Chris qualifies as one of the greatest villainous characters in movie history.  DePalma made &quot;Carrie&quot; when he still knew how to make great movies.  In recent years, DePalma has not only forgotten how to scare and shock viewers, but he has even forgotten how to make his audience feel genuine emotions.  DePalma forces viewers to empathize with the pain and anguish of Carrie White.  &quot;Carrie&quot; is a tragedy as well as a horror film.  Perhaps no other film director has more realistically depicted adolescent cruelty than DePalma did in &quot;Carrie.&quot;  The shock conclusion will jolt viewers right out of their seats.<br />DePalma's &quot;Carrie&quot; is very well-recommended.
B00003CX5P|1.0|a tip for the film industry when following up on a successful film or films try to remember what happened in previous films. george lucas ignores all that facts from empire eg ben was trained by yod,the force is a living energy field.
B00005IC2H|3.0|Don't mind this album, don't hate it. Is good but not really my type of thing...<br />One thing though.....Sigur Ros is as much a &quot;noise quartet&quot; as your mom is an 18 year old virgin.....
B00005BCPC|5.0|Okay, if you overlook the &quot;kissing cousins&quot; part of it........this is a great film!  I recently saw it for the first time, and was just bowled over by how sweet (bittersweet) the romance was between Fanny and Edmund.  My heart just sighed several times watching the interplay between these two characters.  Just wonderful!!  I highly recommend it!
0385484518|5.0|This book is for anyone who has ever gone through a difficult phase of their life.  It explores the relationship between a dying man who is experiencing life anew and a young man who is just learning to live life.  <br />Compact and easy to gobble away in one sitting, this book should be cherished and savored for the lessons it offers.  It gives a new insight for anyone who is afraid of the unknown and also makes one reflect on areas of life that can easily be taken away with worry over little things.
B00000IAU3|5.0|For me to buy a CD means that the work has to grab me. I don't want to come off sounding that I'm all high and mighty when it c omes to listening to music. I'm just picky. I appreciate music of all kinds. I listen to music of all kinds on the radio. When it comes to buying, however, I tend to lean towards artists I grew up with. Those I can trust to produce that I know I would love. I also admit that I'm a great Megadeth, Metallica and Iron Maiden fan. How in the world did I get to buy this CD? What was it about the CD that grabbed me?<br />The first time I had heard Dido, in which at the time I didn't know her name yet, was in the Eminem song &quot;Dear Stan&quot;. The voice was very striking that it was simply soul-soothing. Of course having Eminem screeching in between killed the mood, though I admit &quot;Dear Stan&quot; is a very good song. I had thought that it could have been Suzanne Vega singing, but through it all I was not that interested in knowing who it was. The second time I heard Dido, and still unaware of her name, was when I saw a Roswell episode. Evedn then I did not make the connection. When I heard &quot;Hunter&quot;, I decided that's it. Who was that cute blond singer with a voice so ethereal I could swear it was not from the world. I'm definitely buying that CD.<br />Dido's album is excellent. The music matches her singing. The beats are well arranged and striking, but it's that mysterious out of this world voice of hers that brings it al together. If the music just kept on playing without her, it would have been listenable. She could sing without the music and there wouldn't be a problem of any sort. However, when the two are brought together, the result is divine, it sweeps your soul away. This is an artist who truly knows her craft, in both writing her songs and doing the honors of singing them. She truly touches the heart of the wanderer and the lost. There's so much emotion and soul put into this work that it's difficult to find faults inthe woodwork of the album. It transcends all recent modern music and the direction the industry has been taking with one day stars and the teen trend. It has the ability to appeal to most people, just because of the artistry of the final product. Dido makes her presence well-known on the musical map. All I know is that I've added a new artist I'll be buying future albums of. Who knows, maybe with time grow up with her music too.

B00003CY0V|5.0|I felt I had to write this review because every other reviewer must have seen a different film to me. If you were expecting a great plot then you should never watch a hollywood film. Even starwars which as I recall was not to well treated by the reviewers has a weak plot but has gone down in history. For me the great thing about this film is not the overall plot but that for the first time there was a sense of realism. I have a PhD in chemistry and if you gave me the problem/job of getting the money I would do whatever it took 1 hostage, 2 or 100 I would not care as success would be all that mattered. There is a great line in the film when one of the hostages is blown up as the police attempt a rescue John Travolta says \\"that was not my dicision it was yours\\" (the police) and I agree. In this the hostage taker says what he will do if you do something, if you then take action that results in his/her death that was your dicision. The hostage taker just told you what he would do. Also in the film you never really no who is bad and good as Travolta does not play a terrorist as many reviews have said but a member of a black opps team who take pro-active measures against people who they consider to be a threat to the USA. To save millions they may have to kills a few hundred is this good or bad? ... The story is simple I need money to continue my course ie the 9.5 billion dollars to do this I need a good hacker then I do whatever it takes to get away. For me this film raises some interesting questions for one how far would you go to get what you want? To protect your country? How far is too far? Etc... This is a great film as there are no real good guys just people who know what they want and in that more like life. We all work for money don't we. See the film and judge for yourself.
0553328255|5.0|From our first encounter with Sherlock Holmes in Conan Doyle's introductory novel, A Study in Scarlet, we are fascinated by the uniqueness of Holmes' eccentric character and personality, his incredible intelligence and powers of observation in all things concerning the solving of difficult criminal cases, his total dedication to his craft, and the enormous resources of energy and determination he calls on to solve problems that baffle the best minds of the London police and Scotland Yard.  Sherlock Holmes is a consulting detective. He is the court of last appeal when the police, government officials, and private citizens can find help nowhere else.  What makes Holmes special is not only his vast knowledge related to crime and the master criminal, like the infamous Professor Moriarty, but also his incredible powers of observation and deduction, which he uses in every story and novel to the amazement of his friend and colleague Dr. Watson and the various police detectives who seek out his help to solve a difficult case.<br /><br />Conan Doyle is a fine write who wanted to turn his attention to other projects and so he decided to kill Holmes at a least meeting with Professor Moriarty at the Reichenbach Falls in the Alps in The Adventure of the Final Problem.  As we might expect, Holmes is not so easily disposed of.  The demand of the public for more stories prompted Conan Doyle to bring back his famous detective from what seemed like certain death.<br /><br />The late Jeremy Brett brought Holmes to life in the celebrated PBS series on Mystery.  I recommend not only the Complete Stories and Novels, but also Brett's interpretation of the greatest of all fictional detectives.
0812523334|5.0|This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it!  My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it.  I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls.  They loved it!  Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them.  They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls.  You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord.  Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies.  They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed.  They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them.  They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay.  Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside.  So, back to the book.  Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures.  Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives.  You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind!  I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder!  No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book foryour teenagers or just read it again yourself!  In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book.  Please read it!  As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on....

B000001OAA|4.0|Garbage's debut album comes off like Hole's &quot;Live Through This&quot;, only with a thicker, glossier coat of Pop sheen.  The term &quot;Pop&quot; of course had a broader definition a decade ago, especially when compared to what passes for today's milquetoast.  Back in the early/mid 90's when radio wasn't afraid to experiment with its format, Garbage's debut came across as very accessible but no less raw, menacing and dark.  Make no mistake, Shirley can scare you just as much as Courtney, especially when she spits out lines like &quot;Now I'm here burning down your house&quot;.  It's a formidable debut from probably the most inventive rock band that comes from and has survived the Grunge era of the early/mid 90's.

B00005KC99|5.0|Each character is unique and combines to form a healthy whole and stable story.  The music of the film by Mendelssohn brings out the strange and delightful schemes of these individuals and not least of all, Dave's Italian fashion.  A perfect sound, the Italian Symphony creates the atmosphere without allowing the story to muster its remorselful and regretful air.  It keeps the mood fantastic which brings out the screenplay that deserved the oscar that it was rewarded.
0875428940|5.0|I consider this deck to be, for the most part, a redrawn Rider-Waite deck.  I love the colors, the art, and beauty of this deck! This is more of symbolism of art rather then symbolism through the more esoteric arts.  I feel love from every card, even the ones that are not so easy to digest.  This is the deck I would suggest to start with!  I would suggest it to anyone that is looking for a deck to become good friends to.  This is a type of friend that tells you the truth in a loving way.  The design on the back allows for the deck to be read reversed.  There is also a book that is written by the artist that gives you a new perspective on the details of this deck... I would suggest that also if you plan on owning this deck and using it...

B00000I4XR|5.0|Most center on the shark when the aspects of this film's plot go even further towards shore.  The film is about a town.  It is about a traditional sea of income, and the shark swallows the hope of needy men and women.  This need brings out the greed in the mayor.  The shark is playing its role by doing its part in leading the characters out to it through starvation.  When both begin to starve they find one another.  Man's survival through another's decline is one significant theme.  One man loves the shark, another despises, and this one indifferent, yet wants justice and peace.  All are selfish as is the town's prime function to unite for lives.  I could call this film a satire, but it isn't one.  IT certainly is a gold mine for an intellectual, because it isn't about a shark.  The shark, I believe can be symbolic for a moment. I love questions.
B000001GKC|5.0|This recording of Bruckner's Seventh Symphony was Maestro Karajan's very last recording. Karajan, of course related to Bruckner more than with any other composer, so what a great recording to go out with. This album is truly majestic. Karajan, like no other, is able to bring out the mystical aspects of Bruckner's symphonies that make them so unique. Though this isn't my favorite Bruckner symphony, this is definitely one of my favorite recordings of a Brucker symphony, second only to Karajan's famous recording of the Eighth. Karjan is able to bring forth great emotional intensity from the piece and all of it is recorded in superb digital sound. For fans of Bruckner or for a great introduction to his work, this disk is a must have. I recommend it whole heartedly. It's essential Bruckner and shows an elderly Karajan in top form.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|.... SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is the most charming movie I know, bar none, and richly rewards repeated viewings.  Nothing in recent years, or in the future, is likely to equal the artistry of the hand-drawn animation, or the beauty of the youthful yet classically trained singing voices.  Yes, Adriana Caselotti gave her coloratura tones and soubrette speaking voice a cartoonish tinge, as part of the characterization.  But anyone who cannot get used to her sound within five minutes and appreciate its humor is beyond hope.  .... One feature unfortunately still absent from the track listing is the full-length soundtrack recordings of songs like \\"Heigh-Ho\\" and \\"The Dwarfs' Yodel Song,\\" which were seriously shortened before being used in the finished film.  If I remember correctly, only the RCA 78s (and their BMG reissue on CD) included the longer versions of the songs.  .... <br />And while the Disney studio keeps drawing our attention to a few of the Frank Churchill songs that were not used in this movie at all, it would be more interesting to see reproductions of the sheet music for the familiar songs, and to hear the sheet-music arrangements faithfully performed.  These, too, were usually longer versions, with distinctly different lyrics that various popular singers eventually recorded.  (For example, Richard Tauber's eloquent vintage single of the Prince's \\"One Song\\"--truly a desert-island recording--begins with a long-forgotten stanza that builds sublimely to the first chorus.) In the movie, almost every song is shortened to a single chorus, and the words for \\"Heigh-Ho\\" consist of only two lines, endlessly repeated!  ....
B00003CX8J|5.0|This film has great special effects. And the DVD has excellent sound and picture quality, and some really good extras. Yes, it has a comic book plot and the characters are kind of one-dimensional. But it's supposed to be that way! Some things are just meant to be a lark! Park your brain at the door, turn off the analyzer, and just enjoy it!
0553573403|4.0|I knew that the somewhat cryptic prologue would be related to the story.  It also helped me read through roughly the first 100 pages until I came across that sardonic Lannister  dwarf Tyrion who, along with John (Snow) and Arya Stark,  more than tweaked my interest.  The story does pick up to a dramatic end, by then I identified and was able to fully distinguish each of the characters.<br />I quickly purchased the next in the series.
0767827015|5.0|Boyz N the Hood was the movie debut of african-amemrican movie director John Singleton.Anyone who've seen this movie can remember the stir it caused around 1991 when it was released, at a time when George Bush was president and ghetto riots occured in LA later in the Rodney King incident.<br />One can be rather amazed but such such a a stark but accurate portait of the hood and most impotantly what it is living in the projects.<br />I have rarely seen such as clever and brillant outlook on african-american issues in a movie.John Singleton here doesn't glorify violence or gangs, he address and demonstrates these issues by telling the story of three young black teenagers living in a rather harsh neighborhood : South Central LA.<br />What struck the most was how accurate this movie actually is.It doesn't portait mens who thrives with gang-violence but rather are trying escaping it, finding a better surrounding.<br />Not only Boyz N the Hood does a great job in acheiving this but it also manage to tell us meaningful issues such as single-parenthood, fatherhood, sex and education.<br />A strong duality also did struck me : scopes of imporoving your life and how it can be done.On one hand you've got one child who's got a caring and reponsible father, played amazingly by Lawrence Fishburne and other young mens such as Doughboy who live wihout knowing his father.Clearly Singleton has pointed out brillantly that men that have fathers taking care of them and loving them are more chance to suceed.In the end, Tre choose not to live within the gang-violence framework showing us how crucial a role-model father can be for his child.<br />Two different paths and two different families, those of Tre and Doughboy, demontrates how single-handly having a father can change their fate : life or death.<br />The daring finale where Tre choose his fate and doughboy avenge his brother is one of the most touching and emotionnal scenes I have ever encountered.I was emotionnally touched and deeply saddened by this scene (along when Cuba Cooding jr handles the gun to Lawrencne Fishburne).<br />The fact that Singleton also manage to capture the true essence of South Central LA when football wiz Ricky encounter his death is also one of the most daring scene.The music stops, Ricky runs trying to escape his death, gun's fired, the shooting happens and nobody can stop it : this is the realness of violence.You can't escape it. <br />More importantly, you are not witnessing the hood YOU ARE LIVING IT.It is truly breathtaking !!!<br />Such a clever movie should not be overlooked.<br />It has genius written all over it...<br />5 stars and tears to your eyes
0553579908|5.0|The clash of kings was far more complex alluring and exciting than the first.  Martin expands our view to activities in the north while detailing the actions of those interested in the crown through the lives of the characters whom we now know more about. I am annoyed by Varys, humored by Tyrion and vexed by Cersei.  I also have concern for the well being of Arya Stark and even Sansa.  There are other characters  as well whose welfare has my concern and wish to find out if they manage to stay alive.   I was intrigued by the sudden change at the end of the first book which lingers, but is not emphasized, in the second. My interest is piqued as I only wonder what this sudden spurt of magic will mean for the future.
0767827015|5.0|Boyz N the Hood was the movie debut of african-amemrican movie director John Singleton.Anyone who've seen this movie can remember the stir it caused around 1991 when it was released, at a time when George Bush was president and ghetto riots occured in LA later in the Rodney King incident.<br />One can be rather amazed but such such a a stark but accurate portait of the hood and most impotantly what it is living in the projects.<br />I have rarely seen such as clever and brillant outlook on african-american issues in a movie.John Singleton here doesn't glorify violence or gangs, he address and demonstrates these issues by telling the story of three young black teenagers living in a rather harsh neighborhood : South Central LA.<br />What struck the most was how accurate this movie actually is.It doesn't portait mens who thrives with gang-violence but rather are trying escaping it, finding a better surrounding.<br />Not only Boyz N the Hood does a great job in acheiving this but it also manage to tell us meaningful issues such as single-parenthood, fatherhood, sex and education.<br />A strong duality also did struck me : scopes of imporoving your life and how it can be done.On one hand you've got one child who's got a caring and reponsible father, played amazingly by Lawrence Fishburne and other young mens such as Doughboy who live wihout knowing his father.Clearly Singleton has pointed out brillantly that men that have fathers taking care of them and loving them are more chance to suceed.In the end, Tre choose not to live within the gang-violence framework showing us how crucial a role-model father can be for his child.<br />Two different paths and two different families, those of Tre and Doughboy, demontrates how single-handly having a father can change their fate : life or death.<br />The daring finale where Tre choose his fate and doughboy avenge his brother is one of the most touching and emotionnal scenes I have ever encountered.I was emotionnally touched and deeply saddened by this scene (along when Cuba Cooding jr handles the gun to Lawrencne Fishburne).<br />The fact that Singleton also manage to capture the true essence of South Central LA when football wiz Ricky encounter his death is also one of the most daring scene.The music stops, Ricky runs trying to escape his death, gun's fired, the shooting happens and nobody can stop it : this is the realness of violence.You can't escape it. <br />More importantly, you are not witnessing the hood YOU ARE LIVING IT.It is truly breathtaking !!!<br />Such a clever movie should not be overlooked.<br />It has genius written all over it...<br />5 stars and tears to your eyes
0385501560|4.0|After reading CHOKE, I noticed I felt the same way after watching some of Stanley Kubick's harsh social commentary.  In both cases they kind of end where they started, although, not without going through some searching and fighting against the machines of society.  It's pretty hard for me to like a story where you end at the same beginning, only more depressed (some would say enlightened) about the situation surrounding you.<br />If you can look past that, Choke is pretty entertaining.  By far the style and bluntness of the words and characters is the winner (like in Fight Club too), yet if the novel didn't apply those attributes it's hard to say where the book would end up for enjoyment.  In this age and experience of middle-age philosophy, it seems standard that Chuck's insight into the psyche is delivered in such a movie and music video format; which would explain the cult following that praises it.  Maybe he's invented a new genre, the pop-philosophy workbook for many, but maybe it's a genre that will start and end with our generation.  Whatever the case, it's definitely a trip for it to be sharing the same shelf space as The Great Gatsby.
0812550706|5.0|I was recommended this book by my father.  Usually I am a strcit fantasy reader, rarely venturing into the somewhat &quot;colder tone&quot; of science fiction.  However, I could not put it down after reading the first page and finished it in one day.    Ender's Game, deals with children and the pysche.  more than that, it deals with limitations; how far can you push a person; how far will a man go to get what he wants; and when does a child stop being a child?  Ender's game deals with all these questions and more: how deep are the differences that seperate us?     This book truly makes the reader think.  Orson Scott Card is as much a genius, in his way, as the characters he has created.  The book never drags and is never predictable.  It's spontaneity makes the reader relate even more to Ender because we are kept almost as much in the dark as he is.  Never have I read a book with a character so lovable as Ender.  His non-existent childhood, the manipulation he is forced to be a pawn in, the fact that no one ever cuts him a break . . .all these things make the reader stand by him even more.     Even if you are not a fan of science fiction, read this book.  It is the story of men who must sacrifice a child for the sake of humanity and the child who surprises them all.

B000002JSP|1.0|yes I agree with some fans who saying that this one is a funny stuff alots of disco movement, it did not sound like ZEP anymore.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I'll be honest-- I bought this CD purely for &quot;Clint Eastwood,&quot; but now that I've heard it all, I'm almost convinced it's the best CD I've bought this year. Cake, Radiohead, and Weezer aside, this CD is stellar. With four memebers from such different musical backgrounds (Blur, Cibo Matto, etc.), you'd expect this to sound like the train wreck it probably would have been in less capable hands. But instead it is the funkiest, funniest, and just best thing I've heard in AWHILE. The beats are incredible. It's an upbeat record and makes great use of Cibo Matto's hip-hop sampling, with drum loops and distant voices. I have yet to find a bad song on it, and I've been looking closely. Get it. Get it. Get it. You know you want it. Get it. Buy it. Right now. I said NOW.
B000005RS6|5.0|yes Steve Morse/ex Kansas and Dixie dregs had replaced Ritchie blackmore on banjo, joined the old guys like Gillan, Lord, Glover, Paice. they are Deep Purple MK 7 line up who rocked the parisian olympia in 1996. The set is fantastic and loud, many French fans still love them on stage and the band still thundering the fans. a must for Purple fans!
6305513406|5.0|I had never seen any of The Original Series before last year, I caught one on TV and thought it was interesting.  I bought this DVD to start my collection and see if I liked other episodes of The Original Series.  Did I ever.  I grew up watching the movies with my dad and to see the characters of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy in their beginings was great.  If you alreay like Star Trek then these DVD's are the best way to start a collection and revisit old friends.  The quality is far better than what you'd get just watching them on TV.
B000025XX0|5.0|This greatest hits album from the U.K. is the perfect compilation of Queen's latter day career. On this 1991 release finds songs from \\"The Works\\" through \\"Innuendo\\" with a throwback from the 1981 release of \\"Hot Space\\" with the song \\"Under Pressure\\". As with many of the super-groups of the 70's and 80's there is definitely an evolution that takes place as time goes on. Many of these bands became more refined, better lyricists, better players, and immensely more popular. Queen is no exception ending with the masterpiece, \\"Innuendo\\". <br />As it turns out, I was pretty unfortunate in acquiring this CD. The only domestic CD that competed against it at the time was \\"Classic Queen\\", but it had a different song listing. A few years later, Hollywood finally released this album stateside in conjunction with Greatest Hits I making a double album. I felt burned, but I couldn't wait to get the album. <br />Without doubt, Queen is one of the best groups ever to play in an arena. Freddie Mercury had one of the best male voices ever to sing, and a stage personality that could get any audience involved. Mixed with the great playing and hit songwriting from guitarist Brian May, bassist John Deacon, and Roger Taylor on skins they reached the status of legends. With Queen's ultra-successful career it would take you quite a bit of money to collect everything they've done. This album is a good place to start to get some of their greatest songs of the late 80's and early 90's. Mixed with \\"Greatest Hits I\\", you'll have a very solid start all for the same price I paid to have mine come from the U.K.
6304126344|5.0|This is such a great, film i think that everybody should watch it termitator judgement day is one of the best films of it's kind it has kind of a funny but serious attitude to the way the terminator acts but in Terminator 1 it has barely any funny things in it all.THIS IS A  MUST SEE  FILM SEE AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6305907145|2.0|A bizarre reworking of Jane Austen's most carefully nuanced novel. Rozema's \\"Mansfield Park\\" is a wholly different work than its namesake.    Admittedly, Fanny Price has been a difficult character for many readers to admire, but Patricia Rozema goes so far in her hatred for Fanny that she has removed the poor thing from her own life story.     Austen's Mansfield Park is tale of Morality.  In a sense,  Rozema retains this focus, but has transposed the moral quandary into a kind of fancy-dress present day topicality, dropping the central dramatic moment of the novel, namely Fanny's redemption of the wavering Edmund.  If it were not for this redemption the novel truly would have been inexplicable, and so is Rozema's film inexplicable in consequence of ignoring it.    The screenplay of this \\"Mansfield Park\\" is self-evidently based, not on Austen's novel itself, but rather on essays >about< the novel from the 1998 Norton Critical Edition, most particularly upon Edward Said's \\"Jane Austen and Empire\\".  Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley's \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Women\\" is also collected in that volume.     The strange imposition of turgid images of the repression of a West Indian slave rebellion--sketched with Leonardo (DiCaprio)-esque skill -- by the now somehow damaged and misunderstood Tom Bertram, the selfish rake of the original; Sir Thomas's putative lechery toward his niece (this played with relish by a slobbering Harold Pinter); and Fanny's abrupt flowering, not as the anchor and conscience of the family, but as a sexy young authoress, are highlights of Rozema's unfortunately all-too-literal dramatization of these secondary sources.
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt did a wonderful job bring his readers back to his tragic childhood in Ireland. Poverty was something that his family struggled with and it did not help the situation as his father was a hard-core alcoholic who prefers to spend his dole money on drinks even though his family is barely surviving. McCourt also had to deal with the deaths of his sibblings due to improper care and lack of food. <br />I like this book a lot because it makes us think of how fortunate we are, to have food, loved ones and at times, we don't appreciate what we have. This book also gives a good perspective of how difficult times were after the Great Depression and how World War II were able to provide jobs for a lot of people and helped to boost the economy. <br />I think this book is quite funny too besides the problems faced by the McCourts. The author did a great job in observing his surroundings and also find humors in difficult times.
B00004U2A1|5.0|Contrary to popular belife, EVIL DEAD 2 IS A SEQUEL NOT A REMAKE. Read up on it, it just goes to show you that some people are dumb. oh yeah the movie is good, not cheaply made, well it is but whatchagonnado?
0783235607|5.0|You never know where Hitchcock is going to lead you in this film.  It starts out as a psychological drama about a woman driven to steal so that she and her boyfriend can get married.  Then, the main character is ripped away, and the void left is filled by a shy young man who's never torn himself away from his demanding mother.  Hitchcock's best film ever.

In the first Child's Play, they dunt show chucky talk alot just andy tellz his mother what chucky sayz.

0385501005|4.0|Mike Gayle is definitely no Leo Tolstoi and this book is no War and Peace, but still, the time you allocate for reading of this book will be worth of it. Spending two days eating the chocolate bars could be dangerous, considering all the consequences, but spending two days to read the book as sweet as mentioned confection is definitely safe activity with no health damaging side effects.<br />No.1 best-selling author of My Legendary Girlfriend moved on - the days when his Hiro Protagonist had to solve the troubles arising from such a simple thing as a relationship with the person of the opposite sex are over, and in Mr. Commitment he operates on the more dangerous continent of life - the land where girlfriends who want to marry &amp; have children live.<br />Now, as many of you probably know, &quot;girlfriend thinking of getting married and having children&quot; is the kind of situation when the young man is in real trouble... the situation which, in the safe 90ties and Millennium decade, equals in the thrills involved for the young fine men to the challenges their grandparents had to face during the WWII. With McJobs and under the burden of the student loans, addicted to television and to the magic of being young and irresponsible in a Brad Pitt way we simply have to sit down in complete shock when we see our girlfriend is such a state of mind and yell (deep in our souls, of course): &quot;Houston, we got a problem!!!&quot;.<br />And this is exactly the moment we join Duff, the main star of Mr. Commitment, in his lifetime story: Mel the Divine, wants to marry. <br />Mike Gayle has most of the characters right and he truly understands our generation and the way we thing about those &quot;important things&quot;. He knows how those difficult parts of our lives start and how they usually end. He writes about the people whom we know, about ourselves, about our friends, about people we have been living with or working with, and he does it so well that it came to my mind from time to time while reading this book that he was here around, as the Invisible Man, observing last five years of mine and my ex-buddies, taking notes, recording the discussions, making snapshots etc. in order to make this piece of easy reading. The only artificial thing in this novel is Alexa and her relation to Duff.<br />Now the things in book which I found very interesting and amazing:<br />1. Apparently, young males have some problem with IKEA. I can confirm that on the basis of the study I have done among my friends. I have the problem with IKEA, all my ex-buddies have problem with IKEA and surprise surprise, Duff has the problem with IKEA too. It seems the IKEA is not the kind of shop young fine men are willing to spend much time. Notwithstanding that, it is still possible that some men use the IKEA catalogues as Edward Norton did in Fight Club movie.<br />2. US cultural global invasion is reality!!! Duff eats Mars chocolate bars, we all know what it is. Duff mentions Groundhog Day, and we all know it is movie with Bill Murray. (On other hand, when Duff mentions some BBC programming, we do not know what the hell is he speaking about.) So much for Cool Britannia hype!<br />3. I know couples myself, which are only allowed to socialise with other couples for fear of catching single-people disease, and Mike Gayle knows such a couples as well! Duff knows one (Mark and Julie)!<br />4. I also like the moment when Duff says that he thinks about kids about as often as he thinks about ... inviting unemployed psychopathic dwarves to share his live...<br />5. Mike Gayle quotes John Lennon in the book once. Not interested in being hip, Mike Gayle also quotes ex-PM Thatcher, instead of quoting Tony Blair. It is worth of mentioning that there is a song by The Fatima Mansions titled Only Losers Take The Bus, while writing about that quotation of Lady Thatcher.<br />In the segment of summertime romantic fiction you can hardly find something better. No high art but extremely readable. Beautiful cover artwork, BTW...Go for it!
0783229887|5.0|actually thiz movie waz gr8! I love child's play movies, own all of um, have a talking Tiffany doll and a stuffed Chucky. I watched thiz about 100 timez and got totally bored with it. some partz are lame, but the effectz are gr8! Chucky iz funny and sayz funny stuff. I hope there are more sequels!
B00004XQ83|5.0|I heard a couple of songs from this CD on the radio and had to have it! When I bought it, I hadn't even seen the movie yet. It's a rarity for me to purchase a soundtrack where I can only assoicate the songs with the artists themselves. The movie simply reinforced the good feeling that I get when I listen to the O Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack.
B00005KB9W|5.0|From the opening hum of the crowd,to that most famous introduction..to the fading memories..this captures the legend that was Bob Marley.Arguably,in my opinion, one of the handful of truely great live outings.This was the watershed recording for Bob Marley,delivering the immortal live recording of *No Woman No Cry*and * I Shot The Sheriff*,and my personal favourite *Trenchtown Rock*.Recorded in mid 1975 in London,I have had the vinyl recording since the late 1970s..it ushered in a muscial style and revolution that influenced the British music scene from the mid 1970s well into the 80s..and established the already glowing reputation of Island Records. The set is short in comparison by modern standards but excellent in every way.This recording stands the test of time and the remastering adds a new dimension to the original recording.I rate this with *Get Your Ya yas Out*,*Frampton Comes Alive**Live At the Harlem Square Club 1963* and*One Night Only*as capturing the essence of a great *live* feel. The influence of this recording can not be overstated,as it married a political cause with that rasta spirituality and infectious Carribean beats,and delivered it to an adoring live crowd,be they somewhat *heightened* for the experience. Definately to be bought and played and enjoyed..definately a 5 star performance..as enjoyable now for me as it was in the 70s...
6305132984|2.0|The DVD plays well until the &quot;I feel pretty&quot; song and then the entire thing goes haywire.  I know my DVD player is OK.  And I checked the disk (there are none) and even washed it off.<br />The disk is defective.  Has anyone else had this experience?
B00004Z459|5.0|WOW! This cd takes my breath away. I'm not a huge fan of the rap rock genre, but these guys can really pull it off. Usually rap rock to me sounds more or less like rap with a clean guitar sound. Or all the songs sound the same like with Limp Bizkit. But Linkin Park totally pulls the act off. Chester's aggressive growling vocals blend very well with Mike's rapping. It's rare that I find an album where I love all the songs, but this is one of those rare times. These guys write about honest emotions and feelings, no sugar coated boy band material here. Just honesty and a lot of meaning. This whole album is great, the live show is even better! I recommend this album 100%, total two thumbs up material. And if you get the chance to see them live go you won't regret it!
B00003CXV4|3.0|This lackluster romantic tragedy is a weak treatment of a threadbare storyline, further diminished by spotty acting.  The story is shamelessly familiar.  Boy falls in love with girl who he learns is dying, and he becomes transformed by his love for her as she wastes away.  Kleenex stock rises.<br />Anyone who saw \\"Autumn In New York\\" with Winona Ryder and Richard Gere, released earlier the same year, probably had an overwhelming sense of déjà vu watching this film, right down to the season.  This film could very well have been titled \\"Autumn in San Francisco\\".  It was basically the same film with different topography and local color.  However, while the first was well acted with sensitive and insightful character development, this is just a schmaltzy bouillabaisse of sappiness that is spread broadly but thinly.<br />Keanu Reeves, who should have been perfect for the part, wasn't.  In the beginning of the film, he plays a high powered advertising executive with a presentation that is so forced it can only be described as robotic.  Once he wades back into more familiar waters and settles into the romantic role, he seems to be more comfortable and natural, but he still presents a character that is far to stoic to be endearing.  In contrast, Charlize Theron gives a charming and emotionally compelling performance and single-handedly keeps the film from foundering.  Theron gives her character great range and endows her with a kookiness that belies her depth.  Unfortunately, Reeves is so inert in this film that the romantic chemistry between them is as exciting as last night's dishwater.<br />Director Pat O'Connor (\\"Inventing the Abbots\\") did what he could to enliven the film with some nice location shots around San Francisco and some well assembled romantic montages (that might have crossed the line into the overkill zone).  However, his handling of Reeves was poorly done.  I have seen Reeves give numerous performances that were far better than this.  When a solid actorcomes off this uninspired, I put the blame squarely at the feet of the director.  Also, I feel that the character development was sorely lacking, with O'Connor content to present superficial skits rather than delve into anyone's psyche.<br />Though not awful, this film requires a strong cup of coffee or an incredibly sentimental viewer.  I rated it a 5/10.  Anyone who liked Keanu Reeves in films like \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"Speed\\" should prepare to deduct a point or two.  Worth a try for romance junkies.
B00003CXRM|4.0|All in all, I thought this was a fairly successful film. It is an adaptation of Homer's &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, set in the early 1900's South. It follows the journey of three chain-gang escapees, searching for a treasure that will help them get their lives back on track. What they encounter and find on their journey is unexpected, but all the more entertaining.<br />Though this film seem's very strange at times, when one considers that it is based on such a early epic as &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, it is easy to understand why it appears this way. Upon closer attention, you realize that the way the story is adapted from the original is clever and engaging. Not to mention, at times hilariously funny. The film also succeeds with its strange but fitting acting, and its beautiful settings.<br />Fans of the Coen Brothers' other works will find this movie to be a funny and unexpected escape from the boring usual fare.
B000059WH0|5.0|Is that so few will ever hear it. I picked this up on a whim almost a decade ago, and was shocked. This is a dark, addicting TOTO album. One reviewer noted a few of the great songs -- not one bad one here - but the real high note is the title track. Who would have thought that the same guys who wrote &quot;Pamela&quot; would have &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; in their blood.<br />This may be the most underrated rock CD ever.
B00003CXRM|3.0|I've been a Coen brothers fan for a while now, but this was a film I wasn't quite expecting from them. Overall, the movie was enjoyable. Homer's Odessey is a hard text to tackle, and I think they did it with their own flare. Most of the movie was good, I loved the Soggy Bottom Boys! If you are looking for the type of comedy that you are used to seeing from the Coen brothers, it won't be found here. The is not the Big Lebowski set in the south during the Depression.
B000000993|5.0|A groundbreaking piece of work by one of today's greatest rock bands.  Heavy, experimental, and a definite head trip.  This dark piece brings you through the depths of depression, torment, hatred and self exploration. It is musically intricate and lyically complex.  Worthy of listening to many times over, with each time discovering a new aspect or harmony to grab your interest.
6305622930|5.0|George C. Scott is Gen. George S. Patton Jr.  To many Americans, he has become the famous general.  Never has an actor been cast better than this.  I am a big fan of Gen. Patton and I have read many books about his life.  This movie is a great portrayal of his life.  However, it is important to know that the consultant for this movie was Gen Omar Bradley who had no love for Patton.<br />The opening speech of the film is, in my opinion, the greatest few minutes in movie history.  It's funny to note that as colorful as the language is in the opening speech, the director had to tone it down from Patton's original speech.  From this opening scene until the wonderful closing scene at the windmills this movie is perfect in every way.   The battle scenes are very good even if you consider that they were done in the 1970's, years prior to the computer generated special effects of today.<br />This movie won 7 Acadamy Awards including best picture and best actor for George C. Scott.  The soundtrack for this movie is also fantastic and will run through your head for some time after watching the movie.  Have I said that this movie is the greatest ever?  I can't say it enough and I hope everyone takes the 3 hours needed and savors this movie.
0767830555|5.0|Taxi Driver is one of the most powerful and disturbing films I've ever seen. <br />Paul Schrader's gritty screenplay is superb. He effectively creates a sense of loneliness in one of the largest, most highly populated cities in the world. <br />Schrader creates one of the most complex and disturbing film characters in Travis Bickle. Robert DeNiro also lends, significantly, to the character of Travis in one of the greatest cinematic performances ever. He perfectly captures the loneliness, complexity, and frustration of Travis. Jodie Foster gives a commendable performance as a young prostitute on the streets of New York City. Peter Boyle, Cybill Shepherd, and Harvey Keitel all give noteworthy performances. <br />Martin Scorsese uses many intriguing and unique camera angles and shots to tell this shady story; his direction really is quite good. I particularly like the long, over-head shot he used to conclude a violent scene at the end of the film.<br />Bernard Herrmann's romantic and sometimes ominous musical score nicely compliments the images on screen. <br />Michael Chapman's cinematography is also first-rate. His use of lighting combined with Scorsese's unique direction and his occasional utilization of slow motion gives the film a very surreal look.<br />The picture quality on the DVD is fantastic, especially when you consider the age of the film. The documentary is very informative and advoids being &quot;fluffy.&quot;<br />Taxi Driver certainly isn't a film for everyone. By showing you Travis's disturbing life, it will leave you feeling hollowed out but if you think you can stomach it; I urge you to give it a try.
B00004R99M|5.0|My mom took me to see this when I was just a lad, <br />and it was one of the best times that I had ever had.  <br />Last month my wife and I, we watched it with our kids, <br />and they enjoyed it just as much as we ever did.  <br />Oh, supercalifragilisticexpialidoscious, even though the sound of it....
B00001NFCY|5.0|This is great music, well-written, well-arranged, well-everything. Creed takes a lot of shots in the media because they don't have a very &quot;rock&quot; attitude, but who cares. The music's good, and who cares what some fatass 50-year old music &quot;journalist&quot; thinks anyway?
B000002AP1|5.0|When I first listened to this album I was transfixed in the parking lot of the record store.  This is pure essence rock and roll.  Search and Destroy made time stop.  This is as primal as sound gets.  Iggy heard the slamming blast of a Detroit auto stamp press as a kid--that awe, sound, that power, that primitive noise, it's in this record.  The Huron, Algonquin, Iroqouis tribal beat--resurrected here.
B000002LOE|3.0|Let me say one thing, &quot;Losing my Religion&quot; is one of the best songs I've EVER heard. It completely overshadows the rest of the album. It was the true hit of '91 (yeah you heard me Cobain). But the rest just isn't that great, really. There's nothing terrible, just nothing compares to this song. And you know, Michael Stipe isn't really a guy you wanna pattern yourself after.
B000002U82|5.0|Classic is something that transcends generations...each song is priceless; the album flows with an unselfconsciousness missing in later albums, and it is obvious that the band is having fun with this and not trying as darned hard as they did in subsequent works (like the theatrical, and sometimes tedious The Wall). I had the pleasure recently of introducing a friend (who is 10 years my junior and into the most recent Techno/Industrial/Gothic stuff) to Dark Side...what a rush to see that thrill of discovery in someone all over again! The fact that he ended up taking the album home with him speaks highly of the timeless nature of this really great work.
074322454X|5.0|This is a great, well-researched book.  This is the first Ambrose book I have read and it will not be my last.  This book is about to be made into an HBO special mini-series and promises to be a big hit if it can relay the emotion felt while reading this book.<br />This book focuses on one company from training through the end of the war.  It continually emphasizes that the training in the states is what made the elite paratrooper group so special.  The book does not scrimp on more mundane parts of the war like training, waiting in England for the D-Day raid, and after surrender duties.<br />But clearly the most mesmerizing parts are the vicious fighting role the group played in knocking out enemy positions on D-Day.  The company then goes on extended duty fighting in some of the most important battles of the war.  Sometimes these battles are intense, and sometimes they are just boring and terror-filled as you dodge artillery in the cold of a foxhole for days.<br />An interesting part of the book to me was the role the group played in Germany after the surrender.  There was much looting and unfortunately, much drinking and debauchery which led to some deaths.  Ambrose correctly relayed the point system to get sent back to the states and the severe disappointment of some soldiers, as they had to continue to serve instead of immediately coming home.<br />After a completely enjoyable read, it was interesting to read how the company has stayed in touch, and the success and failures of the company in civilian life.  I strongly encourage reading this book if you have interest in war books, books converted to movies, or books about true American heroes that made this country great.
0671027344|5.0|This book was about a boy named Charlie.  He was writing his story in the form of letters to &quot;a friend,&quot; but he wouldn't tell who the friend was.  It was his story about him and his friends, and it was really interesting, and there were a few quotes in there that were thought-provoking and brilliant.  I can't believe this was Chbosky's first novel.  I was also able to relate to Charlie, and his feelings, so it really helped me to better enjoy the content.  This book was excellent, and I think everyone should read this at one time or another.
B00004SCS1|1.0|My friend gave me this CD, saying that it stunk. Well he was right, it STUNK! These people are trying to be like Tool and it is not working. All they do is scream, scream, scream. They have no musical talent whatsoever. This CD is overrated, don't buy it. ...
0441008356|4.0|It is about 500 years in the future, humanity has spread out to the stars using relativistic starships. An archaeological dig on the distant planet Resurgam has uncovered evidence of a long dead race called the Amarantin, and what happened to them may affect the future of the human race. Dr. Dan Sylveste is in charge of the excavation, his father Calvin exists only as an electronic personality, and there is political intrigue on the planet as well. The ancient starship 'Nostalgia For Infinity' is involved with all of this also, with it's captain strangely infected with the 'melding plague', virtually unstoppable. And there is Ana Khouri, a woman who is sent to murder Dr. Sylveste, by a mysterious lady. Then there is the 'Shroud', an alien object in deep space that means nearly certain death for humans who approach it, but a few do anyway. This hard science fiction novel includes suspended animation of starship crews, robots, advanced artificial intelligence, nanotechnology, immortality, cybernetic implants, electronic personalities, mysterious aliens that are believable, and the list could go on. <br />Alastair Reynolds is a first time author but he writes like he already has wrote a hundred novels, some people are just natural writers. He is also a scientist and that is very evident in this book. This novel stretches the envelope on what is possible without violating known physics. Cutting edge science fiction like this is hard to find, and this is a 'must read' for serious science fiction readers. I found this novel to be great reading, although it was a bit long, it could have been 50-70 pages shorter, that is why I did'nt give it five stars.
B00005B4GU|1.0|It's inevitable that any band who consistently improves with every release will have to either reach a plateau or actually stumble.  Well, Radiohead fans here is your favorite band's big letdown.  The opening track is as good as anything they've ever done, but it's all downhill from there.  The album sounds exactly like what it is, i.e. outtakes from Kid A.  I can't imagine how anybody could sit through this album and actually pay attention.  I've put the record on at least half a dozen times and eventually the same thought goes through my head: \\"Is this still playing?\\"  For a while I kept expecting the hidden genius of the record to unfold but now I have given up.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I had heard many good things about the movie, &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; but I couln't help but think how ridiculous this movie was going to be since it was about ditzy blondes.  I was completely wrong.  The movie wasn't based at all on the fact that blondes are stupid, it's all about no matter what people think of you, you can reach your dreams.  Reese Witherspoon gives an amazing performance and this movie is definitely a movie you want in your collection!  It will leave you with a smile on your face and you'll walk out of the movie theater with your head up high!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|...for Moulin Rouge as a movie but the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful. I have to admit that Moulin Rouge, the film was not as good as I anticipated, except for the last hour and the  excellent music numbers, though. I knew I had to buy the CD immediately after. It turned out better than I thought. It's a wonderful mixture of pop and musical-almost Brodway-like  numbers. <br />1. Nature Boy    <br />This is an excellent song, and almost tells the story of Moulin Rouge or at least how it starts out-a boy traveling to a distant land and not expecting to find what he did at the  Moulin Rouge.<br />2. Lady Marmalade    <br />Probably my favorite on the disk. I have yet to hear a better pop song. Without this song and Christina, Pink, Lil' Kim and Mya, Moulin Rouge wouldn't be half as bright.<br />3. Because We Can    <br />This is a very fun song from Fat Boy Slim, that might take getting use to at first, but you'll become obessed with it after.<br />4. Sparkling Diamonds    <br />Nicole Kidman sings great! She goes from soft to loud in this perfect pop-like version of Marilyn's song.<br />5. Rhythm of the Night    <br />A pretty good song from Valeris-not the best track on the CD, but it's fast paced and adds to the others with it's hip-hop theme.<br />6. Your Song    <br />Ewan McGregor sings wondeful as well, I was so surprised, even though I saw the movie. This song is great, even though I've never heard the original by Elton John, I can tell from this version of it.<br />7. Children of the Revoultion    <br />Okay addition, but hardly heard in the movie. They could have replaced it with &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;, which I was dissapointed was not on the soundtrack.<br />8. One Day I'll Fly Away    <br />Again, Nicole Kidman sings so well, and this is one of the bet tracks on here. It's very slow moving at first, and then builds up to a daring climax, where Nicole Kidman belts out against the orchestra.<br />9. Diamond Dogs   <br />May take some gettinguse to, but the beat is very unique and the song original.<br />10. Elephant Love Melody    <br />Also one of the best. It's superb how they put together these classical love songs into one melody. Without this number Moulin Rouge wouldn't be the same.<br />11. Come What May    <br />I didn't expect to like this song as much as I do. It's brillant and a real masterpiece.<br />12. El Tango De Roxanne    <br />This song is so intense it's scary. When this song hit in the theatres you knew Moulin Rouge was getting better from it's first half hour of frivolous, silly song and dance-routine (although I'm still dissapointed at the absence of &quot;Spectacular, Spectacular&quot;, it was kind of a good song.)&quot;Roxanne&quot; will give you chills.<br />13. Complanite De La Butte<br />You don't know what they're saying, but it's a calm, slow- paced, nice song.<br />14. Hindi Sad Diamonds    <br />This will also give you chills because of the intensity of the song. Yet it's funky and shines a light on the whole story.<br />15. Nature Boy    <br />So-so, almost haunting version of the first track. Really not too much to say on it.<br />If you're considering buying this soundtrack, don't waste another minute. You won't be dissapointed in the least. It never leaves my CD player and brightens up my day. It will make you completely obessed with Moulin Rouge!
B0000073BG|5.0|My dad first introduced me to Renaisance when I was eight years old. &quot;Trip to the Fair&quot; was instantly my favorite. As a singer and pianist, I could, even at such an early age, appreciate the intensity of John Tout's piano prelude, Annie Haslam's beautifully pure voice, and the overall magnitude of this band. The hauntingness of &quot;Trip to the Fair,&quot; and the sadness of &quot;Ocean Gypsy&quot; are moments every person should experience. It's a shame that music has taken such a downfall these days, and that people have forgotten the capabilities of the creative mind. Renaissance is a genre of its own, combining the discipline and format of classical music, and merging it with the addictive sound and heavy rhythms of rock. I suppose that would be classical rock, wouldn't it? But, nevertheless, Renaissance has paved a sound so original and powerful, and &quot;Scheherizade&quot; is probably their finest moment.
B00005K3OT|3.0|\\"Chocolat\\" is a winsome fable, more notable, perhaps, for its mood and atmosphere than for its rather hackneyed plotting and timeworn theme.  It's true that many viewers may be put off at first by what would appear to be the anti-Christian (particularly anti-Catholic) subtext that seems to run through the story.  But, rest assured, the film ends up not attacking religion - merely redefining its terms.<br />The lovely and radiant Juliette Binoche stars as Vianne, a young unwed mother, who, with her charming daughter, enters a small, morally uptight French village in 1959.  There, much to the dismay of the rigid and intolerant Roman Catholic mayor, she sets up a chocolateri, during Lent of all times, and proceeds to dispense confections that (as in \\"Like Water For Chocolate\\") seem to exert a magical influence on the villagers who partake of them.  The chocolate is, of course, a muted metaphor for the eternal conflict that has been waged throughout history between those who view sensual pleasures as \\"sins\\" and those who see them as natural and morally neutral human desires.  The film certainly comes out foursquare in favor of the latter view, showing the dangers that can result when people become obsessed with repressing their basic human needs and end up isolating those who believe, think or live differently.  Vianne, and those who rally to her cause, are viewed as warm and loving free spirits, placed in stark contrast to the mayor and his minions who appear as crabbed, morose and intolerant cretins.<br />But \\"Chocolat\\" is less impressive for the story it tells than for the magical mood it weaves thanks to its charming setting, its spirit of sly fun and, above all, the radiance of Binoche, who demonstrates once again that she was truly made for the camera.  Despite the rather bizarre clash of accents that results, the film utilizes a vast international cast that includes American Johnny Depp, British Judi Dench, and French Leslie Caron.<br />Like many of the rural French comedies on which it appears to be patterning itself, \\"Chocolat\\" seems, at times, as artificial and lightweight as the truffles it features.  Yet, even though its message is not exactly original and radical, in this day and age when many religions seem to measure their closeness to God based on how many rules they can make for us to follow and how many groups of people they can manage to keep on the outside, it is nice to be reminded that the purpose of religion is to gather people together into a circle of common humanity.  And what better meeting ground than the one truly universal desire we all do share:  our unabashed and undying love for chocolate?rench comedies on which it appears to be patterning itself, \\"Chocolat\\" seems, at times, as artificial and lightweight as the truffles it features.

0440180295|5.0|I decided to add this after reading a few other reviews.<br />First, Vonnegut explicitly states that Billy did not begin time traveling because of the Tralfamadorians but that they were merely able to explain things to him. Billy still may or may not be nuts, wrecked by his experiences, but that's different. He first time travels when near death in the frozen wilderness behind enemy lines in WWII and he first begins talking about it after nearly dying in a plane crash many years later.<br />Second, I didn't just spoil anything because in the first few pages (after the autobiographical intro) Vonnegut lays out a straightforward biography of Billy's life in two or so pages, which can help with the rest of the story if you read it thuroughly, though I found it easy to follow anyway. As an example of how time travel is used: in one moment he's near death in a frozen German forest; in the next, he's a boy hearing music at the bottom of a swimming pool and about to pass out (and drown); and then he's a mature man visiting his mother, who is dying. All in about five paragraphs. He doesn't travel that rapidly very often but it's a good example. (There are equally good examples of funny or ironic juxtapositions like these but this happens within paragraphs of time travel being introduced to the reader so I didn't think it would spoil things much.)
B00003CXDD|5.0|I'm 17, but when I was a little girl I watched this movie almost every single day.  I'm not kidding.  My parents taped it a long time ago and even though the tape is really old, I have recently enjoyed watching it once again.  I cannot believe that this wonderful film is out of print.  There are films much less popular than this that are still in print, so why is this film not around anymore?  It is so incredibly good.  The characters, the story, the setting, and the magic all steal the viewer away.  The setting is a realm of fantasy, full of monsters, little people, warriors, and sorcerers.  The story evolves around Willow, a little person who discovers a baby that was born to be empress of all lands and overthrow the wicked sorceress queen.  Some of the great characters include Willow, played by Warwick Davis, Madmartigan played by Val Kilmer, the funny little brownies, the good sorceress, and all of the other little people.  Val Kilmer really stole the show away, doing so well at acting out the personality and action of Madmartigan.  Warwick Davis was very charming and magical(rumor says that he will appear in the upcoming Harry Potter movie).  The brownies also added in so much humor that you just can't put this movie down.  When my sister and I watched this film together a short while ago, from our very old tape, we loved seeing all of those timeless scenes, like the baby going down the stream, Val Kilmer in the cage, the two headed monster, the people turning into pigs, and so many other great things, I would prefer not to give away the plot.  And the music!  The score was by James Horner, whose mystical, ethereal music creates a very haunting atmosphere.  Several Celtic instruments were even used in the soundtrack, such as the Celtic harp.  The credits also say that Wales one of the sights for filming.  It gives a very Celtic feeling to the movie.  Some time ago, I found out that back in '88, this film somehow ended up on Siskel and Ebert's list of worst films of 1988.  I don't know why such a disgraceful action took place because in contrary, this movie is one of the best fantasy films, not just of the 80's, but of all time.  These other reviews testify of that.  My family does not have a DVD player, but as soon as this movie comes out on DVD, believe me, we will get one!
B000006045|5.0|Evocative of Tricky's &quot;Premillenium Tension&quot; and pulls you into it's deep and soulful rhythmic sweeps like a riptide.  Sweet vocal tracks are skillfully balanced with harder bass lines than previous albums.  This is the sort of music your animal side has been craving.  Mezzanine satifies your messy, bloody, even weepy desires yet sooths the beast within.
6305311463|1.0|I used to not have a movie I considered the worst of all time. I've watched some pretty bad ones, but it's hard to distinguish one movie with a ludicrous plot, bad acting, bad editing, etc., from another. But all those bad films had two things in common: they had no talent and no budget. There is no excuse for garbage like Armageddon to ever exist. But it does, and the magnitude of it qualifies it as the worst movie ever made.<br />Shallow, idiotically patriotic, insulting, and irritating are a few of its characterizations. That so many people like this movie frightens me.<br />Watch &quot;Deep Impact&quot;. It's a little sappy at times, but it's a far superior movie.
B00004Z311|5.0|I remember seeing Legend on the &quot;big screen&quot; and being absolutely stunned by the depth and texture of the film's sets, the magical feeling that seemed to leak into the theatre.  Tim Curry's &quot;evil&quot; character is fearsome, the makeup/costuming are stunning.  The princess is actually one of the few fairy tale princesses out there who isn't a complete dimwit.  (Much as I love them, they often are a bit embarassingly helpless).  Tom Cruise plays the naive &quot;young hero&quot; quite well, and his &quot;superstar&quot; personality wasn't so strong in this movie (in other words, you barely notice it's TOM CRUISE!!! like in other movies with him).<br />This movie is for anyone who loves fantasy-- wherein the plot &quot;good vs. evil&quot; is enough to define the point.  Visually stunning, dreamlike.  I loved it, and it's a definite must-see.
B00004XMVM|5.0|brillant. thats all i can say about thia movie. Vin Diesel is brillant in it and that voice!!!, it lacks no acting ability though the story line a weak in some parts, the films characters and it special effects definalty make up for it!!! buy it
B0000029LG|5.0|I really enjoy owning this two cd set.  It is amazing.  At first I only listened to the first cd, the one with all of Michael Jackson's classic, big hit songs.  But a few months after I poped in the second cd and fell instantly in love with it.  Contrary to popular opinions in here, i feel the second cd is awseome...and it just takes some getting used to, but sure enough you will be humming htese tunes.  A must have even though a bit pricy.
B00003CXRP|5.0|I'm a fan of the whole &quot;cast away from society, forced to survive without technology&quot; theme of this movie. The acting by Tom Hanks is top-notch. It's interesting to watch his character develop throughout the movie, and the fact that he has few dialog lines through the main part is also interesting, and makes him focus the acting much more since he can't define the character through his words. The DVD extras are also awesome, and provide a good watching experience.
B000002B7M|5.0|Words can not describe how great this album is or how much it meant to me growing up, so I won't even attempt trying. However, I just have to ask...am I the only one who's noticed that the keyboard intro to 'Mr. Crowley' was almost directly lifted from 'Angel (Theme)' off the first ANGEL album from 1976? It is SO similar that the band definitely could have sued Ozzy and Randy. Well, anyway, just buy this cd!!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? This nine-member symphony of carnage is probably one of the most famous newer bands out there, and they're the ones who really opened the floodgates for all the new ultra-heavy bands who are out now. A really excellent cd, every track is a keeper. The first edition of the cd was much better, however. They never should have gotten rid of Purity, which was a truly awesome track. Me Inside is a good choice, but it's no Purity.
B00004YKUY|3.0|I'll admit, it took me a LONG time to put down the bucks for this disc. My favorite band EVER without arguably the greatest rock singer ever? Hmmmm...When I did buy it, I wasn't too disappointed... until the first track was over. If this was on vinyl, I would have worn a hole through on &quot;Higher Place.&quot; It certainly ranks with the best of the band's efforts. The rest, though... Some people say &quot;too many ballads.&quot; Probably true, though a couple are actually pretty good. As a whole,though, the album left me dry. First, at 74 minutes, it's too long. A few less tunes would have made it more easy to digest. It's actually easy to forget Steve Perry isn't in the group anymore, and the more comments I hear from the band, that's exactly what was supposed to happen. Has Perry been cloned? Get George W. on the case.  In all, a good buy, if for no other reason than it makes you yearn for the glory days of the late 70's and early 80's. In fact, I'm going to listen to &quot;Infinity&quot; right now.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead...ahhhh..Now that's what I call a movie.  Of course if you want explosions, babes and you like to turn your brain off when you watch a movie, this is not for you...Rent Armageddon or something like that.  But if you like intelligent movies, something that'll make you think, then this is for you. David Lynch is a genius and this is one of his best films.  One viewing is not enough to get this movie, you have to see it over and over again..And when you're not watching it, you'll still be thginking about it, trying to figure out what you just saw. Please Mr.Lynch, Let us have a great ERASERHEAD DVD SOON!!!!!!!!!!
B000000993|5.0|This is definately a must have if you like Tool or even if you don't like Tool. This CD features 2 singles Prison Sex, and Sober. The res of the songs are equally amazing. There is also a song featuring Henry Rollins of The Henry Rollins Band called Bottom. So buy it and listen to it and enjoy.
6303477259|5.0|The \\"Pulse\\" video has to be the best live video ever, the only possible contender being (of course), \\"Live at Pompeii.\\"  I can't watch this enough times - I've tried!  The concert spans Pink Floyds entire existance, from Astronomy Domine (album only) to the complete Dark Side of the Moon (I get chills just remembering watching that part) to later material off Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell.  Can't leave out the pigs - evil pigs with laser eyes are comming out of the wall at one point.  And my god, my god - THE LIGHT SHOW!!!  The one that accompanies the end of the world will pale in comparison.  You think that Offspring concert you just went too was cool?  Son, you ain't seen nothin.  Until you've seen this footage you have never seen a Rock Concert.  Period.  BUY THIS VIDEO NOW!!!  You'll probably never spend a better (price).
B00003CXRM|4.0|This is one of those movies that will have you shaking your head throughout, not because you don't understand it, but because you can't believe how the Coen brothers strung the scenes together.  Three convicts escape from a chain gang to search for a treasure their leader (George Clooney) vows to split with them.  This is the nearly invisible thread that holds the movie together; everything else feels like a series of unrelated bits - until the end, when most falls into place.<br />At first, Clooney's acting seemed terribly self-conscious and flat - I could understand only half of what he said because of mumbling delivery.  Soon, however, both he and I grew into his role as the fast-talking, pomade-obsessed, singing leader of the gang.  Holly Hunter, as his wife, steals every scene she's in; Hunter plays this small part with just the right mix of spunk and self-righteousness.<br />The Ku Klux Klan scene has to be seen to be believed.  I didn't know whether to laugh or be horrified - the true mark of the Coen brothers.<br />Although the soundtrack seems to be better known than the movie itself, the film deserves attention in its own right.  If you're looking for something offbeat, this is your film.
6302054982|5.0|The finest film on organised crime since the 1930's. Being based on Henry Hill's unique account of his own life (the best document of its kind), it has a very rare authenticity that is otherwise only found in films such as 'Public Enemy' ('Goodfellas' cinematic daddy) which had a conviction and force that could only come from portraying events happening right there, right now. Scorcese's upbringing in Little Italy gave him an affinity with the material that no other director could possibly have. These fine ingredients gelled to perfection. Virtuoso camera work, brilliant soundtrack underscoring the visuals, razor sharp editing, fine performances from Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, Lorraine Bracco and (notably) Paul Sorvino. Do read the source book 'Wiseguy' as well.
6302293553|5.0|Even the credits are funny. You can't go wrong.
0671665707|3.0|Readers coming to this book from 'Wiseguy' will become aware of a major flaw in this account of organised crime's workings in Las Vegas from the 1960s through to the 1980s. Henry Hill was free to more or less spill the beans unguardedly and his candour and thrilling free-flowing narrative is exactly what key participants in this story still alive cannot give us (despite what the book's gushing blurb promises).This gives a patchy quality to much of the narrative and by the end the reader is left mulling as many unanswered questions as those the book attempts to amswer. There are fascinating aspects to the book (given the characters involved there could hardly not be) but ultimately the book fails to satisfy. A definitive volume on the history of Las Vegas and organised crime will surely come one day, but at the moment too many lips are zipped.

B000002C1W|4.0|I bought this album recently after reading some of the reviews posted here.  I just had to find out for myself about this album since I've enjoyed most of the music from the Waters era of Floyd and was curious about the Gilmore incarnation of the band.  Truthfully, this album would be considered a very good David Gilmore solo album, but because it bears the Floyd moniker I couldn't help but notice how some of the mediocre tracks (&quot;Dogs of War&quot;, &quot;One Slip&quot;, and &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot;) could have benefited from Roger Waters' more poetic lyrics.  That having been said, there are some rather outstanding songs on this album including &quot;On Turning Away,&quot; &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;Sorrow.&quot;  Thus, this album is not as horrible as some would make it out to be.  I get the feeling that Gilmore was trying too hard find the right balance between his own style of songwriting and that of classic Floyd.  The result is a somewhat flawed but listenable album.  Even the tiresome &quot;New Machine,&quot; &quot;Terminal Frost,&quot; New Machine 2&quot; medley manages to have some barely entertaining moments that might prevent one from skipping to &quot;Sorrow.&quot;  The album does have its frustrating moments, but it is worth a listen.  Whether or not it's worth repeated listening is somewhat debatable. I for one will have to see how much it grows on me.
0517543052|1.0|This is an example that not every book that talks about Love, God and spirituality is helpful for one's spiritual development. The author read some spiritual books, ideas got all mixed up in his head he added some of his imagination and then put them all on paper. This book if read without critical mind will create more illusions take one away from right path and will be harmful. If read with a critical mind this book of a very little use because of all the garbage one have to sort through to find anything useful.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Reviewing this movie is like reviewing Shakespeare . . . what can I really say about it?<br />Orson Welles, a genius of the craft, portrays Kane in all of his emotions and all of his incarnations over the years.  I can just listen to his voice all day, even reading the ingredients to ice cream.  Watch for scenes where he limps, since he broke his leg during the filming of the movie.  And the scene where he goes postal in the room?  That was filmed with a broken leg.<br />The cinematography is eye candy.  Will all the advantages we have today, why aren't we resurrecting the angles and framing that Welles or Fritz Lang used?  All we are getting is rehash of the Matrix for the umpteenth time.  Can we return to beauty?  Or do we get glitzed by computer generated effects at the expense of art and story?<br />The story is a jigsaw puzzle, with each interviewee providing a piece.  But putting the perspectives together we get an external view of a man.  But externally, we just see what a man does.  We read his journals, and see what he thinks and feels.  But what is a man really???
B00004Y6RO|5.0|I picked up a copy of the digipak about a month ago. It instantly became one of my favorite c.d.s i own. They just sound so different than anything else I have ever heard.

0385335482|2.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book while on holiday.  I read a glowing review at my nail shop in a People magazine (I should have known!), and bought it to bring to New Mexico.  I love London, and did appreciate reading all about the shops, neighborhoods and tube stations, but that was about it!  This character really does have a problem that could have been dealt with in a more humorous and realistic manner, but instead we are treated to a compulsive personality that never truly gets clarity.  There are also some parts of the story that don't get wound up at the end, so frustrating!  Don't waste your time (especially your vacation time!) on this borer, instead read or reread something by David Sedaris.  Cheers!

B00001ZULV|5.0|As a single-disc collection goes, this one can't get much better.  One can argue that the failed &quot;Congo&quot; should've been left off (and possibly even &quot;In Your Wardrobe&quot;) in favor of still more heavily-played tracks from the Phil Collins era, but as it stands this is an adequate career retrospective.  I personally would love to see a second compilation, which would have to include: &quot;Illegal Alien&quot;, &quot;Home By The Sea&quot;, &quot;Taking It All Too Hard&quot;, &quot;No Reply At All&quot;, &quot;Man On The Corner&quot;, &quot;Paperlate&quot;, &quot;Just A Job To Do&quot;, &quot;Duchess&quot;, &quot;Keep It Dark&quot;, &quot;Never A Time&quot; and &quot;Driving The Last Spike&quot;.

B00003TL18|5.0|What a voice-strong and gutty. This is a classic and all the more important since his &quot;friends&quot; were there and working with him. I just can't get over the Dream You and all the other standards. The video is well done, but this cd is solid from top to bottom. Great instrumental work and the &quot;extended&quot; section of Pretty Woman was worth the price by itself. There isn't a single second that you are not a part of the action. You know, most of his songs are short. However, the intensity is spine tingling and full of fun. I can (and do) play it over and over and over and...
B00003W8NM|5.0|I was always shocked when Fight Club was overlooked at the awards circuit because of its content. If people would look past the blood and acually pay attention to the detailed story they would realize that Fight Club is one of the best movies of all time. The Director, David Fincher should be praised for taking a very detailed and interesting book and changing it into a very interesting movie. The scenery is very detailed and the actors seem to have excellent chemstry with each other. This is one movie not to be missed.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is an incredible band, that is understood.  This is the best albumn they made, including Lateralus.  I'm a fan of everything that they made, but this is their best work.  As much as I would like to see them top this CD, I honestly doubt they could.  It is simply that good.  How many CD's can anyone say they own that they listen to every track?  If you simply heard one Tool song, thought it was good and wanted to hear more.... buy this CD.
6303269826|1.0|Let me say this first! This movie was not good at all! While they did have a few facts in there that people over look, or do not know. It was just bad acting, Costner mostly. And even though i like Dennis Quaid a lot. His \\"Doc Holliday\\", was just rotten. Sorry. ... ... ... I am a historian. ... ... ... The fight at the \\"OK Corral\\" Was not even at the corral!!! It took place in an alley between buildings! And, the fight was over one thing. Too many people trying to run the same organizations. They all did prostitution, opium, saloons, you name it! And the Earps did not like the Clantons and the rest of them stepping in on it. As for Doc, the person I am named after. He was brought in to take care of any \\"problems\\" that came up. And he did a hell of a job! While Doc was not exactly what you would call an upstanding citizen. We could all learn a thing or two from him about friendship! Wyatt was his friend, and he never let anything happen to him! Moreover, this film did not make Doc out to be a lawman. Nor was he ever. I do feel anyone that wants to, should study a little history. It will help you to understand thing's before you write a ... review!
B00003CXE7|5.0|I first saw the trailer for Gladiator and I never thought i would have been as good as I first thought it was. I went to the theatres and watched it and after it was over I was amazed because I have never in my life see a movie like this and withouta doubt this is the greatest movie of 2000 and one of my favorites of all time. anyways watch this classic for yourself and it will just turn your prospective of movies upside down, Russel Crowe glows in this classic.
0425180638|2.0|Patricia Cornwell is an excellent writer, but each book in her series presents situations that are more macabre than the last.  If you like mysteries that are reminiscent of film noir, then this book is for you.  As far as I'm concerned -- The Last Precinct is my last book by this talented, imaginative author.
B00000JR2A|4.0|Though nothing can beat William Gregory's beautiful Sax solos on TFF's \\"The Working Hour\\" (from the album \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\"), this album is not without its own special moments. The music is indeed rich and varied. It is sad that the fragile egos of the duo broke the group apart little by little: first with the departure of Manny Elias, the drummer with the cool hair and kickin' attitude, then Ian Stanley, and finally Curt Smith. In many ways, this album is a testament to self-destruction.<br />  No, Orzabal does not have \\"rock's greatest voice.\\" Anyone who has heard \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" or this album's \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\" and to anything of Roland's should easily conclude that Curt's is the superior of two fine voices. In fact, the balance of my favorite TFF songs are/were sung by Curt, and since his departure, the quality of TFF albums has gone steadily downhill (the only song that comes to mind since the breakup is \\"Break It Down Again\\"). Orzabal's power trip with this album stands as a showcase to his egomania and was, sadly, the driving force behind the breakup.<br />  All that aside, this album is a keeper. Not just because it is so good, either, but because it is the last true TFF album.  Though the additional tracks are not that much of an improvement over the original album version, they are an interesting look at the creative thoughts of the group.<br />  Who knows, perhaps the mellowing effects of age will bring the duo back together in twenty years for a reunion album. We shall see.
0684853523|5.0|Easy to read and understand, enjoyable;it's like having King sit down with you and discuss his life and writing. He gives practical information on writing and his own journey through the process.I highly recommend this book to aspiring writers and King fans.
1561001791|5.0|Taita became a family member and I missed him terribly when I finished River God.  Then Warlock appeared on the bookself.  I know I will feel as if I have been reunited with a dear friend.  Smith weaves a web of love, hate, deception, devotion and all the stuff that makes life delicious.  The characters will last a lifetime.  Cheers to Smith who educates and entertains!
B00004RFCM|1.0|For me, there's a lot going against this series. I expected a chick-show, but the content is just overwhelming. It's about these women who sit around and complain about dating and love and sex. The thing is, they constantly shadow their experiences onto all of Manhattan, as if what happens to them (or what they want) is pretentiously representative of the whole borough.<br />Then, the lead character constantly addresses the camera directly, without any other conversational or narrative premise. It's even worse than &quot;Malcom in the Middle&quot;.<br />It's also aimed squarely at women, and it totally misses me. But my wife didn't really find it intersting, either. &quot;I don't know if would be worth the wait a week for the next episode of this show.&quot;<br />On top of it, I'm left with the feeling that the column that Carrie is supposed to be writing is not very insightful. Presumably, she's writing about her circle of friends and their expeirences--that's premise to making Carrie's point of view interesting, isn't it? But her friends never read the column, I guess. They never mention what she's written, even when it's supposed to have been a private incident among themselves.<br />They don't seem likely friends, anyway. All they seem to have in common is sex.<br />Finally, why isn't this disc wide-format, like HBO's _The Sopranos_ discs? It seems like the video quality is pretty bad.
B00003CY5K|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish. Reese was perfect in this role and couldn't have done a better job. The acting was top notch, the cast was great and the plot was hilarious. This is a must see!
B00005JG6Q|2.0|I was a big fan of the original, as a matter of fact when it first came out on VHS it was quite pricey to order and several friends and I went in on it.  We all loved the movie and thought it was amazing animation, but somewhat confusing the first time through.  Although after a second veiwing the movie became one of my favorites.  So when I saw it available on DVD I went out and snapped up a copy, as my old VHS copy was starting to get worn.  Although after the first 10 minutes of speaking I threw in the VHS to compare how different the translation was... it's ridiculous... I pulled the DVD and quickly returned it.  For example in the first scene in the bar when the first customer walks in in the original he is asked what he wants and responds, &quot;red bennies, three of them...&quot;, the new version however contains the laughable line... &quot;give me peanuts, three of them...&quot;. It only goes downhill from there.  I thought the original VHS versions voices fit the characters much better and would recommend to anyone, who like myself owns the original, DO NOT UPGRADE!  The DVD is a total disappointment.  If you've never seen the original and want to see a classic piece of anime, then by all means pick it up, you won't notice the difference.
068484267X|5.0|As a high school teacher and a published novelist (my debut book is in its initial release), I understandably found myself attracted to ANGELA'S ASHES by Frank McCourt, himself an educator and an author.  In ANGELA'S ASHES, Mr. McCourt recounts the struggles of his youth in Ireland, his battles against poverty, and his desires for a better life.  ANGELA'S ASHES is an inspiring book that is beautifully written.  I recommend it highly to everyone.
020530902X|5.0|All English teachers, students and writers should have a copy of this book as a resource. It is practical and insightful. Steven King recommends it in his On Writing book as a valuable tool.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I thought that this movie was great.  Brad Pitts character was hilarious and so was the rest of the cast.  The ending was awesome and it was almost non stop action through the whole movie.  If u haven't seen this movie u should definitly buy it or rent it.
B0000039PW|5.0|this is da hottest cd ever.NOTHING compares to what big did on this.EVERY song is hot even the skit where he's smashin little kim.\\"everyday struggle\\",\\"machine gun funk\\",\\"suicidal thoughts\\",\\"unbelivable\\" and \\"warning\\" are the best but every song is hot.this is da one where you put it in late at night smoke a [...] and play it the whole way through.biggie takes you on a journey through his life and shows you da game along the way.Puffy gave dis [...] the hottest beats he could find.this is and always will be my favorite album.GREATET RAPPER OF ALL TIME.and if you don't belive me then why did jigga,jada,canibus,dmx and every other rapper pay they respects and they all acknowledge the fact that he was the best.RIP BIG
B00004X01U|4.0|Combining Madonna's sharp songwriting capabilities with Mirwais's rough french electronica landscapes, the 10 song &quot;Music&quot; easily pleases the ear. It is a dance record in the best sense. Madonna keeps the lyrics minimal and playful, while Mirwais keeps it bumping. <br />Highlights include the popular &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot;.
0440180295|5.0|&quot;I think of how useless the Dresden part of my memory has been, and yet how tempting Dresden has been to write about....&quot;    &quot;And even if wars didn't keep coming like  Glaciers.....&quot;  Vonnegut creates an anti-war novel unlike any I have read as he writes about Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran. This book did become a movie,  but not because it had action-scenes for John Wayne or Frank Sinatra (or Ben Affleck). So there is sex with the porno star of the era, in his dreams, observed by aliens of Tralfamadore.  There are German soldiers herding American POW's into concentration camps or making Billy dress humiliatingly as Cinderella,  yet this book really has no villains but lots of victims.  Oh, there is death,  every death story summarized by &quot;so it goes&quot;.  Billy Pilgrim's story is narrated in no particular order,  which is both bemusing and irritating, so a second or a third reading of the book may be warranted.  Do read it.  You may hate it in the end as a useless book about a useless firebombing (albeit with over 130,000 citizens -- obliterated), or  as balderdash science-fiction with an anti-war theme.  Or you may recognize it as first-rate writing.  But read it.
0804106304|5.0|I read this book when I was far too young to understand the intricacies and the delicacies that are found throughout this novel.  Having reread it recently , I came to a conclusion: The basic story is so simple, almost anyone could write a story of mothers and daughter, but I find it hard to believe that anyone could have written anything nearly as well as Amy Tan has. With stories about women who were strong, women who kept secrets, and even more, this book captures not only the relationships of the 8 women, but also of any mother and daughter. My mother recently payed me the same compliment that June's mother did to her. She told me that &quot;my heart was best quality.&quot; I sincerely thank Amy Tan for writing a story which has undoubtedly made mothers and daughters connect or reconnect to each other.
B00005K3LU|5.0|This is it the masterful film that started all terrorist films and gave them a genere. John McTiernan's fundimental action film is a classic action aventure film that made Bruce Willis an overnight star.New York City cop John Mclane is vacationing over the holidays to see his wife and spend time with his family ,his wife played by Bonnie Bedilia (Holly Gennero).But just as John Mclane is enjoying his vacation a group of terrorists , take over the 30 story highrise and declare war now tired and trapped, he is the only hope for his estranged wife and the other hostiges who are being held by Hans Gruber played by Alan Rickman. John has the experience for mortal combat and antiterrorist tactics his only support is officer Powell a officer that is on the scene. With only a handgun and what he seemingly gets from the terrorists he launches his own one man war with the terrorists. Bleeding and bruised he attacks dissapears and reappears to attack again and with the brains and intelligence of a cop if there's one thing John Mclane is it's that he's hard to kill and as tough as steel taking out the terrorists like flies in a spider web it's only a matter of time before Mclane makes the terrorist his prey. Bruce Willis plays John Mclane with style making him compareable with Clint Eastwoods Dirty Harry but infact this is the best cop movie since the likes of Dirty Harry. The specal edition has fun and interesting options such as an editing feature <BR>where you can edit chosen parts of the film it's as if you have your own film school in Die Hard, other features are sound editing and a vault of deleted scenes and a branching version of the film.If you want an action classic then this film is the one your looking for amazing special effects and incredible action make Die Hard a must have for any DVD owner so get your popcorn buckle up and get ready to be blown out of your chair!.
B00004W5UA|5.0|From the reviews, I wasn't sure if this was the movie for me. But upon the request of my friends I finially decided to rent it. It is now one of my favorite movies. There is so much more to it than violance. It's about life and bordem, pain and fun.  It's about insanity and soap. Oh, man. It's about everything. If you want to think for awhile, this movie is for you. Oh, yeah, and be prepared to watch it at least twice.
B000002MFN|2.0|Most sexual encounters are so so or really disappointing, just like most tracks on this album: easily forgotten and totally boring after the second round. But some sexual encounters are mind-blowing and inspire you, like very few tracks on this album. Well actually only one track: Erotica. The only track that shines in originality. Her sex-period was interesting, but not musically.....I give it two stars, but only because Erotica is on is.
B00005JKMO|5.0|Like everyone else out there I have not yet seen the actully ALI movie staring Will Smith, and Jamie Fox.  But after seeing a few trailers, and reading a few director/actor notes, I can fairely say that this movie will stand alone, in this new century of movies.      Its that feeling you get when you first set eyes on someone beautyful, when you get your frist kiss from that very person that made you swoon, the day you fist laied eyes on them.  The feeling that makes you grine from ear to ear. I got this feeling when i was sitting in the theather waiting to watch rushour2, a film by the way left me asking myself: Why cant jakie chan get a partner that complains 90% less than what chris tucker did.  There i was watching movie preview after movie preview, all giveing people the action apeal that so many movies do these days. When there it was.  IT took me about a minute to figure out who was playing the role of ALI, In the flim ...but i knew it was ALI.  Then i saw it, a Classic image of will smith came up on the screen and a smile came over my face.  Will smith portrays The &quot;Great one&quot; (ALI) like nobody else could have done. With the classic lines like &quot;Im a bad, bad man&quot;  and &quot;Im only 23 years old, i dont got a mark on my face!&quot;  I wanted to jump out of my seat and Yell &quot;FINALY&quot;.  finally, something real, final a story about a great man, played by a great man!&quot;  ALI, promises to be a wonderful, entertaining movie, with an eaqualy fulfilling story.  I will be the first one inline for this movie. for the generation that never had the privalage of wittnessing Ali's greatness, This movie will give them an understanding and vison unlike any of his fights ever did. Not only will one get to see the fighter, but the man behind the gloves, And what made him.... &quot;the greatest&quot;
0440219078|5.0|I thought that this book was extremely thoughtful and very touching. I think I've read it at least 10 times since I was 7! It's a good story that really makes you look farther into life. I recommend it to open minded people!!READ IT!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|Folks, this is amazing. I have waited for this series to come to DVD for about 5 years now! Finally, it has come to this beloved format. Now I can watch Manuel in clear crisp picture!!
068484267X|1.0|I AGREE WITH DIANE SCHIRF , THIS IS A REAL WORK OF FICTION.  ITS AN INSULT TO THE POOR,  THE IRISH, TO REAL MOTHERS EVERYWHERE, AND TO THE READER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BELIEVE ALL THIS GUFF. ITS LIKE A COMPILATION OF ALL THE WORST HUMAN BEHAVIOR IN THE WORLD, EXCEPT FOR THE SUBJECT WHO OBVIOUSLY IS A BABE MAGNET AND PHYSICAL WONDER FOR SURVIVING. FIRST I WAS ANGRY AND WANTED TO THROW IT AGAINST THE WALL , BUT THEN IT BECAME RIDICULOUS AND COMICAL.I KEPT READING IT ONLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT HAD TO GET BETTER, P PRIZE AND ALL. I GUESS HIS IMAGINATION WAS NOT STARVED.  HOW MANY WOMEN SWAM OUT TO MEET THE BOAT ????
B000000OPU|4.0|I've heard that Gabriel was once part of Genesis, but left early. Only because he wanted to make music his way (IMHO).  This led to his take on pop music led to this collection with two hits (Sledgehammer and Big Time).  The other songs are mostly pretty good, too.  The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is that I like most of the tracks, except the tracks after Big Time.  That's just my preference and should not take anything away from this overall excellent CD.
B00005BJPO|5.0|I got this today and am still a little stupified.  I am a newer fan to anime and this was a little bit of an overload.  It was a welcome one though as I am watching the movie a second time until I figure out the entire story.  You MUST watch it in Japanese with subtitles, its a Japanese movie that should be watched in Japanese.  Anyone who likes a good story should get this.  Its way better than any movie I have recently seen in America.
0618001905|5.0|The story of Leopold's quest for a colony, any colony, and of the consequences of being a native of his own personal feifdom is gripping and terrible.  Hochschild gives a very balanced, objective voice to this history many people would prefer to forget.  In fact, his voice is so balanced, and so objective, that as a reader I had to stop from time to time as the horror of what I'd just read sank in.  The story tells itself and leaves the reader to create his own outrage and disgust in response.  Yet for all the outrage and disgust the account generates, it equally enlightens readers to why things are the way they are now in the Congo.  The ghost of Leopold's orders and actions has reverberated down through history and will continue to affect life in the Congo for many years to come.  Seeing the beginning of the problem gives hope that there can be an end, too.<br />This is a valuable story on several levels.  First, it should be read because it is true, and truths need to be brought to light.  Second, the history is important to understand the present.  Last, King Leopold's Ghost serves as an object lesson for us to examine our own modern world, to look for and call out the maniacal self interest and callous disregard for others that made the story possible.
B0000508U6|1.0|What a sham.  Isn't anyone original anymore?  Coldplay is just another cookie cutter mainstream wannabe.  The lead singer's embarrassing attempt to emulate his vocals from Dave Matthews immediately tells me that this band lacks the guts to create anything original and progressive... If you're still looking to buy this album, wait two months since this last Coldplay \\"gem\\" is headed straight for the bargain bin.
B000050XEI|4.0|Prior to getting this album,  I felt that quality and quantity of each of Enya's albums were &quot;just right.&quot;  They did not leave me feeling that there could be more that could have been included.  Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent album to get. It's just that I thought it was on the short side time-wise.  Maybe I'm too picky in this case or maybe one can never get enough of Enya.
B00005JIZA|5.0|I first heard John Mayer interviewed and playing live on a local radio station (92.5 WXRV The River). I was immediately intrigued and did a quick search of the net for more about him. After heariong a few more tracks and hearing him interviewed on Acoustic Caf&eacute; I decided to pick up the CD. I was not disappointed. He's got a good talent for capturing what is normally treated with clich&eacute;s and triteness (ie Young Love  and Life Choices) and presenting them in a different and fresh light. If you like artists like Dave Matthews, Ben Harper, and David Gray pick this up. You won't be disappointed.
0425166805|3.0|Chariots of the Gods mentioned so many things that I'd never heard before, it was astounding! The book also got me thinking more about the great pyramids in egypt. How were they built more than 4,000 years ago when we can't even produce them today? Questions like that opened my mind to wonders I'd never imagined. That said, I still have doubts about his theory. What would advanced aliens need these things for? I can't imagine. Perhaps an ancient civilization existed before recorded history instead.
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I can't believe the hype that surrounded this release ... it is just another repackaging of the Beatles best-known songs.  Yes, it has a special 'theme', in that they are not only popular, but just the #1 hits they had.  But come on, there have been so many other Beatles compilations, some arranged more fittingly than &quot;1&quot;, which is just a chronological rundown with no thought or flow to it.<br />I'll give it credit for packing a LOT of music onto a single disc, though.  But thats about it.
B00005N5SF|3.0|Arguably the most laughable -  but not necessarily the stupidest TOS episode.  Kirk &amp; crew are physically manipulated by telekinetic jerks to perform the most embarrassing acts.  Only one act surpasses Spock's depressing ode (singing) &quot;Bitter Dregs&quot; - and that is the sight/sounds of Kirk &quot;winnieing&quot; and rearing like a horse with a midget on his back.  I laughed so hard - I cried. Wink of an eye was marginally good - especially the alien blonde hottie in the skimpy outfit.  Aliens move so fast in time, it's like Kirk &amp; crew are standing still.  Typical 3rd season mediocrity. But again, a must have for TOS purists!
0451160916|5.0|This is the first Stephen King book I ever read.  It started me on a long journey as a &quot;constant reader&quot; and stopped me from dangling my feet over the side at night when I slept and from walking into dark closets.  I actually bought this copy for my nephew, so that he can be warped in a similar fashion!  It is a great book if you like having the crap scared out of you.  It is one of his best and one of my favorites.
B000002KJM|5.0|ZZ Top's 1970 debut is an absolute treat for fans of blues rock. It's raw and hard rocking as was all 70's Top. Billy Gibbons' guitar tone is stellar as always, and he pulls of killer riff after riff and solo after solo. My favorite song on the album is Brown Sugar, which has an awesome intro with just Billy's vocal and guitar with a killer solo, after which the rhythm section comes in for the first time. Great song.<br />The CD is not as great however. It's old master and really needs to be updated. As for the echo and fake drums, I didn't notice it. I never heard the album on vinyl, so I really can't compare it. It sounds okay to me though. It's not as noticeable as later Top songs like Sharp Dressed Man or Legs. It would be really nice if Warner would remaster and rerelease ZZ Top's catalog. Until then, I will just make do with my CDs of The Best of ZZ Top, Deguello, and First Album.
B000002J20|5.0|This was to be Yes's masterpiece.  The only problem with that is that their audience had just recieved a masterpiece in &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;.  They basically pushed MASTERPIECE to a new level and some people are not ready for true majesty, true MAJESTY.  This album is incredible.  It IS Yes's masterpiece. Each song is a journey--a quest for peace.  Some of my friends say that the lyrics are horrible or that the music is &quot;scary&quot;.  They are obviously not listening to the album correctly.  If this music scares you, let me reasure you, it is the best stoner music out there because of the journeys that each song provides.  And the lyrics are meant to paint mind's-eye landscapes of underwater rainbows, marshmallowy clouds, and ancient indian ruins.  For me, the album does this and more.  It has some great solos on it too from Howe (this is some of Howe's best playing ever)and Wakeman.  The music goes from low-key accoustic work to blazing synthesizer and electric guitar passages.  There is a spiritual yearning in the songs and each can reach a very interesting and different connection inside me.  Don't be affraid to get into this music, it can be magical if you let it and if you stop worrying about the lyrics--it can be your safe haven from the rest of the world.  It creates its own world, step into it, gently.  Take it gently and grant the whole album a few listens before you make your decision.
B00005LKHW|5.0|First off I didn't buy American Pie the first time it was released and I'm glad I didn't because the ultimate edition is a well produced dvd.  It has it all: good features, 2 good transfers (full-frame and 16x9 enhanced widescreen), super cool packaging, and a free ticket (yes I said free no additional purchase needed) to American Pie 2.  Also although it may not matter to everyone the layer switch on both transfers is extremely smooth (it's a pluss to me because an ill placed layer switch can ruin the home vieing experience)....
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|I really like this cd, and the movie is on my top ten list, but it is a little repetitive at parts and it brought back too many disturbing memories of the movie to be enjoyable.
1573225517|5.0|Except (1) I'm not single and (2) I'm not British. Rob Fleming, incidentally, is the protagonist of Nick Hornby's very funny, very charming, and compulsively readable High Fidelity. Obsessed with popular culture? Have a compulsion to constantly make lists? Find yourself re-organizing your music collection in times of stress? If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of these questions, then here's the book for you.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This live album is one of the best ever.  The band is in high gear, equipped with tremendous energy in each song.  Even the ones that don't quite live up to their studio versions (i.e. &quot;And You And I&quot;)are worth hearing.  It isn't that &quot;And You And I&quot; isn't as good as the studio, it is just different textures and you may not be used to the electrified version.  The rest of the double-disc set is above anything else I have ever heard by Yes.  &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot; is a blistering hard-core jam and the first notes come so suddenly after the end of the Opening Firebird suite, that you are immediately brought into Yes's world of sky, sea, fish, and Mushrooms.      Rick Wakeman especially shines on this album with his other-wordly addition to &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;.  His other solos (&quot;Close to the Edge&quot;, &quot;Siberian Khatru&quot;) are amazing as well.  But perhaps the most amazing thing about this album is Chris Squire's bass solo on &quot;The Fish&quot;.  It's just completely insane to comprehend that he is playing a bass and not a guitar because he gets so many high notes and crazy strumming...ahhhhh!        Certain pieces of this live album remind me of some Grateful Dead jams.  Especially the opening of &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;.  This truly establishes Yes as a jam band as well as brilliant composers capable of 20-minute jams and Beethoven.  They were monsters at this time and I would die to be there at the Rainbow in London for this incredible band playing its incredible music--it is truly transcendant.
0780626966|5.0|I love these films.  I first was introduced to A Nightmare on Elm street when I was in second grade, and since then I couldn't get enough.  I just bought the set today.  It's filled with many extras.  There was one minor dissapointment though.  A Nightmare on Elm Street 5:  The Dream Child, is not quite complete.  I'm not sure if many people are aware that there is actually a Not Rated version of this film.  I was fortunate enough to purchase that edition during a video store close out.  Don't get me wrong, the film doesn't suffer from the missing stuff.  I was surprised though that the DVD release didn't honor that edition.  Otherwise EXCELLENT!!!
B00003CXV4|3.0|disappointing - i watched the 2001 version and the 1968 original back-to-back; although entertaining, the remake just does not deliver the same romance; sadly, the 1968 version is only (just recently) available in vhs; if you're a real romantic, don't miss the original !
B00003CXSP|1.0|Just when I thought Silence of the Lambs was one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen; they come out with a sequal that seemingly had an attempt to be humorous...what's with that? Audiences paid millions for this movie in the box office...the acting was good but it was, frankly, flat out dumb. Atleast the first one had depth.
B00005KHLV|5.0|I understand the main characters' disposition too well: The agony of betrayal, the never-ending despair, the unalleviated and life-long loneliness as a result of such unfortunate circumstances.<br />This movie is not a kung-fu flick. It's a drama of two persons on which circumstances, or fate, have brought them together as neighbors with infidel spouses. Upon knowing the secret of their spouses' constant absence, phsycially and emotionally, the main characters embark through a journey that hinges between fidelity, love, loneliness, and undying nostalgia.<br />Never have I watched a movie that portrayed such excellence in romantic realism. From their first meeting to the ultimate end, this movie relishes itself in realistic circumstances of fate and love intertwined with breathtaking cinematography. Of life in love with circumstances adhered to the movie, there are no happy endings and this realistic drama portrayed it as such.<br />The emotions set forth between the main characters will leave you in awe, even for those who have not been through such experiences. Certain facets of this exquisite movie are sometimes too subtle for the normal viewer, and subtlety are the main characters' traits. Thus, watch this movie carefully and distraction free. This is the first movie, of any genre, that has garnered my 5 star rating.
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie was absolutely wonderful. I am not at all surprised that it was nominated for best picture. With wonderful actors and a wonderful and touching story how could this movie Go wrong. A great movie! P.S. It's Chocolat NOT Chocolate
B00003CXP1|5.0|From the moment the movie began to the moment it ended, this movie kept me thrilled and interested! It shows the inter-twined lives of four addicts... and how they each feed and cope with their habits. Brilliantly directed and filled with brilliant actors, this movie is a MUST-SEE for anyone who wants to be absoultely intrigued!
B00005AAFT|5.0|I can not say that this is their best cd but that is only because all of their music is of supreme quality. To start any Rammstein collection you should just go from Herzeleid to setinsucht, and finally Mutter, you can throw Live aus berlin in their too. RAMMSTEIN RULES!
0670880728|5.0|Although I don't read many books, I was captivated by this one. From the first page I was laughing, and as I read more I laughed harder. Some might say that this is a woman's type of book, but I know men, which have read this and found it very funny, and true to life. The events which occur are unpredicted but still funny. This is a really good book and the 2nd book in the series is just as funny. This book is a prime example of Helen Fielding's best work as a brilliant author. On the whole I'd give this book 5 stars due to it's realistic and humorous take on life.
B00000K501|3.0|If you have ever seen RAMMSTEIN live you know that it is the ultimate rock experience. But if you havn't seen them live this movie is as close as you can get to the real thing. RAMMSTEIN RULES!
0385484518|5.0|That is how I would describe Morrie, an old man with a young heart, who faces his impending death by passing on his life's wisdom to Mitch Albom. Mitch and Morrie have written a book that will have an effect on the way you view things in your life, and may even motivate you to make some changes. I  have read tons of self-help books, and none come close to what Morrie has to say about life, and about death. Mitch has done his old professor proud, leaving a legacy of words behind that will not soon be forgotten. It is an easy book to read, I read it in one day, yet it stays with you and haunts you until you take a serious look at what it says. Morrie is a man I now feel I knew, his words strike an intense chord within. You will not be able to deny the effect they will have on you. Bravo Mitch Albom, this book is superb!
B00003CY5K|5.0|Looking for some excellent laughs? See Legally Blonde! Fabulous performance by Reese, clever script, great music... great supporting performances...
0790738082|5.0|Perhaps the best of the classical musicals on film, The Music Man is wonderful entertainment for the entire family.  Children especially love the opening train scene, and its slice of Americana is a gem.  The high energy and marvelous melody lift everyone's spirits.  Five stars hardly do it justice.
B00000I1OZ|5.0|Ever wonder why some movies hit that special spot and other make you snooze.  Well, a lot of that has to do with chemistry.  Chemistry between actors and the originality of the plot all combine to make a movie either a hit or a dud.  Only You, succeeds on that front do to the fact that Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr. have that connection that most of us only dream of.  And of course what better way to make full use of the chemistry, but set your story in the most romantic country on Earth, Italy. This very original and witty plot follows Faith, the young school teacher, as she flies half way around the world in search of her true love.  Thrown in, are wonderful panoramas of the Italian Lanscape and little subplots to make the whole experience even more enchanting.  Hopeless romantics will certainly watch this entertaining movie with awe and envy, as the star crossed lovers search for ways to please, tease &amp; win over the heart of their true love. Watch this with someone you care for and plan your next trip to the most wonderful place in the world to fall in Love...
B000001ELL|3.0|I got this album soly for 2000 Man [I heard 30 seconds of it on the Kiss website and was thusly introducted to Kiss music] and was slightly shocked by everything else. Loud churning guitar rythms, slightly growling lyrics [Gene, Charisma] and suchlike. I thought that Magic Touch was kind of sketchy, and I didn't like I Was Made for Lovin' You very much at all, but I'm not a disco person. This is good for a Kiss fan, but for someone browsing the CD store's racks, I wouldn't bother.
B000007PI9|1.0|This movie was absolutly TERRIBLE! I was laughing most of the way through. Don't get me wrong it wasn't SUPPOSED to be funny. The parts that are supposed to be funny are badly timed and rather sad. There was alot of corny 80's music and robots. Please don't rent, buy or borrow this movie unless you are planning on doing the humaine thing and SET IT ON FIRE!
B00003CXDG|4.0|If you like John Woo's style, get this movie. If you like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible, get the first one. If you like more plot and suspense movie, get F/X.
B00003CWL6|1.0|&quot;American Beauty&quot; is a new low in American cinema.  The buzz that you might have heard from critics needs to be put in perspective: You see, many of the top film professors and critics read the film text as a pointed criticism of Reaganism and the fall of the WASP male.  With this in mind, they praise the film for politics rather than power.  Moreover, the studios are trying to turn a British director into a mainstream, American director, a move which always requires a little push from the liberal-minded critics.  Furthemore, the film is problematic because it tries to present left-wing politics as a middle-American staple.  Many people would like to labor under the illusion that this scenario is all too familiar in America; but rather the reverse is true.  What exists in &quot;Beauty&quot; can hardly be labeled typical.  I've often wondered why a British director intrepreting middle American life receives less flack than when a male directs a feminist film.  Ridley Scott was criticized as being unqualified to film &quot;Thelma and Louise,&quot; because it was a feminist film, and, obviously, he was male.  But the same outrage doesn't take place from the critics when British director Sam Mendes interprets American life--he too is unqualified for a balanced take; especially since he embodies leftist politics.   But that's precisely it, isn't it? He is reinforcing a view of America that most critics would like everyone else to believe in.  It's also a little known fact, except in Hollywood circles, that &quot;American Beauty&quot; is considered a joke amongst filmmakers, just like the tag-line which equated &quot;Traffic&quot; with &quot;The Godfather.&quot;  Most people in the industry are so familiar with the politics and intrigue that was used to package a terrible film like &quot;Beauty&quot; to everyday Joes, that they write it off.  &quot;American Beauty&quot; is not really considered a classic amongst professionals, but rather by people who are too ignorant to realize they are being swept up in agenda.  There were many foreign films that easily could have garnered Best Picture from the Academy--films that far surpassed &quot;Beauty&quot; in subject and style; but they were pigeon-holed by the superflous &quot;Best Foreign Picture&quot; category, in order to keep Hollywood as the film mecca.  A film like &quot;American Beauty,&quot; however, suggests that America might be losing that claim.
B000002N3J|5.0|Once upon a time I ignored Madonna as a passing pop fancy.  I knew she could sing, but so could lots of others.  When I heard &quot;What it feels like for a girl&quot; I realized that I had not given Madonna credit for being a woman of substance.  I decided to revisit her work with an open mind, aided by advice and information from those more knowledgeable.  After I listened to &quot;Something to Remember&quot; I knew I had struck gold.  Songs of passion, songs of sharing, songs of hope.  Some songs remind me of the joy of love shared, others point out the pain caused by loves lost, loves failed.  This is an album for the benefit of humans.  I may be too old to boogie woogie, but these songs sync up with my heartstrings and confirm that I am not to old to be touched by memories of loves past, present, and future.
B00005BJPO|5.0|The movie is even better with the new voices and script. Unfortunatly the last 5 chapters do not play on my dvd player,  hopfully it's because I'm using a Playstation 2 I have to heck it out first.

6304712936|1.0|The irony of the DVD release of &quot;Amadeus&quot; is almost too much to bear.  Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, arguably the greatest composer in the entirety of human history, is destroyed by a jealous rival in this wonderful film.  His rival, Antonio Salieri, is talented enough to recognize Mozart's genius at a time when few others were capable of appreciating it.  However, because that genius overshadowed his own modest talent, Salieri chose to destroy Mozart.  It was as though Salieri was once the brightest star in the heavens, shining as brightly as Venus on a moonless night.  Then Mozart appeared suddenly, like the rising sun, blotting out all other heavenly bodies.  He both fascinated and overwhelmed his contemporaries, and only by vanishing below the horizon could he be fully appreciated.<br />This film captures Mozart's rise and fall with exorbitant sets, amazing costumes, consummate acting, and fantastic music.  I give the film 5+ stars.  The DVD however, seems to be jealous of the film it is charged with conveying, and seeks to diminish it as much as possible.<br />This is the first and only DVD in my vast collection that contains half the movie on one side of the disk, and the other half on the other side.  You must get up and turn the disk over simply to continue watching the movie!  My collection ranges from quaint, shallow films good for an occasional laugh, all the way up to masterpieces like Amadeus, and none other than Amadeus have the film split over two sides of the DVD.  Simply unbelievable.  I would never have bought it had I realized that the continuity of the film had been destroyed in this way.  I would have stuck with VHS until a DVD was produced that did the film justice.<br />As you might guess, with minimizing production costs being top priority with the producers of this DVD, there are no extras (worth mentioning) on this DVD either.  No commentary track, no deleted scenes, nothing of any substance.  Certainly, the video and audio quality areexquisite, but that comes for free with a modern film (which does not require remastering) and the DVD medium.<br />It is as though Salieri himself has reprised his role as Patron Saint of All Mediocrities from beyond the grave.  Through his ethereal influence, he helped to ensure that the greatest film to portray the life and genius of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart received the most shoddy treatment possible in its DVD release.  Salute, Salieri.
B00003CWTI|5.0|I never get very sad while watching a movie. But Magnolia did it for me. I love that the director put so much effort into the film and wasn't shy about puting his feelings into his characters. It makes me very happy that there are people like him making films, something to look forward to. I won't try to review the whole damn thing, im lazy. I'll just tell you some good stuff to make you look forward to the movie. There's about nine different maine characters in the movie, mostly all of their stories are entertaining as hell, especially William H. Macy's character. He plays this middle-aged loser type who brags to anyone who will listen about how he was \\"whiz-kid donnie smith\\" about 30 years ago. He has my favorite line in the movie \\"i have some much love to give, i just don't know where to put it\\". Tom Cruise is also good as the woman hating macho man. My favorite story centers around a lonely cop who seems like the nicest guy in the world. There is a lot more great stuff too. But like i said, i'm lazy and don't want to go into it.
B000001GBJ|4.0|Perfect candlelit dinner music.  My husband and I often sit on the sofa running our fingers thru each other's hair, falling in love all over again as we listen.  A seductive collection; as you're listening to this delicious assortment of classical/modern dream music you'll truly feel alive.<br />The haunting voice in the first song, Nocturne, will lull you into a free-floating state of being.  As you continue to listen to such lovely pieces as sensual Sigma and sweet Adagio, you'll find yourself in another world. Your senses will spring alive to the riveting pulse of The Rap.  And, to complete the enticing package, you'll end with the delicate Ode to Simplicity.<br />I strongly recommend buying this CD for yourself.  I also recommend giving it to a new mom at a baby shower (it's wonderful lullaby music), to a newlywed couple along with a bottle of scented massage oil or to anyone who's ill.  This is by-far the most stress-relieving and relaxing CD I've ever owned.  Sure to become a classic among your collection.  So, light some incense, slip into a fuzzy bathrobe and sip some wine as you slip away...
6303234844|5.0|Peter Gabriel is one of my favorites and this is one of the best concert films I have ever seen. Yes, it is heavily edited, as with most of Gabriels &quot;live&quot; videos, but it is still very entertaining. I also enjoyed the versions of the &quot;US&quot; songs better here than on the original studio CD.  If you are a PG fan, you must have this. This is the kind of concert film you can watch more than once.
B000002BQK|4.0|This cd is really good! That is basically what i wanted to say but I guess my review would be really crummy if I just left it at that. My favorite tracks are &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Butterfly&quot;, and &quot;Whenever You Call&quot;, and &quot;My All&quot;. That's all folks!!! :) Buy this cd and you won't regret it.
6302799066|5.0|This is the greatest black comedy ever and one of Stanley Kubricks best!  If you like Kubrick films and you haven't seen this, you'll love it!  But beware, this, as all Kubrick films, is not for everyone.  I admit, some parts drag on a little bit but this is surely a classic (remember the clip of Slim Pickens riding the bomb?)!
B000002AVF|4.0|I really still enjoy this cd even though I bought it about three years ago. As a matter of fact, I just listened to this today. Mariah is awesome!!! My favorite tracks are &quot;Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot;, and &quot;One Sweet Day&quot;. Gotta run!
B00000IMCU|4.0|This film does not deseve a 4-star rating.  But as a horror film it does.  If you like blood, guts, gore and all that good stuff, rent or buy this because you will love it.  This film is about zombies invading the earth, and a few people get away in a helicopter and settle in a zombie infested mall.  Excellent special effects (especially for 1978)!
B000004286|5.0|I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out and it has been my favorite movie ever since. But I know that the thing that really stood out in the movie was the amazing and beautiful music. I really had to pick this cd up. I almost could not live without it. I was really happy with my purchase. I love bag pipe music and this cd has plenty of it. I deffinately reccommend this cd to anyone who fell in love with the movie.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Red roses.  White roses.  Red blood.  Red lips.  Bars.  Reflections.  Look closer.  <br />Don't watch American Beauty when you're distracted.  More than any film I have ever seen, the cinematography and direction give details so intricate that even the color scheme has caused heated debates amongst my group of friends.  The film has everything that makes a moviegoing experience, from a pitch-perfect cast (even the Smiley Burger drive-through woman is ideal) to the masterful lighting.  Though much has been made of the mature themes of the film, any viewer who has handled The Usual Suspects (another Spacey masterpiece) or The Silence of the Lambs can appreciate American Beauty for the, well, beauty that it is.<br />The DVD provides some insight into the fascinating cinematography, but focuses more on the cast and direction.  I was hoping to learn more about the film by watching the director's commentary version, but was disappointed in that Mendes did not mention many of the details I had noticed myself.<br />Still, the American Beauty DVD is fitting for a movie of such brilliance.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead have truly given us a wonderful collection of songs to listen to for the next year or two.  Amnesiac is an improved version of its predecessor, Kid A.  Yet, Amnesiac is much different than Kid A.  It's a graceful mixture of smooth, haunting melodies and deeply moving chord changes.  The album starts with &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushed Tin Box&quot;, a perfect opening song which leads into a swirling mass of chanting around the core of the piano based masterpiece, &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;.  Other high points in the album include &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; which goes into the radio-friendly &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, and the perfectly performed favorite &quot;Knives Out&quot;.  Let's not forget &quot;Morning Bell/Amnesiac&quot;, an improved rendition of the classic &quot;Morning Bell&quot;.  This track is one of the most, spooky, haunting songs you'll ever hear- a five star experience.  The album ends with a big bang with the incredible &quot;Life In a Glasshouse&quot;(What a title, huh)-a dixieland funeral march, spiced with a light jazz touch and Thom Yorke's beautiful voice. Yorke's voice sparkles thoughout the album and Radiohead shines brightly on Amnesiac, although the album itself is pretty damn dark.  Nevermind Kid A(if you didn't like it)-this is a whole new experience and a damn good album easily rivaling &quot;The Bends&quot;.  Get it.
B000056ULS|5.0|Dido, the new artist, has taken the world by storm. This artist was first released to the world in 'Stan' by Eminem, which had excerpts of 'Thank you', but she held no empty promises, as her albumn has more potential than any other yet. Without being old fashioned, mainstream pop or just odd, Dido has combined the feel of Loreena McKinnett, and added the voice, which is unique in many ways, but similar to Sinead O'Connor. 1 - Here with me - the theme to the TV series 'Roswell'. Good effort, but a little bit mainstream. 4/5. 2 - Hunter - a nice catchy piece about loss of expression. Poetic in a nice way. Love it. 5/5. 3 - All you want - an interesting piece, at first strange, but it grows on you. The theme doesn't quite fit the tune, but relaxing otherwise. 4/5. 4 - My lover's gone - definitely one of the best tunes in the cd. Sounds very traditional, although not too original. Very relaxing, and has an oriental feeling to it. 5/5. 5 - All you want - more pop, deals with the common theme of heartbreak, but it's always nice to see a song like that with some promise. 5/5. 6 - Thank You - popular theme, used in Stan, and as the Sliding Doors closing theme. Somehow it sounds better in Stan, where the depressiveness refers to something. 4/5. 7 - Honestly Ok- a curious piece, very useful when everything goes wrong. 5/5. 8 - Slide - Beautiful. Voice shines out and the background is minimalized for the best effect. 5/5. 9 - Isobel - My favourite. Beautiful drumming. Smooth voice. Soothing lyrics. Stunning tune. Brilliant. 5/5. 10 - I'm no angel - this is supposedly what the album was named after. It's not hard to see why. The Dido's voice shines better in this tune than any other, and the words are humouring. 5/5 11 - My life - Somehow i get the feeling i've heard this before. Nice anyhow - 4/5. 12 - Take my hand - Love the violins. Gives the piece a roomy effect. The piece is great, but a little too long. 4/5.

B00002R0MC|5.0|Four CDs, an informative booklet and a solid &quot;cube&quot; box...why wouldn't you buy this?  If you're a Bob fan, then you owe it to yourself to buy this collection.  It's got all the songs--even those hard-to-find selections.  From &quot;Simmer Down&quot; to &quot;Redemption Song&quot; and everything in between, this collection really HAS IT ALL!<br />If you're not a serious fan, or if you're just getting to know Bob and don't want to spend this much (although it's really worth it), then you should probably just buy &quot;Legend.&quot;  &quot;Legend&quot; is the most popular greatest hits collection.  However, those are the really over-played, over-popularized selections.  The songs in the &quot;Freedom&quot; box-set are the songs that illuminate the real Bob Marley.<br />Poet, prophet, revolutionary: Bob lives.
0553106635|5.0|If truth be told, Tolkien's Lord of the Ring is never as exciting (or gruesome for that matter).  Martin's  Song of Ice and Fire is so rich in content that, it makes the reader wonder why he or she isn't reading 10 novels at the same time.  Indeed, it would probably be fairer to review A Storm of Swords in 10 distinct sections.<br />1) Catelyn's outing turns out to be tragic and heart-rending, in Stark contrast (pun intended) to the triumphant conclusion to Book 1: A Game of Thrones.  A glimpse of hope is all that remains in the epilogue.<br />2) Tyrion's intrigue is wry and bitter as ever.  All the same, the unexpected trial by combat towards the end is a shattering experience.<br />3) Daenerys's campaign in the east is easily the most exotic part of the book, as well as the bloodiest.<br />4) Samwell's ordeal in the snow is so painful in the beginning that the reader would naturally wish it to end as soon as possible.  Of course, Sam, reminiscent of his namesake in Lord of the Ring, would turn out to be influential in his own way.<br />5) Bran's quest is relatively subdued, after the narrow escape in Book 2: A Clash of Kings (which must rank as one of the finest hours in the entire series).  By the way, where is little brother Rickon?<br />6) Sansa's tale starts out at a leisurely pace.  The adventure quickens up little by little, until it is rushing through so fast that one may fine it hard to grasp what is happening in the closing chapters.<br />7) Jon is the reluctant hero who is driven along by momentous events.  His achievements are perhaps a little bit over-dramatic.<br />8) Davos is another hapless fellow.  It just makes you feel sad to be the good guy.<br />9) Jaime no longer acts as the arrogant anti-hero in the limelight.  These days he appears to move around in the background, playing a supporting role to the main storyline.<br />10) Arya's aimless wandering across the countryside is still the weakest link in the series.  Who knows, perhaps there are great things to come in future instalments...<br />Admittedly, it is difficult to rate a series objectively.  (Those who don't enjoy the topic must have already dropped out in Book 1.  Only loyal fans will likely read and rate a sequel, so a somewhat exaggerated rating is to be expected.)  If one is to find faults in the book, there are indeed a number of criticisms which can be readily made:<br />A) There is the glaring problem of the majority of the cast being murdered over a short span of time.   (Okay, the interesting question has arisen: who will be the last one left standing?  I can see the fans already putting their bets on Jon and Daenerys.  Hopefully, the treacherous villains will also meet their ends soon enough, notably the Freys and Boltons.)<br />B)  The sub-plots are becoming so complex that the author needs to tie up many loose ends in a rather abrupt manner.  (There is just not enough time and space to cover the Greyjoys, for instance).<br />C) The main characters are beginning to show conflicts in their personality traits.  For example, the impulsive Jaime has become quite thoughtful, whereas the normally crafty Tyrion is going to take some rash action.  Daenerys is now kind but cruel.  And Arya, well, is as inconsistent as ever.<br />Nonetheless, the above imperfections will not distract from the fact that the Song of Ice and Fire is the most enthralling fantasy series to appear in recent years.
0446677450|5.0|...This is a great book, not so much a great read, but the idealogy and lessons are perfect. My wife even read it and loved it. Part of it is in a story format relating to his life experiences which she loved and the rest is in a straight forward informative format which i like. This book should be a mandatory purchase as you can learn alot from it and use it in your every day life. I highly recommend buying this book, Cashflow Quadrant, Guide to Investing, and Rich Kid, Smart Kid. I have read them all in that order. They are also know as Rich Dad 1 through 4. They seem to gel together as one big book split into 4. Buy them all, you won't regret The books make perfect sense.

B00001OH7X|5.0|This album has been ignored in a very thankless fashion. It is the last, and to some, the weakest link in the 'Berlin Trilogy'. It's unfair to characterize it as the odd man out, though. The songs have a strong inner logic and manage to follow coherent themes. The instrumentation is wonderful... some of the strongest and sparest rhythm work is here (thaks to Carlos Alomar). There is a beautiful old world feel that suggests the lonely atmosphere of travel in far-off places. 'African Night Flight', 'Red Sails' and 'Yassasin' all suggest this. There are also pop gems: 'DJ' and 'Boys Keep Swinging'. It might take a while to see the influence of this beautiful album... listen to the Au Pair's version of 'Repetition'.
B00005MAM2|5.0|There's a million reviews on here already, so I'll keep it short and sweet.  The new dub finally does the movie justice, the extras are plentiful and great, and this is the best anime ever made.  There's no reason NOT to buy this.
B000002MFN|4.0|This is the overlooked and/or misjudged  of all Madonna discs. But it happens to be one of her finest achievements. The disc came out in October of 1992, but carefully listen to it, and much of it's heavy bass lines and club beats are heard in alot of the popular music being played now in 2001 !!! Doesn't that give you an idea how important, and inspirational a recording this is. I hope so ! An essential recording of the 90's and a must have CD !!!
6304493681|5.0|This was the first DVD that really showed what anime was capable of in this format.  All anime on DVD should strive for this level of quality, both in terms of video and audio, and in content and extras.
B00000272N|5.0|This was the first Alice In Chains album that i got, it was just awesome.  I listened to it every free second that i had for about 4 months, at this point I got into the Dirt Album.  This album is probably on my top 5 all time favorites, it speaks so clearly.  I love it se much because it is more raw, the entire record shows the unpolished side of AIC, which i love because it is a lot of straight forward rock.  Obviously &quot;Man In The Box&quot; is a classic and its not possible to become tired listening to this song.  Though &quot;Man in the Box&quot; is the classic, by far my favorite song on the record is &quot;We die Young&quot;.  If you like Alice in Chains even remotely, you will love this record, in my opinion it will stand the test of time forever.
7119005901|5.0|[This review is actually for the unabridged Moss Roberts translation]<br />This book lives up to its reputation as a source-book for Chinese adventure, politics, history, culture and just plain swashbuckling fun. For the translator, it is a work of a lifetime - this comes from an amateur sinologist who remains daunted by the original texts of works such as Three Kingdoms. Roberts joins David Hawkes in the all-time Chinese translation hall of fame.<br />For those interested in an introduction to the drama and adventure that provide the framework for Chinese thinking about large issues such as nation-building and nation-destroying, love, honor, war and peace, this is the ultimate guidebook. Long before Gibbon wrote the &quot;Decline and Fall ...&quot; and Asimov wrote the Foundation series, the Chinese were obsessed with the process of dynastic change and transformation in their own country. It is impossible to overstate the role of this work in Chinese culture -- it is as if everyone in the West actually grew up reading -- and loving -- the Iliad and the Odyssey. In the sweep of history, though, the personal is not lost. Personalities large and small march across the scene and the reader is swept up in their strivings to find a place and something to strive for as the structure of the world turns upside down. For the great Han Dynasty is falling, and no one knows what new configuration will take its place. Military and political geniuses, opportunists, men (and woman, who play a significant role) of cruelty and vision emerge to strive in a chaotic arena, seeking to make their mark on the new order to come. In this sense, Three Kingdoms is a human story which repeats itself again and again, but this is one of the bejewelled versions.<br />Roberts' translation is accompanied by extensive endnotes, which are fascinating to the Sinologist, but which cannot help but distract from the action. Reserve them for later perusal. Finally, the translator has done a tremendous jobof translating the poetry in the book - often used to eulogize heroes and martyrs who give their lives out of loyalty to their leaders or who go down fighting in a losing cause. These bits of verse help to cast the necessary sense of the futility of human strivings which pervades this work and the Chinese sensibility generally. The heroes see their own deeds as tiny drops in a great river of history, and their names to be forgotten in years to come. If Cao Cao, Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang only knew how Luo and Roberts have extended their memory in times and worlds they could never have imagined.
0375703861|4.0|I actually found the book very entertaining in the first half (of the 400+ pages) when it talked about Archie and Samad and their families. However, by the second half when the focus is on the Chalfens, SuperMouse and the weirdness of animal rights activists, Erie's sudden sexual involvement with the twins, and the meandering Jevohah's Witness' speeches, the book loses steam. The ending is kind of interesting but rather sudden after the rambling of the last 200 pages. I also felt that the way some words are joined together to make a more descriptive word, the manner in which some comments are itemized, and a certain elliptical way of approaching a subject all borrow from Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things. <br />As an Indian I thought the Indian/Bangladeshi references somewhat confusing/inconsistent. Some examples: <1> How did Mangal Pande - a caste Hindu (and the mutineer who \\"started\\" the First War for Indian independance) end up with a great-grand son Samad Miah who is a pure Muslim? - This made no sense to me at all and I kept hoping that there would be some explanation during the course of the narrative. <2> How did Samad meet Alsana (his future wife) in Delhi (which happens to be in India) in 1973/1974 when Alsana's family is from Bangaladesh? Bangladesh was formed in 1971 (after a war with West Pakistan, East Pakistan broke off to form Bangladesh). Did Alsana come all the way to Delhi in India to meet Samad? <3> Members of KEVIN (a terrorist Islamic organization in London), have members with distinct Hindu names - like Brother Rakesh. <4> During the 2nd World War, how could Samad Miah have been in the Royal Air Force, then become injured in one hand and then be shunted to the Army all by the age of 17? I know its just fiction but I can't imagine such 17 year old war veterans exist even in stories. Especially because Samad is from India with a college degree in Biology (or something - this means had to be at least 20 years old) and joined the Air Force asan officer.<br />Ultimately, I think it is a GREAT read. But keep an OPEN mind!!!
0767802470|5.0|I first saw Das Boot as a mini series on British TV.  A colleague knew of my passion for submarines and recorded the series when I was working out of the country for several weeks.  I shall be enternally grateful to him (thanks, Colin!).  This DVD is the &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; of underwater war - it's portrayal pulls no punches.  With the superb sound on the DVD you find yourself curling into a protective foetal position when you are under depth charge attack.  You truly believe you can smell the sweat, the 'head', the rotting food and the chlorine gas when you are trapped on the bottom of the unforgiving sea.  Listening in German, the language of the U-boats, is the only way - the tone and emotion of language can be universally understood.  You don't need to know the words to understand their meaning.  Read the English subtitles when you want to check your understanding.     Like &quot;Hunt for Red October&quot; this is a superb movie that pleases submarine buffs, AND is a gripping thriller for those who are not especially into subs.  Even when you've seen it before, the last scene still leaves you feeling stunned! Get this DVD, and live in the stark, realistic and noisy silent world of the men doing their job of war.
B000059PQQ|4.0|This movie was made in the year I was born, so it's gotta be good right?  Right.  I must admit I was curious, not only because it starred Ewa Aulin, whom I'd first seen in Joe D'Amato's Death Smiles On A Murderer, but it co-starred John Astin, Marlon Brando, Richard Burton, James Coburn, Walter Matthau, and Charles Aznavour!  What a lineup!<br />It turns out that those five all play exaggerated cariacatures of their roles, the uncle (Astin), a mystic who travels across the country in the back of a diesel truck (Brando), a drunken poet who struts like a rock star and whose hair blows constantly as if having a personal wind machine around him (Burton), a surgeon whose operating theatre is like an actual theatre, complete with audience looking down at his performance (Coburn), a general who has been airborne without the company of women for way too long, and a hunchback (Aznavour), all of them trying to score with Candy.<br />The opening scene is a true stunner--the appearance of a ball of heavenly light in outer space, the scene shifting to various galaxies, with the heavenly light coming to the familiar blue-green planet of Earth.  The camera then pans along a desert, a stretch of cracked earth, and then the ball of light materializes into a covered white sheet.  The sheet unfurls to reveal our beautiful heroine--Candy Christian, who gazes at the camera with a dazed but sensual look.  She gives us the briefest glimmer of a smile, nothing more.<br />While the next scene revealed that she was in her father's class daydreaming and that she was an Earth girl, I kind of wonder if she was an extraterrestrial, and that scene told of her arrival to Earth.  The Byrds' &quot;Child Of The Universe&quot; playing over the closing credits also lend credence to that theory.<br />The 60's rock guitar score provides a bit of nostalgia, of a style of music and movies that bely a period long gone.  And Candy predates Star Wars by nine years in having only the opening titles without launching into the credits.<br />Standout scenes--In the hunchback's hideout, the hunchback's friends douse them with pillow feathers (ground shot looking up) while they are making love on a piano (ground shot), whose strings ring with a discordant sound provide a psychedelic moment.  And the various of bogus mystic Grindle (Brando), as he and Candy bend themselves into awkward sexual yoga positions, with the sheets squirming amoeba-like inbetween each position change.  His parable of the pig and the flower seems a cynical denunciation of the classic princess and frog fairy story.<br />Candy is the most decent of all the characters in that movie.  If she isn't being accosted by all these males trying to get into her pants--including her own uncle (!!), she is arrested by a pair of Mutt and Jeff cops, verbally abused by other females (e.g. the doctor's mother, disguised as a cleaning lady, or the doctor's chief nurse and chief piece of skirt, who is jealous of her).<br /> The sick twist ending in the book is diluted somewhat in the movie, but it's there nevertheless.  Then there's the final scene of her walking among the people who took or tried to take advantage of her in the scene not unlike a convention held by the Society of Creative Anachronisms, with her pure white virginal robe gaining a flower print and her head gaining a crown of flowers.  Were the flowers a symbol not of love but of the stains of &quot;human beings&quot; that soiled her, or did the flowers stand for the universal love she believed in?  And with the starfield scene reappearing at the closing credits, did Candy turn back into that ball of light and set out across the universe for somewhere more civilized than this sick planet Earth, where she was besmirched over and over?<br />Finally, I'm sick and tired of reading all these negative things about Ewa Aulin.  Okay, so she looks like rape-bait with that innocent look and short skirt, speaks like she was drinking Nyquil like it was Coca Cola, and eyes that alternate between being drooped as a result of said Nyquil and that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look.  The point is, she succeeds as that well-meaning idealist or alien who truly believed in that idea of giving freely of oneself. After one look at that dazed sensual gaze, all I want to do is just hold her in my arms and tell her I love her for what she is.yes that alternate between being drooped as a result of said Nyquil and that deer-caught-in-the-headlights look.

B000002LSV|3.0|ZZ TOP is a great rock/blues band, and this one is OK, but it is a LATE ZZ TOP greatest hits. Only relatively fresh stuff here. Old-ZZ top is much better than the material here, but if you dig &quot; Sharp-dressed man&quot; you will like it. By the way, the best song here.
B000002KGT|5.0|This album has probably been listened to and reviewed by millions of fans, thousands of times. It really has the power that only a few rock/pop records have had in history: the power of surviving through the years and becoming an album that's part of the world's mutual soul. Everyone who has been into a love relationship can easily feel related somehow to at least one song in this album. The passion that came into the songwriting and recording process is absolutely amazing. <br />This successful Fleetwood Mac line-up had amazed North America with their first self-titled album together. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, together with Christine McVie, had proved to be a pretty much more than a competent trio of composers and singers. Each one of them had a distinctive way of presenting the songs to the public, and yet the music and the instrumentation glued together by John McVie's killer bass guitar and Mick Fleetwood's incredible drums and percussion made the audience feel the band as a huge whole. And then everything broke up. The love relationships simply fall apart (the McVies got divorced, Stevie and Lindsey ended their long term relationship, and Jenny Boyd, Mick's wife, began cheating on him), and the band had to take all these hard feelings to a recording studio, and try to make decent music. Based mostly on this desilutions and vivences, the lyrics to the &quot;Rumours&quot; album are outstanding and very touching.<br />Christine McVie's tunes, for example, show what a beautiful lady she is. Passing through a horrible time with her husband, her feelings were not of anger or pain... She was just wishful that everything could work out well for his ex-husband. &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, often seen as a hopeful anthem, is more like a lovely way to say &quot;goodbye&quot; to him... It was also a huge hit, reaching #2 in the US, and being later converted into Bill Clinton's official campaign theme in 1992. So, it was also catchy, just like &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;, on which we could see that she was moving on, looking for another way to find the happiness she couldn't find in John. The great electric piano riff also sustained this powerful rock song and made it another top 10 hit. &quot;Oh Daddy&quot;, Nicks' favorite McVie song experiments with lovely percussion and acoustic guitar sounds, and a gorgeous lyric about Mick Fleetwood. And &quot;Songbird&quot;, the most delightful moment of the album, makes one cry. Her voice, only joined by a piano and a slightly hidden acoustic guitar, is just thrilling, and the lyrics are a song of joy and hope. <br />Buckingham and Nicks were clearly breaking up and speaking to eachother in this album's songs... In fact, &quot;Second Hand News&quot;, the opener, sung by Lindsey, hides behind the happy &quot;ba-bam&quot; solo, the horrible feeling of isolation and losing the loved person, and a slight touch of irony, which is also appreciated on the huge rock and roll hit &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;. And the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, sustained by Lindsey's gorgeous spanish guitar work, shows his intention of moving on and going on with his life. Powerful lyrics on the three songs.<br />Stevie Nicks is outstanding. Besides the pop/country ballad &quot;I Don't Want To Know&quot;, she writes the only Mac #1 US hit single &quot;Dreams&quot;, a song that's full of kind feelings and deep poetry, and also an amazing set of vocal harmonies. Plus we get &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot;, Stevie's ode to herself, a woman overwhelmed by drugs, the weird light of fame, and her personal disaster. Plus, &quot;Silver Springs&quot;, a song written and recorded during these sessions, was not issued on the original CD, but appears on the DVD edition. We had known this amazing ballad in its live &quot;The Dance&quot; version... either way it's just breath-taking. One can almost be driven to tears with it. It's a direct yet poetic way to tell someone &quot;you'll never forget me&quot;. Stevie knew how to do that.<br />The group felt it was a hard time. They foresaw it on &quot;The Chain&quot; (the collective effort from &quot;Rumours&quot;) with verses like &quot;damn your love, damn your lies&quot;... They decided to keep on working despite the hard times, and they came up with one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Plus, they demonstrated that love never ends when there's so much great music to survive through it. So now, more than 30 years later, we can still hear them saying &quot;I love you, I love you, I love you like never before&quot;. They felt love for eachother, and love's flowing through this album. If you've ever been in love, you'll feel this album as an amazing accomplishment.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of radiohead must have this album. This album takes you places you have never been before. It is a very moody and melodic journey into the abyss of the insane and twisted view of society. This may not happen right away but after a few listens this album will have you wrapped around its finger. Anyone who thinks that it is crazy in comparing radiohead with pink floyd is crazy. There will never be another creation like ok computer because no one will be as open minded and talented as yorke and co. Tracks that stand out are karma police, paranoid android, no surprises and lucky.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I just got into anime about a year ago, and finally got this from amazon today.  It is a great movie.  I have heard that the best 3 anime titles are Akira, Ghost in the Shell, and Princess Mononoke, and this is the best one outta those.  It has the deepness of Ghost in the Shell, without the boring, unnecessary jabber that it consists of (I don't like Ghost in the Shell very much), and the extreme action of Princess Mononoke (which I like very much).  And despite what many people say, it is not that violent.  That's a good thing.  All-around, this is an excellent movie, with pretty good animation.  Oh! and the DVD.  I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of the DVD.  The picture looks as clear as can be and the sound is excellent.  One of my favorite aspects of this DVD is the great interactive menu pumped up to full volume in surround sound and hearing the motorcycle sounds when you pick an option.  It's amazing.

B000059QWJ|5.0|I would put \\"Metropolis 2000\\" up there with S&amp;M, it is a must have for anyone who liked \\"Scenes from a Memory.\\" Dream Theater disappointed me with their performance on \\"Once in a Live Time,\\" but this more then makes up for it, they play out better then on the original and Portnoy just nails that solo at the end.      You can also get a chance to hear the band comment on their masterpiece.  It is fun hearing them talk about it.  You get the feeling that you're special, it is like they are addressing you.  Another amazing thing is Portnoy directed it.  He is a very talented guy and I think that was his first DVD that he directed.  Also if you know the album then seeing concept footage along with the music gives you chills because it is so vivid and fits in completely.  It adds a whole new aspect to it.      In conclusion \\"Metropolis 2000\\" is one of the best live DVD, and is at the same caliber as Metallica's S&amp;M.
1577311523|5.0|I was attracted to the title of this book, and when I picked it up and read Eckhart Tolle's first words, a description of waking up in the middle of the night years ago filled with dread and an unnameable fearfulness, I thought: &quot;This is me&quot;.  When I returned to the bookstore a few days later to buy it, ALL of their multiple copies were sold, as was another bookstore's.  Three local libraries had it out on loan, with a waiting list to reserve it. This is a book that connects to people. The premise of &quot;The Power of Now&quot; is that, rather than USING our minds, we have grown into a society that is used BY our minds, trapping us in a neverending cycle of repetitive, negative thinking that totally absorbs us out of ourselves and any awareness about the miraculous moment we are in RIGHT NOW.  This is not a new concept, and the author is admitedly influenced by the teachings of the Buddha and &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;.  What makes his approach so remarkable (aside from his clear, vital writing style) is a simple question-and-answer format that Tolle has drawn out of years of teaching. Tolle presents probing, often argumentative questions raised by his students, and then answers them with eye-opening truths.  The book is also notated throughout for moments to stop reading, put it down, and get a feeling of the message that's been presented. And it's these moments NOT reading, but allowing yourself to be conscious of what you've read, that really opens the ideas for you.  &quot;The Power of Now&quot; is so vastly superior to other books of its kind, it is staggering.  While I am currently relaxing my way through a third reading, none of the philosophy of &quot;Now&quot; is in any way promotive of obsession or in conflict with ANY religious or spirtual belief, as a previous reviewer seemed to suggest.  I will be buying a LOT of these for holiday presents.

6300263614|4.0|In this first movie to actually carry the word &quot;Cannonball&quot; in the title, was penned by the genius of Brock Yates, who in 1971, organized and raced in the first &quot;Cannonball Run.&quot; Burt Reynolds in his comedic element as &quot;J.J. McClure&quot; who decides to make this trip to California in the guise of an ambulance driver. At his side, is Dom DeLuise who occasionally drifts out of reality when the going gets tough into a self-contrived super hero named &quot;Captain Chaos.&quot;<br />Other stars joining in the challenge are Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, driving a Ferrari dressed as priests.<br />Adrienne Barbeau and Tara Buckman provide some stimulating appearances as Marcy and Jill in a Lamborhini that looks somewhat like Darth Vaders personal space ship.<br />There's an hillarious fight scene towards the end of the film featuring Peter Fonda and Jackie Chan that will keep you smiling for days.<br />Even after twenty years, still wonderfully refreshing and entertaining. Don't miss it.  :)

B000000WHH|5.0|Culture Club's 1983 sophmore hit was a follow up their 1982 debut &quot;Kissing To Be Clever,&quot; and was their most successful album.(They'r both great but George admitted that instead of writing/singing material he really wanted, he just did what was popular at the time-not so with this.) This was a multi-platinum success. Culture Club was more than just some &quot;pop band,&quot; they had their heart and soul-including Greorge's beautiful smooth, mellow counter-tenor. &quot;Colour by numbers&quot; proves that, mixing pop, rock, country, R&amp;B, soul, anthems, ballads, and fantasy story telling. It's true that many of these songs were aimed at his then-boyfriend Jon Moss, the drummer of the band. I first heard this album while cleaning my apartment (it can really pass the time), and having it on CD and ct, it's great on both. Opening beautifully with their multi-platinum smash single, the cheerful, country-like &quot;Karma Chameleon&quot;4:11 (which is funny since when George presented this to the band they hated it, and it became so big). &quot;It's A Miracle&quot;3:25 is another cheerful, happy tune (which he wanted to call &quot;It's America,&quot; but the band made him change his mind). &quot;Black Money&quot;5:19 is about them realizing the cost of fame. (During the VH1 storytellers, he said from the age of 10, he strived to be the center of attention, and thought once he became rich and famous, all his problems would go away-which wasn't the case.)Next is the mellow, 90's sounding &quot;Changing Every Day&quot;3:18, and George is known for having a tremendously soulful voice, and it shows in &quot;That's the Way (I'm only trying to help you)&quot;2:46 a tribute he wrote for and about his Mom. They lend their R&amp;B tribute in &quot;Church of the Poison Mind&quot;3:29 (before I knew about Helen Terry, I thought this was Aretha Franklin singing), and then to the smooth rocker &quot;Miss me blind&quot;4:31. Next is my favorite, the story-telling anthem &quot;Mister Man&quot;3:36, and then the Aisan sounding &quot;Stormkeeper&quot;2:47. Closing is the beautiful, haunting, soulful &quot;Victims&quot;4:56 At a time like this George really should have began a solo career like stevie nicks did in Fleetwood Mac instead of releasing their 3rd &quot;Waking up with the house on fire.&quot; But still, enjoy this beautiful treasure of an album!
B00004RF9I|3.0|The title says it all. I mean, if you want to be depressed, watch this movie. It has a good story and all and Faye Dunaway is hot, but it doesn't do much for me in the viewing catagory. But, I gave it 3 stars for &quot;I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore.&quot;
B00004RFFS|5.0|As a fan of author Anne Rice, I was anxious to see \\"Interview\\" when it made its cinematic debut, but I was very skeptical that the movie would be able to live up to the novel.  Since Anne Rice herself adapted the screenplay, it was very true to the original spirit of the story, and the ensemble cast is outstanding.  The only cast member that didn't suit the character in the book (although he gave a commanding performance; had you not read the book, you wouldn't have any problem with this casting) was Antonio Banderas as Armand (Armand was supposed to be very young, cherubic and Auburn-haired).  In addition to the engrossing plot line and the top-notch performances by all of the actors, the visually stunning use of light, color and fabulous period costuming as well as the understated special effects (edited so well, the effects are not easily noticeable as such) make this truly entertaining.  The DVD picture is very clear and sharp (I did not find the Chpt. 15 glitch distracting), and the DTS sound (especially in surround) is phenomenal.  The DVD also contains great extras - especially rewarding are the interviews with all of the principal cast members, with the director and with Anne Rice, and the complete Director Commentary.  If you liked the movie, you MUST see the DVD.  Learning how attention was paid to every production detail by every one involved in the movie (for instance; Stephen Rea (my hero!)spending a great deal of personal time studying how French Theatre of the Macabre performances were actually delivered in order to accurately portray the vampire, Santiago) makes watching this movie even more enjoyable.  (Is there actually a woman somewhere who wouldn't lose her soul to at least one of these &quot;vampires&quot; (Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Stephen Rea, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater)? This is a good one for a &quot;girl's night in&quot;.)
B00004R99U|5.0|Audiences seem to be split concerning this movie, they hate it or love it. Personnally, I loved it much more than the original which I don't own. The animation is exceptional for straight-to-video release and the songs are as wonderful, if not more than those of the 1995 flick (I have a soft spot for &quot;Where Do I Go From Here&quot;). This is also one of the first Disney movies I actually rented before buying it. This story, although still historically unaccurate (Pocahontas is supposed to die a few days after they go on the boat *There won't be another sequel*), is very cute and has hilarious moments. In my mind, it would have been a hit in theatres. <br />This movie is remarkable and well done compared to many Disney sequels. Let's go over them with my ratings:<br />The Return of Jafar: I hated it 0/5<br />Aladdin &amp; The King of Thieves: Not too bad 3/5<br />102 Dalmatians: Same story as the remake, wasn't it enough!! 0/5<br />Little Mermaid II: Same story as the original except Melody (Ariel's daughter) wants to go the sea (Roles exchaged). 1/5<br />Lady And The Tramp II: Same story with Scamp (son of Lady &amp; Tamp) agian with roles exchanged. Very poor animation! 0/5<br />Fantasia 2000: Lives up to the original although I didn't really like the pieces that were chosen, but for wonderful animation 4/5<br />The Rescuers Down Under: Good, I loved it when I was young. 3/5<br />Beauty &amp; The Beast Xmas: Great holiday movie and wonderful songs 4/5<br />More Beauty &amp; The Beast videos that weren't hits 0/5<br />Coming Soon (Ooh, lucky us!!):<br />Dumbo II<br />Cinderella II: Dreams Come True<br />The Hunchback of Notre-Dame II<br />101 Dalmations: The Animated Sequel (We have enough already!)<br />Peter Pan II: Return To Neverland<br />Why keep messing with our memories, anyway, we know now that Disney is just a company that's losing money and taking the most they can out of their classics by making sometimes-absurd sequels! And there will be more coming,I'm sure, so much for Happily Ever After! As long as they don't mess with my favorite, Sleeping Beauty, a masterpiece in animation that doesn't want a sequel.
B00003CX7L|5.0|My 5 year old son loves TS2. Unlike a lot of Disney there is not much violence and bad behavior. Jessie recalling in song how her owner played with her then abanded her is a real tear jerker. The animation is great, the voices really match. Traits like loyalty and challenging oneself are emphaiszed during this movie. Two thumbs up!<br />Oh, now why does Al say to the Japanese businessman &quot;don't touch my moustache&quot; before hanging up the phone? Well if one slurs that phrase it sortof sounds like &quot;Doitousamasata&quot; which is &quot;your'e welcome&quot; in Japanese!
B00003CXCK|5.0|This is super director Spielberg's greatest triumph. A black and white masterpiece about a human tragedy. This movie put all those nay sayers in their place who said Steven couldn't make a serious film, especially one about the Holocaust. The casting was done to perfection with every character being truly authentic and totally convincing. For me, Ralph Fiennes was the brightest of these bright stars. He was the Holocaust personified with all the nazi's foolish racism and sick habits built into him. It was remarkable for me to see this film. Before viewing it, I had read about the Holocaust in history books and heard some of my jewish friends talk about it, but I really didn't get the full impact of what actually went on over there. If you are a seious movie fan or even just a casual one, or even just ignorant when it comes to this matter, I highly reccomend this. It deserved all the praise and every oscar it recieved.
B000002UB3|4.0|This album (with Sgrt. Pepper's) is considered both as a break from the past Beatles (Yeah,Yeah,Yeah) and as the first album in what will later be termed Progressive (Prog) Rock. Prog/Art-Rock/Sympho-Rock has complex patterns borrowed from the Structure of Classical Music.<br />Not all songs on this album are Prog. But &quot;Because&quot;'s ending is certainly one of them. Follow this with Moody Blues &quot;Day of Future Past&quot; to King Crimson to Yes to ... and you can see the progression of Progression.<br />For the Prog enthusiast there are about 4-5 songs that can be termed Prog and like most Prog hold up well with time (Yeah, Yeah , Yeah doesn't).

From song 1 to 13, this is one of their deepest and most balanced albums to date. It is heard better as an album than any individual song alone. Binaural ranks right up there with their last 3 records (Vitalogy, Yield, No Code). Here is a rating for each of the 13 songs.<br />1-Breakerfall- 9 2-God's Dice- 9 3-Evacuation- 9 4-Light Years- 10 5-Nothing As It Seems 10 6-Thin Air- 10 7-Insignificance- 9.5 8-Of the Girl- 9.5 9-Grievance- 10 10-Rival- 9 11-Sleight of Hand- 9 12-Soon Forget- 9 13-Parting Ways- 9<br />As you can see, there isn't a song on this album that I would give less than a 9 rating and that is why I rank it higher than Ten or Vs.
B00005LMBK|3.0|I scratched my head trying to find the words to describe the sound of this record. Gorillaz is mixing hip hop, trip hop, rock, punk, reggae and what I would call easy listening... At first, rather exiting cocktail, on the long run, a pleasant essay from people who have carefully listened to Massive Attack &quot;Blue Lines&quot; (&quot;Tommorow comes today&quot;, New Genius&quot;)and &quot;Mezzanine&quot; (&quot;Sound Check - Gravity&quot;), then decided to spice it up with punk (the well titled &quot;Punk&quot;, and the great &quot;M1A1&quot;) before changing their minds and cool it up with &quot;Double Bass&quot;, &quot;Rock the house&quot; or &quot;Latin Simone&quot;. &quot;5/4&quot; has a typical Depeche Mode deep rhythm section.<br />You cannot escape the singles, &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, an infectious rap with laid back, strong chorus (on my copy there is an upbeat, reggae/ska/shaggy style rap remix as a hidden bonus track) and &quot;19-2000&quot;, a sticking melody and chorus. The rest of the record will sound, depending on your mood, either &quot;cool&quot; or just irritating. Whatever, you will still groove on it. Worth a try.
B00005214X|5.0|On a Today show interview in 2001, Ringo Starr was asked &quot;Are there any of today's musicians you would like to work with?&quot;  Ringo's laconic reply was &quot;No.&quot;  Listening to this remastered version of &quot;All Things Must Pass,&quot; it's not hard to figure out why; after working on this with George Harrison and the other musicians on here, what else would you need?  There really isn't any music this good being made by any current &quot;rock groups.&quot;<br />This is an elegant, ornate album, with many, many brilliant songs.  George would never hit such a pinnacle again (although many of his solo albums have great songs). Apparently being denied the opportunity to have his songs put on the Beatles' albums was beneficial to George in the long run.<br />&quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; is expansively melodic and richly detailed, and the remastering does perfect justice to these moody, atmospheric songs.  That should be recommendation enough to get it.  The extra songs, including George's revision of &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; are nice but ultimately unnecessary; the essence of this CD is still George's original album. It was his declaration of independence from The Beatles, his introduction of his new self into what was then a new decade, and most touchingly, his declaration of love for his Lord Krishna.  We may not share his beliefs, and some closed-minded souls may have a problem with the richness of the production in this postmodern era, but the passion and beauty of George's music comes through powerfully all these years later.  And in comparison to the work of most so-called &quot;musicians&quot; these days, it still outshines all but a very, very few.
B0000013GT|5.0|damn dis cd is da best Outkast eva made an it blows all they otha cd's out tha water.Every song on dis cd except tha intro is phat.I mean for real dis is da type a cd dat u can jus keep playin an not skip a song.Cuz all da songs are classics.An if u like dat southern playa music u gotta cop dis cd cuz it tha best cd out da south ever.Fu-k i would tell ya'll all my fav. songs on dis cd but they all so good i aint even got favorites cuz sh-t they all my favorites.But anyway if u like good southern rap u gotta cop dis an pick up they first album Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik cuz it off da hook too.
0780619951|1.0|Absolutely one of the WORST movies I've seen in the last 20 years........so bad, it makes disasters like &quot;Beverly Hills Cop III&quot; and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; look like timeless masterpieces.  Marlon Brando &amp; Val Kilmer both had to be heavily influenced on pharmeseuticals to agree to &quot;act&quot; in this piece of garbage!
B00003CXRP|3.0|Wilson was very funny, and smart. I think, maybe, they were setting themselves up for a sequal, but what the hell could they do? I can't say how it should have ended, but I guess the message is, 'tomorrow is another day. Thanks,...
B000001ESF|4.0|This is actually only half of a great album, with the second half of the album being pretty blase, but the first half has more music than some bands record in their entire career.  The story and music flow throughout the 2112 segment of the album, which showcases Lee's voice and the variety of styles of Leifson's guitar work.  Neil Peart's work on drums is spectacular as always.
B000002GXX|5.0|I can remember tooling around with my buddy in his '72 model Dodge Challenger and listening to this Eagles classic along with the others that made them one of the most popular bands in America. They were a refreshing change of pace from all the late 60's protest rock and sappy '70's corporate generated music. Blending country with rock in an era when there was a line drawn between the two formats. Hats off to the Eagles for breathing new life into the music of the day.
0312954468|5.0|River God centres around three characters. Taita, a eunuch slave and the storyteller, Tanus, the warrior hero, and Lostris the Princess. Tanus and Lostris share a forbidden love which Taita helps them to fulfill. Taita narrates the story, taking the reader through his life, how he serves his master and, subsequently, his mistress. The book is a combination of historical fact and 20th century invention, but the result is a superb account of the rise and fall (and rise) of an Egyptian kingdom.<br />I don't think it's stretching a point to call River God a stylish masterpiece. It is a powerful, awe-inspiring epic that narrates historical facts whilst eliciting the full range of human emotions. The characters are BIG. The battle scenes are monumental and epic, even on the scale of a Cecil B. de Mille. The descriptions are breathtaking. The narrative (though there is little of this) is credible. River God has the ability to amuse, engross and entertain us throughout. Wilbur Smith succeeds as never before in transporting the reader into ancient Egypt with his amazing imagery and action packed plot. River God is a book to which I am happy to give five stars (more if they were available).
B00003CY5H|4.0|This is a good movie.  You should see it. Robert Deniro makes an exelent thief.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Much as the film soundtrack version of Hedwig revels in its &quot;live performance&quot; sound and energy, the songs from the show are so wonderful they deserve the clearer, smoother orchestrations offered by the stage version of the show. I will buy the film soundtrack because I enjoyed the film so much, but I will probably play this CD more often.
0441172717|3.0|I first read an Ace printing from the late 60's early 70's., so many years ago. I just read a &quot;newer&quot; edition. They aren't the same book?! It's like someone came and changed Huck Finn... ha,ha... I know he tried to make it &quot;better&quot;... more literary, but he took out Paul's humanity and replaced it with a Messiah. It was more of a love story in a very strange culture with more mystical stuff about the spice and the second moon. There was a sound weapon that has disappeared completely as well. In my opinion he ruined it by messing with it? He lived too long and tried to make perfection better...<br />It reminds me of the pigs in animal farm who can in the night and changed the laws on the wall.<br />We should go back to that Ace edition.... the laws were better.
0440219078|5.0|I read this book for the first time in fourth grade and now as  a freshman in high school, I still read this book at least once every year. No book I've ever read has effected me so deeply. It has shaped the way I see things in our society and caused me to care about thnigs I otherwise might not have. I think it should be required reading for everyone. If you can't appreciate this book, you're a bonehead.

B00004TJTQ|4.0|This is a wonderful family story and coming of age story based on Willie Morris' 1995 memoir of the same title. It tells the story of Morris, (Frankie Muniz) a shy, isolated boy growing up in Mississippi during World War II.   The story starts out with Morris a shy boy, whose only friend seems to be his next door neighbor Dink Jenkins. However, Dink goes off to World War II early in the film, where his life too would be changed forever. Willie is bullied by his peers at school    However on his ninth birthday when Willie's mother goes behind his father's back and gets him a little terrier dog named Skip.    &quot;I was an only child and now he was an only dog,&quot; Morris says.    From that point on, the two are almost inseperable as Willie lerns to overcome his shyness and stand up to the bullies, who learn to respect him and become friends. Skip also helps Willie get up the courage to talk to the prettiest girls in school, who also becomes his close friend.    The story comes to a head when Dink comes back from the war AWOL and shamed and continues when Skip goes missing, after an incident at Willie's opening day baseball game, and winds up on an operating table at the vets.     The movie ends with Willie going off to school in England a young, confident man, but never forgetting about his dog Skip, with whom he learned and grew.    Maybe everything in the movie didn't happen in real life, but I think to judge the movie by events or actions would be to miss the point. The movie captures a time and place very near and dear to Morris' heart and the creature that helped him come out of his shell and discover it. This movie is a study of character and emotions and sometimes how tough it can be and how loyalty and love can help you pull through.
B000056HOZ|4.0|The Minister of Rock'n Roll has yet to provide us with a video of all live performances, but if like me, you really can't wait, this is a DVD with great cuts that you shouldn't hesitate to put into your library.  It's the closest thing available to a full concert by the Boss for your viewing screen. Its mood ranges from reflectively acoustic, to joyously lighthearted, to passionately engaged.<br />For anyone who's never seen the Boss live, there are enough such cuts here to begin converting you into a fan.  As long as this world has not yet succeeded in turning your heart to stone, I believe Springsteen's unpretentious sincerity and depth of soul will speak to you through these discs.  <br />Whether in his acoustic version of &quot;Born to Run&quot; or in the plugged version, the connection he makes with his audience is palpable. You'll feel what's in his gut and his concern for young people during this live rendition of &quot;War.&quot; You'll hear an intense form of patriotism in &quot;Born in the USA,&quot; not of the sunshine variety, but of one whose heart has the strength to suffer from the sins of his country AND who desires to do what he can to make his country better through confronting rather than hiding from its mistakes.  You'll hear on the first disc his best rendition yet of &quot;Tunnel of Love,&quot; a confidently reflective &quot;Tougher than the Rest,&quot; and a heart-searing version of &quot;Spare Parts&quot; that alternatively tears and sizzles.        <br />On the second disc, &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; will give the uninitiated a lighthearted sense of how this man &quot;gets down&quot; and connects with his audience -- a connection which for him clearly, is always a personal affair.  For those of us who know already, we'll just smile and sing or scream along with him while we take that &quot;Leap of Faith&quot; or while he unveils the &quot;Hungry Heart&quot; in each living soul.  Never having spent a night under the trestles, we'll still feelthe campfire and the dignity of every human being through the eyes of &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot; in two haunting acoustic versions.  When the E Street Band joins him in &quot;If I Should Fall Behind,&quot; one can feel the heart, pathos, and hope of those who knew of what they were singing. You're also likely to draw connections in your life, as I believe only the blind and deaf of soul could remain untouched.  <br />While nothing can compare with the live experience of Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, this video includes live cuts that are priceless.  Several of the taped versions are done especially well also such as Human Touch, 57 Channels, Streets of Philadelphia -- not to mention the plain ol' spirit of fun expressed in Dancing in the Dark, I'm on Fire, and Glory Days.<br />For those who have seen him in concert though, we won't be satisfied until we get a video/DVD compilation that simulates his live performances, not from a historical perspective, but simply of his &quot;best&quot; performances, available on tape.  <br />For the uninitiated, &quot;best&quot; needs to be put in quotes, because the man never performs a song the same way twice.  But there's a huge fan-base out here that would love to see a simulated live concert on DVD, whose company we could keep in our home, while we wait for another reunion of the Boss and the E Street Band.
0521370957|5.0|Horowitz and Hill's book is a commendable effort. It serves its targeted audience well. Hence 5 stars for its rating. Too often however people seem to overrate it. There is life (.and electronics) after H&amp;H, and designers would do well to keep this in mind

0446677450|5.0|This book says what a lot of people who want to be rich just don't want to hear. Like, spend less than you earn. Live in a smaller house. When you get a raise, don't buy a boat -- buy a rental property. Get a slipcover for your old couch instead of spending 1000 for a new one and buy some (carefully chosen) mutual funds or stocks with that money. And most of all, don't rob Peter to pay Paul - don't use credit to live a lifestyle you can't afford. <br />It challenges what the poor and middle classes have been taught - that looking rich was the same as being rich. Trying to `look' rich, the author says, encourages people to spend all of their income on items that depreciate in value (cars, TV's, stereos, hot tubs, designer clothes) rather than buying things that will appreciate in value (mutual funds, property, and stocks.) If you have a new car but no money saved for retirement -- this book is for you!<br />Maybe the bad reviews are caused by the frustration that there is no get rich quick advice in this book -- the truth is it takes discipline, commitment, time, and self-control to build wealth. But, for those willing to listen, this book leads a way out of the month-to-month grind, regardless if you make 18,000 a year or 100,000. This book reminds the reader that it's not what you MAKE, it's what you SAVE that determines if you will be rich or poor. In addition to this book, I'd also suggest two other fabulous books on building wealth -- &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; and &quot;The Millionaire Next Door.&quot;
B00005M989|3.0|If you have a general interest in the greatest musician of the last two decades and only want to buy a single cd that has a general coverage of his music from 1979-1991 buy this cd, it won't disappoint.  If you want a more in depth representation of his carear from that period, buy the Hits/B-Sides that is available, it contains pretty much what the title suggests, all his Hits and B-Sides.  And of course, considering the man put out nearly twenty cd's of music in that time the only way to get a true Prince experience is to buy all of his cd's, which really are one of the most amazing and diverse bodies of work any musician has ever created, and continues to create.  But do not let any of these whining Prince fanatics cry about what is right or wrong about the release of this cd, that's Prince's fight.  This cd is about music, and the music is great, except for the final track &quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night,&quot; a dubious addition to the set since it is neither one of his best or a huge hit and could easily be replaced by a more deserving track like &quot;Pop Life&quot; or &quot;When You Were Mine.&quot;  Although it seems to serve as one last jab from Warner Bros. to Prince, considering money seems to be the only thing he is worried about these days.
B000021XS0|5.0|The first DT CD I got was the EP A Change Of Seasons. When I listened to I just stood there and went wow, these guys can play. With this album, they totally outdo themselves. With this album, Dream Theater has done something most bands can only dream of. They created both an artistic and technical masterpiece here. This is what you get when you put five ofthe greatest musicians on the planet together. The only other band that I can think of that has done something like that in recent history is Tool (Lateralus). Everything, from the vocals to the drumming is performed with precision and power. Mike Portnoy's percussive assualt is even better than before. Only two other drummers,Danny Carey and Vinnie Paul, can even come close to matching Portnoy. And he makes it seem so damn easy. John Petrucci is the Eddie van Halen of the 21st century. He can run rings around anyone else out there. Jordan Rudess is too good for words and John Myung's base lays down the foundation for it all. On top you have one of the best vocalists, James Labrie, belting out lyrics with more passion than ever before. Every song on here rocks. So if you are a prog fan, metal fan or music fan, you need this in you collection. It is more than worth the price.
B000002JSV|5.0|This, in my opinion is the greatest AC-DC album ever put out by the boys. It has a genuine &quot;Blues&quot; feel to it, and tracks such as &quot;Down Payment Blues&quot; and &quot;Gone Shooting&quot; sound like John Lee Hooker himself was playing alongside Angus and Malcolm. Bon Scott has a voice and style unlike anyone else in rock &amp; roll history. Try and imagine Robert Plant in his prime with a mean-streak, and a super macho attitude about women and booze, and you've got Bon! Brian Johnson has taken over the helm of AC-DC and has done a very credible job as the new frontman, but Bon was un-replaceable. His style cannot be duplicated. &quot;Kicked in the Teeth Again&quot; starts out with Bon wailing at a woman who done him wrong, about her two faced lies, ect, and one can picture Bon at the local pub drowning his sorrows and whiskey and women, just like John Lee used to. I think Hooker and Scott are at some pub in Hell, right now, drinkin' all the liquor, and gettin' all de women!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|When I discovered Iron Maiden last year, I was a high school graduate living off the radio and listening to the likes of Limp Bizkit, Godsmak, Kid Rock, and recent Metallica releases and thinking it to be awesome heavy metal. When I borrowed Brave New World from a friend of mine and heard the opening guitar riff of The Wicker Man, my musical tastes were turned upside down; or rightside up depending on how you look at it. This was something EXTRA SPECIAL.I was blown away by the shear power and finesse of this album. Steve pounding out bass lines, Adrian, Janick, and Dave riffing and grinding on their axes, Nicko's percussive assualt and Bruce's soaring vocals all mixed together into one mind-f#%kingly awesome collection of songs. I have since bought all of their 80s releases and found them to be even better than this. But this will always be the album that opened up a whole other genre of music for me. Up the Irons. Iron Maiden's gonna get all of ya!!!
B000002NG7|5.0|This was Mike Patton's most stable project, FNM that is.  While varying in range and form, this album still maintains a level of radio friendliness. <br />Faith No More is gone now.  This is a terrible farse.  Listen to Fantomas is you are as bored as I am with music nowadays and want to hear more Mike Patton and other forgotten brilliant musicians.
0684867621|5.0|Beware: this book is - although made of very simple ingredients - very scary. What do you get if you take Red Sox' Tom Gordon's #1 fan, a young girl who struggles with her parent's marriage and her brother, put her on a walk along the Appalaichan Trail and make her get lost? A nightmare showing Stephen King's true craft: making an extraordinary story out of an ordinary thought.  The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon deals with the psychological terrors of loneliness and fading hope of ever being rescued; of the lurking dread that somewhere behind you, deep in the woods, is a monster, that is real, very real ...<br />... until Trisha finally confronts her true enemy, the monster, the thing of the woods, she has to defeat in a thrilling showdown that pushes you on the edge of your seat und ripps your nervs like a butcher. This book will definitely make your teeth grind, because it is very tense Stephen King at his best - at least in a way, if you stick to the fact, that it is an ordinary thought, but an extraordinary story.<br />At the end of this book you will come to realize that sometimes the love for the true thing - for that one thing (whatever that is to you) you like best - is the only thing you got ... and the only thing you can fall back on, because it is YOUR thing. Maybe you will even get a few foot steps closer to that thing of yours!
0805062971|5.0|This book is not for the faint of heart!  That said, I implore everyone to read it.<br />I picked up this book because it looked kooky and interesting.  Kooky doesn't begin to describe it.  The novel follows the exploits of two men (or does it?) and the underground club they form where regular men voluntarily beat each other into a pulp in front of a crowd.  Sounds kinda like boxing, except that there are no referees, no rules, and no one is allowed to speak about Fight Club.  Oh yeah, and the true devotees are required to embark on bizarre and destructive missions all in the name of Project Mayhem.  Plus, they make homemade soap which they then sell to ritzy department stores--if you read the book, you'll love the irony of this.  Add to this an insane and suicidal &quot;love&quot; interest and you've got yourself one mixed up bunch of characters.<br />The plot really isn't as important as the style.  It is written from the perspective of one of the fight club founders who just happens to be an insomniac and the jumpy, incoherent shifting from topic to topic really gets the reader in the narrator's brain.  The night I finished this book, I dreamed I was living it and woke up in a cold sweat.<br />I highly, highly recommend this book.  It will change the way you see reality.
B00005NVDF|4.0|I think this movie represents the height of Woody's slapstick period. It also contains perhaps the funniest five minutes ever put on film (meeting the blind date). Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts are solid as always and the Woodman is forever the comic genius. His timing is impecable, the dialogue is instantly quotable. It's just great to see a master at the height of his comedic powers. I certainly think that some of his later works are &quot;better movies&quot;, but I don't think any of them are as funny.
B000005IU1|5.0|Punk rock did not begin with the Sex pistols or the Ramones.  One must look back, before the Heartbreakers, before the Dolls, all the way to the late 60's and the Stooges.  They, along with the Velvet Underground, returned rock n' roll to its primal roots while adding elements of disaffection, alienation,  and anger that paved the way for all of the 70's punk groups that followed.  The stooges had a lyrical edginess, musical rawness, and dangerous presence that other garage &quot;punk&quot; bands of the 60's lacked.  They were the real deal.  Iggy crawled around on broken glass, Iggy knocked his teeth out, Iggy smeared himself with peanut butter, Iggy attacked the audience.  The music is raw and tribal, Bo Diddley with distortion pedals via suburban white trash nihilism. The first self-titled stooges album is my favorite.  It contains such classics as &quot;little doll&quot;, &quot;no fun&quot;, &quot;not right&quot;, and &quot;I wanna be your dog&quot;.  The second album (&quot;funhouse&quot;) is also excellent and highly recommended. Johnny Ramone cites Stooges guitar player Ron Asheton as an influence, 'nuff said.

B000002ADT|5.0|'Kind of Blue' has to be one of THE best jazz albums ever recorded! As many other reviewers have stated, if you aren't too familiar w/ jazz, this would make a great introduction cd...real easy on the ears. Miles Davis has always been an anchor for jazz music and I feel this is one of his best works. Oringinally recorded in 1959, you'll find some of the best jazz has to offer in this cd, with Davis on trumpet, the greats Julian   &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley and John Coltrane on alto and tenor sax respectively, the ultimate Bill Evans on piano (who by the way, along with Vince Guaraldi &amp; Dave Brubeck, is one of the best jazz pianists to ever play), Paul Chambers on bass and Jimmy Cobb kickin' the sticks on drums. Also Wyton Kelly joins on a gig playing piano. Not a bad lineup, huh. The cool thing about this album...you're not only hearing the legendary sweet trumpet blows of Davis, but you're also being introduced to some, who go on to be jazz greats in their own right. The musical influence that 'Kind of Blue' has had is huge. That influence traveled outside the realm of jazz and seeped into other musical scopes as well. It's certainly an art, so that must make Davis the Picasso of jazz. The music on this cd flows so smoothe and crisp, it stirs something deep within you. I've only seriously gotten into jazz over the last few years, and although I am not a jazz connoisseur, I can tell you it doesn't get any better than Miles Davis. <br />A bonus on this cd is the alternate take of Flamenco Sketches, not on the origional LP....there are some advantages to today's technology....and the sound is much improved w/ this digital remastering. The improvisation on this recording is the ultimate and that can often be difficult to acheive within a group. But then again, bravo to Davis, who carefully handpicked his players to accompany him on this recording. I don't know what more I could say that hasn't already been said by some other reviewer. I just felt compelled to share my take on this incredicble cd. Over the years, Miles Davis has put out album after album after album...I have read from great jazz enthusiasts, that this recording is one of jazz's all-time best. Why not find out for yourself!?! You will not be disappointed.
B00000FCBC|5.0|THIS 2 CD SET IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE 'TALLICA ALBUMS. DISK 1 IS GREAT WITH NEW RECORDINGS AND SOME VERY AWESOME COVERS.  MY FAVORITE SONGS ON DISK 1 ARE WHISKEY IN THE JAR, TURN THE PAGE AND TUESDAY'S GONE.  TUESDAY'S GONE IS VERY GOOD WITH JOHN POPPER ON HARMONICA AND IT IS ACOUSTIC WHICH MAKES IT EVEN MORE SWEET.  DISK 2 HAS SONGS FROM THEIR &quot;GARAGE DAYS RE-VISTED&quot; ALBUM FROM 1986.  A FEW OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OFF DISK 2 ARE &quot;AM I EVIL&quot;, &quot;LAST CARESS&quot;, &quot;SO WHAT&quot; AND &quot;STONE COLD CRAZY&quot;. I THINK THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY METALLICA FAN OLD FAN OR NEW FAN.
B00005K3OT|5.0|All of you know that critics teared it to tiny pieces and along with many &quot;pure movie fans&quot; can't forgive this one the participation in the Oscar's run. And the &quot;stubborn&quot; Academy still choose Chocolat as one of the 5 best pictures of the year. Why? Well, i guess they simply enjoyed it as i and everyone i happened to know did. <br />This movie can be described as a fairy tale. In European style. The misterious woman arrives with her daughter to some anonimous (supposedly French) small town. And, as it appears, she also wants to start some chocolat buisness. Her strange habbits, appearance and &quot;dark&quot; past along with the unfamiliar sweet stuff she tries to produce make the local people feel quite uncomfortable in their skin. What, of course, creates some tensions and relationships of all kinds between her and the local community. <br />This is the story in a nutshell. It's not really original (well, it's also adapted), intellectual and actually it's not really plot-driven piece of moviemaking. And it's not a masterpiece. It's flawed, as ALL other Oscar contenders. It also may not be your cup of tea. Everyone has a right for the opinion.<br /> From the objective point of view it's a fine movie - it's well-directed, well-written, well-acted, well-scored and well-designed. It's definitely worth a look, though i believe you should see EVERY movie before you decide to buy it.<br /> My personal advice to everyone -give Chocolat a try (unless you have some chocolat allergy) because you might immensely enjoy it. Because to my opinion it's better than its &quot;just good&quot; parts. Because it's charming and delightful as a real chocolat, and for a couple of hours might make you forget about your undone laundry, unpaid bills or irritating boss. <br />You may like Chocolat for its sheer entertaining value. But it also may make you think. About us, humans.

0446310786|5.0|Some people say that the impact of a book is never fully realised until some time after the reading.  Nowhere is this truer than within Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird.  I first read this book at University some years ago, and to be honest it had a relatively moderate effect on me.  But in the years that have followed, the messages that are dictated have continued to make more sense to me, and have in many respects never left me.  They repeatedly act as guiding philosophies to the way I try to live my life as an adult.  <br />The book tells the story of racial tensions in the 1930s in a small town in the American South.  Although the 1930s were some seventy years following the abolition of slavery in America, at this time, in many respects whites still viewed blacks as ill educated, immoral and childlike.  To add fuel to this fire, the 1930s were also the defining years of the great depression, a social climate that served to intensify racial tensions, as there was much competition for work. <br />Within this intense social climate the novel dictates a profound insight into understanding racism, and also advises a means to remove this ignorance.  It's philosophy simply dictates that racism is the result of fear of the unfamiliar, and that it is this fear that motivates people to categorize individuals as part of a negative group, as a means to control this fear.  The novel then decrees that in order to remove prejudice people must have an understanding of others as individuals by attempting to understand their perspective as if living their lives.  This would then eliminate fear and stereotyping and ultimately reverse the path that leads to racism.<br />This philosophy is offered to the reader through the objective narrative voice of a child and the lessons she learns through her interaction with various characters within the narrative.  Her father is her biggest influence, a white lawyer representing a falsely accused black man at trial, against the views of hispeers in their town.  As such, as she is lead to an understanding of the novels hypothesis for the elimination of prejudice, so are we the reader.<br />As the novel was written in the 1950s at a time when Southern blacks were demanding more civil rights, such as the right to vote and the complete abolishment of segregation laws, the novel also had resonance in its year of publication.  Perhaps Harper Lee saw this has an opportunity to educate the 1950s white community on issues of race and prejudice, at this critical political point.<br />However, I believe the novel goes even further than this and makes points that can educate people from any background anywhere in the world.  If people could see others points of view by standing in their shoes and seeing them as individuals instead of part of a larger group, then not only would prejudice cease, but human understanding and interaction as a whole would benefit.<br />This is definitely one of those life-changing books that you will come back to time and time again in your life, always reading it from a new perspective.
0441008356|5.0|While this book had a few problems, I thought that it was an excellent read, particularly in its outstanding world-building. The characters are interesting as well, in particular the cyborg interstellar space crew. <br />For whatever reason, the British seem to be building the most interesting future worlds for a reader to explore. I refer to the likes of Banks, Hamilton and MacLeod. If you enjoy those authors, then this book is a must read. I eagerly await the US publication of his next books.
0385486804|5.0|I first read Into the Wild when I was 13. I could still recall (well, 2 years ago, lol) vividly on grumbling with a dictionary in hand, checking unfamiliar words one after another. I also remember how I felt after the last page, with my dictionary abandoned somewhere, my eyes unfocused, and my brain a clatter. Thus the after effect of the book. <br />Into the Wild illustrates a story of Christopher McCandless, who had everything in the world going for him (intelligence, affable, wealthy parents, a possible great career), but abandons all to chase his 'idealistic' dream, to 'live in the wild' and ended up dead. His journey is packed with adventure, so if you are one that's fond of nature but never had the guts to go out and 'just' survive, you may enjoy Chris' adventure vicariously. <br />The overall impact of the book will be on the conclusion of this tale. The fact that McCandless didn't survive raised much controversy and I too, found myself thinking on the why's and what if's. This is a very contemplative book, and the literature is very well done also. Meanwhile, can I just say I loved the closing conclusion? I could still see the disappearing bus, the fading trees and the vanishing forest. ^__^ Very simply, it's a must read.
B0000026UL|4.0|Daniel Lanois again works his magic as the producer of this Dylan album, providing an up-to-date sound to a very good batch of songs.  Political World gets things off to a nice start, and the pace stays pretty strong throughout.  Most of the Time is masterful songwriting, as is Disease of Conceit.  Oh, Mercy is by far the most entertaining and well-made Dylan album since Infidels and Empire Burlesque (which I happen to think was a lot better than it gets credit for).  This is a solid effort by a master, and as such deserves your attention.
B00005JCA9|4.0|I first saw this movie on television and thought it was fun to watch. The story was pretty well laid out and has a lot going for it. I like the way the characters interact, the way the story develops, even the way it ends (although I did have to watch some of it twice to catch some bits I missed the first time). Not much sex, which is more implied than shown. The PG-13 rating seems to me to be mostly due to the occaisional profanity which doesn't seem to be illogically placed but actually works for the story.
B000002H70|5.0|...and they do not anymore. Supremely melodic, with complex orchestration and unashemedly sensitive; nineties without any apologies and without a fear to appear too gentle, too suggestive, too captivating.<br />It is easy to see the point of reviewers who call it the best album of all time: the quality is monumental, from the first crisp opening chords, through build-up of majestic cathedral-like  musical structure of &quot;Pictures of You&quot;, and through to &quot;Lovesong&quot;, so beautiful it can bring tears to your eyes. <br />With so many reviews, you do need me telling what the album is like, so let me simply encourage you to make this purchase.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I really loved this film it was very funny and well made and it made me crave chocolat.
B00003CXP1|5.0|I don't think that there has ever been a film as bleakly harrowing or as brave as Darren Aronofsky's &quot;Requiem for a Dream.&quot; The film deserved to win a dozen Oscars, including Ellen Burstyn for Best Actress. What makes this film different from other movies about drug addiction is that it never offers a moral view. It tells the story of four addicts living in Brooklyn who we see spiral with unstoppable momentum down into drug addiction hell over the seasons of one year.<br />You feel for all of these characters, but the one you will pity most is Sara Goldfarb, a lonely widow played brilliantly by Ellen Burstyn. Sara hangs on to the pathetic dream of being on her favorite TV game show and losing weight to fit into her beloved red dress. Enter the diet pills. The scene where Sara explains to her son Harry (Jared Leto) that she &quot;likes the way&quot; she feels now. &quot;Now, I smile,&quot; she says. You get the feeling that Sara is teetering on the edge of madness, and more heartbreaking, she is aware of it. Her later scenes tear you apart as she plunges straight down into insanity, with no hope of ever coming back, because she doesn't want to come back.<br />Jared Leto delivers another outstanding performance as Harry Goldfarb, Sara's heroin addict son. Harry really wants his mother to be happy, and when he learns that she is addicted to speed, he breaks down and sobs on the way home. But a shot of heroin makes him all right again. He and best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans-who is very very good) decide to start dealing heroin themselves, but the scheme goes horribly wrong. Also very affecting is Jennifer Connelly as Harry's girlfriend Marion, who will do anything for her next fix, including prostituting herself. Harry even sends her out with a man when he knows that she will have to have sex with him to get much needed cash. This is the wedge that drives them apart, only reconciling when it is too late for both of them.<br />This is all seen with an unflinching eye, holding nothing back. Darren Aronofsky's highly effective visual style pays off in the powerful punch of the final montage of scenes which shows the fate of the four characters we feel for so deeply. The music jars us to attention as Sara undergoes electro-shock therapy, Harry's infected arm is amputated, Tyrone tries to drift to sleep in prison, and as Marion willingly suffers sexual degradation. The final images show Tyrone dreaming of his mother, Harry sobbing that Marion will never come see him, Sara lost in insanity, and Marion emotionlessly cradling a packet of coke. These four people, now without dreams, now without souls, curl up into fetal positions and sleep. The last clip shows Sara and Harry on the game show, and we see the look of crazed fear and sadness in Sara's lost eyes.<br />&quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; is the most powerful film I have ever seen. It takes a second viewing to catch all of its subtleties, notable the two women who told Sara about diet pills visiting a now cadaverus Sara in the hospital. If you can bear it, you will be changed forever by this sorrowful and realistic vision of four victims of addiction. See it.ching eye, holding nothing back.

0451450523|5.0|This is hands down the best book I have ever read.  When I was younger, I had seen the movie.  I bought the movie and litterally, learned every line. I knew the whole entire thing by heart.  Then I bought the book and fell more in love.     Beagle dealt with serious issues such as immortality and depression. But he touched on the fairy tale light hearted story I was looking for. He described things amazingly well and made me really believe what was going on.     Seriously, Buy this book as soon as you can, you will not regret it.
0792156684|5.0|I've seen every Cameron film, from the thumbs down Pirahna 2: The Spawning. I have to say, the great filmmaker made his name and talent known with The Terminator. But after 15 years, the one movie that stands out today is Titanic... and rightly so. It's James Cameron's masterpiece. From every angle to every special effect, from the &quot;cheesy&quot; dialogue to the powerful moments....it's something Cameron might not be able to dublicate.<br />It's the Lawrence of Arabia to David Lean. The Schindler's List to Steven Spielberg. The Citizen Kane to Orson Welles. <br />Bravo! Bravo Cameron
014032870X|4.0|I agree with some reviewers in that mostly all of what the book talks about is the glass elevator and Charlie's grandparents. It does state nothing about what Charlie did after all of this with his new chocolate factory, but I disagree with those who say that book was awful. I enjoyed reading it, despite the above complaints. It was very well written, and interesting to read, althought I would have liked to read about what Charlie did with his inheritance.
B000002UA5|4.0|This double-album marks a 'visible' transition between the era of Syd Barrett (founder of the band, who faded away due to substance abuse) and the era of Roger Waters (creative mind, bass player and lead vocalist of the band), which was to continue until the early 80s.<br /> This production was the second one by the band that had a Hipgnosis design (first one being &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;), which would become a trademark of all the other 70s albums by them. The artwork of the album stands out, in my opinion, among one of the best put together for an album sleeve.<br /> The first album was recorded live in the spring of 1969, and has a feel for the type of live performance for which PF would become world famous until our days. However, the song 'Astronomy Domine' dates from the days when the Barrett still was part of the line-up. The other three tracks are simply brilliant samples of the musicianship of the Floyd. I wish we could actually SEE the performance from this CD, since their visuals made them just as famous as their music.<br /> The second album lent itself for EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTATION: extravagant, avant-garde pieces, combined in cases with long tape loops (which the band employed a lot). Each of the members of the band contributed at least a piece, which in most cases turned out to be multi-part pieces. I have to say this album is NOT for the 'Easy Listening' inclined. It is considerably hard to digest, with the track 'Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict' (yes, try to find a song with a longer name than this one!) being the hardest to assimilate.<br /> Overall, in my opinion, if you're serious about collecting Pink Floyd music or are into Prog music, you have to have this album as part of your collection, but I assure you it will not be one of those you'll play to relax yourself, or to take your mind off the traffic, while driving.
B00005B4GU|4.0|Amnesiac has a more jazzy feel to it compaired to &quot;KID A&quot; and all of their other albums. But personaly I liked it, and I didn't have second thought's about buying &quot;Amnesiac&quot; because if all of their other albums are awsome then this one must be too! I think Radiohead is actually one of the best bands out there today. They have a unique sound thats hard to find now. I enjoyed this album like i enjoyed the others.
B00005B4GU|5.0|For all you OK Computer/The Bends fans griping and moaning about what you deem to be the &quot;electro-murk&quot; of Kid A/Amnesiac, wait 'til you get a load of the 3 new b-sides on the soon-to-be-released Knives Out single (&quot;Cuttooth,&quot; &quot;Worrywort,&quot; &quot;Fog&quot; -- though, sadly the U.S. version may only include one of these). You can actually hear Thom's voice; you can actually understand what he's saying. These tracks are astounding -- a perfect fusion of OK Computer's lyric clarity and Kid A's sonic daring.
078062565X|4.0|Since it's release, King Kong has remained one of the greatest, most influential adventure/monster films ever made.<br />The direction is atmospheric but quite typical for this time period and for a film of this sort.<br />Edgar Wallace and Merian C. Cooper's use of a `Beauty and the Beast'-type storyline is quite interesting. The film provides a unique take on the classic tale.<br />The acting is very melodramatic, as it is in many films released during this time period, but in a way that makes the film fun. Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot are so hammy that they are, at times, comical to watch. Frank Reicher is quite convincing as Captain Englehorn. Fay Wray is good at playing the damsel in distress. <br />Max Steiner's grand musical score suits the magnitude of the film nicely.<br />Ted Cheesman's editing is great. Though the film has a short running time of only 100 minutes, it does stay interesting throughout.<br />The legendary special effects are clearly dated by today's standards but it's easy to see how believable they would have been in 1933.<br />King Kong is not the groundbreaking film it was when it was released but it still manages to be a wonderfully enjoyable movie.
0553213105|5.0|But for this book I have to.  I first picked up Austen's P&amp;P when I was in middle school and it failed the 3 chapter test.  (You know the test: if you aren't interested in the book by chapter 3 put it down.)  I picked it up again a few years later and simply fell in love with the wonderful story.<br />Austen may have written the book over a century ago but the themes that play out within its pages are universal today.  Pride, wealth, and station in life are still as important today as they were when Mrs. Bennet was hoping to find husbands for her daughters.  In P&amp;P Austen writes about falling in love, how we view it, and how we don't always understand it.  Is mutual regard enough for a lasting marriage?  What about passion?  And does passion or regard equate to love?  I reread this book every time I need a reminder that love isn't always fanfares and fireworks.
B00003CY5K|5.0|A laugh riot. A wonderful feel good comedy. I wish I could be friends with Elle Woods! A great comedy with an underlying message of personal strength and the inside being just as important as the outside. Awesome soundtrak as well. This movie will keep you rolling on the ailes. I highly recommend it. You'll leave the theater feeling awesome.
B0000028M7|5.0|dirt is probably my favorite guitar album of all time; one that i know every nuance.  the vocals are truly unique.  in addition to layne's great sustained melodies, the backup vocals and harmonies make this a great album to sing along with.  highlights for me are the final verse of &quot;down in a hole&quot;, which features, i think, 5 or 6 overdubbed harmonies.  the wah-wah riff of &quot;rain when i die&quot; is unforgetable.  cantrell's solos hinge on insanity.  the way he fuses blues with elements that seem to not fit fuel his leads.  i think cantrell's incorporation of different rythms into a solo are what give him his audacious and unique sound.  alice in chains and soundgarden were the best bands of the 90's; much better than their grunge buddies nirvana and pearl jam.  dirt is their hardest but best work.  it is probably the single best album i own.
076780421X|5.0|Delightful! Is the best way to describe this film. Matthew Perry plays New Yorker Alex Whitman, who is a project manager for a construction company that specializes in nightclubs. Salma Hayek portrays Mexican (raised in Las Vegas) Isabel Fuente, who is working at the casinos and chasing her dream of being a Photographer. The chemistry between the two is great. They first meet in a restaurant where Isabel is on her way back to Vegas from visiting her grandmother, and Alex is working on themes for the project. The initial encounter of the two binds them for the rest of the film, they have a one-nightstand and she leaves before he wakes up the next morning. She goes back to see him three months later to tell him she is pregnant with his child. He freaks out, in the middle of a business deal. She splits, because he is in the middle of a business deal, he chases, they reconcile, and before the night is thru he meets her family and they get married.    The rest of the movie is the two developing and trying to keep the relationship. This set of events is the real treat. You see elements of how guys and gals think in relationships as well as their own very different cultures and personalities conflicts. All in all this is without a doubt one of my personal favorites. I thoroughly enjoy this film every time I see it. If you are thinking about buying this movie, I highly recommend it.
B000053VAF|2.0|I loved this movie, I thought it was funny, and it had something to say something about life. I couldn't wait till it came out on dvd, so when it did I bought it the same day. To my dismay I found that there wasn't much on it other than the movie. Now, they release another version a year later with extra features hanging out of the package? It isn't fair, I'm a poor high school student, I don't have the money to pay for two dvds of the same movie. I really wish they would stop with the special editions, the collector editions, the super collector editions and whatnot because they are making me go broke!
0486408434|5.0|I've always been fascinated by magic tricks, but it wasn't until about a month or so ago that I finally decided to try learning to do them myself. I bought a couple decks of cards and I searched around the Amazon website for different magic books; I ended up buying this one as well as a few others.   Having already read several of them, all I can say is that, for the incredible amount of information contained within this book, it is well worth the price. A few of the books I purchased were a bit overwhelming, but not this one. The instructions for learning the different sleights are presented in such a way that I felt very comfortable picking up a deck of cards even though I had almost no previous experience. Within a day, I was able to do one or two of the first tricks in the book, and since then I've learned several more.<br />I know the other reviewers have mentioned this, but one truly great thing about this book is that the difficulty level of the sleights actually progresses reasonably as you make your way through it. There's one trick in here-the pass-that it says could take at least a couple of months to get right!<br />This is a wonderful book, and I highly recommend it to anyone even slightly interested in learning card tricks.
B00005B6C9|4.0|I'm in my thirties now and have been a Bee Gee fan since I was 13 yrs old. I have a total of thirteen Bee Gee CD's and the Living Eyes album which I wish I could get on CD.  Their latest &quot;This Is Where I Came In&quot; is definitely different for them, but as usual shows their talent in songwriting and I like the fact they like to try new areas in their music.  No exception with TIWICI, although the only really disappointment I have is that it became a solo album for the brothers with a few songs with them doing what they do best. Their harmonies are what make me a very huge fan.  And as a Barry Gibb fan, I do miss the falsetto, but it must get more difficult to do when you get older, but even without Barry's falsetto, he's still to me the most talented of the three (no offense to Robin &amp; Maurice).  The song to me that stands out the most as being different for them is &quot;Technicolor Dreams&quot;.  It's not really the type of music I prefer, but strike it up for Barry for giving it to me, a sort of dedication to his father who was a big band leader. I wish they would take on some more country type music as they did on their Main Course album and the excellent songs they did for Kenny Rogers &quot;Eyes That See In The Dark&quot;  All and all they are my favorite and the only group I will play in my car.  Thanks Barry, Robin and Maurice for your gift as songwriters and performers!
B00005LQ6S|5.0|I loved this movie. I am one of the biggest Chris Lambert and Bruce Payne fans around. Bruce Payne really made this movie for me .I loved the fight sequences, even in this day and age the sword fights are timeless. I thought Adrian Paul did a splendid job also. I was so hurt when the legendary Colonel McCleod was taken out of the picture because in my opinion he really would have set &quot;Endgame&quot;  off.
630419949X|4.0|Being an ardent Schwarzenegger fan this was a bit of a letdown.  There is plenty of action but the underlying feel to the plot believability leaves a little to be desired.  Weapons that fire aluminium rounds cause explosions!!  Vanessa Williams is well worth watching.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I bought this CD solely because of a a profile that I read in a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly. I had never heard of Sigur Rós before, and I had obviously never heard any of their music either. When I received the CD, it went straight into my stereo, and I've been listening to it ever since. I don't understand the lyrics, but that doesn't matter. The whole CD feels me with such peace and calm that the mood on the album seems to be without translation. I listened to it in my portable player the other day, and the sound only got better through the earphones. The sonic swirling music seemed to have a direct outlet into my psyche. They use a variety of different instruments, from a full orchestra to pianos and guitars. This is beautiful music and a very good purchase. I am so glad I took a chance &amp; bought it. Oh, and the little drawings of alien-angels inside the CD booklet are just an added bonus. :-)
B00000JGEO|5.0|One of the best films that I have ever seen, a definite thumbs-up.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|LONDON CALLING was the first album that really opened my mind up to music in general and what a band could be, achieve, and really reach for...simply put, this is the best record ever produced in rock history...THE CLASH were at their creative and artistic peak and were talented enough to create one of the most powerful, diverse, and consistent lps ever.  I first heard this when i was 12 years old, sitting in my room for a week with headphones on and couldn't stop listening to song after amazing song.  I tossed my Cheap Trick album in the trash and my love for music (rock, punk, reggae, jazz, dance, funk) started here...and after over 20 years LONDON CALLING still holds up as a true classic, timeless.  I could name all the songs I love and cherish, but why, once you really digest this set I dare anyone not to agree that it's an incredible piece of work/art/music history.  There is a reason that CLASH fans are after all these years still so die-hard, obsessive, passionate, and a bit nostalgic - for we yearn for a time when the only band that mattered was at their musical peak and the world could not stop them.  Forget &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; or &quot;Should I Stay Should I Go&quot; = if you have not checked out LONDON CALLING you are missing something very special indeed.  Today, it makes me laugh and somewhat sad that so many teens listen to Blink 182, Green Day, Rancid, Limp Bizkit, et al and truly think their music is great, while they really are listening to a pale ghost to the genius of a band like THE CLASH - today's generation is missing out on the real source of musical power, talent, and boldness.  Many people in their 20's I talk to have never even heard of this lp - so sad, but unfortunately true.  Please, buy this and take time to listen to pure genius.  LONDON CALLING was produced in 1979, a time of pretty mediocre rock music - the fact that the band pulled this one out of the hat when they did is icing on the cake - incredible, unforgettable, and ultimately the best ever!
B0000046KM|5.0|brilliantly romantic...ms. horn has such an elegant passion in her voice, you cant do anything but respect the power of it.  she could be singing &quot;i'm a little teapot...&quot; and with her voice and the musical arrangements she could still invoke the powers of love. you will love this.
B00004XQP4|4.0|this album is probably the least punk of all their albums, not to say it isnt at all, but they experimented with a lot of different styles here.  green day gets criticism from a lot of people for it, but really, its a good thing, because who wants to hear the exact same thing on each album?  i appreciate all kinds of different music and there is a lot of variety on &quot;warning&quot;.  i really like about 8 out of the 12 songs.  among my favorites are blood, sex, and booze, castaway, and macy's day parade.  so if you are a green day fan, this is a must-have.
B000002JS0|5.0|I've been listening to AC/DC for a long time and this is one of there best, here, I'll tell you about the Songs,<br />1. Very good opener, and the bagpipe is breathtaking.<br />2. Also very good, music and lyrics, also a very good meaning.<br />3. A nice cool down song, and somewhat funny, but the live version has better lyrics. (but these words are more appropriate)<br />4. Teriific music, you'll get the feeling you heard it before.<br />5. A classic if you never heard T.N.T, you haven't heard nothin'<br />6. Originally sung by dave evans, but this one is ALOT better.<br />7. Little Lover sounds like a 50's song, but it's still good. (It could have been worse, it could be Love song here instead, that tune is there worst!) <br />8. She's got balls is all AC/DC.<br />9. THE BEST ON THE C.D!!!<br />There's something else, look at the differences between U.S and Aus. releases. (for those who don't know)<br />High Voltage<br />Baby, please don't go - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) She's got balls - (released on this album) little Lover - (released on this album) Stick around - (Never released in the U.S) soul stripper - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) You ain't got a hold on me - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) Love song - (Never released in the U.S) Show Buisness - (later released on 74' Jailbreak)<br />T.N.T<br />Almost identical to the U.S High Voltage except Rocker was replaced by she's got balls (and later put on Dirty Deeds) and School days was replaced by little lover. so it's just a combination. Thank you and good night!
0553573403|5.0|A friend recommended, and I thought okay, what the heck - probably another Robert Jordan. Boy was I wrong - this is a fantasy light fantasy book - it reads almost like a historical novel, and there's no magic (a nice touch). You won't miss the magic as the characters are so well rounded and interesting. there is magic referred to in various legends, but nobody walking through walls or unexplained plot twists. I found the direwolf an intriguing animal to use as foreshadowing of events to unfold. As always will such epic stories, there are many characters to try to keep track of  - i just ignored and followed the main houses as history was made. all in all, a great book, and I hope he can match the quality of the story and characters for the sequels.
B00003CY5H|5.0|I had high expectations of this film going into it and I was not let down.  It was slow at first but it got better and better as the film wore on.  Talk about climactic, the ending is very suspenseful and shocking.  You think you know but you really have no idea what is going to happen.  The film starts off slow giving you an understanding of who Robert De Niro's character is and what his intentions are for his future retirement from the robbery business.  It slowly builds in suspense as De Niro's character is forced to make tough decisions about his life and this heist he has to pull off.  One of the best scenes is where De Niro and Norton's character are meeting two guys in a park to exchange information about a fortress's security system.  One  of the guys they are talking to becomes a little unstable and almost shoots Norton's character Jack in the chest.  This scene was very intense and captivating.  Another great part about the movie is the relationship between De Niro and Norton's characters who seem to be testing eachother the whole time to see which one is the smarter more intelligent thief.  You think one is smarter then something else happens and then the other man is the more clever thief until the end where you really know &quot;the score&quot; and who is the smarter man.  And to find that out you'll just have to see this picture.  I strongly believe that you won't be let down by the outcome of the film.  It's got a great plot, excellent performances by all the actors, and it is also very funny.  Just go see it!
0553579908|5.0|Weird but true - the second installment of this series sounds an improvement over the first (and that was already great!!!). You think you know who is bad and who is good, right? not quite. This time around the story sheds more light on the motivations of the various characters. Each chapter is again from varying points of view so each new chapter is a new tone of voice, and new perspective on events. Like the first book, I was unable to stop reading until the last page! Can't wait for the next one!

B000002AVF|5.0|This is a very good album from Mariah, in fact it is one of my favourites of hers. The 'duet' with Boyz 11 Men is wonderful, one of the best on the album. But unfortunately her later albums are not a touch on this or her earlier ones. It's too bad. But this is definately one album that will always be a pleasure to listen to.
0812550706|5.0|Having read this book about a million times, I still find it hard to put down every time. The whole world that has been created and the way the author builds his scenarios is absolutely stunning. Several people I have spoken to have dismissed the book because it has a poor ending, they read the whole book expecting a big fight at the end, for anyone that hasn't read it be aware that the point is not the physical war it is the mental one. If you want a book with &quot;shooting and killing&quot;, read F.N.G, if you want a psychological masterpiece read this.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|Cats is a very wonderful show for me. I started to watch it when Isaw it on wedu. I loved it since then and it is the only show I watch in my spare time. One of my favorate Cats is is, well I like all of them. I love Old Dutaronamy beacuse he is the leader of all of the cats. I like Mistfolees beacuse at the end of the show he does that little magical and brings bach Old Dutaronamy plus he is cute. I like Rum Tum Tugger beacuse He is cute, he has all of the right moves to atract girls. Now VICTORIA, man she is so flexable, she can bring foot all the way up to her head.

No matteR how old you are you will love it.
B00003CY3W|5.0|I read the comic. Once. The drawing was nice and I always intended to pick it up... But I never have. After seeing the movie it was impossible not to notice the huge differences between the movie and the comic. Seymour (the aging 78 collecting fellow) was by far the biggest change.<br />Anyways, to address a few of the earlier reviews, I too was hugely dissapointed that the Patience and Prudence song &quot;A smile and a Ribbon&quot; isn't on the soundtrack, and as far as I've been able to tell it was issued on 78 only (nut i'm not even 50% positive).<br />But to address the authenticity of the background characters, eg. the video store clerk who hadn't heard of &quot;8 1/2,&quot; I was laughing  recalling a time when as a record store clerk, a fellow employee had to ask (in all seriousness) who John Lennon was. Look for the smoking/drinking pregnant girl...<br />I think the film was far more subtle than it needed to be and in it's subtlety there wasn't a single moment where a lowbrow joke was used in favour of a clever comment or twist (except where it was realistic). <br />A brilliant adaptation and wonderful film. I haven't enjoyed a film like this in a long long time.
0880389052|5.0|I'm a fairly educated guy, but reading was never my thing...Until I picked up &quot;Homeland&quot;.I've always been into DnD, but never really read any books (actually none since ive been out of school). So when my wife told me to read this book, I was a little &quot;ify&quot;. I have to admit the first 10 pages took me about 2 days lol, couldnt really get into it. Then... I was forever hooked on Drizzt Do`Urden, and on R.A.Salvatore. I read the rest of the book on the 3rd night, just begging my wife for the next one in the series.<br />Homeland was an overall excellent book, Great characters, real good story line, and uncanny fights scences. My favorite character...duh. Drizzt. The beginning of many long nights reading started with this book.<br />So if you havent read this book yet, please pick it up and read it.<br />And my hat goes off to you Mr.Salvatore,Thank you.
0375703861|4.0|On the cover of the paperback version of &quot;White Teeth&quot;, there is one of those critical blurbs that proclaims what you are about to read/buy &quot;may be the first great novel of the new century.&quot;  Zadie Smith's debut work was certainly the &quot;it&quot; novel of the publishing world last year, so one can only begin to read &quot;White Teeth&quot; with fairly high expectations.  Does &quot;White Teeth&quot; live up to hype?  Yes and no.  <br />It is certainly a creative, fresh, and often comic piece of fiction.   Smith has brought together a wildly divergent cast of characters living in modern day London - from the twin sons of an arranged marriage between two Bangladeshi Muslims to an 80+ year old Jamaican Jehovah Witness who rides a sidecar of a motorcycle.  The novel has an epic feel, covering a 25-year period (with some flashbacks deeper into the past) in the intertwining lives of the many characters. Smith also shifts the narrative and time period focus four times in the novel.   So, as other reviewers have noted, some characters and plot lines disappear, new ones come to the forefront, and others return.   And this is where some readers might get into trouble.  I readily admit I was baffled by the reappearance of a character in the novel's later stages (it did eventually dawn on me who it was!).  At times Smith seems to lose her focus or perhaps just fails to keep the readers' attention (I plead guilty).  With this ambitious work, some aspects of &quot;White Teeth&quot; (storylines, characters)  will appeal to some readers, while others will not. But, in my opinion, much more things work than do not.<br />All in all, this is a fine novel and an impressive debut from Zadie Smith.  Unfortunately due to the heavy buzz that &quot;White Teeth&quot; has received, some readers will be undoubtedly be left disappointed.
0897500482|5.0|Excellent book. If you are just starting in martial arts however, this book will be hard for you to understand. If you are just starting out and read it, then read it again when you are more advanced in the fighting arts. However, this book is not one of Ashida Kim's \\"Learn to fight in 10 steps\\" type books (because his books are fake). Instead this book has a deeper meaning of Bruce Lee's infamous art.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Typically I don't listen to music of Dido's genre - stuff like Sarah MacLachlan, Sinead O'Connor...I like it, but I never go out of my way for it...Dido, however, rises above her genre. From the acoustic power of &quot;Hunter&quot; (my fave song on the CD, besides, of course, &quot;Thank You&quot;) to the surreal sorrow of &quot;My Lover's Gone,&quot; the CD - in essence - rocks.
B00003CXSP|4.0|The caracteres in this movie are decadent, perverted, Mason Verger ( Gary Oldman ) is one of the most horrendus villans in movie history, his voice, his makeup are memorable, and the movie follows the book and I think is fine, even the change on the end works, because the people in the theater was at one step to laught and if Jodie Foster join to the dinner that will be excesive, the athmosphere created by Scott is morbid, sick, specially the first part of the movie so I think he does a good job, we know that he is a great steticist and this movie has to work in the commercial way, so Im not expected a masterpiece like Alien, or Blade Runner, because of that, I buy this movie, is worth for the photography and elegant production design, and still expecting the release in DVD of 1492 Conquest of Paradise ( with the unforgettable music by Vangelis ) and The Duellist another great movies by Ridley Scott.
B000002NZO|5.0|Excluding the astonishing masterpiece that is &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;, I believe this is Genesis's best album. Most of people prefer &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot; or &quot;Selling England By The Pound&quot; and only like this record because of the last track - &quot;The Knife&quot;. In my opinion, it has 2 of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard: &quot;Visions Of Angels&quot; and &quot;Stagnation&quot; and there is only a minor quality track (&quot;Dusk&quot;).  It's a more quiet album than the ones that were to come. Here, prevails the sound of the keyboards and, of course, Peter Gabriel's vocal and poetry talents. Phil Collins was not in the band, yet. That's why the drums' sound is not very proeminent. If you liked the quiet songs from &quot;Nursery Cryme&quot;, (&quot;Seven Stones&quot; or &quot;The Fountain Of Salmacis&quot;), &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (&quot;Can-Utility And The Coastliners&quot; or &quot;Time Table&quot;) you will love this record. If you prefer a more balanced sound and your favorite Genesis tracks are &quot;The Return Of The Giant Hogweed&quot;, &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; or &quot;The Battle Of Epping Forest&quot; you might skip this record. As for me, I'll keep it close to Lamb!

B000001FA4|5.0|As an objective music fan, I don't expect to be blown away by much.  This album, which I first heard on vinyl from my roommate's mother's record collection, first struck me as simply mediocre.  As an entire album, it lacks the consistency of other U2 work like Achtung Baby, October, and All That You Can't Leave Behind, but The Unforgettable Fire will always remain my favorite because it truly showcases the positive power of rock music.<br />&quot;Pride (In The Name of Love)&quot; is one of the most powerful songs ever written.  Not only does it have catchy pop appeal to endear it to the shallow listener (I will never forgive the makers of the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; soundtrack for sampling it as &quot;one night in the name of love&quot; - as if it had anything to do with the lustful whims Hollywood glorifies as &quot;love&quot;!), but it is truly inspiring, with its references to Martin Luther King and Jesus Christ as individuals who gave their lives &quot;in the name of love.&quot;<br />Musically, this album soars - &quot;Bad&quot; will always characterize the beauty of U2 for me.  The soaring guitars by Edge, soulful bass by Adam, powerful percussion by Larry, and of course, Bono's beautiful bass-to-falsetto vocals are solid, smart, and inspiring.<br />The profundity and emotion expressed in this modest production mean more to me than any other work of the 1980's.  I highly reccommend it to those who still believe that rock can uplift.

B000053VAF|3.0|Kevin Smith is an excellent screenwriter. No doubt about it. But sadly he´s crap at directing his own films. A smart move on Smith´s behalf would be to let somebody else sit in *the* chair, while he kept to writing, and perhaps instead of directing he could be producing. So the problem with this film is, as I´ve said, the directing. The scenes are well written, but Smith has huge trouble pulling them off in front of the camera. The shots are poorly set up. It all looks cheap. Not all of the scenes work. And so on and so forth. But that´s not to say the film still don´t manage to generate a few laughs. Because, as I said, the screenplay really is funny. But it´s perhaps a better idea to rent this film than to purchase it.<br />Another thing that bothers me, on a more general agenda, and which I would like to take the time to comment on, is how the production companies behind these films continously milk the market for every penny that´s out there, by first releasing a normal DVD edition of the film and then, a few months later, release a special edition of the film. &quot;They&quot; seem to be doing this with nearly every film nowadays. Why can´t they just release the supirior version of the film and be done with it.
6303461484|5.0|While the movie took some artistic license in adapting Robert Cullen's &quot;The Killer Department,&quot; the book about the search for the Russian serial killer of more than 50 people, the overall quality of this movie was astonishing.  Not only Sutherland, who received much deserved awards, but Rea himself, the always-wonderful Max von Sydow, Joss Ackland (the man you love to hate) and Jeffrey Munn were riveting.  Due to the integrity (i.e., emotional honesty and passion) of the actors, this movie is very hard to watch (most of the victims were children and the characters respond authentically). Watch, especially, for the fabulous chemistry between Festilov and Burakov. Everyone involved did their job.
B00003CXRP|4.0|From such established literary classics as \\"Robinson Crusoe\\" and \\"Lord of the Flies\\" to such products of pop culture idiocy as \\"Gilligan's Island\\" and the original \\"Survivor,\\" the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit, ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self-preservation.  Perhaps, those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we, ourselves, could rise to such a challenge.  Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's \\"Survivor\\" and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, \\"Cast Away.\\"<br />\\"Cast Away\\" is a film that works on several different levels at once - but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking.  This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks, during the course of the filming, underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in \\"Raging Bull.\\"  Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.<br />The story is a simple one:  Chuck Noland is a classic type-A FedEx exec (one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie-in to end all product tie-ins) who is clearly too focused on the split-second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses - or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean, Chuck, as the sole survivor, manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange, forbidding world.  Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.  We watch the step-by-step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence - and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued.<br />\\"Cast Away\\" is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality.  The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love - even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them (children, of course, do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates).  The finale of the film rings true as well, for we know that, in our lives, fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us.  The world marches on and, if, for any reason, we fall off temporarily, all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up, painful as that may be at times.<br />As it is, \\"Cast Away\\" is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations.anks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.

B000005ZFN|5.0|This is a great album!  And, before I say anything else, there's one subject I must brooch! The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.  I've seen way too many people rip on this piece.  I love it!  You have to understand its purpose.  It's an intermission, to lighten the mood between the heavy music and meaningful lyrics.  Yes, others have noted that, but they missed a point.  Remember the title?  A PASSION PLAY.  A medieval passion plays could take a week to perform, and would always have a light-hearted interval, unconnected with the rest of the story.  Almost exclusively dealing with a simple moral with animal characters.  If you take that, and the obvious anti-establishment (for lack of a better term) satire involved, you'll get much more out of this story.  (And by the way, Ian doesn't do the vocals for The Hare, Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond does.) The rest of the album's great, too, but any other review can tell you that.  Check this piece out, it's worth it!
B000001C6M|5.0|This is where it all started,Modern Death,Speed and Thrash all revolve around this historic piece of music.For the USA Slayer was THE first Death Metal Band of all time.This hails as their first full album.Even if you are unfamiliar with this type of music,this album should be in your music collection as a tribute to the genre of music it inspired. Pay attention to the way the album was mastered,instruments panned,drums miked a certain way,aggressive vocals,centered around Steven King like settings.All these things would be copied again and again by thousands of garage bands around the world.If your a fan of horror books I would recommend this as an excellent back drop to,&quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;,or &quot;The Shining&quot;or any of your favorites.Make sure you buy the edition of this album that includes &quot;Haunting the Chapel,Chemical Warfare,and Captor of Sin&quot;.These are three bonus songs that appeared seperately,but now should be included at no extra price.Get the adrenaline glands ready,for this ultimate rush of horror!
B00001ZULV|2.0|I was anticipating this new release featuring many of my fave tunes from the Collins-era Genesis. Sadly, I was disappointed by the content: many of the tracks are radio edits. \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Abacab\\", and \\"Mama\\" are three of the cut-back songs that make this Greatest Hits release something of a downer.<br />Although the \\"Carpet Crawlers\\" re-make- featuring Peter Gabriel &amp; Phil Collin's momentary reunion- isn't too bad, it's not quite enough to offset the clipped `tunage. If you want this particular track badly enough, go for the CD-single instead.

B000006OBQ|4.0|This appears to be the favorite album of many who count themselves as members of the Board or rat-pack wannabes. Indeed, I find it a pleasurable album, a taste of Vegas before it deserted genuine cabaret in favor of Disney family fare, white tigers, and sheer synthetic excess. However, the album really isn't that great a representation of Sinatra the artist. He is in only fair voice, some of the arrangements normally given to symphony orchestra are awkwardly transcribed for the Basie band, and much of the recording is taken up with Sinatra's verbal patter and attempts at humor (which is best experienced in person). I heard Sinatra in better voice at concerts he gave in the 70s and 80s than in this 60s night club setting.<br />There are some fine moments on the album (&quot;Don't Worry About Me,&quot; for example), and Sinatra's recognition of composers of songs and acknowledgement of the band members' contributions reveals his sensitivity to purely musical values. But for a better live, concert date, check out the sextet session, &quot;Live in Paris,&quot; or the album made with Red Norvo in Australia. Or if you want to hear both Sinatra and Basie at their very best, pick up their first studio session on Reprise, &quot;Sinatra and Basie.&quot;<br />If you remain unconvinced, try to obtain the original album instead of this remastered edition, which includes the previously unreleased &quot;Luck Be a Lady.&quot; For some reason, he's struggling with his phrasing and vowel sounds on a song that he normally owns. This version should have been destroyed.
B000002LIR|5.0|An offhand comment from a pal (\\"you know who's never recorded a song I don't like? Rod Stewart!\\") and a five-disc carousel CD player with four empty slots inspired me to purchase this anthology eleven years ago. (Jeez, has it really been that long?) I slowly drove my college roommate insane (believe me, it was a short trip for her!) with the music as I fell hopelessly in love all at once with the crisp sound of CD technology, Rod's unbearably sexy, raspy voice and the lively, intelligent and pretty damned catchy lyrics of his songs. I already knew many of the songs on Disc 4 from the MTV years as well as some of his bigger hits from earlier years, but I easily came to enjoy the music that filled in the gaps of my familiarity with Rod's musical history. <br />A totally unexpected bonus completes the package - a fantastic booklet replete with Rod's reminiscences and opinions of each of the compilation's tracks provides some insight into both the man and his music. In it, Rod recounts the story behind the discovery of 'Maggie May' (it was the B-side of another song, a DJ in Cleveland flipped the single over and its popularity - and Rod's career - took off like a rocket) and reveals that 'Maggie' almost didn't make the album in the first place because \\"nobody liked it\\"; describes a song as one he \\"love(s)...to death, even though [he] wrote it\\"; attempts to clear up a common and persistent misconception about one of his biggest hits; and explains why you probably won't ever hear him perform 'The Killing of Georgie' in concert again (I wouldn't hold my breath to ever hear 'Love Touch' live, either). (If you want more details, you'll just have to lay hands on a copy of the booklet!) He does this all in such engaging, colorful and colloquial language that one feels as though s/he is discussing his oeuvre with him over a few pints at a pub instead of just reading a box set's liner notes. Maybe these recollections simply demonstrate a typically British charm of speech, but I've never read anything quite like them, and certainly never expected anything so articulate (I mean, clever song lyrics are one thing, but...) and intelligent from a popular recording artist like Rod.<br />All in all, this remains the best musical investment I've ever made. Well, maybe I should say it ties for first with my CD player.
B00004Z459|5.0|The first time I listened to this CD as a whole, I got that familiar tingle that makes you want to explore the music further. I returned the borrowed CD to my friend and went out to get my own copy.Second time round, I was hooked. The sound is so alive, the mixtures of electronic grooves, rap, Chester's(the lead singer)melodic voice and the poetic lyrics grabbed me. There isn't a single song in it not worth listening to. But exceptional ones, in my opinion are: Papercut, One Step Closer, Points Of Authority, Crawling, Runaway, In The End, Place For My Head,  Forgotten, Cure For The Itch, Pushing Me Away. Thats 10 out of 12!! Seriously.... I listened to this CD 8 times through in two days... its an excellent collection of music, digitally mastered in such a way to enhance the beats and flow, without becoming too obvious. Can't wait till the next release from Linkin Park....

B000031XCR|5.0|Celine is one of the best singers out there!  She doesn't need to be glamorized and madeup in order for her CD's to sell.  They sell because she she has a great voice and sings with a lot of soul.  This is Celine's best album yet.  It includes some of her biggest hits (all *excellent* songs) and a batch of new songs (there was one big hit out of them, 'That's The Way It Is', which is a beautiful song!).  This was a great finale for Celine.  She stepped out of the music business on a (very) high note.

B00005JG6Q|1.0|Sorry, but no, not even for the time in which it was made.  The motion is not smooth between poses, and a lot of the film is just that- poses held, mouths agape, and stills panned over.  That ain't animation.<br />The story is too condensed and too unrewarding.<br />The English voice acting is the worst- and the script itself is a lot of name's screamed back and forth, yuck.  The children's voices are women scrunched up or something- it is bad.<br />The bst scene is at the end when Kaneda's bike is all smashed up but still rolling.  The otherwise cliched comic relief, cliched violence, and cliched typical Japanese delivery of puerile entertainment... -sigh-

B00005IC2H|5.0|I'm not going to add much to what has already been said about the music of Sigur Rós in previous reviews, only that I have to agree with almost all the other reviewers in that it's like nothing you've heard before. <br />On the other hand I want to say that I'm sorry so many of you miss out on the excellent lyrics of this album. I've seen in many of these reviews that people believe the lyrics are not important to the overall enjoyment of Sigur Rós' music. That's a gross misunderstanding. If you liked the music the lyrics add yet another dimension. It's difficult to describe, but their lyrics are a simple yet beautiful view on the world closest to us, the everyday life of people like you and me. Being Icelandic I have the privilege of enjoying the lyrics as much as the music and you'll just have to believe me when I say they're just as important.<br />The only thing that bothers me about Sigur Rós is their decision to sing in &quot;Hopelandic&quot; in concerts outside Iceland. I agree with someone who found that just a tad pretentious. But don't despair, the lyrics on the album are in Icelandic. So all you have to do now is find a course in Icelandic near your home and enroll tomorrow! It's worth it.<br />Oh, one more thing, please stop comparing Sigur Rós to alien music, how on earth can that be a positive description?
B00005IBGQ|5.0|Total admiration and rapturous praise approach what I would want to say about Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Poses.&quot;  Contributing to the timeless tradition of troubadours and trouveres who have  feasted at life's tableÐ not yet 30, this silken, sultry voice is evocative of the explorative, often sensual excursions of a young man who has learned and experienced much. A close listening is an absolute if one is to fully discover both the vocal and metaphorical pleasures hidden within each songÐevery one a new trove to be examined and enjoyed as unique. This CD is proof that great songs will continue to be written and sung. If you want an experience to touch you in those secret, mysterious placesÐthen this is the CD for you.  August 8, 2001.  Thanks , Hal Newman, Richmond, VA
B00004YW6I|3.0|if you're thinking of making this album your introduction to polly jean harvey, i wouldn't suggest it. musically there's a few standouts like the rocking &quot;this is love&quot; (the album's classic) and the beautiful &quot;a place called home&quot;, but on other tracks like &quot;we float&quot;, &quot;good fortune&quot; and &quot;you said something&quot; she sounds like a lilith fair cast-off. even worse is the lyrical content. completely gone is the androgyne misfit of &quot;dry&quot; and &quot;rid of me&quot;, the obsessive vamp of &quot;to bring you my love&quot;, the storyteller of &quot;is this desire?&quot; and is replaced by... a hallmark greeting card! really, she doesn't say anything new here. most of these songs could have been written by anybody - she talks about how beautiful love is, how much it's changed her, how intense it makes her feel - and doesn't even present it in an interesting way. you think polly would, judging from her other albums... all of which come higly recommended!!
B000001G16|5.0|I am now purchasing this CD for the THIRD time.  Everytime I have purchased a copy some Girlfriend walks away with it.<br />ITS THAT HOT!!!<br />Jon may have been the genius in the band, but there is no way to compare Richies talent to Jons.  Sambora is an all arround pro.  Not only is his guitar talent and his songwriting talent, but his vocals are so strong they can cut thru you so deep that you can feel it in your soul.<br />If you like rock blues style it doesnt get any sexier and hearfelt than this.<br />A MUST ADD TO YOUR COLLECTION<br />Words to describe this CD... SEXY, HOT, BLUES/ROCK, BON JON WHO???
B00003CXE7|4.0|Some movies get hyped into 'greatness' - this is an excellent example  of the kind. I'm not saying it's not good, but make no mistake, this  is no 'Ben Hur' or even 'Braveheart'.<br />  The 'epic scale' is more or less achieved, aided considerably by some  impressive Computer Graphics, and the action sequences are mostly  well done. However the storytelling could've been better ........  and in a strange way, the movie lacks soul. It doesn't really shake  you up when it supposedly should.<br />  Russell Crowe is competent as the chief protagonist, but his role is  not emotionally demanding. I believe he's given finer performances,  eg in 'Insider', without winning any awards so i guess it's some  kind of poetic justice that he must win it for this.<br />  Phoenix Joaquin is more impressive as the villain, even though his  character has no shades - he's just evil through and though.  Connie Nelson as his sister &amp; Crowe's ex love interest is fair.Most of the support cast do their job well.<br />  The technical aspects of the movie, like cinematography,  graphics, etc and the score all quite good.<br />  All in all, a movie worth watching, but you should do that first to  decide whether it's actually worth **buying**.
6305181772|5.0|This movie was one of the best movies I've seen in years.  With a really good cast includig Tom Cruise and Jon Voight, This movie can actually provide action with a plot.  If you hear that this movie was confusing, the people you are hearing these from don't know what they're talking about.  If you need a good action movie to watch, watch Mission: Impossible.
B000002KXV|5.0|I first was given this album in 1982 by a boyfriend.  I was always a huge Steely Dan fan, and listening to this album was as about as good as it got.  When I listen to it now, twenty years later, it is easy to see how timeless each song is.  You cannot help but have emotions stir up as you listen to it - yes, it is that powerful.  The story behind each song is almost a tear-jerker, but you are too busy enjoying the music.  I highly recomend this CD to anyone who was/is a Steely Dan fan and a lover of great jazz music.
B0000033PB|4.0|Don't go out and buy this expecting Brain Salad Surgery or Tarkus etc. This is a strong album reflecting the maturity of the artists and skills. I personally can appreciate a band never staying in one place and definately don't want E.L.P. to be sounding the same as they did 30 years ago, however I do appreciate them being in the same genre. This album has some beautiful music and I can strongly recommend it to someone looking for something to relax and really &quot;get into&quot;. Lake's vocals, although much changed, are strong and right on the money. The band is tight and sounds like they have been together forever. Too bad they couldn't keep this up.
B000002AH7|5.0|What possessed Davis to make a recording based on the work of a Spanish composer will probably never be known to the masses but thank heaven he did. &quot;Concierto de Aranjuez&quot;, one of the finest works of composer Joaquin Rodrigo, is certainly not the typical Miles Davis theme. Davis recorded the music in a very impressionistic manner...broad, bold strokes of the brush. Fitting, since Rodrigo himself said, &quot;My path is the period from 1600 to 1750. Later, impressionism, the French school&quot;. Miles takes the composition and makes it his own, seemingly a conduit for Rodrigo's mood but tempered with his own invention. A great recording, a mix of the classical and of a very subtle jazz that is quite beautiful and timeless
0780020685|4.0|Don't get me wrong, &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; is an excellent movie that deserves five stars but I was disappointed with the options included on the DVD considering its price.  The film and sound quality are to a degree where the DVD version is not necessary and I doubt you'd lose much watching it from a VHS source instead.  I'm not criticizing the movie because of this - after all, it was released in 1956 AND also in a Japan that was still recovering from the crippling effects of World War II.  It's just that I've seen classics on DVD for the same price that have put in much more effort (extras) for a release on DVD.  I'm not sure how much of the price reflects its Japanese origins but the film is still a keeper for any cinema fan.<br />Besides the usual scene selection option, the other extras included are a trailer and a commentary by a noted expert on Japanese film.  The commentary is insightful and helps answer many questions that arise while watching &quot;The Seven Samurai.&quot;  While this film is universal in its theme, there are some moments in the picture that are based in obvious cultural differences and its fun to listen while the commentary explain some of these.  Another interesting point is to compare this to the American version of the film, &quot;The Magnificent Seven,&quot; to witness the differences between Japanese and American cultures.  <br />If you've never seen a film by the director Akira Kurosawa I would definitely recommend this film as an introduction to his famous work.  &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; is to Japan what &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; or &quot;The Godfather&quot; is to the United States.  Disappointing in its limited DVD options considering there was so much they could have done but still worth having in your film library.
0684865130|2.0|Thirty years ago this summer after my freshman year of college I started to read Catch 22. Everyone was reading Catch 22.  I don't really recall why, but I never finished it.  This summer I picked up the book on tape because my high-school daughter was assigned to read it. I'll finish it this time, but now I know why I left the book unfinished that summer.  Reading it is turning into a chore. <br />I question whether this book holds up as a classic. True, there are plenty of moments of biting satire and superb black comedy. and yes, the phrase Catch 22 did enter the language and that concept is brilliant. But the book is 400 pages of the basically the same thing over and over. There is virtually no characterization -- Heller is incapable of it -- and not much of a plot either. One cannot keep the characters straight; they all blend together. Yes, it is about war, but Heller/Yossarian really comes across as a misanthrope -- everyone in his world is weird and worthless.  I don't want to spend more time with any of them, but I've got two-thirds of a book to go. Voltaire did something quite similar to Catch 22 in Candide, but he kept his story to about 100 pages.  Heller probably should have done the same.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Okay, first of all, you don't even need to like anime to love this movie.  Its one of those movies you just love. The music is great, the animation is great, ... its just great. If it were a woman I'd marry it. Anyways, I have a lot of anime(about 40 DVD's and about 5 VHS.), trust me this is a must buy. I have personally seen it about 40 times.  I cant stop watching it along with Rurouni Kenshin OAV (Samurai X). Whoops, Im reviewing 2 things at once. Anyways, you have to get it, yes Im talking to you, hey look at me,.... GET IT!!! NOW !!!!!!!!!
B0000013GT|5.0|Everything about Outkast's second release is an experience. The intro sets the mood for a funked-out Alien joy ride through the ATL. From there, the album only gets better; &quot;2 Dope Boyz (In a Cadillac)&quot; is catchy with its eery beat and soothing hook. Next is &quot;ATLiens&quot;, whose hook is bound to get the party going (and who doesn't recall the line &quot;cooler than a polar bears toenails&quot;?). Every cut from then on uses the same formula: laid back E.T. style beats with soft R&amp;B-like-flowing hooks. other stand-out tracks include &quot;Wheelz Of Steel&quot;, &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot;, &quot;Elevators&quot;, and &quot;Millenium&quot;, whose hook of soft grunting creates an incredibly smoothe, clean sound. And the lyrics? Off the hook; neither Dre nor Big Boi miss a beat anywhere on the album. Only Outkast can pull off aruging black rights and boasting their fur coats in the same verse. And guest appearances by Goodie Mob &amp; Babyface only make the album better. Throw together tight lyrics with crisp production and a couple great featured artists, and the listener is immersed into Outkast's extraterrestrial world of players, pimps and hoes. The hook for &quot;E.T., Extraterrestrial&quot; descride the album perfectly; &quot;Out of this world&quot;.<br />If you like ATLiens, check out: &quot;Dead Prez - Let's Get Free&quot;, &quot;Goodie Mob - Soul Food&quot;, &quot;The Roots - Do You Want More?!!!??!&quot;, &quot;Blackalicious - Nia&quot;
B000002552|4.0|If these spooky/goofy/amazing songs ever get properly presented in a form that doesn't insult them on every conceivable level, it will be my favorite album of all time.  Until then, I'll give it 4 stars and continue to stick pins in my Columbia voodoo doll....
B000002MZ6|5.0|Bought this CD after buying the single &quot;Let there be light&quot;.  i'd just heard tubular bells for the first time, and recognized the name... i still can't get over this CD.  This is surely the most-listened to CD i own.  I've had others listen to it and immediately beg for a tape-copy until they can buy their own (this was before burners were common. ^_~).  <br />If you get the chance, read the book as well as listen to the music.  they do work together, perfectly. ^_^ <br />I believe my favorite track is &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;.  I love how throughout the entire CD, the tracks blend together. Oceana and Only Time Will Tell have a single note which brings them together as one piece... and it sounds beautiful.  Perhaps that's the only word I have to describe this... beautiful.
B00000K31V|4.0|This film is wonderfully non-exploitative.  It delves very lightly into the ideas behind the gaming world...and where it could go, and how it could affect our future.  The game seems to surround the question of whether such realistic games could distort our reality.  The film is clever in the way it pursues this initially, but falters a lot.  It definitely has interesting situations...and a few twisted images.  Cronenberg doesn't leave you with much to think about, just a few ooh's and ahh's.  Jennifer Jason Leigh doesn't give much to the film.  She's as whiny and annoying as ever with the exception of the lines &quot;Did I win?&quot;, &quot;Did I win?&quot;.  That was endearing.  It's a different sort of film which holds your attention, so for that alone it's worth seeing.  It's light and Jude Law is worth watching without doubt.  No pomp.
0140328696|4.0|If you haven't read this book, where have you been???  The story is like the perfect childhood fantasy -- visiting a chocolate factory and seeing all the cool inventions!!  Willy Wonka is a bizarre character who hides out in his factory, inventing candy with the help of Oompa Loompas (who only seem to show up when a naughty child is about to get into trouble!).<br />It's a great book, and it teaches valuable lessons about greed.  Charlie is a good kid who follows directions.  The other children on the tour get themselves into trouble by not listening to Wonka's instructions.  They're punished in strange and surreal ways, and we really don't know whether they live to tell the tale.<br />That's why I'm giving this book 4 stars, not 5.  I find it to be a little cruel, and I think Wonka is kind of sadistic toward children.  For example, he shows everybody his brand new chewing gum invention that tastes like a 3-course dinner.  Despite Wonka's warnings that it's not quite ready yet, a girl named Violet (who is famous for loving to chew gum!) grabs the gum and starts chewing it.  When she tastes blueberry pie, her body turns blue.  Before she knows what's happening to her and before she can spit it out, she starts blowing up and turning into a blueberry.  While the poor girl is screaming helplessly, the Oompa Loompas surround her and start rolling her around the Inventing Room singing a song!!<br />All of this struck me as a little mean.  Wonka never tells Violet that she'll turn into a blueberry if she keeps chewing.  All he says is it isn't ready yet.  And the Loompas don't seem terribly worried about juicing her.  They're joyfully rolling her around and singing about how naughty she is!  Instead of learning any kind of lesson from Violet's \\"situation,\\" I just ended up feeling sorry for her.
0446343129|5.0|This informative and fearless book reveals how the government has strived for years to keep Americans ignorant about white sugar in the name of profit.  <br />The book was effective because it was not pushy.  Dufty gives us a history of refined or white sugar.  He reveals that many &quot;harmless looking&quot; foods we eat today are not food at all, and are killing the American people!  he does not give his readers much advice until he has properly informed them.  Amazing book, I have already recommended it.
0393312836|5.0|Well i never really wrote a review before so its not that great. but yeah, this book is great, it took a while to learn what some of the english words meant translated to american slang, but it really makes you think. this is my current favorite book.
B000002H72|5.0|Nobody was doing what the Pixies were doing when this came out in '89.  And nobody was doing anything quite this good.  It's a pretty phenomenal listen all the way through--the Pix's best no doubt.  Eclectic doesn't even come close to describing the way this band can put together caucophony and chaos and make it come off sounding oh so fine.<br />Francis Black screams, but the rage is tamed by humour, so all is O.K. in Pixieland.  Kim Deal's bass lines are rock solid and keep the songs driving along.  There even some pretty out of the world drumming on &quot;La La Love You&quot; and Joey Santaigo's axe work is par excellence.  So many styles and influences are explored here that when it's all mixed together it emerges as something entirely unique.  To really set it off, there is a Spang-lish thread running throughout Black's lyrics as Black declares himself an &quot;un chien andalusia&quot; from the same film by Buhnuel (sp?).  And I was dissapointed to find that Francis Black wasn't even hispanic but had a soul molding (maybe warping is a better term for it) sojourn South of the Border with a prostitute as a roommate in Mexico City.<br />The styles range from the heaviest of heavy metal rage with Black doing some pretty vocal chord wrenching screaming on &quot;Tame&quot; to pretty pop on &quot;Here comes your man&quot; and &quot;La La Love You.&quot;  There's some even some elements of the Rolling Stones riff and roll with Black making like Jagger and Deal playing Richards in &quot;Hey&quot; singing, &quot;We're cha-ah-ained (chained)&quot;..my personal fave. Listen to it and you'll see what I mean.  The production is pretty incredible to as well, with songs seemingly blending into the next making it the Pixies most coherent works.<br />All around brilliant.  I leave you with the wacky words of Black from Crackity Jones, &quot;Jose Jones told me alone his story, he got friends like Paco Pico Pierda, la mueneca Muerda.&quot;  What does this mean?  I don't think the Pixies know and frankly francis it just don't matter when it's sounding this good.Pixies know and frankly francis it just don't matter when it's sounding this good.
0780021967|5.0|I first saw 39 Steps a few years back on AMC with my son, who was 7 at the time. We missed the ending, and ever since we've both been wanting a chance to see the rest. Since then I've bought two copies on VHS that were so bad they were unwatchable. Finally, thanks to Criterion, we were able to watch it all the way through. This print is nearly pristine, which makes watching this great movie that much more enjoyable. Like each of the Criterion discs I've bought so far, this is a must-have for your collection.
B0000024RQ|5.0|I haven't heard every folk album ever made, so I can't honestly say that, but The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is definitely my favorite folk album. Dylan's songwriting is genius on this album. Not the same kind of songwriting genius that would be exhibited on later albums such as Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, but still genius. The songs range from protest anthems (&quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot;, &quot;Masters of War&quot;, &quot;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&quot;) to love ballads (&quot;Girl From the North Country&quot;, &quot;Corrina Corrina&quot;) to blues (&quot;Down the Highway&quot;) to humorous songs (&quot;Honey Just Allow Me One More Chance&quot;, &quot;I Shall Be Free&quot;). It's a wonderful, truly classic album, all the more amazing since Dylan was only 21 when he recorded it. This is an essential part of any Bob Dylan collection.
0451457994|4.0|Okay, first, let me say that I do have respect for Stanley Kubrick.  His work is probably the best that any director could offer in terms of cinnematography.  However, his &quot;vision&quot; of the story which he and Arthur C. Clarke concocted is about as understandable as standard US tax forms.  Look at it all you like and you may get a general idea, but I doubt you'll find the details.<br />Clarke's work takes place on a different planet, with slightly different dilemas, and a different ending (IE a non-cryptic understandable one).  One of the best parts of the novel (when Hal opens the air locks) didn't even appear in the movie.<br />Clarke also consistently follows the laws of physics, something that some science fiction writers have a great deal of trouble with.<br />The series sparks much thought about our origins and where we're going as a species.  The thought provoking and mysterious &quot;monolith&quot; personifies the mysteries of our own origins.<br />Overall, this is an excellent book and good for anyone who saw the movie, marveled for 2 hours at the pretty colors, then saw the ending and said... &quot;huh?!&quot;  Enjoy this and the entire series, they are worth the time.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Star Wars Episode 1 would have to go down in film history as the biggest disappointment ever. What a piece of rubbish! The script is appalling, the acting non-existant (everyone just stands around saying their lines, without any feeling or emotion, looking like they desparately want to know what's happening on that green-screen behind them), and the computer generated FX so overwhelming that its like having spectacular fireworks let off in your face for 2 hours ... my brain went into fatigue-mode after about an hour.<br />George's excuse for my above comments? I would imagine him saying something like this - &quot;The script is bad because I hate writing scripts; the acting was bad because it was nearly all shot in front of a green-screen; and the CGI was so over the top because we had to take the audience's eyes away from the bad acting.&quot;<br />And we can only hope that Jar Jar Binks is sliced into little pieces by a lightsabre during the opening of Episode 2 (&quot;Attack of the Clowns .. er, Clones??? Please pass the bucket ...... ). As well as hoping that George isn't directing Ep 2. Lets face it, Georgie ... just sell the Star Wars license to someone who knows how to make a good movie, because you've forgotten how to.<br />In closing - 'Star Wars' (I can't bring myself to call it &quot;A New Hope&quot;) was fantastic; &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; will be looking on in 50 years time as a movie classic; &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was a let-down, but great anyway; &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; was complete (pretty) garbage!
B00005B1EX|1.0|DOnt care if it is good or not. Compilations are horrible. The only intention of this album is to make fast money. The formula is old: an old band or solo asrtist comes back after years of reclusion or commercial breakdown. What does he do ? Release a new studio studio album followed fast by a live album: see recent exmaples: JUDAS PRIEST (JUGULATOR followed by LIVE MELTDOWN), IRON MAIDEN (BRAVE NEW WORLD followed by a live album that is already on production) and so on and on. Blergh !
B00005M989|4.0|OK, I understand that Prince is a victim of the industry and I've read all the reviews saying &quot;don't buy it because....&quot;  However, I think this is a very strong compilation and a great overview of Prince's amazing career on one beautifully-packaged single disc.  Sure, it's missing a couple of my all-time faves, but for a &quot;hit&quot; collection it pretty much hit the nail on the head.  I'd have to think he's making some money off the publishing and royalties, so I'm not going to lose sleep over whether or not it's going against &quot;the cause&quot; in buying this release.  And everyone else should buy it too!  It's just great music in one convenient fabulous package!
0451199871|4.0|I read The Body in the Library when I was probably 12 or so and developed a great admiration for Agatha Christie and Miss Marple. (Can't say I like Hercule Poirot that much, but that's just me). Anyway, I went on to read a great many of the books, but always remember The Body as my first and one of my favourites. Now 23 years later, I bought a copy to read on vacation and I am loving it again. I still remember details from the first time I read it. I think that Agatha Christie was the best classic English mystery writer ever and Miss Marple was one of her best creations. Bravo!
B000005DQR|5.0|Got this album five years ago and it is still one of my favorites.  Its brilliance never ceases to astound.  Has to be one of the best albums of all time.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I know that's a very bold claim.  This CD has not left my CD Player in two years.  Ok, fine, it's a 3CD changer, but still!  The songs on this album are uncredibly overpowering.  The only album i can compare this to is Dark Side of the Moon.  I know you're saying know, &quot;here's another comparison to PF&quot;, but it's the truth.  Each song plays with your emotions.  By the time the tourist is played, i am exhausted.  Anyone who doesn't give this album 5 stars, needs to listen to it agian and again and again..
B00005B6C9|5.0|This Is Where I Came In is another triumph for the Bee Gees.  With something for everyone, the disc hooks the listener from start to finish.  The title track is infectious, and demonstrates the famous Gibb harmony is stronger than ever.  All three brothers have tracks featuring their unique vocal styles - Man in the Middle and Walking on Air are two particularly upbeat offerings featuring often overlooked brother Maurice.  The jaunty Technicolor Dreams pays homage to the 40s style music of the Gibbs' parents while still being accessible to the younger crowd.  Walking on Air and Embrace are destined to be club favorites with their driving rythms, while the beautiful Wedding Day is certain to join the list of wedding standards.  Thoroughly enjoyable whether listening, dancing, or singing along, This Is Where I Came In is a remarkable compilation that is reminiscent of the brothers' early career and yet inviting, current, and vital.

In this incredible film not only does it continue the Star Trek saga, but it also elaborates on one of the best episodes from the Original Series.  What happen to Khan?

B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall is one of those CDs that will forever leave a mark on the music world, and is in competition with Dark Side of the Moon as the best Pink Floyd album.  To listen to the entire album is more like listening to a story with great background music then to any number of individual songs.  Speaking as a current high school student, I can testify that The Wall is possibly the most well-known and liked CD from before 1990 in our school.  Another Brick In the Wall Part 2 is up there with any new hit song as the most popular among the teen crowd, and this is one CD that will never fade, and is well worth the cost.
1577311523|5.0|I was a little put off when the author described himself as sitting on a park bench being incredibly happy for two years affter his enlightenment.  Sounded nuts to me.  Then I realized that real enlightenment might look a little nuts to the rest of us.  The author is able to explain profound truths very simply.  I found the information changing my attitudes and behavior immediately.  And he explained some things I have wondered about, for instance I have wondered about the future of the earth and the human race (which doesn't look good) and how consciousness could continue if the human race doesn't continue.  His explanation of consciousness experimenting with form makes more sense to me than other things I've read.  He also takes us gently to task, somewhat like the Dalai Lama, and doesn't allow us to make excuses for our poor habits.  This is also a good book for anyone wanting some insight on relationships.
6305165912|5.0|The Big Lebowski is a hilarious movie that has all the best actors like John Goodman. Easily my personal favorite.
0553573403|5.0|I had been given a border's books and music gift card by my father and I planned to use it to buy some new books.  Well, I was browsing the book store and happened upon a &quot;Clash of Kings&quot; which as we all know is the second book in the trilogy.  After picking it up and reading the front page, I noticed there was a first book.  I found the first book and bought them both, based mainly on the reviews on the book.  I must say I am ASTOUNDED at how well George Martin writes.  The man has the ability to surprise you, keep you in suspense and even draw you so deep into the storyline that you dream about being there in the ice, running from the Others and hiding from the Lannisters.  Good show.
B00005JK93|5.0|Probably the most thoughtful and artistic film to come out this summer (if not this year).   Musically and visually, it accomplishes what Moulin Rouge did with a fraction of the budget.   Full of humor and pathos, this film explores the most basic of human emotions- one of which being the simple search for love and acceptance.   However, it does so without ever being preachy or heavy-handed.  John Cameron Mitchell has created one of the most mature \\"first films\\" (in terms of his directorial confidence)  I've seen in a long time.   In a summer full of mind-numbing [stuff], it is refreshing to see a film that makes you think and feel to the extent that \\"Hedwig\\" does.   (Unless you count the feelings of complete despair and sadness that accompany any viewing of  \\"Planet Of The Apes\\" or \\"Tomb Raider.\\")
0375707972|5.0|This is a beautiful story which struggles with the new and learning life of a young boy as well as the long and hard life of a grown women (one that still has something to learn) and brings the two together in the most beautiful way that is humanly possible.  A book that is not for your morals, but for your heart, one that will most definatly touch it.
6303014100|4.0|Movies based on history fall into one of two categories.  They're either wonderful stories that are flawed on facts (Braveheart, JFK, for example), or they're faithful to the facts but lack drama (The Battle of Britain, produced by Harry Saltzman in the late '60s).  This film, written and directed by Ronald F. Maxwell, manages to be fairly accurate storytelling and compelling drama at the same time.  That Maxwell's movie embodies these two qualities in an almost four-hour picture is no small feat either.<br />The movie recreates the pivotal battle of the Civil War, when General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia sought to    destroy the Union forces under General George Meade at Gettysburg, a small town in Pennsylvania.  Maxwell's towering achievement in this movie, besides the many well-staged battle scenes, is to highlight the personal, emotional anguish of the soldiers on both sides, some of whom had been quite close before the war began. Witness the scene in the tent of General James Longstreet (Tom Berenger) as General Lewis Armistead (Richard Jordan, in one of his last screen roles) speaks emotionally about his friend, General Hancock, who he knows is just over the ridge where they will attack the next day.  Tears well up in Jordan's eyes as he recalls the deep affection that he developed for Hancock and his wife many years before.<br />Gettysburg is not a great movie, but it is a very good one, and well worth viewing for any American who is interested in the war that tore this nation asunder and, in some ways, made it more unified afterwards.
B000056K04|1.0|Being a long time DMB fan, I feel a bit as if I'm betraying the band. But honestly...this CD is, hands down the worst one yet. Lillywhite Sessions is WAY better, they should've released that one. I absolutely refuse to listen to &quot;I Did It&quot;. I hate that song with a burning passion. The only acceptable songs on the CD are &quot;The Space Between&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.
B0000035E7|3.0|The first six tracks on this album are vintage Nirvana. Then it goes way downhill, lurching in the bilge of monotonous plodding riffage. The last three tracks improve somewhat. I would give this album 5 stars if I were to judge it only on the first 6 tracks. Buy this CD if you like Nirvana. That is all. Out
B000002KET|2.0|This was the beginning of a long, slow decline for an early Sabbath fan like me.  I remember eagerly buying the vinyl when it came out in early '74 and was a mite dissappointed at how silly it sounded.... <br />The title track is a ridiculous Spinal Tap type of tune that skipped after all the times I scratched it with the needle.  The only tune of merit (IMO) is Sabbra Cadabra which should always be included on any Greatest Hits CD that they release.  The rest is just endless vamping....
B000002UR7|1.0|An album that is almost indescribably horrible. I couldn't believe how bad this was after hearing their RH's other albums. The difference between Pablo Honey and Amnesiac is the difference between night and day. I mean, this album is really, quite bad. It's tuneless, uninspired tripe; possibly the worst debut album in history from a band that would later become great. Don't buy it.
0790731479|1.0|I am continually amazed at the shoddy treatment that some movies get in their DVD release.  This DVD is simply a disgrace, especially considering what a great movie this is.  I give the movie itself 5 stars; it's a wonderful example of Tim Burton's energy and style.<br />This DVD has no extras worth mentioning.  No deleted scenes, no featurettes, not even a lousy commentary track!  To make it even worse, the film has been CUT DOWN from the theatrical release!  I have never seen a DVD release before where you get LESS than was originally presented in theaters.<br />My advice is to save your money until somebody figures out that when a movie is released on DVD, it needs to live up to the capabilities of the medium, and should always provide more material than was originally released, not less.
B00000JCOV|1.0|How the heck do you produce the record of a band with nine members without having it sound like a big cluttered mess?  You can't, and that's exactly what this album is.  Yes I do admit it must be pretty great to see this band live, few can match Slipknot intensity wise but the songs are just noise, there's too much instrumentation and it sounds terrible.  The only good track here is Purity, the rest is just unlistenable.  I'm a metal fan and I do know the difference between this and Limp Bizkit, and yes this is real but it sounds like the band just decides to play heavy stuff for the heck of it meaning this is just stupid tasteless track after stupid tasteless track.  If you want something that'll get your head banging and that has some diversity go get some Slayer, leave this one on the shelves.
0671027573|5.0|Linda Howard's back to her old self!  Yea!  She's finally written a new AND good book again.  I haven't liked her new stuff or 80's re-hashes since Dream Man (1995?).<br />The main character in this book is a strong, fiesty woman who gives as good as she gets, and the leading man is fantasy-tough, but just enough of a jerk to be believable w/o making you wonder what she sees in him.  It's more like Howard lets you see a real person, not a fairytale glossed over prince.<br />The storyline is covered elsewhere, so I'll just say that she makes the characters believable and you start to care about them. <br />Also, I thought I had the ending figured out, but it twisted just a bit, which was nice.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Jimi Hendrix was a true pioneer of Rock and Roll. His amazing talent and his quest for new sounds leave an impression to all who hear his music and this is 30 years after his passing...<br />Jimi was the ultimate pioneer in Rock and Roll, never satisfied of his past accomplishments, he wanted to find new ways of expressing his ideas through music, be it blues-fusion-funk-soul or good ol Rock and Roll, he was one of the rare ones who could combine them all into a unique sound for all to enjoy...His sad passing at the young age of 27 left a void in Rock and Roll that is still felt today...If he would of lived what kind of new sounds could he have made? But we will never know...We are left to enjoy the music and sound of his unforgettable voice and guitar...<br />This is a fantastic selection of his greatest hits. From &quot;Purple Haze&quot; to &quot;The Wind Crys Mary&quot; to &quot;Fire&quot; to his awesome playing of &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;, this is a CD that fans of Jimi Hendrix will enjoy and those who rarely heard his music but want to hear more will definitely want to get this CD.<br />I highly recommend this CD to all Jimi Hendrix admirers and fans of good Rock and unique sound!
6304469519|1.0|If you want a good Aida video, get The Met version with Domingo and Millo, Zajick, Milnes and a fantastic production from begininng to end.  This La Scala version is almost funny it's so bad.  The singers just stand like statues staring at the conductor - not even an attempt to act the roles or relate to each other.  The sets are comical and the costumes off someone's old rack.  Unless you are a real fan of the cast members (Pav is in good voice doing his concert schitchk, arms outstreched, eyes closed &amp; the usual &quot;don't you just love me grin&quot; on his face;  Dimitrova stiffly swoops and screams her way through, eyes glued to the conductor; Chiara has poses and so-so voice with -0- emotion). Too bad The Met isn't available on DVD.  I have tape and LD.  Even on tape, it's better than this version.  Boring is the word for this performance.  Verdi would not approve!! PASS ON IT!
B000002HRE|4.0|I'd give this album 4 stars, but in order to do that, I'd have to give Load 5, and it's not deserving of that. First off, if you're a fan of old Metallica--Master of Puppits, Ride the Lightning--you won't enjoy this CD. If you liked Load, you'll find this satisfying enough, but not as good. Some of the better tracks on the album are Fuel, Unforgiven II--though the Unforgiven, which can be found on the Black Album, is much better--and Attitude. I enjoy several others, but there are also a few songs that I listen to, but don't enjoy all too much. <br />I also noticed that ReLoad is more or less a copy of Load. First, the name is almost identical, which is obvious, but the pattern of songs are similar as well. For instance, Load ends with Outlaw Torn, a slow, long song, and ReLoad ends with Fixxxer, also a slow, rather long song. (Outlaw the better of the two by far.) So overall, if you thought Load was a good CD--like I did--you will like ReLoad guaranteed, but probably not as much. But I'm warning you...if you thought Load was the end of Metallica--why people would think that, I have no idea--this CD is a waste of your money, and I hope you spend it elsewhere instead of purchasing this only to come here and bash it.<br />And, please, don't try to tell me that Metallica only changed its style because they were too old to rock anymore. If that's what you think, listen to S&amp;M and realize they're just as good, maybe better, than before!! Hope this helped.
0060278234|5.0|This is one of the best fantasy books that I have read. It is gripping and you feel as if you are actually there experiencing whats happenning. I would definitedly recommend this book for young adults and for those who truly appreciate a fantasy novel which you just can't put down!!
0789723107|3.0|<BR>If you are looking for an accessible introduction to the topic of web usability, Steve Krug&#8217;s straightforward, humorous approach will fit the bill. Don&#8217;t Make Me Think! is a lively overview of usability principles for the WWW, filled with clear illustrations and real-world examples from familiar e-commerce sites such as Amazon, Gap.com and Quicken.com. At less than 200 pages, this book is a quick read written in a direct, approachable conversational style rather than in dry academic terms or complicated technical jargon.  Despite its brevity and breezy style, Krug manages to cram it full of critical insights into the psychology of Web users. However, in my opinion he does his readers a disservice by downplaying the importance of user characteristics, especially with regard to usability testing. <br />While I agree with Krug&#8217;s assertion that users of mass market e-commerce sites will vary widely in their likes, dislikes, motivations and preferred navigation styles, this does not negate the need for careful selection of usability test participants.  Krug suggests \\"grabbing some people\\" at random for testing, but this approach may backfire if the participants do not share the navigation style or goals of the critical user bases for the site under development. While his suggested approach to testing and recruitment may be cost effective for testing navigation structure or familiar transactions such as a shopping cart application and is certainly better than performing no testing at all, it may have expensive consequences for the design of complex, high risk web applications &#8211; especially within the environment of a corporate intranet. <br />Here&#8217;s an example: let&#8217;s say you were designing a web based application for a high-use call center that required users to look up complex information while speaking to your customers on the phone.  Your call center is located in the Midwest, but your developers work in your corporate headquarters in Northern California. Since the developers have no call center experience, and little understanding of the relative importance of various parts of the application, and since they consider the Midwest call center personnel to be relatively unskilled computer users, they decide to create an easy to learn mouse-driven interface requiring several clicks to move between screens.  Using Krug&#8217;s approach to usability testing, the developers go down the hall and recruit a few web-savvy colleagues to &#8220;test&#8221; the interface.  Sure enough, the designers and developers participating in the test are able to complete particular tasks, and the usability test is declared successful.  But when the application is launched, the call center experiences a slowdown in workflow because critical screens are difficult to reach, and the increased reliance on using a mouse for navigation results in an increase in repetitive stress injuries. Both issues result in increased costs to your company, and furthermore, your customer satisfaction ratings plummet as a result of the slowdowns in the phone queue!<br />When participants in a usability test are not representative of the end users of a web driven application, important aspects of its usability, such as the context and frequency of use, are likely to be overlooked. Additionally, the view of the users held by the developers of a system may be flawed, and those misperceptions can have disastrous results for the usability of your web site.  Despite Krug&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t matter who you test&#8221;, our experience has shown that including representative users in the testing of high impact, high cost web applications provides an important reality check in the development process. <br />Despite these shortcomings, the readability of Don&#8217;t Make Me Think! makes it a valuable book, especially for those new to the idea of designing usable web sites or who need convincing that usability testing is an important part of the design process.  If you are having difficulty getting the decision makers or developers in your organization to understand why usability is important, I recommend giving them a copy of this book and suggesting they read it on their next plane trip....
0060392886|3.0|Ok, Motley is not the greatest rock and roll band--they had a few good songs, but most will agree that the catalog is a bit thin, if not weak.  The book is very good--yes Nikki is arrogant and Tommy is the quintessential dude, but overall, a very entertaining, explicit, raunchy fun fest.  I don't think the editor did a damn thing really--everyone seems to say whatever the hell they want, and I even saw at least one mispelling.  Not a great book---but a good one--not a great band, but a good one.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I rented this flick thinking that it was good, and found that I and my husband were so happy with it, that I bought the DVD.   George Clooney and John Turturro were good, but Tim Blake Nelson made the movie.  I think most people who like this country type movie will like it.  I enjoyed the music very much.  Just watch it.
B00004XONN|5.0|Did anyone really think that a band like Radiohead would follow up the phenomenally successful OK Computer with more of the same?  Of course not.  In the same respect, KID A is not as &quot;out there&quot; as many reviews may have you believe.  This is a strong, bold and ultimately accessible piece of work that should not be overshadowed by the band's previous, commercially successful collection.  From the opening &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; to the moody closer &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot; this disc plays out a much smaller drama than that of OK Computer and the result is a more cohesive, intimate record.  After only a few listens you will wonder why so many critics overemphasized the &quot;experimental&quot; aspects of KID A rather than simply applauding its great vocals and songwriting.
B00004W52U|5.0|Pure and simple, Operation Ivy is possibly the best of the modern punk bands.  This CD is the best representation of them you'll find (and possibly the only one for that matter).  EVERYONE should own this album.  This one is lookout! records' best seller for a reason.  I read a review saying its a good album for Posers to have to show off, but then I followed up and found out that the guy loved &quot;Tank girl&quot; and &quot;the soundtrack to 2gether&quot; so you can rest assures he has no idea what he's talking about.  If you like rock, punk, ska, hardcore, or even old-school rap this album is a must have.
0425170349|3.0|OK, we all know how verbose Mr. Tom Clancy can be, let's not talk about it anymore. Rainbow six is fun to read, and you should read it if you've come this far, since Hunt for Read October, passing through Cardinal of the Kremlin, Executive Orders, etc etc. OK, this book is interesting, though the premise is a little bit ethereous. If I was John Brightling (he's one of the central characters), had all of his money, I would try to do something nicer to the world, instead of... oh, but let's not spoil things for the eventual reader. The plot(s) is (are) good(s), even though I've seen Clancy do better: it's his usual stuff, but, as Austin Powers would say, he lost some of his MOJO. But the ending... I can Imagine this conversation between Clancy and his editor: TC \\"Look, editor I'm in the middle of the book, and see how MANY pages I managed to write this far! \\" ED \\"Mr. C., are you nuts? Can't you see your usual reader can't stand books two thousand pages long anymore, and the infinite plots that don't have ending... I think you should finish it as it is.\\" TC \\"OK, I'll do that.\\" And the book is over, with an almost comic ending, that should be taken by Roberto Benigni as a start line for a new comedy.<br />Grade 6.0/10
B000022TSF|4.0|I've never seen this movie before this year (2001) and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. After I saw it made the AFI Top 100 Films I thought I'd watch it. I'm sure glad I did. The story follows the typical gumshoe format - loner private eye with a mysterious past, a damsel in distress that's also on the dangerous side, plot twists, mysterious secondary characters and an ultimate goal. This time it's not money, gold or a bird statue - it's water and land. Set in LA in the '30s, its style and writing give you a great understanding of what life was like back then (the other film that I can think of that does the same is LA Confidential). Jack Nicholson as J.J. Gittes delivers a great performance. I'm not much of a Nicholson fan - especially in his latter years. But I was truly impressed by his performance in this movie. We see the movie from his vantage point so he is always on the screen. We learn details about the case as he learns them. Polanski's directing style really draws you into the plot - you are there with Jake, experiencing everything he experiences. It's truly a great directing job. Some may not like the ending but I found it very refreshing and poignant. I wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way.
B000000WHC|4.0|I got turned on to this disc at a party, where it was playing at a barely audible background level.  Almost without realizing it, I was checking out the guitar work, thinking &quot;Jesus, who IS this?&quot;.  Needless to say, I coaxed our host into jacking the volume up a little, and bought the CD soon after.  This is a very solid effort from Gary Moore - he takes a nice respectful approach to the blues masters while paying homage to the music he cut his teeth on.  There isn't a bad track here - even the couple throwaway rockers are upbeat and catchy enough to be entertaining.  However, the slower, more mournful numbers really stand out, with Still Got the Blues and As the Years Go Passing By as my favorites.  Moore is a muscular guitarist with good tone and style.  I docked this one star because it feels to me, as good as this record is, like he's &quot;just visiting&quot;, which keeps it from the ranks of the classics.  Much of his other work centers around grinding heavy metal sludge, which strikes me as his true comfort zone.  Still, all things considered, this is an excellent album I'd recommend highly to blues and rock fans alike.
0780628551|5.0|Despite all of the bad reviews this movie has seen, it IS an excellent film.  The acting is very well-done (by ALL cast members).  Every actor took on the role in their own realistic way.  This movie is far from perfect, but the only real downside is that it's a relatively slow-moving film.  However, it's very realistic non-the-less.
0679405631|3.0|You have 50 reviews for this book (the woman in white) which total 4 1/2 stars out of 5 - enough to really pique my curiosity.  But I quickly realized most of the reviews seem to be for other books (there's one for a Steven King book for example).  I was really interested in buying this book until I realized that most of the reviews are for other books.
0226264017|5.0|Arguably the greatest economist of the 20th century makes complex concepts readily understandable.  Easy to read, yet not &quot;light reading,&quot; Friedman's book makes the basics of Political Economy understandable for even the novice.<br />Whether your interest is liberty, economics, or politics, this book is a must read.  <br />I always enjoy watching a debate between someone who has read this book (or one of his others) with people who have not.  Absolute slaughter...<br />Most highly recommended.
B00003CX8J|4.0|It was a lot better than I thought it would be and has definitely raised the bar for all other Marvel movies to come,in every aspect of film making. Sure it was different in someways than the book, but it could stand alone from them and more importantly it was good.  As much as I liked the cheesy 70's and 80's Marvel movies(like Dr. Strange starring Peter Wooten in the title roll, thank you very much), Marvel movies to come will have to measure up to this one. And that's a good thing because sometimes Marvel doesn't place as much emphasis on story telling quality as it does on marketing. But they made one stupendous,unforgivable error. They left out Hank McCoy,aka The Beast! Woe betide them! I'm looking forward to a sequal, and I'll really enjoy it more if it contains the only X-Man who can fight crime in his swim trunks,differentiate between Keats &amp; Yeats,type his doctoral thesis with his toes, the thinking man's Tarzan...........The Bombastic BEAST!!!
B000002N2Z|5.0|As of such, I've bought the first two Deftones cds, and I must say this one is the best of them.  Incredible.  Starting with bored, continuing on its way through great songs such as Engine no. 9, its a great romp through metal goodness.  Buy it now.
B000002N3N|5.0|I have several of the enya cd's and have never been disappointed by any selection of hers.  When I am having trouble sleeping or uptight because of a really tough day, all I have to do is slip one of these cd's in and just relax...she takes over from there. I recently bought this selection for my boyfriend (whom I got hooked on enya's music) and listened as he played it...I will now purchase one for myself...as always, never disappointed...
0553106635|5.0|There is something absolutely refreshing in a series that does not guarantee that the author has a favorite character or group of characters that is indestructible. Martin punishes his characters realistically, making it difficult to know who is next to suffer their fate. This not knowing brings about a kind of suspenceful waiting that leaves you on the edge of your seat and walking the literary high-wire without a net. Just when you think you know who is going to be the ultimate protagonist, amazing and tragic circumstances explode with the force of a bullet.<br />This is a masterfully done piece of work that is undeniably the best fantasy read I've had in a long, long time.<br />-Edrondol
B000002IZM|5.0|After years of waiting, this gem finally resides in my collection, excellent in every way including the blending of dialog from the film, very cool. The dvd is also a must have.
0440234743|2.0|I have been a Grisham fan for years, I loved all of his &quot;early&quot; books, but over the last few years he has become predictable and formulaic, writing only what will sell. The Testament fell right into those lines, making it extremely obvious that Grisham needs to take a little time off and try to figure out exactly what he wants as a writer, and stop writing for the money. The Testament is, so far, the worst of his books. It was overly predictable, boring in some parts, annoying in others, and the ending left me feeling like I never wanted to read another Grisham book again. Lets just hope that his success with a Painted House has given him a little time to rethink the way he has been writing the rest of his novels.
B000001F5A|5.0|This an excellent soundtrack from start to finish. I saw the film once and while it didn't make it into my video collection, this soundtrack did. This is a must-have for the serious Vangelis fan. One of his best works.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Steven Soderbergh loves flash, and people seem to love him. From sex,lies and videotape on, he has commanded grwing respect. After having been mesmerized by the brilliant BBC series TRAFFIK, I was waiting to be dazzled. Sigh. Besides a blistering performance by Benicio Del Toro, this is lame,overwrought and hyerventalating cinema. The story surrounds interconnecting stories around drugs, from the newly appointed National drug czar{an unbelievably torpid Michael Douglas} to a drug king, and his wife{Catherine Zeta-JOnes is a typically wooden performance},the child of the drug czar, two cops, a Mexican cop{Del Toro}andd...the plot laid out over 6 hours on the bbc makes sense, in little over 2 hours it is frenzied and absurd. Douglas searching the &quot;inner&quot; city to find his strung out daughter,and not calling in any law enforcement folks he knows for favors is assinine, and simply not how these guys function. The supposed &quot;harrowing &quot;drug scenes are laughably bad{especially if you have witnessed the real thing}, Dennis quaid makes an appeARANCE as a shady lawyer, and grins his way through this embarrasment.Benjamin Bratt makes a truly ludicrous appearance as the mexican drug connection, with an accent he must have picked up from old Bill Dana routines. The best work is done by three standout actors: Don Cheadle, Luis Guzman and Benicio Del Toro. These three excellent actors hold this movie up. It works very vell when they are on screen, and becomes insipid when they are not. The ending, strangely is quite good and touching in such a light manner that it redeemed the movie for me. So , alltold, extraordinary work by Del Toro, excellent work from the always superb Cheadle and Guzman, weak, by douglas, laughably bad by Zeta-Jones. Watch the BBc series TRAFFIK, and you'll see.
0385495323|5.0|The author has a talent of making history interesting.  Not only was I thoroughly enthralled by the evolution of the subject, but the historical background that accompanied each change interested me.  This is a first rate book, you'll learn a lot as I did.
B000002UEB|5.0|Queensryche's concept record &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; is argueably one of the best recordings I have ever heard.The storyline consists of plotting political assassinations and underground revolutions.Even though this storyline and characters are fictional, there is still much in the lyrical content that probably speaks more truth today than some may think.For example, take the song &quot;Revolution Calling&quot;. Tate sings about the rich controling everything from TV and the media to politics, while the poor stay poor and the rich making more and more money than they can shake a stick at.Keep in mind the setting for this story is during the Reagan-era.One of the best lines from &quot;Revolution Calling&quot; has to be where Geoff Tate sings....'I use to think that only America's way, way was right. But now the holy dollar rules everybody's lives, gotta make a million, doesn't matter who dies'.....and the line, 'who do you trust when everyone's a crook?' could even apply in today's cut throat world.&quot;Spreading The Disease&quot; is another notable with very strong lyrical content. This song pretty much deals with how society turns the other cheek when bad things are happening, rather than standing up and doing something about it.In this song, Tate sings of priest taking in a prostitute off the streets and making her into a nun....only to use her for his own 'pleasure' in return for having so called saving her life from the streets.One line in that song that could be considered controversial is where Tate sings.....'religion and sex are powerplays, manipulate the people for the money they pay. Selling skin, selling God, the numbers look the same on their credit cards. Politicians say no to drugs while we pay for wars in South America. Fighting fire with empty words, while the banks get fat and the poor stay poor, and the rich get rich and the cops get paid to look away.'One of the more haunting songs ever written has to be &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;. Toreally get the effect of that song you will have to take a listen for yourself. You won't be disappointed.Along with the more well-known songs on this disc - &quot;Eyes of a Stranger&quot; and &quot;I Don't Believe In Love&quot;....&quot;Operation:Mindcrime&quot; is definitely one of the best concept albums ever recorded and anyone who enjoys listening to thought-provoking lyrics and epic sounding music....this CD is one you will want to add to your cd collection.
B00005B4GU|5.0|I am a huge fan of good old fashion rock (Black Sabbath, Zeppelin, AC/DC), quality techno (Auctechre, Aphex Twin) and excellent lyrics (Joy Division, Nirvana).  This album takes the best from all three and crams them together into a 40 odd minute masterpiece.  Highly reccomended.
B00005EBPC|5.0|Dark Tranquility is where US metal should have evolved to, but didn't. Right about the time of ...And Justice For All, metal seemed to be going in the right direction, which is exactly where Dark Tranquility took off from. If you want to hear a true experience in exquisite riffs and well placed guitar rythms, then this is the album to buy.
B0000509BZ|5.0|Okay, a few years ago a boyfriend of mine and I watched the Highlander on video.  Then after I got married my husband and I watched all three of them back to back to back.  (here's a hint, don't bother watching #2, it stinks and has very little to do with the others)  Anyway, I was shocked that my FAVORITE SCENE wasn't in the movie that my husband and I rented.  <br />You see I'm kind of an anal person and I need to know all the back ground on things.  (Kind of like watching &quot;Planet of the Apes IV, V and VI).  Anyway, in the Non-Directors cut you don't know why he is so attached to his secretary.  In the Directors cut you find out that He rescued her from the Nazis in WWII and raised her like a daughter.    Anyway, I am getting the Directors cut exclusively for this scene.  Until one of my husbands friends at work told him that he has the directors cut and that scene was there, my husband thought that I dreamed it.
B000000W5F|4.0|With the exception of, perhaps, WHEN THE WHIP COMES DOWN, post '72 Stones' rockers suck. There's really no other word for it. Voodoo Lounge's GOT ME ROCKIN' is the best of a very bad bunch. Their ballads, however, remain strong, and the second side of Tattoo You is evidence of this. WORRIED ABOUT YOU thru WAITING ON A FRIEND is about as good as the Stones get with Ron Wood. And its pretty damn good, really. The lazy guitars and sophisticated lyrics create a nice mood.<br />BTW- the lyric in HANG FIRE is &quot;marryin' money is a full time job/ I don't need the aggravation I'm a lazy slob&quot;, not &quot;earnin' money etc...&quot; as a review below stated. The song's lousy overall, forced and derivative like the rest of the late rockers, but that line's pretty funny...
B00005JK93|5.0|&quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot; meets &quot;(insert name of your favorite Backstage Drama here)&quot; in this instant cult classic. The secret to &quot;Hedwig&quot;'s success is that it doesn't hit you over the head with the &quot;sexual ambiguity&quot; theme (after 25 years of &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; and several generations of Glamrock revivals, I think we &quot;get it&quot; by now, wam bam, thank you m'am.) Once the main character's androgynous &quot;issues&quot; are established, you can sit back and enjoy a surprisingly traditional show-biz tale with just the right mixture of pathos, bathos and clever one-liners. Best of all, (one or two interminable Jim Steinman-style power ballads aside) someone has finally nailed the MUSIC...most of the songs sound like they were indeed composed by Mssrs. Pop, Bowie, Reed or Bolan and would hold up alongside the original artists' work. (I was noting the rich, Marshall-amped Ronsonesque power chord sound throughout and was surprised to see none other than Bob Mould pop up in the musician's credits at the end!) A breezy 90 minutes for rock musical fans and especially entertaining for 70's rock enthusiasts.
B000002TP7|4.0|Most everyone has heard Sabotage and for me thats reason enough to pick this cd up. But, as always with the Beastie Boys, there are many other songs that give this album merit.  One of my favorites is root down.  Very cool.
0486266885|5.0|&quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; is fantastic book that is subtly chilling and a classic mystery/horror novel. That being said, Dover Thrift Editions is a real bargain at less than a dollar. Unlike other editions that group this novel into a book with the author's other stories, Dover just gives you the novel, unabridged and raw. No introductions, criticsm, footnotes, etc. So if all you want is the novel save a lot of paper and money and buy this wonderful book in Dover Thrift Edition.
B0000024JN|5.0|This cd is classic Beastie Boys.  Whether your a fan of their music or not I would recommend this to you.  It has some great beats and you will listen to it over and over, 'nuff said.
B00003CXFG|3.0|I think this is what you get if you mix together the Blair Witch Project and Galaxy Quest. Take a mediocre and predictable sci-fi story, throw in a group of actors that seem to have been instructed to act as badly as is feasibly possible, and then throw in one actor (Vin Diesel) who somehow is able to go counterclockwise and turn in a powerful performance. Mix this all together and the result is something unique, different, and downright weird. There were times where I thought I had my DVD in wrong and that the real movie was on the other side. This unusual mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly winds up with about a 3 out of 5 in my book.
0446677450|4.0|This book really opened my eyes. There's nothing really new here, I'm sure, but no one else has ever told me these things! I was one of the financial illiterates this book was written for. This has really altered my thoughts on what you need to do to build true wealth, and I will be taking action on its suggestions. If I get nothing more out of it than working to get as much of my income in pre-tax dollars and living off what my initial income earns rather than the income itself, this book will have paid for itself hundreds, maybe even thousands of times what I paid for it. Regardless of anything else that may be wrong with the author or some of his specific principles, as many have suggested, this book is highly valuable for teaching these basic lessons.  I will also be buying the other books and products by this author. I marked it down from a 5-star rating because it's sometimes a bit simplistic and repetitive.
B000000OQF|5.0|From start to finish this CD takes you on a rollercoaster ride through the lives of five white trash kids new to LA. Thunderous riffs and searching vocals make this an all time great album in any genre.  Showing that they can rock with the best of them, GnR also display a tender side with the classic Sweet Child O Mine, while Welcome to the Jungle is as good as it gets for an opening song.  Once heard allways hooked, this is powerful stuff.
B00005LQ6Z|5.0|Though it may not portray all gay lives, it does come about with an aspect of &quot;i dont care what you think&quot; and lets it all hang out (Sometimes even literally). It's a great drama and still humourous enough to wet your pants, or atleast cream in them! Though i disagree with it's blunt views on safe-sex and the large amount of drug and alcohol abuse, it barely scratches the story itself. Very worth the buy and I would highly recommend it as a gift for and questioning teen or out-and-proud gay. These Britons sure do lay it on. Hope the Series 2 DVD (which is, by the way out already) comes out in Amazon soon!
B00004WKII|5.0|It's near unfathomable how this much superb material has languished in the vaults for thirty years, but prepare to be blown away by this exceptional box set of the Experience.More than just another trip down memory lane,this collection is made up entirely of never before heard outtakes, remixes and banter. Afew cuts were culled from an album called Loose Ends that a lot of folks bought years ago.One track is from a live recording of a concert at Clark University in Worcester I attended.It sounds MUCH better here. The remainder are all either outtakes,alternate mixes or live.The material extends from the earliest Experience, the Chas Chandler phase (Chas was the bassist for the Animals who &quot;discovered&quot; Jimi when he was playing in New York as Jimmy James,becoming producer/guru), right up through Rainbow Bridge.Chandler left his mark indelibly, and contributed arduously to the sound of the first couple of albums, and the first disc is filled with this material..Engineer Gary Kelgren and producer EddieKramer reprise their respective roles for most tracks.  Longtime fans will marvel at how many words they remember wrong, and marvel at the stuff with different lyrics entirely. Often Hendrix the poet is overlooked because his playing was so riveting. But poet he was, and no slouch as a tunesmith either.And his humor was often side-splitting. Though most of this stuff never made it to vinyl, the sound is better than the ultimately released albums ever sounded.  The enclosed booklet is a knockout with almost eighty pages of essays, track information and gorgeous, never-before-seen photos.And for a four CD box, it's priced to move. In short, it's without flaw.  Jimi is the man. Nobody has ever come close. Nope,not Stevie Ray, Vai or Eddie Van H. Jimi's most mundane surpasses everything going on today.His special recipe of voodoo blues,jazzy improvisation, and psychedelic mayhem is even more striking today. And it's nigh impossible to imagine it ever being surpassed. Lord knows, many have tried.ng surpassed. Lord knows, many have tried.
0375703764|1.0|To the reader who looks at this book and thinks it is intriguing, they are right. However, when one delves a bit deeper into this book they find it is nothing but hogwash. This book makes fine kindling for fires, I must say. I opened this book to find nothing but psychobabble. A jumble of random pages strewn together to form a story. The pages vary from vast, typewritten monologues to blank pages with the word &quot;the&quot; to fill the space. There are pages with just dots and lines, some form of modern art perhaps. One page even has a random musical staff on it with notes. On the pages that are filled with words, some are upside down, some are crossed out, some paragraphs are boxed by blue squares. At the bottom of the pages is random, seemingly fabricated sources for the information. The book is not a novel, but rather a bunch of scrapped together stories to form a whole. It is rather pretentious and confusing. I felt stupid while reading it when I found a bibliography with psychiatric journals in the middle and then at the end when the index indexes every word ever used in the book, from &quot;bat&quot; to &quot;hair&quot; and beyond. Do yourself a favor and skip this book. Read some good literature, like Kerouac or Kesey or Burgess or Joyce. A bookseller I was talking with dismissed this book as B.S. and he was right. Stay out out of the &quot;House of Leaves&quot;!
0380973650|5.0|There are only a handful of authors that consistently push the boundary of &quot;imaginative&quot; fiction, that every time I hear of the emergence of a &quot;truly new talent&quot; I'm really skeptical. Neil Gaiman, however, has completely won me over, and American Gods was a real eye opener in many ways.<br />It's the story of a completely rootless, and emotionally impoverished &quot;regular guy,&quot; freshly paroled from prison only to discover that the life he's longed for in the joint has been totally annihilated with the unexpected death of his wife. At loose ends, he meets a mysterious, burly traveler who offers him a job on the spot, which Shadow (our hero) declines. As Shadow discovers not only that his wife is dead, but was killed during a sexual liason with his best friend and former employer, the tiny flame of emotion, so carefully guarded and cared for in prison, is snuffed out. The mystery employer, introducing himself as Mr. Wednesday, reappears to press his case once again, and this time Shadow takes him up on it.<br />Shadow is brought into a weird, orbiting subculture of seemingly everyday people, living on the fringes of American life. Each seems oddly familiar to him - as they will seem to you. And slowly, Shadow begins to realize the scale and scope of what he has become involved in - an impending battle between the scattered, ancient gods of immigrants and slaves, and the emerging gods of the American cultural and technological revolution.<br />For me, simply the amount of creativity put into the plot makes this a terrific read; but add to that Gaiman's craft of description and narrative - very stylish and stark - that combination makes American Gods a real treat. Ordinarily, I might observe that a hero with only a hole for a heart is hard to identify with, but Shadow isn't really heartless, you discover as the story progresses, and Gaiman does a great job of slowly bringing the reader along for the ride, with a boatload of creative plotwork along the way.<br />Neil Gaiman has placed himself outside of the current state of fantasy or horror - forgoing Clive Barker's tendency for cheap thrills, and Stephen King's dense description for a more economical style that describes in shadows and light, with occasional vivid color. American Gods is a well-crafted and imaginative trip behind the scenes in a land whose gods are as vulnerable as the people themselves.long the way.<br />Neil Gaiman has placed himself outside of the current state of fantasy or horror - forgoing Clive Barker's tendency for cheap thrills, and Stephen King's dense description for a more economical style that describes in shadows and light, with occasional vivid color.

B000002NFM|3.0|I am a big Prodigy fan. I love their first two albums, &quot;Experience&quot; and &quot;Music For The Jilted Generation,&quot; but this album is their worst. It is block-rockin', you got that right, but it is missing substance and some tracks are too hip-hopy for me (&quot;Diesel Power,&quot; etc.). I suggest if you are a new Prodigy fan to go with &quot;Music For The Jilted Generation,&quot; as it is the best.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Requiem for a Dream was a fantastic movie possibly the best I've seen in all of 2000/2001 and I have seen a lot of movies in that time.<br />The story follows 4 drug addicts. Although the movies isn't really about drugs, its more about thier depletion of hope. The movie is faced paced with amazing cinematography which makes you feel that your on a trip yourself. <br />The movie is definatly not for the weak at heart, its disturbing and has a lot of gore in the last 10 minutes. The ending is definatly depressing, I saw this about 4 days ago and I'm still disturbed by it. <br />Requiem For A Dream is a great movie and should definatly be shown in classrooms to show students what drug addiction can do.
B00000J8EK|3.0|i know everybody is telling me that this album is da bomb, and that is is supposed to not have those block-rockin beats that made \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" a masterpiece. But, I can't get over it! I need my block rockin beats! this album falls short in a couple manners. It won't fuel your fire but it may dose you off to a strange dimension, and if that's what you want, go ahead and buy it.
0671004107|5.0|This book is about the human race's first contact with extra terrestrials, in the form of a radio waves from space.  If you have seen the movie, let it be known:  it simply does not do the book justice.  The book is above and beyond the movie in almost every way, although the movie itself wasn't too shabby.  The story provokes a lot of thinking in the reader by making them wonder what would happen if something like this occurred, and by also having conflict between the characters and between their religious views.  If you are at all interested in science fiction or SETI, then I suggest you read this book!
0312954468|2.0|I was disappointed in this novel; I found it full of stock villains and too-perfect protagonists. Too many things happen at &quot;just the precise moment&quot; for them to be anywhere near believable. Too schlocky for my tastes.
B00005MAM2|5.0|I started watching the movie with no idea what to expect, all I knew was that the movie was supposed to be awesome.  From the cool bike scenes to the strange ending, I was so enamoured in the movie that I sat without moving for the entire two hours.  When it was over I could barely contain the feeling of ectasy released during the movie.  For the entire night I sat continually repeating how great I thought the movie was.  The animation was absolutely spectactular and the plot line was totally incredible.  Buy this movie today, even if you have no idea what you are getting into, this is a movie that you will never regret spending the time or money to get.  Recommended for all anime and sci-fi fans, and those who love epics of biblical proportions.
B00000K0DT|2.0|I rented this a couple years ago to think it was usually boring. I recently noticed it to be very popular among critics and fans, so I became a fan and saw it at the store ... The movie starts off annoying and slow and stays that way throughtout every now and then putting in not-boring parts to seemingly keep you from leaving the theater. When the end came it was a little cool but I was disappointed, because I felt that was the best and only good part. I really have to know how movies like this and The Godfather and Schindlers List got to be so loved by critics and movie fans. How did they????
B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is an incredible Anime from arguably Japan's finest animator. The story line is rich with imagination and beautifully portrays the complexity of the human spirit. The illustration of landscapes and vistas as well as the action, is of course, equally engaging. The English track features recognized American actors and grand orchestration, although certain phrases may seemed rushed, this is definitley not a reason to avoid this movie. Calling this 'cartoon' an epic is certainly no understatement. I highly recommend this movie for both Anime fans and first timers.
0446677450|5.0|A few years ago I made a conscious decision to become an entrepreneur. My goal was to start my own business and to become a millionaire before I was thirty. \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" by Robert T. Kiyosaki was one of the missing pieces to the puzzle. When I read this book, and then later when I bought the audio book,I realized how much of becoming wealthy involves mental conditioning and perspective. This is a great book for any aspiring millionaire-to-be...
B00000FBRE|5.0|Lagwagon is one of those bands you either love or hate.  Many new-school fans love them since they seem to have the mixture of punk and melody down pat.  Then you have some old-schoolers, who mainly see Lagwagon as the biggest NOFX rip-off band ever, and that musically, they're stale.<br />Of course, the second view is utter BS.  This was by far Lagwagon's most poppy album yet.  Since it was produced by Mark Trombino, it has a compressed, polished sound.  The most startling change is most likely in Joey Cape's voice.  In every album before this one, Joey's had a great, but yet slightly dissonant voice.  He's 33 in this album, but he sounds 20.  Talk about processing.  Compare DP's &quot;Making Friends&quot; to LTAF's &quot;Gun In Your Hand&quot; and you'll see what I mean.<br />Now on to the album.  This album combines pretty much all of the good qualities from Lag's past albums - the speed of Duh, the riffs of Trashed, the perfect mix of pop and punk with Hoss, and the down-to-earth sound and songwriting style of Double Plaidinum.  It really is such a wonderful mix and makes you wonder how a typical pop-punk band got so freaking GOOD at what they do.<br />Lagwagon, from day one, always sounded a bit like NOFX with their sound.  But after Hoss and especially Double Plaidinum, they've really gotten their own unique sound.  Lagwagon's sound is less like the fast-paced NOFX-type punk rock of Trashed and Duh, and more like the pop-punk of Hoss.  Whereas Fat Mike goes for sarcastic, witty, often-joking lyrics, Joey Cape will, most of the time, sing about mostly-serious topics (which is why &quot;Hurry Up And Wait&quot; is such a cool little song).<br />The album clocks in at about 25 minutes, which is quite short compared to some of their past albums.  The thing is, there's so many great songs here it makes up for it.  Just about every song on this album is awesome.  The best songs are &quot;After You My Friend&quot;, &quot;Leave The Light On&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot;, &quot;May 16&quot; (of Tony Hawk 2 fame), and &quot;Owen Meaney&quot; (Cape stated that this is his favorite Lagwagon song).  So the verdict?  It's not the best Lagwagon album IMHO, but it's certainly damn close.
0671886231|3.0|This tape was quite an intersting story.  Although believeable, I found it difficult to grasp, she could remember word for word &amp; have such an &quot;exact&quot; recall.

B00005B36H|1.0|I really wanted to like Tool, after seeing some of their  videos, but this release just annoys me.  The notions &quot;blunt&quot;, &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;useless&quot; came to mind after hearing their prior releases.<br />This music is even more self-possessed than I ever thought  possible and should not be confused for &quot;personal&quot; albums which are actual, poetic recounts of bad and/or good times.<br />Too bad.  I was interested in seeing King Crimson during their short tour with Tool but paying Tool one red cent in order to  see a shortened Crimson set seemed obnoxious.<br />At least Robert Fripp has the good sense to actually deliver a lecture or just jam out, instead of doing what Tool does,  which is inflated, unhappy, and without the sensibilities of  such dour artists as The Smiths or whoever.<br />So the next time you meet a fan of Tool, count the number of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; versus &quot;us&quot; and &quot;we&quot;.  Or just read the reviews herein and you will see the truth, which is that Tool is not about &quot;we&quot;, it is about &quot;me.&quot;<br />Or just listen to &quot;Easy Money&quot; from Lark's Tongues in Aspic and enjoy the irony (or not).
0345350499|2.0|I have heard so many good things about this book, but I didn't like it as much as I thought I would. It disappointed me in providing a totally unsympathetic, bigoted view of Christianity. It is true that the early Roman Catholics were harsh and intolerant, but the principles of the Church always were full of insight, intelligence, beauty, truth, and love. This book largely contributes to the stereotype of Catholics as drab and unreasonably demanding. If modern people would just look past all of this, they would find a truly amazing faith.
0784011206|5.0|The latest DVD version of the classic Stallone action flick provides several supplemental features, the most notable being the outstanding commentary by David Morrell who wrote the novel the film is based on. More on that in a moment.<br /><br />First Blood is about a Vietnam vet named John Rambo who comes to a small Washington state town (actually British Columbia) to find the last surviving comrade from his elite Green Beret unit. When he discovers that he too is dead, Rambo makes his way into town for a bite to eat and instead winds up being arrested by the hick local sheriff (Brian Dennehy). While in custody, Rambo is abused by the locals but manages to escape sparking an all out manhunt.<br /><br />This film has 55 minutes of action out of 96 total highlighted by the jail escape and subsequent chase. Jack Starrett is great as the cop that does most of the abusing while Davis Caruso is fine as the only deputy (among the surprisingly large local force) that seems to have a conscience. Dennehy is good as always and makes a worthy opponent for Rambo. Richard Crenna is great as Rambo's former CO and he and Dennehy play off one another quite well. Even though he has limited speaking parts, this is probably one of Stallone's best performances highlighted by the \\"Vietnam speech\\" near the end of the film.<br /><br />The film is presented in digitally remastered widescreen 16:9, and is without a doubt the best video presentation of First Blood to date. The movie was shot in the temperate rain forest of BC and is quite dark at times. However, the darkest scenes have been enhanced here and are much improved over the various VHS versions some of which are terrible. Sound is Dolby 2.0 only but not bad considering. Also included are a cute trivia game (get all 10 right without a mistake to see a Rambo cartoon), production notes, and a teaser and trailer. The \\"featurette\\" is nothing more than a glorified trailer.<br /><br />Now on to the best feature of this DVD, one that is worth the price of admission all by itself. If you are at all interested in how films are made and the behind the scenes tidbits about Hollywood, then RUN do not walk (or let your fingers do the walking online) to your local video store and get this disc. Why? For the outstanding commentary of writer David Morrell. This talented man begins to speak before the opening credits and does not stop for 96 minutes. When he does you will wish he could have continued for 96 more. You will find yourself listening again and again and picking up something new each time. This is without a doubt far and away the best commentary on any DVD.<br /><br />Here is just a partial list of the things Morrell covers:<br /><br />1. The many differences between his novel and the film-very fascinating stuff.<br />2. His experience when seeing First Blood the very first time.<br />3. The three act structure of films.<br />4. How he chose the name Rambo and other character names.<br />5. How First Blood set a number of precedents for the industry.<br />6. Why films were kept to 90 minutes in length for so long a time.<br />7. A touching story about his son and Stallone.<br />8. The story of how Kirk Douglas was scheduled to play Troutman and why Richard Crenna ended up with the role.<br /><br />And that is only scratching the surface.<br /><br />In conclusion, First Blood was a precedent setting film featuring top-flight actors and some of the best believable screen action. The wonderful commentary of David Morrell caps off a great experience.<br /><br />NOTE***<br /><br />This review was first written in 2001. There are now several DVD versions of the film available.

B00005KJ1G|5.0|What a killer album.  When this first came out, I was inspired to pick up the bass guitar -  William's Tale.  Although I come from the same city as DeMaio, HIS playing is outstanding!  I have heard none better.  His writing is definitely that of a genius.  Heavy Metal Daze was always a great song. My favorite track is probably FAST TAKER.  I remember how little ManOwaR was accepted back then.  Look at them now!  At last they are understood as TRUE METAL GODS.  HAIL!
B000000WCA|5.0|This is what pop music is all about...fun up-tempo song and cute catchy ballads.  These girls brought pop music back to the front of music.  If you take the album for what it is...a great fun ride..you'll love it.
B000056K04|5.0|I'm a huge DMB fan, and when this album was first released I thought Glen Ballard was the devil incarnate for &quot;changing&quot; Dave and the boys. Yet after I listened to this album more closely, I realized that they haven't changed, it's just another step in DMB's evolution. Dave on the electric guitar is absolutely FABULOUS. It's just another twist and surprise that we've come to expect from DMB. The lyrics on this album are just as good, if not better than previous efforts, and you can really hear Dave taking his voice out for a spin. While Boyd's violin and Leroi's sax tend to blend more into the background of this album (while Stefan's bass comes forward more), if you've ever heard the music live, you'll know that they hardly take a backseat. I applaud DMB for having the courage to change and grow as musicians (this album wasn't ALL Glen Ballard's idea...watch the Charlie Rose special). I agree with the band who said, &quot;These are some of the best songs we've ever written.&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|What a great movie! It's unique and special, uncompromising in it's vision.  <br />Nicole Kidman is gorgeous!  I think she has become one of the great movie stars of this age.  She is mysterious, beautiful, talented and accessible.  <br />What Moulin Rouge offers is an on-the-edge experience, something daring that is completely missing from Planet of the Apes, Jurassic Park III or any other movie this summer.  You can't watch Moulin Rouge with expectations of something average.  It's cutting edge and daring, traits that are so lacking in big-time cinema.  Bravo to Baz Luhrmann for making this experience possible.
B000059WOD|5.0|As a 15-year-old metal fanatic I personally thought this was the best record I had ever listened to. First, the lyrics were so powerful that is knocks you right out of your seat. Second, the rhythm is so fast-moving that it makes you want to start a mosh pit. I rate this 5 stars for two great reasons. I hope you consider buying it for yourself.         Jay.
B000000WJK|5.0|I read one review which called this post-shoegazer.  Sounds extremely shoegazy to me.  Having my head flushed down a toilet when this was released, I'm a little unsure.  From all I can tell the undisputedly most revered shoegaze album is My Bloody Valentine's Loveless.  I like that album too, but this one really does it for me.<br />Maybe it's because I was weaned on Pink Floyd from a little tiny baby.  It recalls the post Syd Barrett period/pre Dark Side of the Moon period. (Which is in fact quite a long period)--Oh well, think &quot;Meddle.&quot;<br />One mood, tone and quality is maintained throughout the record.  Guitar music at its most atmospheric.  The melodies are fantastic, Richard Ashcroft's singing is evocative and moving.  It's just a shame they broke up after this, only to reform later as &quot;(The) Verve&quot; and put out a an album of radio music with their mainstream hit &quot;Urban Hymns.&quot;  The orch-pop &quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; was not bad I guess, but I didn't care for the rest of it.  Too bad the Stones, or their producer, had to sue these guys for musical plagiarism in that song.  (Somebody actually finally got caught?!)  Don't the Stones have enough money already?<br />Anyway, this one is a real keeper, not to be duplicated, sadly, but that's what makes it all the more valuable.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|&quot;The Beatles 1&quot; is yet another repackaged and rearranged collection of The Fab Fours singles to make more money no doubt. With &quot;The Beatles 1&quot; we get all their number one singles. While I know a lot of people discovered The Beatles' timeless music through this release, that is great and I am happy to witness this, but as an old fan I'm frustrated that I have to buy yet another collection of the same songs already released in other collections instead of buying new released material. How about a live album or an album of unreleased material? I also think this collection doesn't show the evolution of The Beatles. It skips &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; which was the album in which The Beatles matured and skips &quot;The White Album&quot; which shows The Beatles in their most creative effort. The biggest flaw of all, no &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot; Obviously this is a singles collection and not a handpick &quot;best of album&quot; but it simply doesn't show The Beatles best work. I think even new fans would be better suited with buying the two &quot;Past Masters&quot; albums for an introduction to The Beatles music. I gave it four stars(Five stars for the music) because of what I explained above. If you do buy this collection, buy The Beatles albums right away after you realize how brilliant they are because you are missing the REAL stuff.
B00001OH7V|5.0|I have to confess I didn't always appreciate this artist.  . . .  .<br />That all changed when I heard this album.  Here Bowie, Fripp and Eno team up to produce a record that is an absolute classic.  The record kicks off like a bat . . . .  Fripp ensures that \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" just flat-out kicks butt.  (I used to play this song so loud that I was [almost] near served eviction papers).  The rollicking good fun continues with \\"Joe The Lion.\\"  Then comes the famous dreamy Eno intro of the title song (yes, you too have heard it) which has been used to sell everything from flowers to computer systems.  Back in the days of vinyl the first side of this album was more spirited, the second side softened into Eno soundscapes, which you notice are never sugary.<br />This is the second album from what's known as \\"The Berlin Trilogy\\", when Bowie was living there . . . Whatever it was, clearly something inspired this brilliant album.  I love \\"Low\\" too, but \\"Heroes\\" always comes out on top.<br />I have since bought several other works by Bowie from several periods (or should I say personas) but I still find Low and Heroes far and away my hands-down faves.  I must be on to something, as modern legend minimalist classical composer Philip Glass put out two albums in the last few years celebrating \\"the music of David Bowie and Brian Eno\\": \\"Low Symphony\\" and \\"Heroes Symphony.\\"  Obviously I'm not the only one who feels this music bears repeating.<br />Nothing can corrupt us/nothing can compete/thank God Heaven left us/standing on our feet/My My, just Beauty and the Beast.....
B00003CWL6|3.0|There are many themes in American Beauty, but the primary one is of its motto, Look Closer.  Indeed by the end of the movie, nobody is as they first appeared, and it almost makes you think.  Almost, that is, because director Mendes decided to change so much of the beauty and satire in it to pure people appeal.  Breasts and sex are in abundance, and for no really good reason.  Mendes did this for the broadway musical Cabaret, which added to it, and made it one heck of a good time, but in American Beauty, it takes out how &quot;deep&quot; the movie is.  Indeed, American Beauty breaks all 10 commandments.  The acting is fairly good, with, as usual, a brilliant performance by Spacy, and certainly his scenes are the highlight of the movie, being witty, fun, and hillarious.  It's a film that almost makes you think, before you realize that it was a film designed to make people think its deep, when it really isn't.  It could have been great, the premises certainly are, but its often slow-moving, unrealistic, dumb, and sexed up for appeal.  Definetely should have been an art film.
B00004XONN|5.0|What can I say, these guys can do no wrong.  One would think after the critically acclaimed and popular OK Computer that they had nowhere to go but down.  But rather than resting on their laurels, or using the same formula to extend their glory, these guys turned their backs on all of it by releasing this, a complete departure.  <br />This is a complex and difficult work.  They employ various ideas to create different effects.  Traditional song structure is abandoned; guitars are used sparingly in favor of an overall electronic wash.  There are all sorts of things here--digitally-enhanced vocals, harp-like synths, and at one point what even sounds to me like a drum machine (could it really be true?)  But never mind that--these guys could put out a record of tuba and triangle music and still pull it off.<br />One of my more favorite parts of the disc is an avart garde sequence featuring what sounds like a distressed sax or trumpet.  One reviewer I read intimated that these guys were not innovators, but rip-off artists, citing the album Red by King Crimson.  Yes, it is most assuredly akin to the something very familiar from long ago.  Yet I felt the remarks unfair.<br />In a time when the classical french composer Erik Satie's most recognizable theme (from &quot;Gymnopedie&quot;) is shamelessly ripped-off and juxtaposed with totally incongruous counterthemes in Janet Jackson's latest hit, there's not much sacred these days--the robbery is blatant, and it seems the only artistry left is in the skill with which you hide it.  And to give credit where it's due, said reviewer was probably talking about the song &quot;Fallen Angel&quot; off the Red album.  And really folks, in all fairness, the main riff from Fallen Angel sounds very familiar, borrowed from the band who influenced (nearly) everybody:  The Beatles.  John Lennon's &quot;I Want You (She's so Heavy)&quot; sounds like a not-so-distant cousin.  Everyone borrows from everyone.  Get used to it.<br />Granted I am ajaded listener.  I buy current stuff, I really try.  I don't want to be like the older generation in the 50's who bitched that when Elvis came along their kids weren't listening to Glenn Miller (actually I like Glenn Miller too).  However so much I hear sounds like just more of the same old thing, rewritten.  This group is an exception and this album, with it's risky experimentation, makes for exciting, challenging listening.
B00005AFVR|5.0|This live album by the Boss and the E Street Band is fantastic.  Listening to the album brought back memories of seeing them live in Buffalo earlier in the tour where they rocked the arena.  The album consists of a new haunting rendition of The River and a new, controversial, and heart felt song America Skin.  The long rendition of Tenth Avenue Freezeout gets you pumped up and excited.  It is great hearing the band play together, they never missed a step for being apart for so many years.  Want to hear an album live that brings up issues of our society, this is the one.
B00004Z459|5.0|Now I'm not a big rock fan, but I have to say that Linkin Park's album is totally awesome. I love that album. I sat in the house for three days just listenin to Linkin Park. I have to say that &quot;Runaway&quot; is my favorite song on the album. &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;In the End&quot;, &quot;Papercut&quot;, and &quot;A Place for my head&quot; were some other good ones. All the other songs are worth listening to. Linkin Park is an awesome band and I hope they do another album.
6303389449|5.0|I actually liked this movie, on account that i am a horror movie freak. It was a good film about this street rat that fell in love with a princess and he tried to marry her but wasnt aloud and there was a mean guy that wanted to marry her. There was also a geni and he was funny and friendly, there was a onkey and a magic carpet, and this king.......
6304366078|5.0|I first saw &quot;Grand Prix&quot; in a Cinerama Theater when it was released in 1967. Unbelievable! Today; it holds up. I would love to again see it on a Cinerama screen. Nothing compares to that kind of presentation. It is simply the finest racing movie ever made. &quot;LeMans&quot; w/Steve McQueen was also very good, but &quot;Grand Prix&quot; has a plot. John Frankenheimer's camera work is superb. He again used similar camera mounts on cars when filming &quot;Ronin&quot;. &quot;Grand Prix&quot; is stunning in many ways. From the streets of Monaco to the actual banking at Monza, it is a masterpiece. It needs to be released on DVD. The Soundtrack is wonderful, as well. Some of the most beautiful music - The Grand Prix Overture, you will ever hear in any movie! It has been said that this kind of movie will never be duplicated. I believe it. When Stallone approached F1 about his idea about a racing movie, he was shunned. He went to CART, made &quot;Driven&quot;, and it has it's moments (few). There is no comparison. Even with today's technology, I guess the cost to 'even' try to achieve what John Frankenheimer achieved would prohibit such a 'grand' production. He was basically given the space he needed, even the Ferrari factory allowed access, to make his masterpiece. And folks, this movie is a masterpiece! Forget the date of 1966. The cars are gorgeous, the acting superb, and the tracks - wow! You will even see cameos by some legendary drivers of the era. Graham Hill, Dan Gurney, Phil Hill, Jochen Rindt, and others.
6303314015|4.0|Lions are very boring . Here's what happens. the king and queen lion have this cub named Simba and simba has all these adventures to try to become the future king. He has problems along the way that he must face and tons of friends and songs. This movie was a great cartoon, but it gets boring after you watch it tons of times~
B00004STDN|5.0|This is a fast paced no let up thrills and spills of a film. John Lithgow is superb as the evil former agent turned to crime for more rewards. This movie put Stallone back on the map after recent disapointing films like Oscar.I recommend this to any action film fan.
6304100507|3.0|I used to like this movie and have the soundtrack, but i forgot what happened. i own this film and its about this cat that gets adopted by these dogs and they try to do something, but i dunt rememeber what. there are these bad guys and these good guys and other plots. one of my favourtes. i havent watched this film in like 5 years....
6304806426|5.0|This movie is fantastic! It has a big story, big characters and big drama - everything a winner needs! I've seen this movie on TV and will now definitely read the book by Michael Ondaatje - The English Patient just overwhelmed me, and of a matter of fact did impress me a lot. I thought this was just one corny love story, an English somehow involved, but man, was I wrong! This is a story of loss and of the shadow the past than cast over you, a story brilliantly transferred to the silver screen, beaming with power and character. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in some time, I suppose, and it is worth to own on DVD! Definitely!
B0000019PA|5.0|The most beautiful, haunting, charged and powerful album of our time. This album will change the way you listen to music. A high-brow lo-fi masterpiece.
B00004LN16|4.0|I bought this cd the day after I attended the last of the two concerts they gave in Austria - their on-stage performance was incredible, really making you dizzy, like always! I like the cd a lot, although it is not one of their best albums. The reasong I mentioned me attending their concert is, that after having been to the show I might not be able to judge this cd in a very objective way, but I can assure you, even if this is not AC/DC at their best, it IS AC/DC in a very great, great manner.
B00003CXSP|3.0|I am a huge fan of Silence of the Lambs so of course I was first in line to see &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I sat down expecting not a Silence of the Lambs, but a good horror movie. Hannibal did notl ive up to my expectations. The &quot;beginning&quot; of the movie is about 60% of the movie. The plot doesn't get developed until about 70% through the movie.  That was the main problem. I was expecting more scenes with Starling and Lector. To get to the bottom, I'm still buying the movie anyway because of my respect to Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal is still worth seeing but it isn't as good or close to Silence of the Lambs.
B00000JKH2|1.0|At the Drive-In is a complex musical atmosphere of shapes and colors.  So why do I give this EP a 1?  Because it's not nearly as emo as their first release, Evil Empire.  Then their next release, In Utero, was a masterpiece.  Then their singer, Travis Meeks, fired the entire band, and took on an assumed name, Cedric Bixler, while his former band mates took the teen pop world by storm with the band Tantric.  Then they released this EP, which is really good, but [bad] compared to their early releases.  Face it, Riot Grrrls, they're just ripping off A New Found Glory.  You know it.  I know it.  \\"Cedric\\" knows it.  So get off your high horse and go get \\"All Killer No Filler.\\"
B00000K19E|2.0|If the creators had spent as much time on the story line as they did on special effects this might have been a pretty good SciFi flick.  The characters are capable of morphing into &quot;virtual reality beings&quot; to survive various assaults but, for some curious reason, they fail to use that &quot;power&quot; to their best advantage.  I'd rate the computer generated special effects, while not entirely flawless, as a seven out of ten.  But the rest of the work appears fairly conventional with no real surprises for the viewer  -  more like a video game than a feature film piece.
0679735909|4.0|What a clever book - not only does Byatt create characters, but for her historical characters she creates a complete oeuvre of work for not one but two poets of the Victorian era. What i really liked about this book is that it makes the reader think about the purposes of scholarship and the interpretation of texts. As a student, i seem to come across so many articles where i think the author did not write it to share something important, just to justify their existence (or tenure).I read this novel as saying some of the characters were the same.  As for interpretation of texts -  i love the fact that this underlines that we find what we are looking for when we read. (an interesting article about this aspect in this novel can be found at: ... - \\"Three at one Blow: Using Possession to Introduce Theory by Julia Whitsitt) I thought   women's studies suffered especially from this aspect in the book - why does every important female writer *have* to be a lesbian?? &#9786;<br />But this is book is not just some intellectual exercise - it is a great story. Two historians come together to chase the trail of an unexpected 'addition' to the writers they study (she studies Christabel LaMotte, a not so famous poet; he studies Randolph Henry Ash, a famous Victorian poet). The story flows seemlessly from the 20th century to the 19th, with wonderful use of letters, diary entries and good old-fashioned story writing. Also included is a great cast of 'supporting characters' - brash American intellectuals (i have come across my fair share of Leonora Sterns) introspective British ones. I must admit that I did skim over some of the passages of poetry by LaMotte and Ash, the two main historical characters, but i found the story engrossing, and the historical aspects very believable. A truly worthwhile read.
B00005LKHW|1.0|Not much difference between this and the uncut release of a year ago, all you really get is some deleted scenes (which really didn't add anything to the movie anyway) a free ticket to American Pie 2 that most theaters most likey will not take and don't forget: the Full Screen Disk. Save the 22 bucks and take some one with you to see American Pie 2! Again the Ultimate Edition is a ripoff!
014100018X|4.0|An old-style tale in a modern setting (if you put two facts together, you can date it as set in 1995) Chocolat is a likeable tale of the arrival of an outsider in a small French village, and the changes her presence brings about. I found that best thing about the story was the description of the chocolates themselves - i once worked in a chocolate shop, and could understand the magic effect chocolates and sweets can have! One reviewer asked 'Is this the best book every written?' and i have to say no. But it is a worthwhile, if a bit 'girlie', story that is best enjoyed with a glass of hot chocolate close to hand
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I am generally a fan of gangsta rap and techno so I suppose somebody like me typically wouldn't even touch something to the likes of Bjork. But, what can I say! This album (and all her music) is just amazing. i know a lot of people who hate her music just because it isn't what they're used to. Well of course it isn't what they're used to. There is only ONE Bjork, and she fits into her own genre all together. A genre all her own meaning she has fused the likes of techno, adult contemporary, alternative, and classical all into one genre that can only be described as Beautiful Music. For anybody who has actually listened to Bjork and had grown to like it eventually: Congrats! This is the path to follow to even appreciate this kind of music. You need a very open mind to comprehend the complexities of the melodies, how everything is fused together and how her vocals are rarely ever kept in time, but very beautifully....
0451527712|3.0|Another school assignment.  I can't see why they bother.  &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a passable book: it has a plot; it has characters which aren't quite engaging as a whole, but some of them manage well enough.  The thing is, there isn't much to find in this novel besides story.  However, there's some. The real horror is not the monster, but the failings of humankind, and to a lesser extent the price science exacts upon nature, and ultimately the price nature exacts upon the idiots who went too far.<br />Victor Frankenstein is such an idiot.  A little too passionate (a little too like Mary Shelley's husband Percy Bysshe Shelley), he isolates himself from the people that love him, obsesses over chemistry and natural philosophy, and creates a monster from scraps of bodies recovered from charnel houses.  Victor's philophobic.  He ends up, one way or another, killing those that love him; because he cannot give his own creation the love and kindness it needs.  Here is where Mary Shelley succeeds: she makes it clear all the while that he is a human; and because the story is narrated by him you get some sort of a glimpse into the way he was thinking.  And he didn't think too differently from the average person you might meet on the street.  That's scary.<br />However, the characters are so dull that I didn't care when they were killed.  Shelley does things so amazingly lame: oh no! he/she's dead, Victor laments, Victor doesn't get sense knocked into him.  Count the deaths.  Then look over what you've read.  You will realize you saw each of them coming.  And not just because you've heard a lot about this book in the first place.<br />Yes, there's a lot of the author in here.  And there's even some of her husband, the infamous Percy.  The appearance of the word &quot;endeavor&quot; every other page was, I think, part of his attempt to make &quot;Frankenstein&quot; more worthy of the Romantics of the time.  It was written by his 19 year old wife, whose vocabulary was apparently not so extensive as his own, so he looked on it as his duty to poke around with the manuscript.  Oh, if only he'd buggered off!<br />Teachers stumbling upon this review: please, please, make your students read stuff like &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (a building block of Mary Shelley's and mentioned in the novel) by John Milton, much more interesting stuff.  Slap before them a summary of this novel.  They'll get it.  Allow them to read this thing on their own time if ever they so wish.  &quot;Frankenstein&quot; was praised by Sir Walter Scott: how &quot;deep&quot; can it be?ntly not so extensive as his own, so he looked on it as his duty to poke around with the manuscript.

0385334176|4.0|Not a standout novel of KV, but a good read all around.  I'd say it peaked around 3/4 through, and then the rest was really just filler, and not all too interesting.  One thing I really like about KV, is his characters keep reappearing in various novels of his.  A handful show up in here.
0671042858|1.0|Stephen King is one of my favorite authors.  No one can write a story that relates to his and my generation like him.  But, I have to admit that maybe I just missed the boat on this one.  It read to me like King had about 250 pages left in his ream of typing paper and knocked this thing off to finish the pack. A little girl gets lost in the woods; a little girl listens to Red Sox baseball on her radio; a little girl gets found.  While Trisha is a sweet and appealing character, the story, to my mind, has no substance and no filling.  Sort of like the literary equivalent of cheese whiz.  I think it would have come off better as a short story rather than a novel.<br />&quot;Tom Gordon&quot; is reminiscent, to my mind, of another King novel, &quot;Gerald's Game&quot;, which involves a wife who, after going through some sexual hijinks with her husband, witnesses ol' hubby having the &quot;Big One&quot; while she remains chained to their bed.  Kinky, yes. Enthralling, no.  Yet the similiarities between these two books are there.  200 pages of the wife chained up was the equivalent here of 200+ pages of Trisha lost in the woods.  It's not so much the lack of &quot;action&quot; in this book. There's no narrative to move the story along.  As in &quot;Gerald&quot;, King tries to insert an element of the supernatural that he brings in almost as an afterthought.  It's almost as if he felt he needed to do this to save the novel.  As a result, it comes across as if he isn't sure what kind of a story he wanted to write.  I heard someone say, &quot;'The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon' would make an excellent made-for-TV movie.  That should be condemnation enough, right there.<br />And, lastly, as a Yankee fan, I have to disagree with King.  No way Tom Gordon strikes out Bernie Williams and Paul O'Neill back-to-back with a high hard one.  Sorry Stephen.
B00003CX8J|5.0|Okay i was just going to review this film, and i founded out,that the film was going to come out on DVD on August 14, i don't get it, i have the DVD, and the DVD has been in stores, since November, I don't get it, Is it going to be re-realeased? Anyway, i love this film great acting, great plot, great script, and is packed with action, also the DVD is wonderful, the Dolby 5.1 sound and the pictures are excellent (Even though i would have preffered a DTS track), and the bonus material are great, i loved the Behind the  Scenes documentary.
B00003CXSP|5.0|This Movie is great, when I firs saw it I KNEW I had to buy it on DVD, and when I saw the special features it contained, well, I had to buy it, it has almost an hour of deleted scenes including an alternate ending, and I myself enjoy very much alternate endings. When I saw HANNIBAL I had not seen SILENCE OF THE LAMBS because I could not get it at the Video Rental, but after I saw HANNIBAL, I loved the movie, the character and the story so much that I not only bought HANNIBAL but also SILENCE. HANNIBAL is extremely great, the narrative is wonderful, the soundtrack is beautiful, the perfomances are astonishing and the Dr. has never been more scarier.After seing the film I bought the book, the end in the film I myself think is more interesting because it opens the window to another sequel, but don't expect for me to tell it to you. Buy this DVD, you won't regret it, it will give you the thrill of your life, &quot;hope you like it custumer&quot;.....&quot;TA TA&quot;
B00000DRA9|5.0|This is the American version of the score for The Neverending Story. The differences are as follows:<br />The first five tracks on this score, including the catchy title song performed by Limahl, were composed and produced by Giorgio Moroder. It should be noted that tracks 2 and 3 - Swamps of Sadness and The Ivory Tower, are not the exact versions used in the film. The Ivory Tower track in particular has a stronger bassline and more discernible beat, although it should be noted that these are the original tracks as produced by Moroder (and not remixed for this album).<br />Tracks 6 -15 are taken from the original 17 track score composed by Klaus Doldinger. That score, which exists on the German version of the film, lacks the title song but also contains cues not heard in the American version of the film. This soundtrack is also available (look under Doldinger or the original title &quot;Die Unendliche Geschichte&quot;).<br />Both versions of the soundtrack are great, and tonally the Moroder tracks do work with Doldinger's original pieces. This version is closer to the the one heard by most viewers, if not necessarily a truer version of the score.
B00000J7A2|5.0|If you're more than a little fed up with what is currently happening in the mainstream side of music, do what I did. Pick up this record. Not only will it completely restore your faith in music, it will also change the way you look at it. A catchy pop tune will never be enough after hearing this record. I was never really exposed to the Captain much when I was growing up. I was raised around a lot of country and blues and classic rock (Grand Funk, the Byrds, Neil Young, Zappa, Stones, Haggard, Jennings, Clapton, and David Allen Coe). I got into the captain a coupla years ago and I must say that I haven't been the same since. I still listen to a lot of what's going on right now but one thing I've discovered, is that with a lot of the newer stuff, I tend to get tired of it really fast. This is what music is all about. &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; is one of those albums that you can listen too a thousand times and it will be a different experience with each listening. Honestly, there is so much going on here, it's really hard to sum this puppy up in less than a thousand words. All I can say is, &quot;just buy it.&quot; Your friends may think that you've gone insane if they happen to hear this playing at your house. I know that my best friend thought that I had finally lost my marbles the first time I loaned him a copy of &quot;Burnt Weeny Sandwhich&quot; by the Mothers of Invention. Like the Mothers, the Captain is highly experimental (not unlike Radiohead) and will definitely find a place in the library of those who appreciate creativity and inventiveness. Chances are if you like Radiohead, you'll love this. You will at least appreciate it, even if it's not your thing. I get sort of a Jeckyll and Hyde effect when I listen to this album. It's really great to listen too when I'm driving and strange thoughts pop into my head. It's really cool if you're taking a long road trip by yourself. I just put this one in and let it play over and over. Well, I'm not making a whole lotof sense here. All I can say is just get this album. It will keep you busy. and I aint lyin neither.
B00004STPT|5.0|Lucky are they who have purchased the DVD of Gladiator and watched the extensive interview with Zimmer on the bonus disk, regarding the soundtrack! His commentary explains intricate details about the sound that he, Gerrard and Scott were looking for. Since I cannot imagine someone buying a soundtrack to a movie which they have not seen, there is no need to dwell upon the composition, inspiration or impact of Zimmer and Gerrard's work. The important factor here is that the music stands on it's own perfectly. However, I cannot play the CD without each scene of the film clearly replaying in my mind, to the point where I can't wait to watch the film again. Zimmer's collaboration with Gerrard, which was supposed to last 3-5 days, ended up being a six month joint project. Her contribution was not just the 'lending' of her voice; it was a total collaboration thoughout the score and this is what makes this soundtrack stand out as the finest of Zimmer's efforts to date. I would go one step further and say that this is THE best original movie soundtrack to date!
B0000027RL|5.0|No matter how many times I listen to is, Ten never gets old.  Its THAT good!  Pearl Jam really made something here.  Not only are there some great rock songs on here, but thanks to Eddie Vedder's insightful lyrics (not to mention his singing), they also have a lot of substance and meaning to them.<br />&quot;Even Flow&quot; is just full of pure energy, and sometimes I listen to it non-stop.  &quot;Jeremy&quot; is indeed a classic, powerful song.  &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Oceans&quot; are great, mellow tracks.  Guitarist Mike McCready simply never lets up.  A classic rock album overall, and more than worth the money.
B000002BPS|4.0|'Ixnay on the Hombre' is one of those albums with some REALLY good tracks and some REALLY bad ones.  For example: &quot;Gone Away&quot; has got to be one of the most intense songs I've ever heard; same goes for &quot;Amazed&quot; (as well as about 5 others).  Then, songs like &quot;Cool to Hate&quot; and &quot;Don't Pick it Up&quot; throw any intelligent-themes out of whack.<br />MOST of the songs on this album are intense, well-thought out, and musically amazing... there are just a few bad ones to skip through.<br />Go ahead and buy 'Ixnay on the Hombre', there is some hardcore punk-rock on there... just be prepared to skip about half of the tracks.
0064407667|4.0|As an adult, I read series books I think would be appropriate for an After-school program.  The series is a little dark, not gory, but, a child should be made aware of this premise.  The children overcome great &quot;adventures&quot; with their personal talents. If you can help the child with #1- A Bad Beginning, I feel their interest will stay.  The stories are up-to-date, not in a past time, so readers can relate.  I recommend starting with the first book, as the following books, I feel, somehow relate back to the beginning.  Give this series a try.
B00000DHRZ|3.0|I own 5 of the 6 Offspring albums, 'Americana' is the one I listen to least.  The band has switched its style, image, and lyrical-messages to appeal to a larger, dumber, and younger audience with 'Americana'; much of the depthful punk-attitude from their previous cds was lost in this one.<br />If you're thinking of buying this because of songs like &quot;Why Don't You Get a Job&quot; or &quot;Pretty Fly&quot;, then you won't be dissapointed.  Most of the album sounds like that.  If you're looking into 'Americana' as a continuation of older albums like 'Smash', 'Ixnay', or 'Ignition', keep in mind that this sounds nothing like any of those.  With this album, Offspring have (de)evolved into a more poppish-angry sound.
0962477060|5.0|Get this book!! If you do nothing you are losing out on a fantastic opportunity. This is for all guitar players, I am 24, I started playing when I was 15 if I got this then I would be playing in a band by now.  It is the greatest thing I have ever bought for the guitar. If you want a gift for someone who plays or is learning to play this is it!    Just read the reviews!!!!! Nothingelse needs to be said! This is it!
068484267X|5.0|I started out reading this book and became somewhat bored with it. I would read a little and set it down for quite sometime before picking it up again. I thought it was slow and although it was interesting, I couldn't stay with it. Once I had read it half-way, I started to really get attached to little Frankie McCourt. I found it amusing and painful at the same time... Towards the end I could not put it down, and the ending wraps up nicely. Looking back, I enjoyed this book far more than anticipated.
B00005B36H|5.0|Tool Lateralus. <br />I'd describe it as a harsh, inventive, angry yet solemn funeral dirge sung by aliens from the planet &quot;Anvil&quot;.<br />The drum work is deceptively awesome - and if you have the patience to listen to the whole thing from beginning to end, it pays off in the same bent way as an ice cream headache, or the way you felt when you realized your pet parakeet 'Tookey' wasn't really playing the stiff-quiet-birdie-haha game.<br />-Dan P Los Altos, California
6304143184|5.0|E.T is a classic.  Who can ever hate such a great movie as this. This is one of the best Steven Spielberg movies ever made.  I absolutely love this movie.  Not only is the acting classic but the soundtrack is classic.  Suprisingly though its sister movie is Poltergiest which does not even correspond with this film its filmed in the same neighborhood and the John Williams music is very similar in Poltergiest.  I think everybody has seen this movie so there is no more to say about it its just a classic movie about a friendly alien which is rare in alot of movies.
B000002MY3|1.0|Geez, are there people who think Alanis has a good voice!!?? She doesn't know how to sing. Like many young male and female singers these days, she just sort of bellows and yells somewhat in tune. Her phrasing is terrible, all those yelps and whoops are annoying. Check out her vocal inflections on &quot;one hand in my pocket&quot; after the line, &quot;I've got one hand in my pocket&quot; the next line is &quot;the other one's hailing a taxi cab&quot; I can never hear that line without cringing. Her emotional level seems to be a jilted junior high student. &quot;You,you, you ....man, you!!!&quot; If you are over 25 and you think that her singing is great and her lyrics are really insightful, you need to check out more mature and much better singers like the late, great Eva Cassidy and maybe a country artist like Carlene Carter.
6304509154|5.0|This is probably the best horror movie ever made in history that I can tolerate.  The whole story makes sense and its real the acting is classic and it deals with real life whats good about it is that it deals with a average suburban family living in a newly developed neighborhood and all this crazy stuff happens to them.  This was a good year for Stephen Spielberg movies two all time classics were released that year E.T about a childhood fantasy and Poltergiest about a childhood nightmare.  What also makes Poltergiest funny is the human interaction in it with your everyday arguements your annoying next door neighbor and the film shows all of that lightheartedness but also that deep horror.  Now there something about this movie usually I look at movies like Freddy Kruger movies and think that they are just the stupitest thing but Poltergiest literally gives me chills the whole movie is eary.  It may also have something to do with the teenage girl in this movie who was strangled to death by her boyfriend shortly after this movie was released.  The music also has a eary touch to it. The scariest part maybe the ghosts spirits coming down the stairs with the music and everything the whole movie is a classic.
B000003Z4C|5.0|To anybody who is not very familiar with Nick Cave's Works, You should not be pondering whether or not is would be worth you money to give him a try; Instead you should be forking out your hard earned cash for both this album (Let Love In) and Murder Ballads. Consider a necessary expenditure, essential for your personal well being. I have been seenig Nick compared to the likes of Jim Morrison, Leonard Cohen, and Tom Waits. To compare him to any single one of these three is unfair to his talents. (don't misunderstand me, if you don't have at least a portion of the works of these three musical geniuses, you've got some listening to to; they are the best in their own genres.) Cave could be compared to all three as having the poetic talents of Morrison, with the unorthodox way with words of Waits, and being driven by themes akin to cohen. In truth, Nick Cave is an entirely different animal; a breed all of his own. Let Love In is proof of this. Red Right Hand, being the black sheep of the album (more akin to the feel of Murder Ballads), will draw you in and make your skin crawl. The most notable characteristic on this album is, however, what I like to call Pure Musical CHAOS! Lover Man sets the mood as dangerous and evil, lulling you in. Then the chorus erupts into a barrage of sounds, almost as if in a panic, yet maintaining the musical integrity of the song. You will seldom hear any other artist try to duplicate Cave's feel, for it may be one of the most complicate styles of the past several decades. Let Love In is a necessity for anybody who enjoys their music dark and mysterious, with a touch of evil. Get It Now.
6304078102|4.0|I would like to begin this review by thanking my mother.<br />You don't want to be at a video store with my mother. While you're trying to pick out a couple of films, she's wandering the aisles recommending movies left and right until you can't remember all the names anymore, grabbing a box with Helen Hunt and one with Leelee Sobieski and trying to get you to see the similarities, and finally ending the trip by trying to get you to hurry (after all that!) because she's tired.<br />She's the one who picked out this film.<br />Originally, I turned it down and rented something else. But after those movies were returned, my mom showed up at home after work with this movie in tow. My sister and I watched it, now I realize what an excellent work it is.<br />This movie is found in the drama section, so if you don't like weepy films, don't rent this. You should also see this before you see another of Richard Dreyfuss' movies, the comedy Krippendorf's Tribe, because if you see that first, your viewing of him as a music teacher will be influenced by your viewing of him in a grass skirt. Luckily I saw KT afterwards, otherwise drama would have been turned into comedy.<br />Wonderful performance by unknown Joseph Anderson as Coltrane Holland, the deaf son of our title character. Excellent movie all around.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|...The entire theater was shocked to have seen something like this.  Throughout the film we had all laughed, cried, and been utterly bewildered.<br />'Moulin Rouge' is full of drama, suspense, romance, laughter and tears.  There was an intriguing plot, superb acting (with believable characters), original costumes, entertaining music, and much more.  Its not often that all of this elements can come together to make a film as touching, original, and heartfelt as Moulin Rouge.  I hope that Moulin Rouge will get the Oscar nominations that it deserves!  Moulin Rouge really does deserve a Best Picture nomination.<br />I had no idea that Nicole Kidman had such a great voice.  If she ever dropped acting, she could most defintely pursue a singing career.   I was already aware of Ewan McGregors amazing voice because of his small singing bit in Emma.  I was overjoyed to be able to hear him sing again!<br />In order to enjoy this masterpiece, you have to accept Baz Luhrmanns uniqueness and just let him take you to another world in order to enjoy Moulin Rouge to its fullest.  I must admit, the first fifteen minutes were a little strange to me, probably because I was so shocked to see something like this!  The movie does get better if you dont like the first fifteen minutes.  Baz Luhrmanns cleverly angled camera shots and neat film editing make Moulin Rouge a movie to remember.  <br />Moulin Rouge is unlike anything I have ever seen before.<br />'This story is about...love...at the Moulin Rouge'   ~Christian 'Moulin Rouge'
B000002KNI|3.0|It's not a bad album, certainly...but it definitely let me down.  Art Garfunkel's voice had noticeably declined by the time this recording was made (complaint number 1).  And it really hurts the whole album.  On top of that, lots of beautiful string and horn arrangements we hear on the original studio albums are gone - replaced instead with an electric piano just dinking around.  WHat's odd is that a horn section does play with them...so why do they sit out on songs like The BOxer?  Good lord, they are incredibly vital to the song.  The fact is, no matter what I may have to say that's disparaging, you still would be hard pressed to go wrong with this album.  But just buy it with the understanding that it won't knock your socks off.
B00004NHCC|5.0|pay attention:  THERE IS NO SONG IN EXISTANCE AS BEAUTIFUL AND ROMANTIC AS &quot;EMBRACEABLE YOU&quot; AS SUNG BY THIS WOMAN RIGHT HERE!!!  the sheer power of the human voice can be an amazing, even near-miraculous instrument when properly invoked! tight work, indeed...plus CLIFFORD ON THE HORN?!? gorgeous.
B00005A1PR|5.0|ndia's music is a throwback to when artist wrote and played music. She could easily have survived in the music expolosion of the early seventies when her idol, Steive WOnder, Marvin, Donny and Minnie ruled. Her music is heartfelt and real. Unlike the hot Alicia Keys (I like her but don't feel the cd does her justice), India's music goes somewhere. It doesn't have that same old feel that all programmed music has. There are dynamics! She writes meaningful lyrics and feels them. \\"Video\\" Iis the most catchy pop ditty that actually means something!  Buy this CD and start listening to someon who will last!
B000002MUQ|4.0|First, BALANCE isn't an awful album.  It's not VH's best, that's obvious, but it's not a throwaway like their next album would be (sans Sammy), VAN HALEN III.  &quot;Can't Stop Lovin' You&quot; is blantant pop, but so what?  Isn't that the essence of the band--fun music?  &quot;Take me Back&quot; is pretty good, and so is &quot;Aftershock&quot;.  But the rest of the tunes are uncharacteristically bleak or slapshod.  But any album with three good songs equals a good album.
0767812166|4.0|Starman by John Carpenter is by all accounts one of the best science fiction movies I have ever seen.  OK there may not be loads of special effects to dazzle you, but this is human life seen through the eyes of an alien, which turns most sci-fi movies on their head.  The development of the love story between the two characters is charming and very touching, not to mention great performances by Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen (I've always liked both of them), but Jeff Bridges really does make you think he is an alien, by the way he talks, walks and acts generally.<br />The music is also very good, and really comes into it's own at the end of the film.  It is very haunting and the whole mood of the movie reminds me of The Dead Zone, which is another favourite of mine.  I love John Carpenter's other films, eg The Fog, The Thing and Halloween, but this is very different from them.<br />In summary, I always judge a film by how it makes you feel, and I always feel emtionally touched after this film, even though it is sad, it is uplifting.

B00004Z4WR|5.0|I LOVE Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie, so i decided to watch this movie althouge i really don't like action and car chase movies. But this movie really surprised me- i actually enjoyed it. It was entertaining, funny, and although it was kinda boring at the beginnings, since the chasing started- the action started, which means a lot of totally gorgeous cars, action, and some funny scenes (see the &quot;Eleanor&quot; chase scene, it was kinda hilarious!). If you're looking for a good action movie to watch and enjoy, i really recommand Gone in 60 Seconds. Just don't forget to put plastics on your carpet first- i mean GORGEOUS, expansive cars, Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie in one movie- how can you not drool all over it?...
B000002NHN|5.0|Although I only own a few of Loreena's albums I can't see myself picking a favorite of the four I own. Every album Loreena puts out is gold. The music is stunning, if not breathtaking. &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; is a continuation of her world travels. What she sees during her journeys inspires her music which I just find utterly captivating. I think the excerpts from her journal are interesting to read and the listener gets an idea of where Loreena gets the idea for a particular song.<br />The music on &quot;Book of Secrets&quot; is a stunning masterpiece of beautiful, breathtaking melodies and delicate vocals from one of my long time favorite artists. What I love about Loreena Mckennitt's music in general is that she puts out consistent music that I can never hate. There isn't one single song of hers that I do not like. I love every song on &quot;Book of Secrets&quot;. There are no particular favorites because every song on this album is a favorite of mine. Loreena's skills as a musician is just as incredible as her singing and it really shines through on this album. What else can I say? She is simply amazing.
B00005BCPC|4.0|If you want a good viewing experience, fun, funny, and fast-paced, you'll probably enjoy this film.  If you loved the novel &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, however, prepared for a disappointment about the presentation and the story.  This &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is more an exploration of Austen herself, in the guise of one of her characters, than an adaptaions of the story told by Fanny Price, an interesting and observant narrator, but not particularly active.  If you can get past these issues, however, &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; is quite enjoyable.
B000006UD8|5.0|Deep Purple could easily have been as big as Led Zeppelin.  They were certainly as talented.  If only Ritchie Blackmore had got on better with Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, this classic line-up could have stayed together for a few more years, and clocked up true supergroup status.  And earned an awful lot of money.<br />But an inability to make compromises often goes with the territory of being highly talented.  Listening again to these remastered anniversary editions of 'In Rock', 'Fireball' and 'Machine Head' together with 'Rainbow Rising', I am strongly persuaded by the argument that Ritchie Blackmore has been rock's greatest post-Hendrix guitarist.<br />This was a re-master I had to buy.  'Machine Head' was the first album I ever bought.  For several months it was the only album I owned, so I played it to death.  Every piece of music brought into my boarding school had to be approved by the headmaster.  At the time, only 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' had been approved.  Rather than ask permission and get the album confiscated, I sneaked 'Machine Head' in to the school, intending to play it to myself on headphones.  But other boys -- we were 13-year-olds -- wanted their own copies, so a number of crude speaker-to-microphone recordings were made.  That summer, the sounds of 'Highway Star' and 'Pictures of Home' echoed around the subterranean cavern that was called the Model Club.  Fortunately this was not the era when hard-rock bands felt obliged to insert gratuitous four-letter words into their lyrics.  Despite the musical style of 'Machine Head' not nothing like the classical stuff that our teachers wanted us to aspire to, the album was not banned.  Strangely, 'Smoke on the Water' was NOT one of the tracks we paid much attention to.  It was only when I moved on the next term to another school -- one where boys could learn the guitar -- that I became aware of the legendary status this track was acquiring.<br />This 2CD set throws up an immediate dilemma: which to listen to first -- the Remixes or the Remasters?  I know every note of the original album, so the Remasters were my first port of call.  The recordings are clearer, but there's no particular revelation.<br />What is stunning -- and this is the reason why every Purple fan has to own this version -- are Roger Glover's Remixes.  Normally I am suspicious of remixes.  Today remixes are usually an excuse for another producer to cut and splice, re-order chorus and verse, and put down several new layers of synth and drum machine.  Glover has done none of that, but he has brought a fantastic clarity to the recordings.  Most tracks last a little longer, because Glover has left in an additional bar of music at the opening or at the very end.  Two tracks, including 'Smoke on the Water', have completely different solos.<br />In listening to the remixes, you feel very close to the stage of the Grand Hotel, Montreux.  There is a tremendous live feel to the recordings.  Extraordinarily for a band whose members couldn't abide each other, the level of empathy between the musicians is oustanding.  The interplay between Blackmore and Lord is wonderful.  (Now at last with the sonic clarity of the remixes I can just about be sure which bits are played by Lord and which by Blackmore.)  Even Glover's bass solo on 'Pictures of Home' sparkles.<br />Ian Gillan may have been casual about the writing of the lyrics, but Purple's music has lasted because the band put so much into the development of each track.  I found that it took many listens to fully appreciate all the nuances of their finest recordings.  That was, after all, part of the appeal of progressive music.  This anniversary set is a fitting testament to the greatest progressive hard rock band I have known.isten to first -- the Remixes or the Remasters?

6303965415|4.0|Despite the much disputed public kiss at the end, I think that this production reflects the attitude and tone of Austen's novel beautifully.  I was quite impressed by how faithfully the production followed the story itself as well as the themes and attitudes, but in any case this is a wonderful and entertaining film.
B00005K3O4|4.0|I would guess that most sci-fi movie lovers would think this is one of those movies that were turned out by the dozens in the 70's. Cheap lousy movies with lousy actors that seemed to have a budget of maybe $50. This is NOT one of those movies. It's truly a classic piece of work that has clever use of the whole clown genre. With cotton candy, magic tricks and carnival atmosphere the clowns use everything they can to get their victims.<br />I really enjoyed this movie.
078062369X|5.0|This is yet another vampire movie that is not stereotypical.  I liked the action, and Snipes was excellent -- probably the best role I have seen him in.  The plot was really good.  See it, you'll will enjoy it.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Christina Aguilera is a very false girl.  She does not have her own sound, particulary on this album.  Christina TRIES to over sing every one in the industry.  She obviously thinks she on a scale with Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Aretha Franklin, ETC.  The girl should steer clear from the extremly high octaves (sounds awful), and hit high notes occasionally (when her troat is not strained.) I for one, think she should stick to her pop (white) roots and, leave the classic christmas songs where they belong.
B000002JS0|5.0|I've been listening to AC/DC for a long time and this is one of there best, here, I'll tell you about the Songs,<br />1. Very good opener, and the bagpipe is breathtaking.<br />2. Also very good, music and lyrics, also a very good meaning.<br />3. A nice cool down song, and somewhat funny, but the live version has better lyrics. (but these words are more appropriate)<br />4. Teriific music, you'll get the feeling you heard it before.<br />5. A classic if you never heard T.N.T, you haven't heard nothin'<br />6. Originally sung by dave evans, but this one is ALOT better.<br />7. Little Lover sounds like a 50's song, but it's still good. (It could have been worse, it could be Love song here instead, that tune is there worst!) <br />8. She's got balls is all AC/DC.<br />9. THE BEST ON THE C.D!!!<br />There's something else, look at the differences between U.S and Aus. releases. (for those who don't know)<br />High Voltage<br />Baby, please don't go - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) She's got balls - (released on this album) little Lover - (released on this album) Stick around - (Never released in the U.S) soul stripper - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) You ain't got a hold on me - (later released on 74' Jailbreak) Love song - (Never released in the U.S) Show Buisness - (later released on 74' Jailbreak)<br />T.N.T<br />Almost identical to the U.S High Voltage except Rocker was replaced by she's got balls (and later put on Dirty Deeds) and School days was replaced by little lover. so it's just a combination. Thank you and good night!
0060392886|5.0|I always knew that a rock stars life was crazy, but this is just insane.  Talk about Sex, Drugs and Rock-n-Roll!  I love Motley Crue, still do, but what a story!  Some chapters made me want to put the book down with disgust, others made me laugh, others made me cry and most made me think, &quot;How are these guys still alive?&quot;.  So many feeling shot through me.  It's a good book when you, the reader can feel the emotional rollercoaster of its subjects. I read it so fast and hope that there is a part two someday, maybe titled &quot;Clean but Dirtier&quot;.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Ok so it is a lot different than anything Roger Waters has ever written.But i was surprised over how great it is. Whoever says this is a bad album can not be a true Waters fan.It is ten times better than anything Gilmour wrote.Although i am glad Pink Floyd decided to make The Wall instead of this album,it is better as a waters solo...especially since eric clapton plays the guitar on this...the songs go great with claptons playing.
B00005MAM2|2.0|These &quot;people&quot; have destroyed a classic with the new English dub.  Several catch lines from the movie have 'vanished, gone...without a trace' Just like that line from the movie.  While the picture looks good and the sound is clear, the dialog ruins this movie.  Anyone wanting this classic on DVD, unfortunately this is the only choice right now.  Perhaps these morons at Pioneer will release the origional english dub on DVD.<br />I am outraged as would any other fan of the origional.
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters (Roger/Floyd)is my favourite writer and performer, so no matter what he makes i will love.But thats not why i love this album.When i first bought it i was disapointed...it was the first solo Roger album i heard.I expected something Floyd like or at least like the final cut.So i put it in my CD case and never mentioned it.Then about two months later i listened to the entire album.And i was amazed...i couldnt believe i practically threw this album away...ive loved pink floyd for years and rogers writing but in the past 4 months i love him 10 times as much after listening to this album and his other solo work...Roger Waters is for sure the best writer of all time.
B000002UD0|4.0|..makes this record better 27 years later. <br />Even though the lyrics aren't among Lennon's best, the music is very melodic and interesting. &quot;#9 Dream&quot; and &quot;Old Dirt Road&quot; have haunting melodies, and &quot;Steel and Glass,&quot; though similar to &quot;How Do You Sleep?,&quot; is very stark and gripping.<br />This set deserves a re-master. C'mon Yoko, get off of your duff and do it!!
B000006TRV|5.0|It is hard to tell you how good this album is.And if you dont know anything about it you have been deprived for too long.Roger Waters is the best writer of all time.His first GREAT album was darkside of the moon...and then every album he has written in pink floyd and solo is great also.But the wall and darkside are the at the top of greatness.If you have never heard any of the music from this album then see a doctor and buy this album and listen to the WHOLE thing straight through many many many times.You will love it....and if you dont then you probably are incapable of liking any good music.

Lori Petty does a great job as the wild, sassy title role, and the other characters are cool too. This movie is very imaginative, with everything from lovesick kangaroo-men to scheming, holograph-headed villains. Tank Girl is one awesome chick, and she's here to save the world. Good can triumph over evil- P-P-P-POW!

B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead is back with &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and what a feat.  This band just keeps getting better and better with each album.<br />Most bands today just wearout after a couple of albums, but Radiohead shows they are one of the most underrated bands today.<br />Well produced artful album with some great cuts like &quot;Pyramid Song&quot;, &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; and &quot;Dollars &amp; Cents&quot; to name a few.<br />Each song is a story all its own with its own style, sound, and artful quality.<br />This album is more acoustic than the last and brings the vocals and lyrics out to the forefront.<br />One of the Ten best for 2001.

I first heard about it when my high school decided to put it on for our spring musical...I auditioned and got a small part in it...I first fell in love with the music, then saw the movie and fell in love with it as well. This movie is one of Kelly's best in my opinion, although Singing in the rain comes in a close 2nd. The story line,choreography,and costumes are amazing. This is truly a masterpiece movie...If you haven't seen this movie yet...BUY IT NOW AND WATCH IT..it is well worth the money and time it takes to watch the movie.

B00005J9M0|4.0|The third proper album from the Pet Shop Boys finds itself firmly entrenched in dance club land (at least for 1988, anyway). The disc is a full-length fifty minute LP, comprised of six long-play songs. The concept was to start out with 12&quot; (or extended) mixes of songs, rather than producing four minute pop songs, and *then* having them extended afterward. The result is, for the most part, marvelous.<br />   All of the songs on 'Introspective' are beat-driven dance numbers. What makes them extra special is that they are superbly structured, and actually contain lyrics of great depth and insight. Some of the songs are political, some scathing, one is a cover song, and more than one of them deals thoughtfully with loneliness. I am not fond of the last track, but it is not enough for me to detract much enjoyment from the listening experience.<br />   The Pet Shop Boys re-issued their first six albums in the summer of 2001. Each album now comes with a 36 page booklet of &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; insight and information, as well as a bonus disc of material recorded from the same era as the album which it accompanies. 'Introspective' has been wonderfully re-mastered, and sounds much more deep, lush, and alive. The effect the re-tooling has had on the beats is superb, and gives the songs a richer tone. There are five previously unreleased tracks on the bonus disc, as well as alternate versions of songs from the album, and b-sides from the singles.<br />   'Introspective' is a solid dance album from the eighties, which contains some of the Boys' best work. The 2001 re-issue version is most definitely an enrichment for the original CD, and is recommended for the serious collector.

B00005LB50|5.0|I have been listening to this nonstop since it arrived. I'm going to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.<br />Could the collection have included more things, as other reviewers have critically suggested? Sure. Could it have been arranged differently? No doubt. To me, listening to the demos and early cuts is like watching the Trinity explosion at Los Alamos. It makes you feel as if you were there at ground zero observing something very significant happening. I'll avoid reference to the obvious cliche about something happening.<br />I was in high school in LA when the Buffalo Spingfield started and ended. Their music, and its influence on so many other musicians and bands, is almost without equal. I love this band, I love the box set.<br />Just a few days ago, riding in the car with one of the box set CDs playing, my wife said &quot;Can you play that song again, I can't believe how pretty the interaction of the two guitar parts is.&quot; Exactly.  She gets it.  You get it too.

0140187537|5.0|Discontent was required reading in high school and has lost nothing in the past 40 years. Ethan Hawley and his story was relevant in the fifties and is even more so today. I've never met a Steinbeck book I didn't like but this one has to be my favorite. Maybe it's because I know more than several Ethan Hawleys and Steinbeck's portrayal is dead on. Although I can't believe the Nobel committee waited until 1962 to award Discontent the prize for literature (what about Of Mice and Men and East of Eden)? this novel surely deserved it.<br />This is a novel that bears rereading every five years or so. If ever an author chronicled the lessening of American standards and the downward spiral of a man's moral integrity, it was Steinbeck!
B00005N5S5|4.0|even though the end scene is really crappy looking (i mean it was stop motion) it was a great 80's movie. the special edition looks really cool with the new scenes and the new 5.1 sound. so at least we don't have to deal with horrible sound. alse MGM sudios is releasing it instead of Hemindal entertainment. i just hope they fully restored the picture also. Warning to parents: there is a love scene around an hour and 10 min in with some nudity. just to let them know <br />     Rated R for graphic violence, strong language and brief nudity involving sex
B0000042BZ|4.0|This opera video while in fact a movie performance with shootings on natural background scenery, is performed so beautifully and magnificent,that it give more emphasize to the sinister nature and tragical story of the jester Rigoletto and his daughter. We enjoy the performance of Ingvar Wixell as Rigoletto, who sung so splendidly and moved our hearts to the tragical condition he is involved. His performance is matched in perfection by the delightful and brilliant performance of Edita Gruberova, who appeared so magnifently exposing the lovely fairylike character of Gilda. I have seen several of Gruberova's performances, but in this opera her singing is so beautiful and as such convince the world of her superiority in performing the innocent lovesick daughter of Rigoletto. Luciano Pavarotti is already so famous that nobody will deny the beauty of his singing. However, his name does not emphasize the success of this video as disappointingly his acting is not quite so convincing as his other performances that I have seen.  Nevertheless, we can still enjoy his splendid voice and watch the magnificent performances of the other singers.
B00003CXS4|4.0|This has to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time - other reviewers have gone into details about the great dialogue and characters, so I won't bore you. One thing that hasn't been emphasized is that you can watch this movie more than once and still be entertained so it's worth buying.<br />BUT...<br />I was less than impressed with the &quot;extras&quot; on this DVD. The &quot;Making of Snatch&quot; featurette was okay, but the &quot;Cast and Crew Commentary&quot; was the worst I've ever heard. Guy Ritchie and the Producer were either hungover or extremely tired and really had very little to say about what they were thinking about while making this great flick. Too bad.<br />So if you get the VHS version instead of the DVD, you probably won't be missing too much.

0767814622|5.0|Awsome movie, awsome acting, and intense story. To all the people that protest this movie: face the facts. This was based on a real story. Face up to what happened. You're not upset because this movie is a lie, you're upset because it exposed the sickening and notoriously corrupt prison system Turkey had (has?) at the time of this event. Anyway, it should be of no surpise: Turkey is not necessarily known for its human rights advocacy! At any rate, the movie was well made. You can't keep a good movie down!
B00000F1D3|5.0|This cd showcases Cher's talent to take on any type of music possible. This album includes her smash hit 'Believe' which went to no.1 in 23 countrys and stayed at no.1 for a record breaking 21 weeks on the Billboard dance charts. It also has a remix of her critically acclaimed 'We all sleep alone'. It has a number of songs that should have been released like 'Runaway', 'Taxi Taxi', and 'Love is the groove'. It includes her two U.K. hits, 'All or nothing' and 'Dov'E L'amore' and who forget her fantastic dance floor hit 'Strong enough'? It has a racey and upbeat sound to it. But there are two other songs that will make you happy when your down, 'The power' and 'Takin' back my heart'. So if your looking for great songs by this comeback diva go for 'Believe'!!!
1556154844|5.0|When I first heard about it, I wondered how a book on software engineering published in 1993, prehistoric by information technology years, could have such good reviews.  I mean the bulk of these examples were written in Pascal or Fortran and Visual Basic, my main development tool, wasn't even available yet.  Why should a hardcore VB programmer get this book?<br />I forced myself to get it because I think it's important to read the &quot;classics&quot; and because I was almost curious as to how it could get such great reviews.  I haven't regretted it.  There is such a diverse presentation of coding techniques and suggestions that it doesn't matter if it's in C, Basic, Pascal or Fortran.  While I usually get a programming book that applies to one specific language, program or topic, this book is language independent.  Perhaps that's why almost everyone unanimously agrees that this book is still extremely useful.<br />I would agree that this book would be considered most useful for new programmers, but I guarantee that any programmer or software engineer can learn something new from this book.  There are too many good suggestions and principles contained within not to.  Pick it up and see what everyone's STILL raving about 8+ years later.
B00003CXSM|5.0|I loved this movie - although I have to admit, it's a chick flick!  Matthew was adorable...Jennifer played a great character with pretty bad luck... Great for a date, or for a night when the man in your life is out of town...get the popcorn ready ladies - you'll love this movie!
B000002H6C|4.0|This is great! Here are my song ratings:<br />Blackened: A great song with very good lyrics and a good beat.<br />Eye of the Beholder: A great song! The beginning where it's soft and gets louder edvery second isn't neccesary.<br />One: Good song. The only part that isn't neccesary is the long solo at the end.<br />Harvester of Sorrow: Great! A long song but it's worth listening though!<br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity: I didn't like this one because of the terrible lyrics.<br />Dyer's Eve: A great story like song!<br />To Live Is To Die: A great steady song!<br />Shortest Straw: I good song but the title doesn't make much sense.
B0000029DD|5.0|Listening to the words of everyone from Chris Cornell, Donovan Sheik, Sheryl Crow and Ty Tabor to drop a scant few names, I have a happy feeling that we've only begun to see the impact and influence of this impressive, fearless, mammoth paean to the muse.   This album is so impressively diverse, you will find every single style in the musical rainbow.  During his life Jeff was known for his eclectic tastes and covered everyone from Bad Brains to Van Morrison with aplomb, so its not a surprise his debut is all over the map.  &quot;Lilac Wine&quot; is smoky jazz, whereas &quot;Eternal Life&quot; rages both lyrically and musically - it should meet the minimal angst requirement for any angry alt.rocker.  Though you will find a few who are put off by the intensity and seemingly scattershot focus, its impossible to sit and listen to this album and not be moved by it.  There are several covers and Buckley owns every single one of them, especially &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, the most tender reading of a Cohen song I have ever heard.   Thats to say nothing of the stunning originals, like the tortured &quot;Mojo Pin&quot;, which literally defy classification.  Its a sad listen because you can hear what is only the beginning of his greatness.<br />One more thought.  On the enhanced portion of _My Sweetheart..._ you can read many of his words; one paragraph in particular is to the effect that &quot;I make music for those people who like to drive fast and far down the highway, with the music turned up loud and tears streaming down their cheeks.&quot;  <br />The world just wasn't ready for you this time, Jeff.  Maybe next time around it will be - I just hope to god i'm somehow around to hear it.

0152023984|5.0|I happened onto THE LITTLE PRINCE in college and read it at a sitting.  Since then I've re-read it many times and bought numerous copies for friends.  In under a hundred pages, Antoine de St. Exupery managed to beautifully express some tender and profound views and teach the reader some important things about mortality and the proper appreciation of it.  The illustrations are wonderful and the text has made this book popular in several languages for over three generations.
0897500482|5.0|This is just one man's opinion.  He knew it, too.  This man was the real deal.  Reading his book is not a look at martial arts, but a look at a real human being's mind.

B00005ASOC|5.0|Forrester is a reclusive genius writer. Jamal is a young black athlete who has a gift he cannot cope with. An unlikely relationship, to be sure, but they teach each other about life and soon become friends, with Forrester emerging from his shell and helping Jamal in his time of need. Finding Forrester has a lot of humor in it, and a lot of great drama. But the best part is the acting. It boasts three Academy Award-winners on its cast, along with a remarkable and heartfelt performance by newcomer Rob Brown, who does great in every scene. Connery is amazing, coming off performances in movies like The Rock and Entrapment, which were from okay to bad, he gives the best performance of his career. F. Murray Abraham has been great in everything he has ever been in (Last Action Hero pending), and this is no exception. This movie could have been perfect if maybe 15 or 20 minutes were trimmed, its a bit too long at nearly two and a half hours. However, it is an excellent movie and although the storyline is comprable to Good Will Hunting (it is impossible to write a review for this movie without mentioning GWH), its acting and humor are excellent, its writing and directing are great. Don't miss it. -m-
0800129806|2.0|because here is another clunker. Richard Gere is just awful as Lancelot. You know, the legendary Lancelot is a NOBLEMAN, not a street performer. He is FRENCH, not...well...American like Gere. These legends have stood the test of time because they are good, just as they are. They don't need to be updated--you ruin what they're all supposed to be about that way. I like Sean Connery, but isn't he a little long in the tooth to play Arthur? He might be a better age for Merlin. Nope, this is not my kind of Camelot.

B000002UB6|4.0|Though it was not the last album recorded by the Beatles, &quot;Let It Be&quot; was their final release.  It is seen by most listeners as the group's swan song as a result.  This is actually an interesting and quirky mix of songs, ranging from &quot;One After 909,&quot; a skiffle number written by Lennon and McCartney as teenagers, to Phil Spector's lush production of &quot;The Long and Winding Road.&quot;  George Harrison's 12-bar blues piece, &quot;For You Blue,&quot; is a true highlight of the album.<br />One of the disappointing aspects of this album, actually, is Spector's heavy hand with so much of the music.  George Martin's lighter touch as a producer would have been welcome here.  At any rate, the title track has become a rock classic, as has the closing piece, &quot;Get Back.&quot;<br />As an aside, in the mid-80's Paul McCartney picked up his trademark Hofner violin bass for a video session.  He hadn't used it in years, and was surprised to discover the session list from the Abbey Road &quot;rooftop&quot; concert still taped to the back.  The version of &quot;Get Back&quot; featured on &quot;Let It Be&quot; was recorded at that session, and includes some of the little side comments made by the band.
6305736650|5.0|One of the most famous movies of all time, and one of the best, Casablanca is set during WWII, in neutral Morocco. Its action centers around Rick, a no-nonsense nightclub manager who was once attracted to Ilsa. When she reenters his life and requests his help, he must confront his &quot;I stick out my neck for nobody&quot; mentality and step up. Many famous phrases and scenes abound, this movie is written perfectly, its pacing, plot and humor (yes) should serve as an example to aspiring screenwriters. There should be a copy in every household, its effects on popular culture are far-reaching and long-lasting, and it is an unforgettable lesson on morals and self-discovery. If you haven't seen this part of America's cultural lexicon, rent or buy it today.
0684833395|5.0|As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I fondly recall reading Joseph Heller's CATCH-22 during high school.  Yossarian, the wise yet trapped bombardier, spoke eloquently about the insanity of war to a generation who grew up watching news reports from the jungles of Vietnam.  I was recently shocked to discover youths still read this novel as a rite of passage.  My son, a college freshman, has spent the summer reading and discussing CATCH-22 with his girlfriend.  As I've listened to their takes on this book, I realized that Heller's masterpiece was not merely a period piece.  It remains a solid work that still speaks to the youth of today as it did too many decades ago.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I dont know what all the other reviewers are talking about...this movie is one of the best of all time. Sure the plot is a little unbelivable at times but the over all movie is a great one.
B00004R99J|5.0|&quot;Pocahontas&quot; was not exactly what I expected from Disney.  (For one thing, the princess doesn't wind up with the &quot;prince&quot; -- a little closer to Pocahontas' real life story).  That said ... the music, animation, and so on are all outstanding.  One of the real surprises in this film is Mel Gibson's talent as a voice actor and *singer* - he's extremely good.  Gibson describes himself as a &quot;shower-only singer,&quot; and I think that is a real misnomer.<br />Pocahontas has her amusing animal friends, Flit (the humming bird) and a truly humorous little raccoon whose name escapes me at the moment.  It is because of her friendship with these animals that she works so hard to convince John Smith (Gibson) of the importance of living in harmony with the land.<br />I think the film carries a couple of good messages, along with its high entertainment value.  The first is, of course, to live in harmony with the land.  The second is that &quot;savage&quot; is often defined by which side of the line you happen to stand on - people often see those who are different as &quot;wrong.&quot;  &quot;Pocahontas&quot; goes a long way toward teaching young people the importance of shedding that viewpoint.
0767821769|5.0|My mother and I watched this together on a Saturday night.  We ended up sobbing by the end of this movie.  It was very realistic.  This movie potrays the family as they handle Jackie being diagnosed with cancer and the workings of a new family so well.  You could relate to the part of Isabel as the girlfriend and new stepmom with two kids who dislike you immensely, no matter how hard you tried, and always compared you to their mother.  And she also showed how difficult it is for the new wife to have two step-kids who will always hold their mother on the highest pedstal of love and perfection.  Susan Sarandon gave a beautiful and emotional performance.  She played Jackie, the mother.  My mother and I could relate to how she felt about having her part as Mother and Sole Protector of her children usurped by this younger, beautiful, working girl.  The young actors playing Ben and Anna gave a perfect performance as well.  The actor playing Ben portrayed his part as young, happy-go-lucky kid, who will always love his mother, so well.  The part where he said to his mother, &quot;Mom, if you want me to hate her, I will.&quot; was so heart-wrenching.  It showed his love for his mother.  Anna played the part of the pre-teen who was going to go through her life withouth her mother so well.  The conversations near the end with Ben and Anna with Jackie brought on sobs.  Ed Harris also gave a good performance as the husband who tried to make the marriage work, but couldn't and now realizes, his first wife is dying.  This movie deserves an oscar, five stars, and a box of tissues.  I suggest you watch it with someone you really care about, a parent, aunt, grandparent, etc.  We tried watching it with Dad, but he didn't get it.  He made comments about the beautiful leaves in the fall scenes, and than left until the movie was over and came back again when we put in a Jackie Chan movie.  But this movie is a must see.  For the first time watching it, make sure you watch it with someoneyou really care about, it's worth it.

B000058T5E|5.0|After the success of his &quot;comeback&quot; CD &quot;Who Else!&quot;, Jeff Beck uses modern technology and drum loops to create new music and sounds that are a huge departure from albums such as &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot;. Now if you were a huge fan in the 70's and 80's, some might find this CD as a &quot;disgrace&quot; to early stuff. But if you listen to what he is playing, he is on top of his game by a long shot. The only dissapointment is that it is 35 minutes long. Short, but great. I suggest this CD to anyone who is ready to hear something completely different and who wants to hear a guitar legend in top form.
B000002LKF|5.0|This is one of those all too rare albums that can be listened to straight through without fast forwarding, in fact, it sounds as fresh today as the day I bought it, many years ago.  There is not one bad song on this album.  Simply put this in your player and let the music take you to another place.  As cliched as that sounds, that is exactly what it does for me.
B00005ABX0|5.0|Even if you aren't interested in the Beach Boys or weird stuff or R&amp;B type stuff, get this disc.  FIve stars means that even if you shouldn't like these albums, you probably will if you give them a listen.  Smiley-Smile is a brilliant album with some of the greatest vocals ever recorded (that I know of).  Wild Honey is great, rocking album that sounds not at all dated, has some of the Beach Boys' best lyrics, and very inventive and pleasing melodies, bass lines, harmonies, and all the rest.  I've gotten several people who were inclined not to like the Beach Boys to love them with this CD.  Truly excellent.
B000003TA4|5.0|This CD was Nirvana's 2nd album, But it was what they thought as a sorry album. Nevermind Ended up being their best selling album. The whole Cd is great but the best song on it to the fans was the one the band hated the most(Smells Like Teen Spirit). All though the band Belived the album s..... It ended up be what the band needed to brake over to mainstream music and help start the grunge movment of the early 90's. Despite Kurts death in 94 Nirvana made a huge inflounce on rock and teens of the world. So even if u hate rock this is the one album u really need to get.

B000002UV9|4.0|i love a band that has at least one song in the positive vein and BEST I CAN is a song to cure a bad mood or day.  to me this album was a good follow up to OPERATION MINDCRIME. there a alot of killer tunes here. ANOTHER RAINY NIGHT, EMPIRE, ANYBODY LISTENING &amp; EMPIRE. this album is catchy,rocking and awesome.  QUEENSRYCHE were a great band that had great musicians and still managed to avoid overplaying.  some bands in the same boat as QR are good but the overplaying kills the mood and QR avoid that.  Geoff Tate has a magic voice &amp; Chris De Garmo is an astounding guitar player who is wonderfully complented by Michael Wilton as a second guitar player and Eddie Jackson on bass.  And who can forget the simple yet complex talent of drummer Scott rockenfield.       Empire is a great album and a worthy purchase.
B000001FA4|5.0|Probably the best band of the 80's and early 90's U2 have made a lot of great album. The Unforgettable Fire, passed almost unnoticed betweeen the amazing live set &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; and the popular breaktrough album &quot;Josuah Tree&quot; and it's a shame. To start with, I have never heard in any other U2 album (or any other band for that matter) such a perfect mix of guitar and keyboards. This perfect compromise resulting in such a unique sound on all the album might be due to the addition of producer Brian Eno &amp; Daniel Lanois to the U2 team. The production itself is magnificient and for those who enjoyed more techno &amp; alternative U2 album's like Achtung Baby, it all started here. The lyrics are also of a superior making. Bono had started his obscession on america and it's philosophy, but unlike the Josuah Tree and Rattle and Hum were the lyrics could sometimes sound pretentious or sanctimonious in Unforgettable Fire the lyrics are just strangely distant and beautiful, almost like poetry. This along with the almost hypnothic interplay between guitar and keyboards supported by great bass lines and impeccable drumming makes for a very relaxing, yet addictive record that encourages the listener to reflect on the various themes aborded by Bono (Such important themes as the bombing of Hiroshima, the life and death of Martin Luther King and the concept of entertainment and fame in America.) In conclusion unforgettable fire might lack the commercial appeal of the Josuah Tree, the in your face rock punch of War or Under a Blood Red Sky or the alternative coolness of Achtung Baby but it stand alone lyrically and musically as a perfect cocktail of all these elements that made U2 such a great band and in the end might be their real masterpiece.

0780020685|5.0|i cannot believe that some people write reviews of films and know nothing about the film they watched, or the film they compared it to. just check out the worst reviews for this film posted on Amazon, some half wit with no imagination, sense or intelligence actually thinks this is a frame by frame REMAKE of the magnificent seven....................... god help us all. Further it is not Gladiator with limbs flying etc. it is a piece about character, it is about what makes a man, that man. It is about prejudice and fear. It is not a slasher film nor a action packed romp. Watch it and learn how a film should be made, and how characterisation is the most important aspect of filmaking. If only all would be directors took the time to build films with character depth, then we would all be getting value for money. This film is a classic, if you dont think so then carry on watching Barney or Chuck Norris or whatever souless crap you do watch.

B000056K04|4.0|What do I like about this album? A lot. What do I dislike? The same things I like. I think that the guys needed to make this record. They needed a change in musical direction. I should start by talking about the album they decided to shelf. After listening to the now-famous &quot;Lillywhite Sessions&quot;, I can see why they didn't release them. The songs are great, the lyrics are right from the heart. Some of Dave's best music and lyrics, but it is dark. I have to say that these songs are better than on &quot;Everyday&quot;, and I still hope to see them someday, but I can see that the musical direction was not wavering much from their previous three albums. It felt like they were going backwards--back to the &quot;Under the Table...&quot; days, which I suppose was the point. But, they needed to evolve more, and so &quot;Everyday&quot; was born.<br />I like the new sound. I like the format they put the songs in--a very pop record, with the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus format. The sound is definitely changing. They needed to tighten up their music a bit, they needed a bit more discipline, which I felt they were losing when they recorded the unreleased records (although what we hear does still have lots of threads to be hidden before the garment is sold). I think Ballard brought some new ideas to the way they play their music and the amount of energy they could get out of the instruments. <br />What's missing? Their natural rawness that makes them a different band from every other on the market. With Lillywhite, they could create a lot of magic in their jams. I know they can do that on stage, but I think Ballard is a little too economical in his producing. It's not a terrible thing for a song to go over five minutes. (Actually, I'd prefer it.) He needs to let go of a couple things. He doesn't need to be a guest musician on the album. He needs to give the boys a little more room to have fun. The solos that they scraped are still an ok thing on a studio record, just don't let them go on as long as they would in a live show. A lot of great bands made their mark by doing jam albums, by playing around and seeing what happens. Discipline is ok, not overkill. Second, Glen does not need to sit with Dave and co-write all the songs. He's looking for a little too much attention. Also, Carter (the drummer) mentioned that they're being treated as &quot;professionals&quot; because they're given charts to work with. Sorry, but some of the greatest bands made records without being given charts, some with members who can't even read music.<br />So, in a nut-shell, I'm saying I love the album. They needed to change directions. They needed to experiment. I'd like to see Ballard to another record with them. But, I don't want to see another &quot;Everyday&quot;. It's a fun album--great to drive to--but I don't want to see another all-pop/rock album. More of their deep musical textures need to come back in the future. I like the discipline, but I don't need it given to me in a designer suit.

B00003CXXJ|2.0|While most people seem to like this movie, I found it to be much of a dud for myself.  The movie starts out great with many funny moments.  However, after the princess is saved, the movie just seems to drag.  Then comes the movie's moral: &quot;don't judge by appearances.&quot;  It's nice and all, but it seemed to get shoved at you during every turn.  This is a movie I would show kids, but for adults it could go either way (love/hate).  The animation and acting was great; the story needed help.

B0000029DD|5.0|I remember when I first heard the song &quot;Grace&quot;. I was sitting in traffic and I was amazed at how it kept building layer upon musical layer until it nearly overwhelmed you.<br />I had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with Jeff in London. Afterwards I saw him perform &quot;Grace&quot; live. It was amazing. I remember being completely mesmerised. Everything else faded away and I could just see his face and hear the music. I thought at the time. Everyone who sees this guy perform will fall in love with him. He was like an angel.<br />I first listened to the full CD sitting in a darkened Cathedral and I was blown away. His music was a religious experience for me.<br />Buy this CD. It will be a treasured purchase.

B00000IMYA|5.0|IÕve only recently gotten interested in jazz, and I donÕt know much about it, but IÕve been listening to this album since January, and IÕm absolutely passionate about it. ItÕs one of my favorite albums of all time. It started when I heard a little bit of Diminuendo in Blue and Crescendo in Blue on Ken Burns Jazz program. Intrigued, I downloaded the whole song, and when I heard it, I just sat, mesmerized, in front of the computer. Even with my computerÕs crummy sound, it was one of the most soaring, amazing piece of music IÕd ever heard. I ran out to buy the album the next day, figuring that, first, I needed to hear it on a decent sound system, and second, any album that had music this glorious on it probably had a lot more to offer. It did. IÕd heard studio versions of a lot of the songs, and liked them, but the live versions here are much better. &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot; is especially  good. I listen to it over and over.<br />If, like me, youÕre interested in jazz, but donÕt know a lot about it, start with this album. I canÕt imagine anyone who likes music Ð ANY kind of music Ð not being able to appreciate this one. It just hits you right in the heart.
B00005B4GU|5.0|So, you're still waiting for Ok Computer 2.  Well, it's not gonna happen.  Though recorded at the same time of last year's Kid A, Amnesiac is very much its own.  Many were put off by the more experimental elements of Kid A and those who quickly ababdoned the 2000 release in hopes of a more traditinal rock album this time around will probably find themselves doing the same.  But they shouldn't.  Both discs are more than worthy of celebration.  Radiohead continues to evolve and those who join them for the ride won't be disapointed.  I agree that Kid A was a departure and not as rock anthem driven as 1997's Ok Computer.  But that shouldn't detract from Radiohead's last two releases.  With songs like &quot;You and Who's Army&quot;, &quot;Knives Out&quot; and &quot;I Might Be Wrong&quot;, all on Amnesiac, the band is clearly not steering away from the melodic.  Even the more experimental tracks aren't as obscure as some reviewers might have you believe.  In fact you can completely disregard a rather obtuse review of Amnesiac in Entertainment Weekly.  Regardless of reviews and first opinions, is music that challenges it's listener, music that can't be easily digested within the first listen a bad thing?  I think not.  Trust me.  A few listens to Kid A and Amnesiac and you'll see that all negative reviews of these brilliant discs are merely surface glances at a band that deserves more.
B000002GHH|5.0|I first bought this tape because I heard it in a record store as Bring the Family was released.  When I grew up an moved to CD's this was one of the first recordings in my budding collection.  It is one of the rare recordings that follows me throughout the many stages and phases of my life.  It is a well balanced recording that defies simple classification.  It is both country and blues with rock and roll sprinkled in like a perfect touch of Tabasco.  If you are not familiar with John Hiatt or the other musicaians on the recording, take a risk and pick this one up.  I highly recommend it.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Here's where it all started. Yes, there was the previous debut disc, but Like A Virgin was the song and album that kicked off the craze. This album spawned two trademark hits (Like A Virgin-#1 and Material Girl-#2) as well as two top five singles (Angel, Dress You Up). But it also set the tone of what was to come. All of Madonna's albums including her most recent have been patchworks, inspired collections of pop confections built around a few hit singles. Though 1992's Erotica was a somewhat \\"conceptual\\" piece, the rest have followed Like a Virgin's eclectic poses. And there's no better time to own this disc. Warner Bros. has done a wonfderful job re-mastering this milestone recording and threw on two bonus tracks as well. Dance remixes of the title track and Material Girl appear as extras. Sadly Madonna herself has distanced herself from this material, claiming she never wants to sing \\"Like A Virgin\\" again. That's too bad. A blonde should never forget her roots.
630438551X|4.0|This movie was wonderful. What made it wonderful was the bold approach that director Baz Lurhman tackled it from. Does anyone out there think that turning a classic Shakesphearean romance into a modern day pic about teen angst and rebelliousness is easy? Is it equally as easy to try and maintain the beauty and elegance that is Shakespeare while at the same time trying to capture all aspects and diversities of youth? Hmmmm.... didn't think so. Please do the world a favor. Don't hate! Appreciate! Appreciate this mans' talent and gift for creating never before devised insights. Am I wrong when I say that we are a world weary of imitators and constantly salivating for something new to nibble on?
B00004XQ83|4.0|I too have encountered problems, including pops and other strange noises, when playing this CD on my computer. However, this is still a great CD and I recommend it for those who will not be playing the CD on their computers.<br />...
B00000I78Y|5.0|Among all the sleazy MTV rock'n'roll wannabes, SOAD is simply a breath of fresh air... Listen to their music several times, and each time you will notice something new. The debut album is fantastic, I cannot wait until the next one comes out. The preview tracks like &quot;Chop Suey&quot;, &quot;Arto&quot; and &quot;Innervision&quot; are very promising so far.
B00005B36H|5.0|I had never heard of Tool until the 28th of June 2001.  That night I was in for a ride of a lifetime, it was the first night of Roskilde festival in Denmark (Im from iceland myself) and I had already gone to see Deftones and Placebo, and since Deftones is one of my many favorite bands I thought my evening had peaked at their concert.  Boy was I wrong!  I cant even tell you how long the show was or what songs they played, but it was amazing, I sort of fell into a tranze and I still havent snapped out of it 6 weeks later.  Right after the Roskilde festival was over the first thing I did was to buy Lateralus, this CD and I have been hooked on it since, its not like your &quot;normal&quot; alternative rock, its very melodic and dark and there is really no song on the album that stands out, it is just one big &quot;whole&quot; album, I cant listen to it song by song.  Well you will know what you mean when you listen to it myself, but I just cant get this CD out of my stereo system at home.  Anyway I am going to go soon and buy some of their older stuff, my friends all recomend Aenima so I think Ill try that one next, but to all of you out there who cant get any sleep out there, you should get this CD.  Not because it will put you to sleep, but because it is perfect to listen to when you are all alone in bed in the dark and you can really just drift into the songs and the music just takes you away...  Enjoy!
B00003CWOL|5.0|I am a little bit anti-christ, I find this movie highly entertaining not because it makes fun of Catholism (anyway if anyone is open-minded, this movie is never offensive in anyway), but because it creates a lot of thinking for us : what if we have  the 13 apostle, what if the god is a woman, what if..... This is Kevin at his best, I can't wait to see his new movie in this summer.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Gracious, where do I begin? This is a truly awesome CD. I find myself listening to it almost constantly, it's that good. Contrary to some, I feel that there's a special something, a feeling that you pick up on in this live compilation and that it's not just a &quot;greatest hits with screaming crowds in the background.&quot; Now, I've never seen Sarah in concert, but after listening to this, I literally ache to attend one! &quot;Ice Cream&quot; &quot;Sweet Surrender&quot; and &quot;Building a Mystery&quot; sound SO GREAT on this album, and are probably my three favorite tracks here. There's so much depth and emotion in Sarah's voice, especially in &quot;Angel&quot; that will just blow you away. I was surprised to not see &quot;Elsewhere&quot; included, but that's such a minor thing and doesn't really change my feelings on this collection. I would definitely recommend this to someone as a first Sarah McLachlan buy, followed up by Fumbling Towards Ecstacy and Surfacing right after that. If you're an avid Sarah fan, or someone who's just looking for phenomenal music, get your hands on this CD as fast as you possbily can! You won't be disappointed!!
B00003CXE6|4.0|Good story. I admire the way the ending was handled.  It could have ruined the entire film for me, but instead it was beautifully portrayed.  I was awed by Crowe's character's fighting skills.  I especially liked that last fight.  I'm a big fan of action and horror flicks but I found the violence in this film to be especially graphic.  Some may find that realism to be a plus.  Parents might not want their younger kids to see this film.  I must say that the costumes and the scenery in this film were a definite plus.  They did a very good job of recreating the Colliseum.  It all looked so real.
B000000I0K|5.0|This album is simply exceptional.  You get a hearty dose of a musical genius's compositional skills and vocabulary, but you don't come away feeling as though you were &quot;taken to school&quot;; the music is very accessible.  Oldfield veers from the &quot;long piece&quot; album format which was the hallmark of his earliest work - the longest song on QE2 is only ten or so minutes long - but the album is cohesive and conveys a rather concise musical theme.<br />With QE2 you have some of Mike's distinguishing trademarks.  For example, the first piece, Taurus, is at times alternately mean and nice, a dichotomy evident in some of his other work.  Taurus also contains some very adroit key changes which allow for contrasting degrees of musical brightness.  The title track is perhaps the album's best; in fact, Mike shows daring here in dueling synthetic bagpipes against an electric guitar for a very engaging effect.  Mike also uses Celtic-based melodies throughout the album as he has done during various stages of his career.<br />Has any single composer born anytime after 1950 composed more aesthetically satisfying melody lines than Mike Oldfield?  And has any put them to work more effectively in his music?  I honestly suspect not.  Just listen to the one melody near the end of Taurus which he predicates the title track upon and take note of the heights he reaches.  The melody is strong, to be sure, but Mike is able to do so much with it.  (You don't have to listen too carefully to appreciate the difference between what he does with it on Taurus and what he does with it on the title track!)  Very few composers can essentially stay with a theme for a long time and continue to add interest through subtle changes and well-conceived developmental tactics, but Mike is one of the very few who can not only get away with it, but make the approach one of his greatest compositional assets.<br />This is one of Mike's best; it comes highly endorsed.
B000002UVZ|5.0|One of their finest albums due to the boldness of its theme, the quality of its songwriting, and its marvelous production, REM's LIFES RICH PAGEANT is a must for fans of the seminal rock group.<br />LIFES RICH PAGEANT is centered around the idea of social progress and a revolution to start the country anew. Songs emphazie that America is founded on the genocide of the Native Americans and corrupt political institutions. The album's first track &quot;Begin the Begin&quot; starts off with the words &quot;The insurgency began...I looked for it and I found it&quot; and ends with &quot;An apology begins the begin.&quot; Following is &quot;These Days,&quot; where Michael Stipe expresses his idealism saying &quot;We are young despite the years, we are concerned, we are hope despite the times.&quot; The third track, &quot;Fall on Me&quot; revolves around the stupid, stupid policies of Reagan's star wars program. Other tracks which tie in the albums theme are &quot;The Flowers of Guatemala,&quot; which relates to the CIA's meddling in Central America in the 1980s, and &quot;Swan Swan H,&quot; a haunting rambling on the Civil War.<br />The fourth track, &quot;Cuyahoga,&quot; is the most outspoken and eloquent expression of the album's message. The name of a polluted river in Ohio where, in purer days Indians lived and flourished, Cuyahoga is used as a metaphor for the wayward country of America that started off better. &quot;Let's put our heads together, and start a new country up&quot; speaks of the need for revolution and a new beginning. &quot;This land is the land of ours, this river runs red over it&quot; expresses the pain of the displaced and dispossessed who have been betrayed by the institions of America.<br />This being one of REM's early albums, there is still a place for playful idiosyncracy. &quot;Underneath the Bunker&quot; is fairly odd, and the albums sleeve lists the tracks in a mixed up order, even leaving several off.<br />This album is brilliant because it so effectively communicates and inspires. REM's political songs on DOCUMENT and GREEN may have sounded fairly awkward, but here they are spot-on. Its sentiments are as revelant now as they were when the album was released in 1986. And with the excellent musicianship, it's a must-have REM released.so effectively communicates and inspires.

078401213X|1.0|Plain and simple, this movie is really bad.  I don't know how people can praise such a piece of garbage.  The movie is awful and the ending is worse.  Requiem for a Dream is one of my favorite movies, and I don't know how Darren Aronofsky can be capable of such a bad movie.
0375707972|3.0|...I found myself getting very impatient with this novel even though it did offer an interesting glimpse into post wwII German attitudes through the eyes of a rather boring middle class character.
0060922583|5.0|This book is easily one of my favorites.  Not only is it extremely well-documented, but very carefully and insightfully arranged.  In my opinion, it leaves little wiggling room for the die-hard skeptics, and I appreciate that.  Anyone who has always loved fictional accounts of unexplained events will adore this book because of the heavy experimental support that Talbot gives for his conclusions.  It reminds us that we don't know everything.  Not even close.
B00000JCOV|1.0|I got this CD because everyone just loved them. I listened to like 6 songs, and was so damn bored i had to turn it off. Its all just a bunch of noise with a guy who cant sing. I had to sit through their hour long set at ozzfest and it only made me annoyesd and gave me a headache. <br />What an overhyped thrash. They suck.
B00005LKHW|2.0|I was very disappointed with the Ultimate edition.<br />The picture quality was not very good. It seems to me that Universal were just trying to put too much on one disc, or got very sloppy with the transfer.<br />Peoples skin has the wierd plasma effect that falls just short of the  bad Mpeg encoding of early discs.<br />Shame really, as with a DTS soundtrack, one would want crisp sound &amp; crisp piccy.<br />But, film very good.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|I absolutely fell in love with this movie, with all its visual cacophony and achingly beautiful music. I bought the soundtrack expecting what I had heard in the movie... and didn't find it.<br />The soundtrack is mostly composed of big name artists who contributed a two-second sound clip here and there, not the music that the show was made up of. Perhaps if I hadn't been expecting the showtunes I would have enjoyed it more, but as it was I felt cheated.<br />The numbers sung in the movie are the only songs on the CD I listen to apart from Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Complainte de la Butte&quot;. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor did not disappoint me, and before people accuse me of not having any base of comparison, let me say that I am a big fan of musical theatre and have *many* showtune soundtracks. Kidman and McGregor both have very pleasant voices and more importantly, they both sing with passion. I was disappointed that their final duet was cut and &quot;Come What May&quot; was a stunted version of what had been in the movie.<br />On the other hand &quot;Roxanne&quot; is an excellent addition, a haunting rendition of the original song by The Police, and if you know what is going on in the movie at that point it will give you chills. I've heard that Baz Luhrmann tends to make a second soundtrack for his movies. I hope he does, because this one is just incomplete.
0380817683|5.0|This novel was the first book I've ever read by Marian Keyes, recommended by Amazon, and I have to say I'm now hooked.  I have gone on to read her other writings, but this, Rachel's holiday, was foremost the best and so far my favorite.  Bridget Jones' Diary was cute, lighthearted and funny, but Ms Keyes puts more meaning and emotionalism behind her novels than Helen Fielding.<br />I loved this novel because even though I've never done drugs and am not an alcoholic, I have felt the same sentiments that Rachel has and gone through similar experiences.  I'm grateful to Ms Keyes for writing about it in a positive manner.  Can't wait to read the next book, Last Chance Saloon.
B000002LTU|2.0|Perhaps Miles owed his dealer, or he was just plain bored, but this is an underwhelming foray into hip hop by a legend.  It's not Miles so much as his collaborators, actually.  The rapping is awful, and while this is from 1992, it sounds even more dated.  Easy Mo Bee is not very impressive, period, and it's a rather ignominious note for Davis to go out on, though I believe he croaked while making it, so there's somewhat of an excuse.  The best track is the opener, Mystery, which is reprised in the finale.  It does sound rather generic now, but it's the high point on a forgettable chapter (his last) from the master himself.
0452281881|4.0|I read this book in one evening.  It made me laugh, which is about the highest praise i can give any book.  So when you're in the mood for something that is very entertaining to lift your mood, i highly recomment this book.
0060930349|4.0|Excellent review for high school and college level. A great book to come back for. Definately a keeper on the shelf.

B00005AKOM|5.0|HALFORD'S VOCALS DON'T MISS A BEAT SINCE THE PAINKILLER ERA, IN FACT HE HITS SOME HIGHER NOTES. PRIEST CLASSICS 'ELECTRIC EYE' 'STAINED CLASS' 'BREAKING THE LAW' 'JAWBREAKER' 'BEYOND THE REALMS OF DEATH' 'METAL GODS' ARE COVERED IN ALL OF THEIR GLORY. 'THE ONE I LOVE TO HATE' W/BRUCE ALONE IS WORTH THE PRICE! MOST OF THE SONGS ARE GREAT, SOME BETTER THAN THE OTHERS. THE OPENING TRACK IS AWESOME! SLOW DOWN IS A GRIPPER! Weak moments are a sidekick vocals by a death metal growler, does not complement Rob's soaring vocals whatsoever and some tracks towards the end of the second cd. There's a lot of metal to choose from so a metalhead will not be disappointed.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|The soundtrack to this summer's hit movie, &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;, is a CD that I never let out of my sight.  All of the songs on the CD made the movie what it is.  My favorite songs are the few sung by Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman, who both have extrodinary voices.  &quot;Lady Marmalade&quot; -- sung by Christina, Pink, Lil' Kim, and Mya -- is one in a million.  You do not hear a song like that on the soundtrack of every movie.  At all costs, listen to this CD.  A favorite of mine, it could soon  be on of yours.
6302293553|5.0|This movie is the craziest thing I have ever seen in my life and I absolutly LOVED it! Knights, monsters and unladen swallows what else can you ask for? Mind you this movie is for only those who have a weird sence of humor and not for anybody who is looking for a historical documentary of King Arthur. If the movie is in the comedy section of Blockbuster I'm guessing that isn't HISTORICLY ACCURATE!!!
B00003CXP1|4.0|&quot;Requiem for a dream&quot; is the most disturbing film I've seen recently. It tells two parallel stories very well connected. The first is about sarah goldfarb, a widowed mother who lives by herself and is very lonely. One day she gets a call from a tv show and decides to start a straight diet to get a better looking on TV. A doctor prescribes her some pills, which were supposed to feed her, but everything starts to change when diet becomes an obsession. The second story happens with sarah's son, Harry, who is a drug addicted, and spends all day long taking all kinds of stuff, with his girlfriend and his best friend.<br />This movie is very good and shows how much damage drugs can do. It's almost a lesson to be learned, a story with a moral at the end. The casting is wonderful. Ellen Burstyn is amazingly real playing sarah in one of her best performances ever. Jared Leto is also great playing the good young guy who has good intentions but is sick, addicted. Jennifer Connely is bright as always. She is very beautiful and I think this part had to be played by her.<br />After you watch this movie, you'll really feel lonely and depressed. It's like a punch in your stomach! It is very sad to see how far someone can go to keep its addiction. The main characters are young, intelligent and surely had a great future ahead of them, if they didn't get addicted. <br />I liked the edition, with fast images, and zoom in the character's eyes.Darren Aronofsky made a great film, which I will never forget. I think no one has shown drug addiction in such a realistic and painfull point of view, and he surely deserves all the credit for doing that.
0345423496|4.0|Well having never written a book review, figured it was time. Having enjoyed 2001 and 2010, I figured it was time to find out the ending to the great epic.  Arthur retains his vision for the future in a much more reserved fashion then previously.  I found some parts tend to drag, the visualization was great, but a little overboard at times.  Too many references to recent current events and pop culture seemed to pull you away from the solitude of space that was very much present in the first two novels making the story seem less immortal.  I found the idea of freezing Poole for one thousand years and thawing him out to be great, however I had a hard time believing it was really the same quiet, reserved, Poole we met in 2001.  Besides those few things this is a great book, it has interesting dialogue, questions human existance, gives great visualization, and takes you into a whole new world only one man could envision.  I cannot wait to see how much Hollywood messes this one up when they make it a movie.
B00000JG4N|5.0|This album of course marked the commercial peak of Motley Crue.  In some bands' cases, that often means it is not quite their best work.  (For example, while Def Leppard's &quot;Hysteria&quot; was a wonderful album and a huge commercial success, the still big but slightly less popular predecessor &quot;Pyromania&quot; was better from start to finish in my opinion.)  However, in the case of the mighty Crue, their most popular album is also their best.  This is a hard rock masterpiece.  The title track was a defining, hard-rocking first single from the album which amazingly made the top 10.  &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; is a great fist-pumping rock anthem that to this day is one of my Crue favorites.  Singles like &quot;S.O.S&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away Mad...&quot; are also exceptional.  &quot;Slice of Your Pie&quot; and &quot;She Goes Down&quot; are classic Crue sleaze.  The only track I to this day am not crazy about is the ballad &quot;Without You&quot;.  A big hit in it's time but a very weak song for a rock ballad.  I am a big fan of rock ballads, and the Crue's &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot; is one of my favorite rock ballads ever, but &quot;Without You&quot; just doesn't cut it.  &quot;Time For Change&quot;, the last track on the original release of this album, is in fact a much better ballad.  Despite the one weak track, this album still rates five stars due to the rest of the songs.  To this day, one of my favorite hard rock albums.
B000002N2P|5.0|I love this CD! It never gets old for me. It's power-punk/pop at it's best. I don't care what anyone says, Green Day hasn't sold out. They're still punk, and everyone knows it. This CD is a steal, all of their CDs are. I've seen Dookie getting sold at some record stores for $...! It's amazing, buy all of their CDs, you won't regret it. Green Day is my favorite band, besided NIN.
B000000OQF|5.0|First of all, I LOVE a lot of the '80's &quot;hair metal&quot; bands.  I still love listening to bands like Bon Jovi, Whitesnake, Def Leppard, and Motley Crue.  Nonetheless, there was something amazing and different about Guns N' Roses when they burst on the scene in 1987.  This album was not your typical &quot;hair metal&quot; album.  It was several steps coarser, ruder, and quite frankly more rocking.  In a nutshell, this album flat out ROCKS from beginning to end.  How on earth did &quot;Welcome To The Jungle&quot; ever make it to the top 10 of the pop charts??  But beyond the three top 10 classics off this album, how about &quot;It's So Easy&quot;, &quot;Night Train&quot;, &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; (which somehow got the work motherf----- onto rock radio), etc., etc., etc.???  There is truly not a dud on this album.  Too bad that this band never came close to anything like this with later efforts.  Besides this entire album, the only songs I'd care to own by this band are the songs &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;.  But for sure this one debut album assures this band their place in history.  One of the defining hard rock albums of a generation.
B00005ATZT|5.0|They did a good job of putting this together, considering the movie is 8 years old.  Lots of technical and creative process covered and the commentary track was interesting to listen to as well.  I was very surprised at how much the actor's themselves contributed to the making of this movie and is a real tribute to their skill.
B000005Z0E|4.0|This is the first album from the late, great 2Pac Shakur. Recorded in 91', it was released when Pac was only 20. Though not his best album, its very underrated, and Pac had already shown on this album he was a gonna be a major force in the hip hop world, before he became the greatest rapper ever. This album sounds like a mixture of Public Enemy and NWA. The songs are very political, and almost all them contain some message or another. On &quot;Brendas Got A Baby&quot;, Pac demonstrates his story-telling skills to perfection and makes Slick Rick look like an beginner. Its one of his most deep songs today even, about teenage pregnancy. &quot;Souljaz Story&quot; is another great story telling track. However, songs like &quot;Words Of Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot;, and one of the best Pac songs ever, &quot;Part Time Mutha&quot;, showcase Pac's social conscience at its best. This is a very underrated album. Definatly a must have for all Pac fans. RIP Pac

B00003CXSP|3.0|I am such a fan of Thomas J Harris that I would watch a movie based on his books sight unseen, along with reading anything that he has written - which I have.<br />I was taken back by this film (and the book) because it was so shockingly different than the first one. The first one centered around Clarice (Jodie Foster) and her interactions with the Doctor. This installment was completely focused on the Doctor himself, so I hoped for his interesting qualities to be explored deeper than in the first assignment.<br />What intrigued me so much with the first film was Dr. Hannibal \\"The Cannibal\\" Lecter. In this film, I can say I have had my fill.<br />I've always thought that what set Dr. Hannibal apart from other fictional serial killers is that he was such an amazing genius, formally trained in psychology and able to use those obtained skills in his crimes.<br />The way that he could realistically break down a person's history/background based on a few mannerisms and introspective questions. His power was not how gruesome he could be, but how smart he could be.<br />In this film, we pass up the genius as if we are supposed to take it for granted and we focus on the gore.<br />He's called the cannibal....<br />In the last film he talked a man into \\"swallowing his own toungue\\" and killing himself. In this film he never really did anything that was amazing in it's own right, it had to be gruesome to be remarkable and that is where this film fell flat.<br />The history of horror films is filled with really weird people that like to kill. Lecter was so much better than that, his real power was something that no one could take away from him because it was his intellect and understanding of the human psyche.<br />In this film we are faced with Lecter indulging his weirdness without any brilliance.<br />Let's put it this way - I have never enjoyed a horror movie that people laugh at, and parts of this movie felt like a parody.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|The modern music scene is by practicly every standard awful. The artists that are \\"lucky\\" enough to get on the radio stations are either classics like Led Zepplin, Beatles, etc., more modern classics like Nirvana, the newest from any pop group, or the stereotypical 3 chord \\"alternative\\" hit. Even the underground scene is decaying with \\"punk\\" bands like NOFX and Lagwagon straying further from the original vision of punk into basically sped up alternative music, and pointless at that. Even so called \\"political bands\\" are either hypocrites or dont have a pointed enough message to make their music effective.  With all this decay going on its hard to imagine a time when music was fresh and inventive, but for me I need only listen to \\"London Calling\\". Its hard to put all of the album's attributes into words, for when you first listen to it you will not pick up on all of its assets. But repeated listenings will show the layering of smart suble, socailly and politically conciouss lyrics, huge musical variety from punk, rockabilly, ska, reggae, jazz, and great execution. \\"London Calling\\" derives a lot of its power from the Clash's personalities themselves. For \\"Guns of Brixton\\" wouldnt have exisited without Paul Simonon's rebel excapades, \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\" builds on Mick Jones' soft, quiet, but potent personality, and \\"Clampdown\\" features Joe Strummer's angry cries for social change. There is no filler on this album, no skippable tracks, nothing disposable. But it wouldnt do the album justice to describe each of the songs seperately, its an album you must discover on your own, the only thing I can say is that it is, in my opinion, the best rock album ever made.
0316776963|5.0|I picked this book up, not even knowing who David Sedaris was. I saw on the leaflet, that one of the stories was about living in France and the various comical misunderstandings which arise when trying to communicate in a language other than your mother tongue. I'm a Francophile, and it looked like it might be amusing... Well, it may well be the funniest book I've ever read. I was crying, indeed shreiking with laughter as Mr. Sedaris led me deeper and deeper into absurdly hilarious,and yet often very familiar situations. France was only one of his mileiu of varied venues. I cannot remember laughing so hard about anything in a very long time. I quickly purchased another to give to a relative who is going through Chemo, and another for a friend who also needed cheering up, and then I bought another as a gift for a perfectly healthy friend, and so on... To be sure, my own copy is and will remain on my  shelf reserved for cherished books. It will take on the hue and texture of an often read and greatly enjoyed book.  Laughter is indeed a powerful medicine and &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; will make anyone feel giddy to be alive.
B00003CXS4|5.0|This is one of the best films that I have seen in a long time.  My question is &quot;what were the film critics thinking?&quot; I missed this film in the theatres because of the mediocre reviews, but I am thrilled to say that it's absolutely brilliant.  ALL of the characters were a joy to watch,--- great script, great soundtrack, great cast.  BUY IT.  It's a fantastic film to round out any DVD collection.  The price of the DVD is worth the &quot;milk out of the car window&quot; scene alone.  I laughed until my sides hurt.  The fast-paced and unexpected plot twists were delightful.  Guy Ritchie doesn't waste an inch of film....I imagine it was hell to edit,-- but he nailed it perfectly!
B00005LB50|4.0|Buffalo Springfield was a great, great band, and clearly the starting point for a lot of other great music.  Having all this material in one place is just fabulous.<br />Two brief comments related to some of the other reviews - <br />1) Lack of live material is a big loss here; some of it should have been included. 2) The long version of &quot;Bluebird&quot; is not that good; I don't see why everyone is so unhappy it's not here.  The original, short version is far better - it burns from beginning to end.  The long version is Stills trying to be an &quot;artist&quot; - we all know how many wrong turns he's taken in his career when he adopts that pose!
1878424319|3.0|This book was less than I expected. There is good practical advice - like cultivating distance from your own thoughts and other people's words and replacing old ideas with new beliefs.  However, there's really nothing new here, it's more of a common-sense book, and I see little, if anything, that hasn't been taught many times over by other popular authors and most major religions.  <br />If you want a little book filled with truly thought-provoking advice on living a happy life, I highly recommend 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life' by Taro Gold.
0684857219|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. The motivation you will gain from reading this book is worth the price alone, even if you don't follow Arnold's routines. I feel like Arnold is speaking directly to me when I read this book. This book inspired me to become a serious bodybuilder in my spare time.        To the reviewers who complain about the routines in this book causing overtraining, you have a lot more to learn about bodybuilding and how training for it evolved. The fact is people must condition their body to handle more intense training.  If you suddenly go from a zero to two hours a day program then your body will not respond because it is still too weak! The notion today that hitting the muscles three times a week is overtraining is incorrect. Bodybuilders who DIDN'T take steroids to achieve their success (Bill Pearl, winner of several Mr. Universe titles) train 3 days a week. The body will adapt. Also, Arnold stopped using steroids several years ago. He still looks awesome and he obviously is probably training under the same programs he advocates.
B000002A3T|4.0|Not great but it's worth the money.<br />Best moments : the intro to \\"Take it Back\\" and the change of pace in \\"Coming back to life\\" after the vocal intro. \\"The Division Bell\\" is a rare, uplifting Pink Floyd. Though most critics say it is a minor work it is one of my favorite Pink Floyd Albums. Looking for progressive rock here, look on, this is a plainer record, but still with the band's signature sound. If you're new to Pink Floyd, don't start here.I'd suggest you start with \\"The Wall\\" , then the must have \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and by the time you get to \\"Wish you were here\\" you just became a fan. ....***<br />If you liked this album, try Pink Floyd's \\"A momentary lapse of reason\\".
B000001FNL|5.0|It didn't sell as much as &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, but this is the album that showed the BeeGees were the superstars of the 1970's because it is their best work in a different tone.  With the help from R&amp;B genius/ producer Arif Mardin, the album is flawless.  Not only does this album contain the number one hit &quot;Jive Talkin'&quot;, virtually all the other songs are even better.  From the catchy &quot;Wind of Change&quot; which is fantastic, to &quot;Edge of the Universe&quot;, it is obvious the world was being introduced to powerhouse songs from 3 brothers, different from there early work in the 1960's, thanks to Arif Mardin, who seems to always be flawless in all his productions.  He also deserves credit for the best song on the album &quot;Nights on Broadway&quot;, which can go under any category of music, from R&amp;B to Rock to Disco Pop.  Every song on the album shines, which is hard to believe this masterpiece is not the easiest to find, even in small music stores.  Buy it now and I promise you won't complain.  Thanks for reading.
B00004XONN|5.0|You said there is no adventure here on this album, and then right after you said there are also no guitars... That is the adventure... The fact that a band like Radiohead, who released two of the best rock albums of the 90's previously, basically discarded their guitars for something interesting, something new... something adventurous... that's the adventure, and a huge risk as well... And well, if you don't get it, well it's too bad... There is more to music, much much more, then electric guitar, bass, and drums... and Radiohead, bored of the guitar, bass, and drums type of rock wanted to try something new, and like I said, if you don't get it don't disrespect them for doing it, just say &quot;It's not for me&quot; and go back to your hook filled, radio friendly &quot;Alternative&quot; and &quot;Rock&quot; music... I like bands like Pink Floyd and the like, but when I look at the future of music I don't want bands to immitate them and create &quot;The Wall 2&quot; or something like that, I want something new... Radiohead is exploring new frontiers, and while it may not be groundbreaking stuff right now, they are getting to that point... I just get so annoyed with people who scream &quot;Oh no, where's the guitar&quot; and then bash the music because it doesn't sound like what's on the radio...

He also gets his man. The mob is led by Jack Palance who gets Stalone and  Russell framed and thrown in prison. They are greeted in prison by an army of old friends they put there. The story revolves around their escape from prison and clearing their names. It's a good actioner that could have been better but will satisfy most fans of Stalone or Russell.
0897500482|3.0|BRUCE LEE! Yes, this is the famous book that you can see in his biographical movie : &quot;Dragon&quot;. He wrote this book while being forced to stay in his bed having back injuries. Many believe that this book is like a bible from the most famous martial artist ever known. I was as enthusiastic when I first ordered it, nevertheless, I was quickly disappppointed. There is no real descrption of the strickes in it. If you want to learn from this book, you'd better know all the strikes pretty well, before benifiting from it. Furthermore, the writting styl is quite poor... most of it consist of chunk of sentences seperated by lines, there is a lack of consistency and continuity for the reader. This said, it remains that this book is a classic and that anyone having an interest for bruce lee should have it on his shelves.
0517122707|5.0|The world of Ignatius Reily is very erratic but it is easy to identify with him. You are going to hate him at too many places in the story, yet there is something genuine about him. He does the most awful kind of things, but you never know whether he is doing that intentionally, full mindedly, absent mindedly or it just a part of his highly intellectual mideval, semi-selfish almost unemployed negligent  personality.<br />Apart  from Ignatius Reily, there are more characters in the novel that  are very genuine. I believe that genuinity of the  personages  gives a lot of vitality to the story.<br />It is amazing to see that this book was written almost 30 years ago, but it is still very modern and the situation of Ignatius is absolutely not unusual to see at the beginning of the 21st century.<br />If you like to read a book in order to think read this. If you do like to read a book NOT to think you can also read this because readability and having fun with the story are warranted.
