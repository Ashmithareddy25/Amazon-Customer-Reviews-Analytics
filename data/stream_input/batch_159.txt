B0041CDPQO|4|I use this to connect a GPS to a motorcycle and have continuous power to the GPS.  Unit is small enough to fit under the seat of a sportbike without complication (ninja 250 and CBR600)
B000JZKLN2|5|Wow! This is Great! It Fits really well and I hear the racing sound when i drive my car with this cold air intake from K&N. Thanks guys!
B00CFKM30S|5|everybody that sees my keys on it says that is soo cute, omg that looks like something you would get, i went and got my letter put on it but super cheap and would get another one in a heart beat.
B00068YB88|5|Great fit, great quality.
B00ANBMRMK|5|Quick back story- I just bought a new 2014 town and country after my three children basically DESTROYED the interior of my 2012. They spilled a milkshake that ended up molding (thought I got it up, I swear) and even a $200 detailing could not restore the carpet satisfactorily. I was determined to take much better care of the new van. I was skeptical about spending so much, having never used WeatherTech before- but I am absolutely thrilled with my mats. They arrived on time, and were incredibly easy to install. They fit like a glove. They could literally pass for being OEM custom made mats for the vehicle. They are thick (in the best way), clearly high quality. They do not leave gaps or areas of exposure on my floor. I never used the stow and go floor compartments before, they were just traps for food and icky gunk. These mats do cover the entire rear/second row flooring, so if I wanted to use the floor storage it may be an issue- but for me personally- the full coverage is a huge plus. I intend to leave these mats in place at all times. I purchased the cargo mat separately- and it also looks fantastic. I will NOT have another vehicle without installing WeatherTech mats from day one. Probably the best investment I could have made in my new car.
B0017KJ0EO|3|The hitch pin holes did not line up had to expand the hole but over all good product
B00N35UZMM|5|good product, good costumer service, it looks amazing thanks.
B00029XI2G|2|Installation of this air horn took few hours. This horn not loud at all. I have installed it to my SUV as a second horn to wake up some retards on the road, but my factory horn is louder than wolo air horn. It needs  more powerfull air pump to produce more air pressure to that horn. One more detail, air tank made from plastic.
B0000CBIK5|5|This product works well and was delivered quickly to our home! Our children will be happy now to be able to ride their bikes with tires that are not flat or 1/2 flat. They can even do the pumping themselves. ( with adult supervision of course)
B00IIN0C9K|5|BETTER & BRIGHTER THAN THE ORIGINAL ONES
B0058V9CF0|5|This item was given as a gift therefore, I have not used it.  It was as described and was of a good quality in appearance.
B004K2BG34|5|great
B0022ZJX1I|5|I got these grips for my '01 SV650 and had NO IDEA how much they would improve my riding.  There is less fatigue with these grips as they are extremely soft and tacky for a solid grip against your riding gloves.  I have carpal tunnel in my throttle hand and getting frustrated riding because my grip would have to be so tight against the throttle, it would quickly get pins and needles.  These grips have helped with that since I no longer need to squeeze so hard to keep the throttle in place. I highly recommend anyone to replace their old, dried out grips with these. You won't regret it.
B00KTIUI9Q|5|Worked great.
B00F84O5V8|5|thank you
B0081ZVBDQ|5|Ethanol can hurt your machines. Use this to ward off evil to your machines.
B00E5PK8TE|5|Both Product and delivery time were amazing, not to mention saved a ton of money not buying the battery through Harley. Highly recommend!!!
B00GBQ3KRW|3|I usually don't get too excited about items until they get in my hands and put to the intended use. This product is no exception. The Lipperrt Jack Stabilizer tool does make access to the T-bolts easier, however, not as one would expect. This tool is cumbersome to get the T-bolts tight enough to stay put which means getting down and doing it all by hand. On the other hand, the tool does make it easier to loosen the T-Bolts resulting in a faster tear down. Al in all this is not a bad product for its almost intended purpose. It was over priced for such a simple piece of metal. Do I regret the purchase? No, I have found it to be better than bending down to break the T-bolts loose, and re-tightening them for storage.  I am all for finding innovative ways to make my job easier for any task. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone with Lippert Strong Arm Stabilizer Bars For the price of the Strong Arm Stabilizers, they should have included the tool.
B0047RV8WG|5|Used in the doors of an 03 Avalanche.  They are a little longer than an incandescent bulb, which was fine.  They are also a little wider, so I had to file out the plastic door piece that the bulb socket snaps into.  They're very bright.  I bought another set to do the doors in our Grand Cherokee next.
B006P0QP5S|5|This item is a no brainer, the lock set is of good quality, very, very easy to install. So far, this wheel lock set has performed as advertised. Good purchase!
B009VOQ05U|4|nice product
B009DJSLWI|2|When I use the turn signal it sometimes works.<br /><br />I would like a new one sent and I will send this one back
B007WMYTN8|5|Exactly as described in the ad and was shipped quickly.  Will look to heygidday for future purchases.
B00ADECCAE|1|didn't fit
B000EDUUNK|1|Does not work lighting the pilot light on my furnace, which is why I bought it.  What a waste of money.
B00CMG00HS|5|Far better than original,at a fraction of the cost.
B003E2AC0E|5|rims look great. I hope it holds up! People ask where I bought the rims. I highly recommend this product for a quick upgrade to some old rims.
B000CB3ZY0|5|I previously used fram filters from my local walmart at $18 a pop. However decided to try these were as they were much cheaper. Quality is top notch and the cost is less so no brainer!
B006Z9681K|5|Im 21a and have been smoking for a few years. Recently wanted to cut back. I've tried a lot of these filters that have gotten clogged. Or take away the taste. This one is perfect thou. You can see the smoke being filtered and it still doesn't take away any taste of the cig. I would pay 20 if I had to. Thank you so much!
B004RFKBEO|4|A bit much if you're just looking to haul a couple of bikes around but a good, solid product. I have a smaller trailer hitch than the 2&#34; (which is rated at 500lbs) so I had to add an adapter so I'm unclear on how that affects the weight rating now so be leary of that if yours is the same situation. Other than that, it's fantastic. Very well crafted.
B001OMLCZ0|4|Received my disconnects today 4/25/2011 and only had a problem with one of them. Went to take screw out and head broke off the screw. Pretty sure seller will make it right. Would buy from them again if for no other reason than they were honest and upfront about the shipping and delivery date.
B000B68V6I|5|This is great stuff....but you must remember to use it.
B0000TX800|5|Have had the unpleasant experience of fumbling around under the dashboard at night trying to find the blown fuse for the headlights, not fun at all.  That prompted me to get these and replace all my fuses in the car.  Do they work?  They work great.  I had one blow immediately.  Replace it as not sure if it was just a faulty fuse, second one blew as well.  Traced the fault to a bad interior light I was not even aware was broken so can confirm 100% these work great.  The visibility of the light when they blow is good even in daylight.<br /><br />Only question is, why aren't these standard fitting on all cars?
B00KP37UNM|5|This Snoopy decal looks great on my computer.
B00IAEW1A0|5|Bought to mount a gas tank on my chopper.  These are high quality.  Just drill a 1/2&#34; hole, drop in, and weld it up.  Fits the bill and will use them anytime I need to maintain structural integrity while mounting.
B009AZ5AD8|5|Looks great and fit great on my 2011 335ix
B000GZO5A0|5|Items as described would recommend these carburetors to anyone who is looking for some TM 38s, and they were the best price I found out there.
B0015PMQDI|5|I do believe this is one of the better polishers that I've ever used. Goes on smooth and rubs right off, even in the heat of the day (though the manufactures discourage that). I use this to make a living on the car lots and I am very happy overall with the product
B004YRES30|5|It was super easy to apply. It looks rad! I love it:)
B000CAO7XO|5|The product arrived quick. It works great -- it holds CDs just fine. Now when you pull the tab to access your CDs, it does or it can block your vision -- if you have it on the driver side. I placed mine on the passenger side visor, and I can reach it just fine -- when stopped. And I don't have to worry with the flap blocking my view while driving because it is on the passenger side.
B00180FX2Q|5|Nicely priced, high quality part. I would buy again.
B002KQA5MK|5|Brought it for a 15 tires, but it was way too big had to clipped off a couple of chains for each tire to made a perfect fit, still cheaper than OEM.
B004HMBK5G|2|They don't really &#34;clip&#34; onto the seatbelt to securely fasten it. In order for it to stay in place, I had to loop the belt back through and I'm not sure how safe that is. I do appreciate that it helps the seatbelt not cut across my neck but think there must be more secure product and or method to achieve that.
B00316Y57Y|4|Very easy direct fit replacement.  I did notice in the picture of the item that it showed the clutch, two o - rings and a single ball bearing.  When I check the package I did not find the single ball bearing and did reach to the store and All Balls and never get straight answer from anyone which I found frustrating, so went to my local H-D dealer and purchased one, which cost me more in gas then what the part cost.  During the installation I double checked inside the clutch which was packed in grease and find that the ball bearing was inside covered with grease.  I finished the replacement and I also found the o-rings supplied where too big and I was not able to use them, luckily my stock ones were still good. After installation my starter has been flawless every since.  The seller and the manufacturer should have better information to insure customer confidence.
B00701EIRS|5|I was getting tired of some seatbelts on planes being just right, others not fitting at all so I decided to purchase my own extender after an embarassing moment on my last flight. This extender worked perfectly with plenty of room. I went thru security easily, they never asked what it was and my top covered it so the flight attendants never even saw it.  It is blue and Airtrans has black seatbelts but as I said, my top covered it.  Took the stress out of flying.  I highly recommend this product.
B003JNYE70|5|Was really glad to have this when I rode to my first camping scooter rally last month.It will hold more than you may think.
B001C6Q8D4|5|Was an exact fit. Not as easy as I thought but can be done with basic mech knowledge. Thanks.
B00EDGQLQO|1|My son ordered these lights because we needed new ones.  We found them to be equal to our old ones in brightness, which is not at all bright.  Also we had a very hard time getting them adjusted, even taking them in to the Chevy garage.<br />They may work well for some, not for us.
B001BFTQZS|5|works great!!!
B0036GCEL8|2|Junk, did not last thru 1st trip.  The bags attach with Velcro strips at the bottom  and straps at the top.  The strap on the left side interfered with shifter knob and neither side snugged the bags to the gas tank. The Velcro at the bottom was not an effective way to secure bags in place. Waste of $$.
B000BZI4K2|5|Bought these for both front sides, the fit was perfect, no problems at all.  A very well made product and is apparent.
B005SIWK2K|5|Very happy with this. I download songs and motorcycle sounds to play on my electric mobility scooter. People get a laugh when I play revving motocycle sounds on my 3 wheel electric mobility scooter.
B0015DMJ2S|5|Item was shipped right away and only took about two days to get to me. Great tool to have. Would definitely recommend to fellow technicians.
B000RFPPNU|5|Well worth the money. No issues at all.
B00CFNLFPE|5|I purchased these split microfiber cloths to keep my Vitamix container in like-new, clear, and shiny condition.  I specifically chose them for their &#34;split fiber&#34; feature which makes them more absorbent.  I use them to dry the container after washing, and they work as anticipated to keep my Vitamix containers, as clean and shiny as the day I got them!
B000LRAICC|5|Bought one this winter with a mid mount setup.  Have really abused this setup and have been impressed with the quality.  Highly recommend.
B0000DYVN9|5|Works very well so far. Our dog loves it.
B000EFP68C|5|Putting a boat in the water is a whole lot easier when your tail lights can go in the water without any problems, great price and easy to install.
B00HFZN69K|5|met my needs.
B002Z64P4Y|5|Just what we needed to protect our new tires!  A perfect fit!
B00CST9ZJS|3|tool update only can go to 2012  nisssan sentra but I have 2014 sentra  may not work for me . it will work on something  a bit older vehicle..
B001DCJ3JI|5|I go this for my 2002 Toyota Solara and was worried about the struts not<br />holding up as some reviewers stated but they worked great, even in cold weather.
B009F0XPCQ|2|incomplete kit. no pilot bearing. clutch seemed ok. too much petal effort. not for everyday drivers. no customer help at all
B0054WIBI2|5|Very good tool, works good. Delivery time to Germany was in nearly 10 days-perfect for me.
B00HLI9XCU|5|Awesome kit! HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Here is why;<br /><br />---------------------<br />INITIAL ORDER<br />---------------------<br />At first I ordered a SDK H11/5000k Kit (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHIPFTW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) which I had issues with. After several attempts to install, the kit was installed properly then a bulb died within the first few days. I returned the kit directly to Amazon for a full refund.<br /><br />Shortly after returning the kit, SDK/Kensun contacted me directly via email to remedy the situation and to ensure my satisfaction. Immediately they offered to send me a replacement kit that was of either SDK or Kensun. I opted for the Kensun kit the second time around over the SDK kit I initially purchased for no real reason. Within a week, I had my replacement Kensun HID kit.<br /><br />------------<br />INSTALL<br />------------<br />Install was easy and quick. I did notice that the stock wiring harness when connected to the Kensun wiring harness didn't click/lock entirely, so I used electrical tape to help secure the connection. That would be my only complaint. Other than that, quick and easy install. No modding. No cutting. Nothing extra needed. This is direct plug'n'play.<br /><br />Note: I did use alcohol pads to wipe down the bulbs thoroughly prior to install to clean any grease or oils from my hands/fingers that may have gotten on the bulb. Grease/oils will significantly decrease the life of the any bulb.<br /><br />-------------<br />QUALITY<br />-------------<br />This kit is of superior quality from other kits I have used in the past and also purchased and tried for my 2014 Honda Accord Sport. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />The bulbs are bright and extremely close to, if not 5000k. There is no noticeable hues of blue to my eyes, every persons vision varies and some may or may not see any hues of blue.<br /><br />The kit has been installed in my car for several weeks now with no issues. I am extremely happy.<br /><br />-------------------<br />DISCLOSURE<br />-------------------<br />I was supplied a sample of this kit for free after an issue with a previous kit I ordered initially. SDK/Kensun contacted me directly to remedy the issue and I promised that my review is fair and honest with no bias after my entire experience.happy.<br /><br />-------------------<br />DISCLOSURE<br />-------------------<br />I was supplied a sample of this kit for free after an issue with a previous kit I ordered initially.

B0089XCCTC|2|Previously when I bought this from an online vendor, the product looked just like the picture; i.e. 2 STRIPS that are the length of the corresponding EX-Pass strips.  I was disappointed to ring 4 tiny partial strips.  I used them to tack up the 4 corners of my EZ pass.  The photo is rather disingenuous
B00BITI5RW|5|Shipped quickly and easy to install.
B000PY9Q6A|5|Great original BMW floor matts, great reseller with quick shipping. Only issue was that the floor matts did not come with the necessary hardware (Special hook that screws in the floor, in place of the removable Velcro) to keep the flloor matt in place.<br />So I had to make a trip to my local BMW dealer and the clerk was friendly and said &#34;while these hooks are usually packaged with the matts, he has some laying around and would give it to me at no charge&#34;  So once I had the hooks, the matts stayed on nicely and did not move around.<br />In my 2008 535xi, the summer floor matts are held in place by a &#34;round screw in velcro plate&#34; on the floor. So I used a quarter to unscrew the Velcro piece and instead put in place the hook supplied by the dealer, which is necessary and did not ship with the floor matts.
B00AGAENF2|3|this light is more of a flood light. the cord needs to be a lot longer. it puts good light out at 75 to 100 feet. but after that it kinda loses power. and the thing that bothered me the most is that the light wad scrached and paint was chipped.
B008G1Z190|5|They were great! Buy them! The only difference to the originals is the peice of trim is slightly different. But they look good and they're easy to install.
B008KL5ES4|5|Love the No Rinse Wash and Shine.  The 3-pack is definitely the best way to go - more bang for your buck.  This is great for conserving water during the spring, summer, and fall when car is mildly dirty and doesn't need a full soap-down.  Leaves a nice slick surface
B00KVC78RU|5|i love this product
B00BD4NLIK|3|does not stick very well
B003F2Q8LK|5|this stuff is stronger than i expected, it didnt come in black that i could find so i painted mine with black caliper paint, as it can withstand heat and brake dust and other crap from the roads, i will see if i can post pics once i have it installed.
B005VSIHHE|5|Awesome sticker. I love everything in the Zelda universe
B0098B4RUQ|5|Nice quality piece, it fits like a glove and even has the cut out for the Caddy emblem on back (nice touch other silicone style brands don't have) also has a leather look pattern that makes it look more expensive.<br />Best reason to get one is that it totally envelopes your $200+ factory remote and it's not too bulky like actual leather ones.<br />Delivered by day promised maybe even a day early.
B006YU7G8E|5|good for my 2002 Honda accord。
B002M4B3Z8|5|The the headlights fit perfect. Thanks
B00CE6OXY2|1|Bad!!!!!
B0000AZ77J|5|perfect
B00NAK8R52|5|Excellent. .
B002935IV2|1|Did not hold in place at all
B000B6JJUK|5|Works great!
B00ACQBE1Q|4|Look good pain to install
B0012NQVJS|5|THE FIRST ORDER WAS ALL WRONG HAD TO GET A REFUND AND SEND IT BACK. THE SECOND ORDER WAS CORRECT AND ALL WENT WELL. GREAT PART AT A GOOD PRICE
B004SR797I|4|I'm giving this a 4 because the assembly looks sturdy and new, arrived on time and was well packed. But, amazons &#34;check you fit&#34; function reported that it fits my 2005 RX-8. It does not! The seller advertises it as a Mazda 5 part, they need to sort this out between themselves and amazon as to what other vehicles it fits. Anyway, no hassle returning it to Amazon.
B00CFM9QLA|5|Great addition to the car.
B006D0LW9E|5|I use this product with a Garmin 655t mounted on a Polaris Ranger.  We had to modify the mount slightly to get it around the larger tubing but this is an outstanding product.  We travel in very rough terrain in all weather conditions for hours at a time and this product meets and exceeds expectations.
B0068FUWGI|5|Works good
B009V1ETVK|5|What can I say? They're batteries. They hold a charge, and shipped quickly in good packaging. When you need a large quantity for a UPS, this is a good deal
B00BJON3G4|5|Easy to install and look great while functioning perfect.
B000RGVNKI|1|Stay away from Rain-x.  I bot from Amazon and this was an old product that did not fit my car even though I went through the Amazon / Car fit process....  One of the wipers did not have the correct fittings to match my car.  I called Rain-X for some help and they gave me a lecture about buying on-line.  I told them I needed a solution and not a lecture.  They could care less for the customers.  Very bad experience and a waste of time and money with Rain-X.
B006XMI1M8|5|Product was shipped quickly and was the same thing the dealership was going to charge us $100+ for, works like a charm.
B002I9OQGK|5|Application was easy and it looks good
B002DYH586|1|the spare parts no more available and the life batery is 2 years, please when the spare parts are available please tell me
B0002JN3Y4|5|Excellent product just as described.nothing more to say I think my short sentence say all that needs to be said,get a clue Amazon.
B000NPRTII|5|I own two scooters, and installed this horn on each one. It is a daily problem of big SUV's trying to occupy the same space I have on the highway. This horn will make them aware that they need to look before switching lanes. This will be installed on all future scoots and motorcycles for me!
B001LHVOVK|5|Very Nice, Simple to use. Great Seller.Read the engine light trouble code with ease.<br />would recommend to friends . Good value.
B000BQYH6Q|3|Slides on asphault
B001DRP9G4|5|In spite of the fact that it could not be purchased locally, this is the only filter I will use for my car. Identical to the OEM filter, there is never any doubt as to whether it is doing the job it is intended for. I usually buy them 2 or 3 at a time.
B0002KR88A|5|If you need an inline water resistant fuse holder this one is tough to beat! You won't go wrong buying it that's for sure!
B00KQNVD4S|5|Everything went fine
B00ZO20LC6|5|I brought this to run of my Goal Zero Yeti 400 while tent camping (car cramping). After attaching the wires I attached a plastic back, then attach to my tent using 3 badge magnets.<br /><br />Having an outside tent light that can both be white or amber is great after dark.  We use the amber light most of the time and the white light for clean up.  Much better idea than battery or gas lights if you have a large tent.<br /><br />As for the product its self, on white its just a little brighter than a 40 watt incandescent light bulb and uses only 7 watts. On amber its bright too and uses only 4 watts. (Measurements taking using the Goal Zero Yeti 400 solar generator).<br /><br />The specifications say that on white the color temperature is 5000K. This may be so  with white LED's only but the unit uses both white and amber LED when on white creating a more of a warm white (pinkish white light) of around 3800K.<br /><br />Overall, a very good outside light for Tent (with the modifies) or RV's.
B006CRT72W|5|Look like they came with the Truck when new.<br />Instructions for re-programming them included with shipment.<br />Took less than 4 minutes to set them up on my car code and I have never done this before in my life.<br /><br />Price was a bargain compared to $55 the  Frigg'n Dealer quoted me just for 1 of them.
B000WJX29U|5|My friend has a 250 Honda Rebel and her battery died about a month ago. She's had the bike for 5 years so considering a bike in Florida the battery was about 2 years overdue. She paid $130 at the Honda dealer for the last one which I thought was out of line. I don't even pay that for my Harley. Well I took a chance and ordered this one out. To my surprise it came with very well written instructions on how to put the fluid in and put the cap on. It came alive in about ten minutes reading 12.8 volts. I did however put it on my batter tender overnight and then installed it. Been running good so far. No problems.
B005HQZ8PY|5|I wear this to be seen while I ride my bike.  It works excellently well for that.  Fits well, seems to be good quality.<br /><br />I don't mind being a bit clown-like if it keeps me safer. I think it does.
B00YXBEE36|5|Worked perfect to replace the OEM part on our '99 Odyssey.  Actually appears to be an improvement over the original as it has more fins to displace the heat (oem only had 2 fins). If your fan will only turn on when at the full speed, and you get no cold AC, this is likely the part you need to fix it.  Be sure to also replace your cabin air filter while you're at it, and vacuum out any dust you can from the duct too.<br /><br />You'll want good lighting and a stubby Phillips screwdriver or a 8mm socket for the three screws.  This thing is a bear to swap out, but a completely doable DIY fix it job.
B001INL9JE|5|Delivered on time and as advertised.
B0049QGHOO|5|Fast shipping and very affordable, this decal was just the thing to show off my Detroit pride. Thank you for a great product!
B0013TM0Z0|3|Bought this for a Kawasaki Mule with a cab. I mounted it on the hood, facing the windshield so it could act as a defroster. I wired it directly to the battery, to eliminate any voltage deficiencies. I turned the unit on and I was immediately disappointed in the fan output. I would have rated the heater one star for that alone, but with the outside temperature 9 - the window did stay clean. So for now I guess I will continue to keep it there and test it more.
B000KID2ZC|4|I had to download and print out 130 pages of for the instructions and applications, punch holes in all of them, and put them a three ring binder so I have a hard copy right there at my vehicle (I don't use a lap-top while I work on vehicles for obvious reasons).
B007XWU5FS|3|Installed onto a 2000 honda civic cx (3 door/hatchback). Since the catalytic converter is part of the exhaust manifold you will need an test pipe, unless you decide to mount the catalytic converter underneath. The only issue I had was the muffler pipe bend may be a little off causing it to vibrate against the wall making a rattling sound. I am working out a way to bend this pipe about an inch which will prevent this.
B00802GZ72|5|Easy to install, and super bright.
B00DYOVXZ0|4|There is not much to say other than it worked well.  It took a bit to get the wifi network setup but that is likely related to how long it takes to initialize itself.<br /><br />It is a bit bigger than I would have liked and it would be nice if I could just leave it plugged in but given the power draw, that would not be great for the battery of the car.<br /><br />Overall, it is hard to complain about it unless I really wanted it always plugged in.  I have now used it for a number of trips and it is just what the doctor ordered.
B006EGAIII|4|It works pretty well, supported my vehicle, but it cracked a little bit on the bottom of it, but maybe it's my fault on this one
B00AM1SBBM|5|Great price and fast delivery don't pay for the expensive guards these are just as durable and the price is half of witch you would pay for the top of the line guards
B001FIDNGO|3|I was a little surprised at how small these were. They work though. I fixed a seatbelt that kept retracting too far. This was a lot cheaper than a 400.00 seatbelt assembly replacement!
B001BYXBKA|1|Do not waste your money!  The product is worthless- just a vinyl sticker that doesn't really adhere well to dash surfaces.  The cuts are not clean, some are jagged, lopsided and missized.  The website claims you can trim to fit- but it is impossible to trim a piece that is lopsided, short in length or too large (for pockets or holes).  The customer service was a nightmare as well-  they refuse to give refunds- even for a cheap product!  What kind of company cannot stand by their product?  If you ask questions about problems you are having-because the product is missized, they treat you like you don't know how to install a silly little sticker to your dash---referring you to look at pictures on their site.  I made a huge mistake purchasing a kit from them---save yourself the headache and frustration of dealing with this company.
B00FESA9G8|5|These are perfect.  Our previous car quickly accumulated scratches from fingernails in the space behind the door handles.  I didn't want that happening with the new car.  These are pricey, but they're magnetic and work fine.
B0072W5OXW|5|Great high quality. fits nice and are very bright and crisp. Would buy again!
B00HT2Y80U|2|Don't think it does much. bright light. Never noticed a decrease in oders
B003CG9PIC|5|I have used this block with 3/8&#34; winch line on my tractor for logging. It has pulled 40 to 60 foot long Oak trees with no problems and no cable wear. I am very glad I bought this instead of the $95 snatch block that the logging winch manufacturer was offering. Good quality, just grease it and go.
B007UTPU1I|3|Beware- this is not fully adjustable.<br />The quality of the product itself is nice.  However, there is a 5&#34; window that the ball will not adjust to.  For example, on my Expedition with the bar pointed downward the top of the ball will reach a height of 20&#34;.  If I then flip the bar 180 degrees so it is facing upward the top of ball height is then 25&#34;.  A difference of 5&#34;!  My boat trailer requires a level height of 22&#34;. I spoke with someone at Trimax and was told to split the difference.  Either run the height at 20&#34; or 25&#34;.  They recommended running it lower.  However, I didn't buy a $160 adjustable hitch to run my trailer 2&#34; off level.<br />You can see in my pictures the disparity in ride height.<br />It is a shame because it is a nice hitch overall except for this flaw.
B00OCAZM7U|5|I replaced this part because my old intake hose was so old and stiff that it cracked. This part seems to be of good quality. The rubber seems nice and flexible, and it fit right into place on my 2000 ES300. I think for a little air intake hose it's a little overpriced, but it should last the rest of my cars life!
B001FCC6RC|4|Was pleased with the adapter, but the packaging was horrible<br />wasn't much of the box left when it arrived.  Would recomend this Adapter<br />for trucks with gooseneck hitches
B000KITSMI|2|Does not fit all R134A valves. I have a 2001 Ford Ranger Truck and it does not fit the valve stem.
B00485PGZ2|2|Installed on 1999 F150. But keyless entry and the remote start worked perfectly for about two months then keyless entry stopped working. Right after that the truck wouldn't shut off when key turned off regardless if remote start was used or not. Trying to find any trouble shooting guide was impossible and waiting on hold for customer service for about an hour just to be told there's nothing they can do.
B007MUJLKQ|5|Great product fast.shoppin good price
B00H7HD8LW|5|Cheap but great quality love it
B004EIBXVO|1|This pathetic inverter can't even keep a 120 watt circuit going - feeding macbook and harddrive - without beeping, and it's so \\"intelligent\\" that if the van is off for 10 minutes, it shuts itself off because of \\"low voltage.\\" My other (cheap) inverter can be plugged in immediately after this one fails, and it'll work fine, so it's not my van's battery that is \\"magically\\" draining in 10 minutes. Not just a waste of money, but whatever time you spend trying to figure out what 410 watts really means to the Schumacher crowd. I should have insisted on Black and Decker.  (This is my first review of any kind - inspired by the hapless engineering that went into this pitiful product.)
B000WL9HI8|4|I've only used it once so far but it stuck to the window of the RV well, is easy to read and seemed to be accurate.  Happy with it so far and hope it lasts.
B008T8CXGY|5|Amazing. Left a great finish and super protection under Surburban. Eat up the light surface rust that you see on underside of vehicles. I love this stuff !  I ran out of Fluid Film, so two new cans arrived, and I did a touch up of anyplace showing rust.  This product protected my Suburban amazingly in this Colorado winter.  I have no rust on this 1999 Chevy.  I am going to coat my tools next....best stuff !
B00JIJ4LWW|5|I love this leather conditioner and cleaner. It works very well and easy to use. It cleaned my leather jacket great and left it looking almost new. It has a nice smell and not overly chemically like others I have used. I like that it came with its own sponge and a good sponge at that. I received to review and will be purchasing again.
B002YKER7G|5|Really like your product. Best hand cleaner I've found.<br /><br />The dispenser arrived broken.The retaining teat on the lid on the right side had been sheared off.Rather than go thru the hoops of returning it,I took a self tapping 1/2&#34; screw with matching washer and fit it loosely.Works fine.We'll see how long it lasts.<br /><br />Will definitely continue to use your product.
B000C57YAM|5|Great buy thank you!
B0063CU2KW|5|Nice quality, and no doubt a breeze to install.  But,  I have a 2013 Elantra GT, not the sedan. This is for the sedan. Even though it says it'll for the GT, it doesn't.
B00E16M1S8|5|Fit my 2007 Prius very well. Would buy again. Review the instructional video clip before installing
B00CJL2QGY|3|I was thrilled to find this Licence Plate Frame for my car. I was not able to find &#34;Nonna&#34; anywhere else. They are all for Mommy's, Daddy's, Grandma, Nana etc but no Nonna. When it arrived I was surprised to see that the letters are not painted on but rather they are sticker letters. Don't expect that they will last long but enjoying having it for now.
B003OEXYZC|5|It could not fit better in a 2015 4Runner.  Very high quality.
B003FONH9O|5|This emblem is so beautiful, I almost feel like it's too fancy for my car.  It really is like a piece of jewlery.  You will not be dissapointed with this product.  It has just enough bling, not too brash.  I love it.  I haven't put it on my car yet, because now my car sort of pales in comparison.  I will put it on though after I give my car a good cleaning.
B000W0RQ8C|5|this is much better looking than the chrome ones that stick out like a sore thumb, especially since its behind a cadillac decorative hitch cover.
B002K6K3RM|2|The color stated Diamond White and appears to be more of a blue color.. I put these in my 05 Audi and although they mounted very good to car, itdid have 4500K bulbs in it. I figured I would upgrade the output to the next level. but they are not a diamond white color at all..Put old bulbs back and going to return then and go back to 4500K bulbs
B003YCEMUA|5|These towels are hyped as great for cleaning windows. I fully agree with this assessment. I previously spent much more on a package of two, similar towels to clean our house windows, so I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the similarities between these and those, and the marked difference in price (these being a much better bargain). I used these cleaning the windows in a solution of vinegar and hot water, and the results were a clean, fresh smell, as well as windows without streaks. But these towels can be used for much, much more, including everyday household cleaning or washing the car. The best part is that they are reusable, and that means less use of paper towels. Highly recommended.
B000MXYVEQ|5|Great.
B007Y85GBY|5|This fit MY 2001 Mercury Sable DOHC perfectly. Alternator is performing wonderfully. Compared to factory unit I removed and and looks to me to be a little bit better construction.
B0034BP1Y2|5|New not rebuilt starter for about a1/3 of what some other places were trying to get.  Yeah I don't believe it has a limited lifetime guarantee but I'll have to replace this two more times before I start losing money.
B00GWEVKMA|3|not a high quality product at all
B00062Z1Z6|5|Easy to put on and take off for cleaning.  The one I replaced was simply a foam cone that went over the air filter and was a bit of a challenge to put back on after the air filter was oiled.  As far as I can tell performance is the same.  I use this on a 2008 can am outlander 400 xt h.o. fuel injected. update 9/30/16:  so I see I have had this for two years.  I was just cleaning the filter and I noticed that this boot has finally torn where it rubs the inside of the air filter housing.  it does seem to extended the times between filter cleanings and is itself, very easy to clean.  It has been covering a dry paper filter for the last little while and I noticed more dirt than usual on the filter...likely due to the tear.  I guess it's time to get another.
B00G3EAGFG|4|Great product, but wish it was a light color so that I can see contaminants better. Dark color hides contaminants, which could leave them exposed to your paint if you don't fold the clay bar.
B000A6Z9LO|5|If the rear drivers side light is what you want - then you won't be disappointed. Cheaper than I saw elsewhere and looks good quality. No instructions but a couple of screws inside the tailgate to remove and it will pop out. Don't lose the old screws - this didn't come with any.
B00123J79O|1|Never worked right out of the box. Etool direct authorized return, but did not replace. Only some static was picked up for a short time, but then nothing from any sensor.
B000CM0X4O|1|It was not what it was advertised as. The size was not the same as the year of the car. I had t modify to make it fit. I did not want t have to ship back
B000HZFDPU|3|So I just tried these today and they seem to work fine. It's the installing and removal parts that I struggled with. But before I go any further I must confess that I drive a BMW 335i + Sports package, which basically means that I don't have a lot of workable space (between the tires and the wheel well) to begin with. Maybe 2.5&#34; on the sides and 1.5&#34; space between the tire and fender. The instructions (and online video) make installation look like a snap but not in my case.<br /><br />If you've got very little hand clearance like me or big hands, I can pretty much guarantee that you'll struggle with with connecting the INSIDE part of the chain. It was downright impossible for me because I had no space for my hands to maneuver the chain around to connect the two ends. I even parked downhill to try to shift some of the weight from the rear (where I'm installing the chains) to the front but that didn't really help.<br /><br />The solution for me was to borrow someone else's car jack since I didn't have one (FYI, BMW doesn't equip cars with a tire jack if their car has run flat tires like mine. Guess I should've checked the trunk beforehand, eh?). This lifting the car's rear off its wheels and gave me the clearance I needed to connect the inner link.<br /><br />What's the lesson I've learned? For one, Security Chain Company claims that their product here will install in as little as 5mm clearance, and they're right. Well, they're right and they're wrong. While the chain may only be 5mm thick, your hands and arms sure aren't! So just look at how much ACTUAL space you have to work with and just imagine your hands and arms in there because that's how much space you really need. Hope this helps someone.<br />Yes, they're loud, really loud. I think that 'feature' comes for free as is probably the case with all snow chains.
B0002MSWTW|4|There is not much you can say about rubbing compound.  But, this one works very well.  Hot Tip:  Use a damp, cloth towel to apply it. If you use a dry towel, the rubbing compound will dry up quickly and stick to the towel.  Use a damp (very damp) piece of cloth towel to apply this stuff. An old wash cloth or hand towel works great.  Rub it on the car with a circular motion. When the applicator towel becomes grimey, wash it with soap and warm water then continue.  Or, use a fresh piece of damp towel.  You can rub out small scuffs and scratches with this stuff. Allow the products to dry to a haze then use a soft, clean, dry towel to wipe it off. It comes off very easily. Then apply wax or sealer.
B001G7DAQM|5|I bought struts from the Porsche dealer for my trunk earlier this year.  These struts for my hood were just as good, but at a fraction of the cost that Porsche charges.
B008E32NJ6|4|Works great
B0061R1KCI|5|I'm impressed by these hooks - I installed them in a 2014 F-450 and they fit and look very nice. They install in less than a minute each. I've only used them to strap a couple of items down so far, but they seem strong with a ratchet strap tied town pretty tight on them.
B00O7ZAD6U|5|So far so good.  Doesn't fit perfectly, but it's good enough for the price.  I hope it lasts longer than the last one.
B00PAMUA1M|2|I bought the Dodge ones based on the picture. When I received them weeks later they look like a child sewed them at home. The RAM Emblem was okay, but the DODGE was way off. Not bold lettering.  The other part I didn't like is the direction it's sewn on. If you want the image/wording to be located properly It puts the velcro seam right on the neck of the passenger.  Other than that there okay at best, what do you expect for 9 bucks?!
B0015PI7A4|4|Having gone away from home for long periods of time in the past, I've come home to dead batteries quite a few times.  I couldn't be more disgusted than having to drag a battery into Walmart or to some dumb kid in an autoparts store to try and receive my prorated warranty.  I am now fully confident in my ability to be sure if the problem is the battery or the charging system, but in my past, my absolute worst fear was that I went through the above process for nothing, that there was nothing wrong with the battery after all.<br /><br />And so for the average homeowner that maintains his own car, I think this is an excellent, simple and effective device.  Of course there are more sophisticated battery testing systems out there that put a heavy load on your battery and analyze each individual cell (this is what they're doing when they test your battery before giving you that prorated warranty), but this will tell you with high certainty what is wrong with your battery or charging system in under five minutes.  To me, a great device to have around.<br /><br />One thing that bothers me:  the name.  As this product is manufactured by a company called Clore Automotive, how did this thing get the name \\"Solar\\"?  I could be too cynical, but I swear they are trying to get the ignorant consumer to believe that this is some fancy solar powered device.  In fact, it gets its energy from the battery it is testing.  That part seems really cheesy and stupid, and if I was 100% sure of my suspicions, I'd probably drop my rating further.  But hey, it's a simple device, and I like what it does.<br /><br />Oh, by the way, it is smaller and better looking than I expected from the pics on Amazon.
B000S2SSYK|5|AC Delco products are always first rate.  Much better than cheap aftermarket  products.  You get what you pay for in these cases.
B000G2MHBC|5|Easy to use. So far it has helped keep the honest people honest, so my gooseneck stays where it should when it's not attached to my truck.
B005EVARDK|2|I had two different modules. It would not have worked at all if I did not go on the Internet to find the problems and figure them out myself from other websites.<br />One fob did not work at all and only the starter worked the doors and trunk did not work.<br />Tech support did not answer my calls.<br />Tech support did not answer my emails.<br />Tech support did not take my last contact attempt at all.<br />Go to another company for this device. This company has many tech issues.<br />If I did not know electronics well this would have been worse.<br />Do not buy this product.
B004ZKVUCI|5|I love paying a fraction of the OEM parts and getting something that fits right and works right.
B002JR949K|3|I assumed that a &#34;set&#34; of visormates meant that there were 2, one for each window. I now see that I was wrong...
B008LUT6XS|5|Priced right .. Recommend this product for removing odors. The neutral air leaves no residue smell. Shipping was better this time too.
B00CUNALVI|5|Works great
B001PWA0IO|5|I modified the way it was mounted.  I added some washers and mounted it &#34;backwards&#34; to keep the cable from binding.  locktited the piece that goes in the tailgate.
B0019II9H8|5|I tried a rain x brand which was suppose to fit my bmw but it didn't fit like the old one.  So . . I ordered these wipers and they were perfect.  Will buy again when the time comes.  Thanks amazon
B00M8IM4D8|5|Thought it would solve a dome light issue I was having. It didn't, but the dash lights don't flicker anymore, so there's that. Seems like a well-built part and the installation was straightforward. Just make sure you order the correct switch for your specific option package.
B000RN04VU|5|Affordable and quite spacious. I use it on my CB500X and holds a lock + reminder cable, a pair of shoes, some snacks and a some toiletries. Pretty nice for commuting and/or a short overnight trip.
B00B1VBHKY|3|I didn't look at the size before I purchased it and it is too small for the windshield of my truck.
B001P2D4AU|5|Good product just ordered too many
B00554PR6I|5|Not a bad price for this \\"kit\\".<br />Yes it doesn't have any instructions since it is assumed the person installing it knows what they are doing...<br />They also know a minimum of \\"electrics\\".. You know? Red is positive and black is negative - got it?<br /><br />The red wire on the power plug or relay harness plug goes into the power port on the ballast where the + is cast; make sure. Same goes for any connecting plugs not for the bulb; connections oriented red wire with red wire and black wire with black wire..<br />You have two black wires ground to car body with ring connectors - MAKE SURE THEY ARE GROUNDED VERY GOOD; you don't and more likely your headlights won't come on. You will more likely hear the relay clicking; but no lights; check the ground.<br /><br />The red positive wire with 20amp fuse and ring connector goes to the positive on the battery. ALL POWER for the relay and ballasts go through that wire. Another poster complained the \\"fuse\\" didn't blow and melted the wires? If it did what fuse was being used?<br />More likely they hooked the trigger wires with the spade connector to the battery creating a dead short and no fuse inline.. But it looks like they wired up the harness backward and wrong..<br /><br />You will also see two wires red and black with spade connectors on them. They go into the headlight bulb plug on the car. You WILL NEED A VOLTMETER to determine the polarity of the wires. One will be the ground and one for low and one for high. Ground is easy set the meter to read ohms and do a continuity on the plug connectors and touch the other meter probe to vehicle ground. When you see the meter swing all the way over or you have a meter that beeps; you have found the ground. The black wire on the relay harness goes there; BUT don't pull the probe out of the headlight bulb plug yet. Set the meter to volts DC and turn on the vehicle headlights; now stick the probe into the headlight bulb plug on each of the other two connectors and watch the meter; when it swings you have found the connector for low beam; the red spade connector goes there. High beam equipped kits the other connector would be for the third spade connector.<br /><br />Also the wires are long enough; lay out the relay harness where you want to run the wires and look at it; it will fit it did on my car and possibly it might be too short; splice more wire of the same type..<br /><br />This is what I do and this is just an explanation of what I did. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING get a friend who does and buy them a pizza and beer AFTER THE INSTALL or take it where some one does know how to install it.<br />You use this information at your own risk..
B001P2JONQ|4|Ordered this quite some time ago and have used it allot over the summer. It still works well and I'm hoping it holds up for a few years.
B009AA2FAY|5|just like oem, works perfectly
B00EECL90U|2|I purchased 2 6000K D1S bulbs for my 06 9-5 Saab.  They were a perfect fit, and looked good.  One failed after 3 days, and they sent me a replacement fairly quickly.  Now after a year, they are dim and started flickering.  I didn't change my one quick enough & now am waiting for a $241 ballast!  Apparently, this is the norm from what I&#34;m reading on the Saab Boards.  So, long term they may be trouble ... be warned!
B007FGR852|5|No complaints. Been on my 2014 Iron 883 for awhile now and no issues.
B00BKAFIRO|1|I bought these bulbs to replace other HID bulbs that have worked for years. These did not fit into my headlights properly, and were out of focus. Also, the hi/lo switching was broken so they only had one setting. This may be why they did not fit properly, but regardless, I still have to buy a new set of bulbs.
B000E2AL1C|4|When i give my bike throttle, no more lag.<br />Bike is getting all the air it needs.<br />Don't hear the carbs trying to suck in air.<br />Highly recommend.<br />When i drive relaxed, my milage increased by 10%
B00BTLEJXI|5|Fit well, look nice.  We have not yet installed the rear covers just because we haven't had time, but we love the fit of the front covers.
B009HU8CWW|5|Saved me money and no issues with installation<br />.....<br />Do your research as everyone has their preferences on what brand works.
B0040CWY58|5|Good job
B000WK4CS4|1|This may be a great battery, but mine didn't work and when I tried to return it to derby cycles they just play games for a month.  So I bought another battery at a local store.  Don't waste you time with them, they just blame amazon and don't actually stand by the products they sell.
B006RVS7O2|5|What a great product, fit great, great pricing, sppedy delivery, and unquestionable style. now I can drive around with a Type R emblem on my car, since my name start with an R, its All good
B003KXGU4E|1|Come on people, you don't know that the ISLAM support the peace, there is no one here show some respect for a religion of 1.5 billion person in the world. Respect us as we respect you !!!
B005ZHFXKU|5|Installed myself on my 95 Honda Civic. A bit tough, had to use the internet a lot because they don't give enough info for the average joe to do it himself, but once installed with all my added extras it works like a charm. Remote start is great for cold days, and the 1 mile range (while not true when there's too much stuff in the way) does work quite well. Would recommend to a friend.
B005FW31S6|5|Fits great looks good
B000FLLWGA|4|I chose this rating because the product worked fine when I installed it. It was nice to get the same part that was in the RV, so that the wiring worked good.
B001TAPLYA|5|This was a great deal.  Compared to buying from a automotive shop.  If you know what you're doing, you can save a trip and money taking your Jeep to a shop to have these installed.  I found it useful to view a DIY video on youtube.  These are great!
B00DC5OJAC|5|I have a truck with 7.5&#34; of lift. The ramps were exactly what I needed to load my atv.
B00192HPOC|4|Screened in the lower outside fridge vents on our Casita. They fit fine. I used other cable ties that I had for a snugger fit.
B00BFIAUVA|5|I collect military gear, knives, all that good stuff.<br />This is a very cool piece. It's a REAL Israeli kevlar helmet. Make no mistake, they are old but are still in great condition.<br />Good buy for only 50 bucks!
B001GOLA5I|5|Nice quality plate.
B0001L0DFA|5|Yes, I baught similar (craftsaman) from sears. This is only you need. Do not bother to buy other less expansive nozzle. You will buy it again and again. So do not waste your money on other nozzles. Just buy this one...
B002GT78GW|5|After purchasing this I put it on my back window.  People I meet love it and asks where I've found it.  Thanks for supporting our Troops!
B007Q4MOGG|5|Great product, exact as described, perfect OEM product at good price.
B007A3VHDY|1|ordered a starter from these folks, was told &#34;we will get it out today&#34;, I never received email confirmation, contacted them the next day and was told, &#34;it is on the way&#34;, third day, no starter, contacted them again, was told &#34;sorry we forgot to ship it&#34;, I needed my truck back on the road, found a local shop that repaired my starter in 20 minutes for $30.00
B00BLPVGJM|1|Too good to be true.  Picture shows the lock included.  Original description did not mention cable.  When I tried to return the item they said it was subject to a20% restocking fee.  Add postage and it is not worth returning.  The cable is tiny gauge that could be chit with mail trimmers.  I would not trust anything of value to it and would not pay 9$ for this useless piece of wire.
B000DINKPQ|5|Installed on a motorcycle with the high note horn. Great. Now cars hear when I honk.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|works as designed. a must have for late model toyota filters.  I use on sienna vans for fleet maintenance
B0034GW1WW|3|Worked well for about a year then the plastic cracked allowing it to leak and lose pressure.
B008HOJX8Q|5|Ok
B0089NKPZA|5|Great fitment and quality
B000C14U26|3|The regulator failed on our 2000 Lesabre and my son replaced it about a year ago with the cheapest one we could find on Amazon and it failed again.  Upgraded to the Dorman part and it seems better quality.  My son commented that it was heavier and should last longer.
B00EPDLYTO|5|Looks awesome
B004HXGT4C|5|Easier to get on my boots than i thought. I bought one for each of my soldiers, they are great!!
B00VKM3PSQ|4|It swallows my Silverado 2500HD crew cab.  I wanted it for sun and tree dropping protection and it works great for that.  It is super thin and lightweight, and I have had to tie it down well to keep it from blowing off with our strong gulf coast winds.  It has a grommet on each side, and one in the front.  It has a drawstring that goes all the way around, as well as elastic at both ends.  After cutting a hole for my antennae, I found it stays on most the time if I tie down both sides. I don't have the patience to see if I could ever squeeze it back into the bag it came in (it captures air when you fold it), but with very little trouble, I can wad it up to roughly the size of a large pillow.
B0083H5SFY|1|gasket will melt on you in less than a year and cause lean code for bank 1 and bank 2 p0171 and p0174.<br /><br />the melted gasket goop can also be sucked into the intake and cause valve/valve seat damage.<br /><br />Spend the money and buy the bmw oem rather than this or remove all gasket material and seal with rtv if you have no other choice.<br /><br />I'm on my second one. first one also cracked at the a arm.<br /><br />Amazon needs to stop selling these!
B00JPBBGGW|4|works fine
B000BZL0LC|5|Good price and it fits my 02 Subaru. I passed the inspection.
B00H8Z3I2C|5|wonderful
B00B9LM64M|4|Looks just like the original. But these are not designed well for back seat where kids will be. It breaks easily.
B001KSAU42|5|No more squeaking.
B000XMG3T2|1|I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. First time outta bag overheated. Also jbtools wouldn't recommend buying anything from them also DO NOT USE THEM. I'm a union pipe fitter we don't always use vacuums on the job. This was embarrassing brought it to the job to start commissioning systems. Hooked up my micromiter started pump with oil at max level. The thing wouldn't pull down past 1000 without overheating. Junk. I've bin doing this for years. I don't want a refund just a switch out exchange. So I bought it april 30th. It's now June 23. I just got married in May and didn't work for 3.5 weeks for honeymoon and planing. Just broke it out today and junk thanks jbtools your the best. Shame on me for not having work to commission a system. But shame on you for bad customer service.
B009AGGMC0|5|:)  If you like big jugs, youre going to love these puppies.  Big, round and full.  Great shape too.  :)
B00GN53R4W|5|I was wary about trying these, but after seeing a tire go low that I wasn't aware of, AND due to having a couple of missing valve stem caps, I decided to give these a try.<br /><br />And WOW - I am so happy with 'em.  First of all, they work!  Just put them on like normal valve caps and you're done.  You immediately should see green, or else you know a tire is getting low.  They are very easy to see at a glance.<br /><br />My one concern was that they might actually contribute to air leaking out of the tire (we've all been there - while checking the tire pressure you accidentally let about 5 PSI escape because you are too slow or clumsy to get a good seal on the gage ... ok, maybe it is just me!).  Anyway, these puppies must form a really tight seal with the valve stem, because after a couple of weeks of use, no air has escaped; all systems are \\"green.\\"<br /><br />In summary, this is an awesome idea and a great product for the money.  Very highly recommended!
B00I0C44SE|5|i like it so much, it is exactly what i wanted and i would defenitely suggested to other funny man!!!!
B0067BPC68|5|The lamp took S11 bulbs which would pop every other week it seemed so I decided to get a socket reducer to try a different type of bulb. The reducer fit perfectly as well as the candelabra bulb. Would buy again if I needed another.<br /><br />I would give 4 stars since I disliked not having a tracking number on my package but that is petty- this is perfect and got here safely. Thanks!
B000FVXNUS|5|This is a top notch product. Exact fit, high dielectric strength, and brass terminals for long life and the best electrical conductivity are some of the reasons this product stands out from the rest. Furthermore, this high quality product is made in the USA  by a company dedicated to the automotive industry.
B000CQPU8Y|4|Great return process - ordered the wrong product.
B001QV7VPO|5|bien
B007Z35Y56|5|Washable, breathable, nice grip.
B006FUT09G|5|Takes a little elbow grease, but works very well.
B000VULAQC|5|Overall I think this is a good product with a good generic variety of tool applications and seems to be good value for the price.     I was slightly dissapointed when I first used the Noid lights that there did not appear to be the exact light terminal connection for my vehicle application, but with a little common sense I found it was easy to get one of them to work with no problem.     The order, shipping and condition of the received product was excellent.    I think this will work for any back yard mechanic interested in troubleshooting fuel injection systems.
B00480J4PU|2|I replaced both headlight bulbs at the same time. Six months later, one is already dead. I don't expect them to last forever, but at least a couple of years. One of my cars I've had twelve years and have only had to replace one headlight in that time. This car I bought used about a year ago and now I am facing my second bulb replacement.
B0058SPK9A|4|Very satisfied  even thought there was a problem with a switch it was replace quickly.<br />And it works perfectly fine.
B00CFALFXY|4|Bought this particular item after reading reviews of this brand, and many others. I use in my shop, when painting/varnishing, to dust between coats of finish after sanding. In the house, will use for dusting, device/tv screen cleaning and washing windows. So far so good, though I have only just begun to use them.<br /><br />Washing instructions are for machine washing only, which makes little sense when it is suggested to wash separately from other laundry. I suggest hand washing, and it would be good to include that in the instructions (which I received on the label, and in a separate email). Why run a full laundry load for 6 or 8 tiny cloths? Have not yet washed any of these. If you are not already aware, DO NOT PUT IN CLOTHES DRIER.<br /><br />Might give 5 stars, but my rating means little without more extensive experience with this, or any, product.<br /><br />We are asked by Amazon/vendors to review products, sometimes before receiving them, and I wish there were a way to sort out reviews based on real experience with a product, rather than having to read through dozens to get a sense of worth. I will try to update this review should my rating go up or down from here.
B004W0K3T2|5|Awesome product!  I would definitely recommend this product.
B001Y91MFI|4|Very well
B0024E6W02|5|I did end up sending this hose back, but that's NOT the manufacturer's fault. I have a VINTAGE 1966 tiny camper and it just doesn't have a spare inch of storage space. When this wouldn't fit in my bumper (someone over the years added it by attaching a PVC pipe to the back), I had to return it. HOWEVER, the quality was great and the construction looked really solid. I would worry that &#34;matter&#34; might get plugged up in the middle connection, but that connection is what makes this hose perfect for a variety of campgrounds since you never know how far that sewer connection is or what side it will be on. The donut on the end is removable, but I'll say more and more campgrounds are requiring them.
B000HS1356|5|Great cover! Fits perfect and keeps bike clean.  Easy instructions.  Intend on being a repeat customer for future purchases for sure!
B0000AXF21|3|The triangles are Ok. The box is very flimsy. Even the replacement box was hard to close because the buckles are very soft. The entire box is made from very thin soft plastic.
B00062ZNWM|4|recieved item a day earlier than projected,outstanding!.first of all proform started recently manufacturing these in aluminum instead of the brassy zinc of the originals.somewhat dissapointed,also for some reason there is no provision for the vacuum port on the metering blocks.(vacuum advance).lastly i would recommend to test fit all screws and bolts before final assembly,threads felt a bit sketchy in my expirience.all in all it does look nice when assembled,havent installed yet which is why the 4 star rating applied.i hope this helps.
B005FN207I|5|Fits great. A little hard to hook on seats with power. The motor under the seat makes it a little hard but once you get them hooked it stays in place.
B00EY8A7CK|5|Light arrived in good working order. Wires are thicker than a previous replacement I had, which is nice for custom plugs.
B008N6AQXO|5|awesome price arrived very quickly and their is a large amount of them looks like very good quality they should stand up to the abuse i will be giving them
B00802FCC6|5|All as advertised, fast, simple, and truly plug and play. Fast shipping and great company.
B000T2Z7GG|1|Unfortunately, I didn't try to use this pump immediately upon receipt.  I waited until preparing for a trip to try inflate a small bike tire.  The first clue of a problem was what happens when the pump is attached to a tire valve.  The pump handle rises by itself and air leaves the tire.  When I try to pump air into the tire, pushing down causes air to go into the tire and raising the handle lets the air back out of the tire.  Whatever type of check valve is supposed to close to keep air in the tire is defective.  By the time I returned from my trip, the return period had expired, so this pump will probably go to the trash.  It isn't possible to open it to try repair it, and adding some oil hasn't helped.
B000IYAZSK|4|At least it fits my Cherokee, but is a product of a little bad quality, it has those clips that held together the base and the lift, that is not quite good... but besides that is fairly a good product.
B00A740VQM|4|All the tools provided were a good starter kit for new RC racer.  The case should be a semi soft case the hard case breaks to easy.
B000E81VN8|5|There are plenty of reviews so I'll just say the essentials: (1) we got this for a 2013 Toyota Highlander (second generation). It fits perfectly length-wise (turned sideways) behind the second row of seats, with the third row seat down. (2) It fits fine, in the long direction, with either one of the third-row seats up; so you can still use one of the 3rd row. (3) it also fits horizontally, sideways across the back of the second row of seats, although there is not enough space for it to entirely fit *behind* a fully upright third row of seats. (4) the non-slip base works well for it to stay in place, on top of the Toyota rubber cargo mat ([[ASIN:B009AIK1N4 Cargo Liner for the 2011-2013 Toyota Highlander-New, Oem-Genuine Toyota Accessory!]]). (5) the adjustable pockets are great and move very easily to hold grocery bags and other things in place.<br /><br />As others noted, it has a strong rubber odor out of the box. We aired it for 3 days outside and then did not notice the smell at all in the car. It's well priced and we'd happily buy it again.
B001RETV44|5|good job,good item.thanks
B002ZI84F8|5|Awesome looking cover. I've been asked repeatedly where I bought this cover. I love it
B003CJWOXC|5|did fit
B00OONXLUU|5|love this light bar.  wish the correct brackets came with it.  but i understand to keep the cost down the brackets are sold seperately.
B00L8257K2|1|Bought two of these keys to replace my stock 2000 landcruiser keys.  On one of the keys the screw hole doesn't align at all, making it worthless.  On the other key the stock screws from my old keys (NOTE, the keys from Discount Keyless don't come with their own screws) doesn't fit.  I can't find screws that fit anywhere.<br /><br />With both keys the program unit doesn't sit correctly in the fob so that the buttons on the program unit are very recessed inside the fob.<br /><br />Finally, both keys have slightly different horizontal groove patterns than my stock keys.  Actually they also have different groove patterns from one another, neither of which perfectly match my stock keys.  Still, with some wiggling I was able to get both keys into the ignition.<br /><br />I tried to return the keys but Discount Keyless wont take them back because I had them cut by a locksmith before realizing how bad these keys were made.
B0041CE47I|4|I've used these for faring bolts on my 1998 Honda VFR. Anywhere the faring screws directly into the frame with a rubber grommet, the OEM part breaks eventually.<br /><br />These are not as sturdy as the OEM part (at least on my VFR), but they're dirt cheap. After many times of removing and putting the faring back on, they'll start to pull apart. When they do, simply throw out the old one and put a new one in. You get ten for close to the price of a single OEM.<br /><br />I bought a pack three years ago and I only have two left. (A few were donated to other motorcycles.)  I'm placing another order now.
B00EC0YNMA|5|fits perfect
B001RAQGXC|2|did not work
B007P14NPU|3|Excellent product.
B00HVGG95Q|4|but too expensive for what it is.
B00KJLMPXU|3|Unfortunately these we're the wrong ones I wanted the front bonnet lifts !! Luckerly the back door lifts we're shot so used these one otherwise all ok
B000CAINEI|5|The thing is easy to use, relatively cheap, and it works.  Also pretty easy to store.  No flaws 1 month into owning it.
B0058TF7DI|4|Does the job - a bit of a pain to untangle it in order to attach (the hooks on it hook into its own rope creating a spider web sort of thing...so take off the hooks - spread out the net and then reattach the hooks (quick and easy)
B006LIZ3D4|5|Love them
B00E4VY9H6|1|This antenna works alright, its nothing near the stock one I had stolen off my car. Also, its been a month or two and the antenna went from black to orange! Wow! Junk.
B00496Y4IK|2|Fit my 2003 Silverado 2500HD 6.0 perfectly however it starting leaking from the metal elbow that's pressed in to the water pump within 2 weeks.<br />We will see how easy it is to exchange with Amazon for a new one.
B003EOFFI6|4|Excellent cover and does the job.  It CAN be popped off very easily thereby making it easy to steal.  Other wise it is great.  Prompt shipping.
B00EKTIEVO|5|Great price
B007PMY3MM|5|Pads are a little stiff at first, but they loosen up. Good quality, logo adds to the inside on the seatbelt. Very short shipping time. I've always had good luck with Amazon. But you have to have a little savy before you buy.
B005DM2NN2|5|Good stuff, works well and I would recommend to my friends.
B00NROQK1Y|5|LOVE IT!  came on time.. Looks just like the picture.. Very easy to put on....
B009YD4F14|1|The harness/pins of the tool do not fit/match the receiver on the two cars I bought this tool for:<br />  1987 BMW 535i and 1988 BMW 635csi.<br />It appears to be the wrong tool but has &#34;For BMW (1982-2001)&#34; printed on the tool.<br />  Also, I ordered it on November 1, 2013.<br />It took until December 4,2013 to arrive from China and<br /> came in a zip-lock bag with some foam wrapped around it inside a flimsy plastic bag.<br />It appears undamaged but pretty poor packing for overseas shipping.<br /> Still waiting to see what their return policy is and will report how that all works out.
B002IYJUES|5|I purchased these for a Toyota Avalon to help protect the very light-colored mats that came with the car.  The color of these mats match very well and fit ok.  They are very thin but I don't care about that.  If you are looking for really good quality mats, these are not for you.  If you are looking for something supplemental then I would recommend them.  They are holding up fine after six months of use and some spot cleaning.
B001IZIFNK|5|Excellent product at first glance,  I will have a better idea of its quality after the winter is over and I take it off.
B000BKC2D2|1|The kit seemed old to me. The small piece of fabrick that contains the catalyst was dried out. I wasted my money.
B0028ZKMM6|5|Just what the doctor ordered for my motorcycle, a loud horn for  that two thousand pound car that is approaching towards me...This horn is not weak, and commands attention....<br />Safe riding.<br />Average Joe  5 STARS ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆ ☆
B006QAY32O|5|Fast installation.  Went onto the car quickly and as advertised.  Entire job, prep, wiring, install hitch and hitch cover took about an hour. (or 2 beers) Very easy to do.  Hitch cover for Cadillac SRX is not included in this package.  It is a GM part only, but easily available online through GM parts sites.
B0080EQ3QS|2|Bought these for a 2014 Toyota 4Runner. The shipping time was excellent and the installation went great. Where the product fails is in the reliability. After they all got synced to the car by the Toyota dealer, they failed to register within 30 miles. I took the car back to Toyota to get re-synced, which they did, but then they failed again in about the same distance. All tire pressures are within the recommended range (towards upper end of range). I am beyond frustrated with these because they are fine when I start the car, but they fail within the first fifteen minutes of driving. I would send them back, but it would cost me more to have the tires unmounted, change the sensor, and remount. The cost of the sensors are minor is the scope of the real cost.<br />I wold not recommend these. Buy OEM
B000ET525K|5|don't pay $10 at an oil change place to fix a nail hole, buy this kit and do it yourself. even women could handle using this kit!!
B0074V53TQ|5|Excellent product. fast shipping. A++
B000C9RIRW|1|Installed this part on my vehicle approximately at the beginning of Dec. 2014 and the on/off switch portion of the cruise control assembly began to malfunction  on or around the month of March - Apr.2015 timeframe. I verified it's the on/off switch portion of the cruise control circuit. Now I can't get a replacement. I had to use an external switch  to make it work. This replacement is extremely poor quality material. The original switch had the same problem but lasted  years before malfunctioning.
B003S1RQ2S|5|excelent
B002P8JHSQ|5|Great
B00A93S76C|5|Exactly what I expected.  Works great with my new Honda!  The chrome seems to be good quality and does not rub off.
B00EA0ZB7I|4|Okay so I got them and I had no instructions and when upon inspection they had a few dings here and there very small but I notice stuff like that but over all great product and I can't wait to use them at night on the beach.
B00449KAJO|4|It works, easy to install.
B0007ZAJRM|5|Delivered and works as promised.
B000C2DWZQ|1|Insulation is terrible, get bleed over interference over the FM Band radio. Would not recommend. I also get a phantom code from time to time about the fuel injectors...never happened until I installed these wires. Went with a different brand an it all cleared up.
B000NCOKZQ|5|Does the job. Makes it so I don't have to take my seat off my bike just to plug in the trickle / charger to keep my battery fully charged at all time.
B007Y8XZ58|5|The magnetically latched, sturdy storage box gave some clue as to what I was in for. I bought it mainly for the FM Radio and Playback thru 3.5 wire or Bluetooth. (My old phone burns the battery hard when Bluetooth is on, so I prefer the direct wire.) The Scala Rider has been a &#34;no hassle&#34; device, performing everything it advertises and more with very little need for me to do anything but turn it on.<br /><br />I had previously bought the best Sena unit, but never could get it to work - even after 20 hours of running through &#34;fixes&#34; via their Help functions. My initial &#34;Help&#34; inquiry received this reply, &#34;You're not doing it right. Read the manual. Hold the big button in for 2 seconds and it will start...&#34;  I have an advanced degree. I can tell the big button from the small button. I can count to 2 seconds. If the thing had turned on, I would not have had to contact the &#34;Help&#34; ppl. It took me a long time to get across to them that their unit did NOT WORK.  Very upsetting. Maybe that was just a bad unit, but it functioned similarly to a rock with a wire coming out of it.<br /><br />The Cardo Scala Rider G9 needs such a nice storage box since they send you FOUR helmet mount bases - two for clamping and two for gluing. You also get TWO chargers, TW0 3.5 connectors, Pocket bags (nice to carry a fully charged unit in your pocket on long trips., Sticker Mic's, Boom Mic's, etc..  i.e., each unit comes with all the options. So, you can mount the bases on FOUR different helmets, say Summer and Winter or such. The unit slides and snaps solidly onto the base.<br /><br />The Sena Units had larger and  fewer buttons, but maybe a bit of confusion getting each one to to what you want. The Scala's lower 3 buttons are more difficult to hit than the top with gloves on, but, if you push the lower center button briefly, it activates the Voice Command and you just tell it what you want. That works well, but, as other reviewers have mentioned, you have to wait for the voice confirmation as you work thru. However, going 60 mph down the highway, it's pretty nice to just push a button and tell the unit what you want.<br /><br />Maybe it's my old ears or helmets, but most of these units can barely be heard at highway speeds. I would like more volume, but maybe that'd be injurious to one's ears. Living in the country, for me the radio is weak as you leave big cities (say 40-50 miles out). I have an old Sony armband radio with a Dx function that I can plug in for long, out of town drives.<br /><br />This is pretty much an easily installed, easily used, versatile device which has been reliable, so far, for me, in spite of long runs in the rain and high winds.
B00KTIQU4I|5|Very easy to replace.  Was not able to transfer  my red panic button but it's a perfect fit.
B006W2Q306|5|Recd decals late by delivery date but ok<br />Decals look great installed easy very well<br />Satisfied thanks will surely recommend to<br />Others
B009B9H112|1|I ensured that the product I bought said specifically that it would fit my vehicle. When I received it, it wasn't even close. I have returned it with a full refund. I have a 2013 Passat, and it was too big.
B002WLP2LC|4|So far so good, they are bright enough that I could see a Buck and two other deer when I drove around the park & ride ben about a week ago (scared the crap out of me lol). I havent really tested them other than that, I know they make my car look cool at night when I'm just turning my car on and they pop on right before i turn on my 10K Evo Xenon bulbs lol, but these are a great product, great lights with nice blue color
B0041RPGQ6|1|I could not even feel the heat. Very disappointed. Returned it.
B0026MAU46|5|My wheel bearing went and took out the hub on my 04 Outback, great replacement part at half the price of the local parts stores!
B009FNX0DC|5|the step bars shipped very quickly. They mounted easily and perfectly.  They are solid and look great. I would certainly recommend these step bars.
B0060CVRI6|5|I purchased these to give my Challenger a little individuality among the tons around here. I have to admit, it worked out great. Very easy installation. Took the mechanic less than 5 mintues. You could do it yourself if you have the right tools on you. No problems or complaints so far.  Very fast shipping, also. I ordered some items about two weeks and one week respectively and have not received either yet. I received this order in about 3 days. If they have any other items I'm looking for, I will definitely buy. I recommend this seller. I thought that would be useful since this isn't an Amazon Prime item.
B000E28C7M|5|Excellent just what I expected.
B00BMWZQHC|5|This was a great addition to my bike. I love the fact that when you press the brakes once there is 4 flashing red lights and then a full red light. The product was easy to install and can be done by anyone, don't need special skills.
B00BGUMF9W|5|Perfect replacement for original.
B006X8D9N8|5|Nice Grill just know the upper holes are going to need sheet metal screeds as previouse post have said
B00LC06RWM|5|Everything I expected. Lights are very bright. The metal bodies are a plus.
B006MX8196|4|It's much better than anything you can buy at autozone or pepboys for the same price. It fits the seats really well. The headrest are the only part that seems to loosen easily, but again, for the price you can't really ask for anything better.
B00HVHA0EG|4|Perfect fit. Does exactly what I bought it for. Protects my very expensive Lexus key fob from damage. Had to replace entire key before and cost over $600. Mechanic cracked last one I  bought in the weak area where screw goes in so I bought a new case here on Amazon for less than $5. This cover will do a great job protecting it. Easy to install and arrived in 2 days. Lexus logo would have been a nice bonus but not a deal breaker. I bought a nice key chain on here as well so problem solved! Would recommend for anyone looking to protect a several hundred dollar item for less than $10.
B00BRMIBME|1|Excellent fit , shipping was fast  ,  all good now
B000C5DZWI|5|I think you can get better deal. Received it in great condition and works well.
B008G2ZK2W|4|fit was ok. replaced broken tail lights
B0089GTC92|5|They have the bright blue/white look on my daytime driving lights... Also used them for my reverse lamps, but they don't work as well... Wish they were soft white...
B007VR7EYU|5|Wow is this stuff sticky. But that is just what you want it to be. So it will stay where you put it !
B002EADRA4|5|replaced stock lights.easy fit and look great.very good price.ships fast.
B001QIUGVI|5|This is a professional grade instrument. Works great!
B000C16XDK|4|Works as it should.Used 1/4x1 inch bolts with it and all is well.If you use silicon paste in the rubber window tracks so window wont bind the regulator will last.
B00KVMV66E|3|The coat was returned for credit because it was too small in the hip area. The coat was purchased in petite XL, no option for a larger size in petite.
B003WDMUC8|2|Don't buy these they are hard to apply and don't fit the curve of the wheel right. Pay a little more and get the kind that traces the wheel, I'm stuck with half my stickers because I immediately ripped them off
B00029X3SK|5|I think these lights are good for the price.  I'm not a serious off-roading person, so these lights will do just fine for the brightness I need and look on my jeep. Much cheaper than at the local auto store near me.
B000IY9HK2|5|Provides smooth stops.
B008XN7NUG|2|At first, I was cussing this piece of equipment, seriously. Had trouble finding the key programming features for the very first car I worked on, a USA 2008 Ford Focus. The system auto detected the car as a 2008. After spending much time messing around, I noticed that I could manually select &#34;2008.25&#34; which is apparently a different car all together (my 2008 was built in late 2007, so 2008.25 doesn't make any sense to me..). Perhaps Ford sold the USA 2007 model in other countries until 2008?<br /><br />Tech support is not good. While I didn't contact them directly, I did view the forums pretty thoroughly and found that most posts were not responded to and those that were had vague answers.<br /><br />The documentation with the unit is useless.<br /><br />This DS708 is considerably slower navigating from menu to menu than the Genisys scanner I used to use. It can take 60-90 seconds to go from choosing the module you want to communicate with to getting to the next menu. This is frustrating as hell if you don't know which module you need to communicate with to perform a job (PATS on many Fords is apparently controlled from the Instrument Cluster - at least according to the DS708).<br /><br />The web browsing is SLOWWWW. The unit bugs you to register every time you turn it on and when I tried to register from the unit itself, I kept getting &#34;network error, try again later&#34;. I ultimately had to go to a PC to do the registration. The time to download and install a 22 megabyte update (on my high speed internet connection) was around 10 minutes. There were around 20 of these updates I could perform, right after removing it from the box.<br /><br />Many forum posts claimed that the 8GB SD Card which is included is too small. Many people were talking about upgrading to 16GB. I haven't used it enough to know personally if that is the case.<br /><br />There were a number of posts talking about corruption of the onboard software and the need to reinstall or restore the SD card from a backup.<br /><br />I've owned this scanner now, a couple of OTC Genisys/Mac Mentor units, and the Auto Enginuity suite. For whatever reason, the Auto Enginuity has always been hit or miss. Sometimes features work (like an ABS bleed or a PATS program), sometimes they don't. A laptop is hard to maneuver inside a car, so it's not great for that reason. They nickel and dime you to death with software upgrades and manufacturer specific programs. Of the three units, so far, I like the Genisys/Mentor the best. The DS708 probably comes a close second, despite it's issues and the Auto Enginuity has been the least helpful of my scan tools.
B001EEW9LO|3|these do not fit lower only on top
B0019IGRRM|5|👍
B000C7ZDQM|4|I bought this for my '04 Jeep Wrangler and accidentally broke it during installation. These little switches are tricker than they should be. I bought another one and it installed correctly.
B0038ZRNYU|2|The connectors do not fit on 2001 Ford Escape. Quality is not higher as appears. I would recommend to try finding the Ford OEM parts.
B00IUV881Y|5|It's a battery and it does it's job. Simple to install, fit my wife's 2006 Honda Rebel 250 just right. We never check the digital screen cause again, it's a battery and you shouldn't have to worry about it. We've had it running for 2-3 months now and no complaints.
B00IUV881Y|5|Bought it to replace my battery on my KLX250SF and worked perfectly.  Haven't had any issues.  Well worth it.
B007FQQURO|5|This inexpensive car part, is the same part that goes into my Vtwin motorcycle, a 1.8 kw Spyke starter. Great price. Hopefully it does the trick. If not, it is only 11 bucks.<br /><br />If you bikers are having a problem, drill a small hole in solenoid cover 1/8&#34; dia. and insert a small screwdriver pushing the plunger upon start up. It will get you started bypassing the solenoid, providing it is the solenoid that is faulty.
B002GZ6WOU|4|Yes i purchased these since i want the look of a hint of blue & wanted a quality bulb. I believe these that are Made in Japan qualify for this. When installed as compared to stock bulbs these are whiter,not yellow like oem, I just wish they were more blue.. Other then that not problem. Wish Amazon would store handlling the H9's also because we HAD to go elsewhere for the H9's
B004W97DZA|3|Pretty good product -  a little expensive for the quality.  I had to return one because it had a crack on the corner; which was quickly replaced... but had to return the entire set of two of them.... After getting the replacements, and put them on, I did notice about a week later that moisture got inside one of them on the bottom - - impossible to get out, so that's the way they have to stay.... So I'm not sure if one of them was just defective or if it wasn't sealed properly, so I gave them 3 stars because for the price , you would think they would be more durable and last a long time... I wouldn't order this brand again for this or any other vehicle.. Would try a different brand..
B005T3WKHY|5|Came quickly and works great! Easy to install. all the radio channels come in clearly!<br />looks cool too.<br />I like.
B00BQ0BWUK|5|Worked well
B000K36BCI|5|Man, these sure do hold the sunglasses good!
B00EQ01UQ8|5|These lights were fairly easy to install and are very bright. We have had a lot of rain here since I have installed them and the have held up great. The housings are definitely water resistant. Very good product. I used these as under-tailgate running and brake lights.
B000PUIM1Y|1|I ordered a transmission filter kit to include 1 filter & 1 gasket. There was no gasket in the box.
B000BLEQ0I|4|Installed on a 2000 Tundra 4WD Limited Access Cab with factory mud flaps no problem. I had anticipated needing to do a little extra work, or switch out the flaps due to the note that it wouldn't fir with factory flaps, and was quite pleased at how easily they installed with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />Good:<br />Price<br /><br />Easy of installation<br /><br />Bad:<br />Metal is thin - these are not in the least bit 'beefy'<br /><br />Paint on one of the brackets had been scraped off (prior to shipping)<br /><br />Welds on the connections inside the tubes were sloppy - one of them was bad enough that it lightly interfered with the connecting bolt.<br /><br />Steps say Smittybilt on them - Drivers can be read from the inside, passenger from the outside.<br /><br />Pictures in the instructions seem to be photocopied black and white - not the clearest.<br /><br />Installation note - The front bolt brackets are basically bolts with a metal arm attached which lets you guide them into place - as soon as you figure that out, the installation is very simple.<br /><br />All in all, I was super happy - for $150 delivered 2 days later I'm not complaining - but if I were in a showroom or something where I could have examined other bars, I would have picked something thicker.
B00B50HN18|4|this product was sent out very quickly. it fits great but filter screen does not fit very well and could at the least be sent with replacement bolts
B008D976QG|3|Glasses don't really stop the wind from getting in your eyes. Alright for a cruiser with some type of windshield.
B00538KEE6|4|EZ to apply, and is on the window securely. I got it in remembrance of my late father, a WWII Pacific Navy Vet.
B00075XCCG|4|I installed this with my 8yr old son and a standard scissor type frame jack in 30 minutes.  Bolts all lined up and went in fine.  I put in the center 2 first and the outside (3 each side) lined right up as well.  Did not need to take the muffler down.  Just the spare tire.  Its one SOLID receiver.  Used a torque wrench as well.  This is important.  Recommend!  Ed
B008CE0OHA|5|a well made carrier that is priced right , very happy with it ....
B00BQYCIVI|4|Great product. It dries my car well. The only downside is that you WILL need more than one. Some reviewers claim they can dry an SUV with this one towel. That is simply not true. I would say it soaked up about 85% of the water on my car (which is impressive), but you will need an additional towel.
B00BTGSID0|4|This is a very good microfiber towl, I have tried the cheap ones from autozone, shucks, and other auto parts stores, don't waste our time or money on these cheap microfiber towels, spend a little extra and buy some good quality stuff. I have purchased a lot of products from the  chemical guys, and they all work very well. I have detailed boats, trucks, cars and trucks using these microfiber towels and the hold up very well, I have found if you wash them with the chemical guys microfiber washing machine soap they last a lot longer, and they come out of the wash a lot cleaner too.
B00EUICSGW|5|It's really neat. High quality. Looks good and doesn't hide the license plate stickers the way many holders do. I would highly recommend this.
B00JW3068C|4|I bought these for my RV interior.  No heat is given off from these and they will undoubtably outlast me.  I only gave these 4 stars because the flat ones are not as bright as the incandescent bulbs.  I should have bought the round led bulbs for my application.
B00CH4GYQG|4|Great replacement battery for Jon deer tractor
B000AMBHG4|5|we bought a used trailer and found this type detector wasn't working and in fact the wires to it were cut.  they<br />beep after 5 years requiring replacement so the previous owner probably cut the wires to eliminate the noise.<br />anyway, we ordered this one which looks identical to the original and it works well.
B001MYWBF0|5|I haven't had any problems with this charger. It charges all batteries fast. I like it gives you a battery percentage so you know when it's done. This is now my go too charger.
B0019II9H8|5|Quick product delivery, product was easy to install (as advertised), product works superbly and was VERY easy to install, and is a factory spec!
B00AKX9OOK|4|The price can't be beat, and the products are decent.  The plastic is softer than it should be, in my opinion.  Still, it hold the fender liner and under carriage liner in place.<br /><br />Shipment was fast, and as I mentioned, best price I could find!
B0049CGIAG|5|Exactly what I need to stop my hitch from slamming in the tongue while towing our boat.  No noise anymore when leaving a light or braking.
B00H1ES6S6|5|Perfect replacements for both my interior floor lighting in my GMC truck AND my 4-watt Malibu landscape light bulbs!<br />(replaces any 194 automotive bulb)<br /><br />My 12-volt landscape lights now look fantastic & cool - NOT dim and wasteful.<br />For the first time in 10 years, I can see my sidewalk at night.<br /><br />This is my 3rd order of Cutequeen LED lights (different styles/configurations)<br />I have not run into a single dud yet. (flip them around [like a battery] if they don't light at first)<br /><br />These things are great! I've now replaced ordinary ugly bulbs in 2 cars, my truck, and around the house.
B004O5B6XM|5|Durable, cuts hard snow, lightweight and breaks down easily for backpack. Best value out there for this type of shovel,
B007ZCQD9S|5|I installed this on my Concours 14 motorcycle, and it functions perfectly. Set, Resume, Accelerate, Deccelerate, Disengage on braking and clutching all work. Makes riding the bike on long trips a lot more enjoyable.
B00GN53R4W|5|Work great, time saver!
B00I0O6I4U|4|Runs great..
B00CG354A0|4|Accidentally ordered the G3500EU, but i bought an adapter and was still able to use it. My battery was dead and I was able to squeeze a few weeks use out of it before I had to buy a new one. Charged 100% in less than 3hrs as stated.  If I had a plug at work though, I would have never bought one. Still keeping my old battery charged in case I or someone else needs a jump. CAn be used without removing battery.
B00UZ0OHIQ|1|There are no warnings about the APP not being available outside US. The company doesn't answer my contact attempts even to tell me if there's an alternative to make it work or if I threw money out.<br />Useless, so far.
B005VFWOOE|5|Really cool sticker. Great price, quick delivery. Will I order again, yes! good quality product, good size for my truck. Lots of compliments.
B00707B9AG|5|you will love the power .
B000676MJA|5|fit and works well
B004ZF39T0|5|Awesome lights are super easy to install.  Perfect upgrade for anyone to do
B005UTS6FW|3|I bought two of the wipers for my car. They are so cute and worked really well, but after about 2 months, I noticed that one started to fade alot... it was almost white.
B003B44C6U|4|The bag is sturdy and provides excellent protection. My only complain is the zipper that is hard to slide sometimes, especially around the corners. It should  use a zipper with bigger teeth for easier closing.
B005FO2KZY|1|Was not what we expected so we went to auto zone and bought the item we needed
B0063MIBRS|1|the projectors in these are horrible!!! you cant even see the road in front of you at night with out your high beams on. However this seller could be a good guy, this product is no good!
B002WBQC5M|5|Fit was perfect, and install was cake. The only tough part is mounting the MAF in the neck of the lid. Like the instructions say, HEAT is your friend. This cleaned up the engine bay nicely and opens up the intake tract for a nice cold intake charge.
B001CF1A7O|5|Pros:  Very sturdy, strong hitch<br />  Fantastically mobile and useful<br />  The D-Ring is solid and the removable shackle unscrews nicely<br /><br />Cons:  None<br /><br />Sometimes Smittybilt gets a bad rap from true, hard-core offroaders, but I must say I'm very impressed with the materials quality and the quality of the design of this Smittybilt hitch.  I wanted a removable hitch and liked the price of the Smittybilt.  In this case, I must say that I came from the price....but left impressed with the quality.  Well done Smitty!
B002L15W6S|5|My new 2014 Forester has grey cloth seats so I wanted some cheap covers to protect them from stains and dirt. I don't care about Ed Hardy or the Koi print. I actually prefer if it was just plain black lol.<br /><br />BUT heck, they were $8 bucks each shipped so I ordered one. They fit very snug on a 2014 Forester, but hey they fit. It's not a perfect fit, but good enough for $8 bucks. I can't complain.<br /><br />So I ordered another for the passenger seat. Meh, I don't care for the design, but the price and quality offsets the look. As long as they keep my seats looking new underneath when it comes time to sell/trade in my vehicle, I'm okay with it.<br /><br />Now I don't have to worry when it comes time for an oil change when the mechanic climbs in my car with greasy dirty hands, etc..<br /><br />Oh the graphics are very bold and crisp. If you like the design, its bright and pops.<br /><br />If you have pockets behind your driver or front passenger seat, you will not be able to use them anymore since this seat cover will block them on the back. I don't mind this because I know the entire back side of my seats are protected too from the rear passengers.<br /><br />Hope this helps.
B002R12QPM|5|Has to replace the originals that came with my 2005 chevy tahoe due to rocks breaking it.  Actually seems brighter that the original.
B009AM6KBC|4|This thing turned my 2013 wrangler into a sports car. I really can't believe the sound and the pep of the 3.6 now. Not a good product for water forging,but on dry land,it can't be beat. Looks real pretty under the hood. Even my wife said it looks super cool. She did ask me why I wanted my brand new jeep to sound like that. I just giggled and smiled.
B001F0M0C0|5|These are the coolest ever! This makes launching and loading so much easier. If you have a boat & trailer that uses tiedowns, you will love these and wish they'd been invented sooner.
B001JT0CGI|5|The product is excellent! A+.
B0055DQ2RC|4|Better quality than I expected, and keyed alike which is hard to find in this style lock. I have a Masterlock of the same type and it seems to be a little bit higher quality than these but don't take me wrong, these locks do the job, and are tons cheaper than a 3 set of the masterlocks
B00I9JC3N6|1|Doesn't fit cup holder. Please re-size the base.
B0012ZEZ8A|5|I recently bought a used car and I needed some cleaning supplies. This got the job done and it included very good quality products. The plastx is what I used at first i bought a cheaper brand of the same item and it didnt work at all, you visibly see the difference against cheaper brands. You get what you pay for. Also the micro fiber equipment is a good addition relieves you of having to buy more things.
B002UCADGW|5|Was an easy install in my View 24G.  Just removed Winnebago's two boxes and put this one in their place.  I was a little leery of the plastic construction of the Box itself, but it seemed to work out OK
B0033TUFSC|5|Product came quickly as described by seller. Appears to be above average quality for the price. Easy to mount on your hitch receiver. Would recommend this product for customizers.
B002G11GOA|5|it's just what i need v e r y n i c e p r o d u c t
B008YFTB4E|1|Not only did the instructions (as well as warning labels on items) have misspelled words and improper phrasing, they were very difficult to decipher.  I installed the lights in every possible combination according to their diagrams and they would not work.  I returned them within 30 mins of opening the box and attempting the install.
B006CQLSM0|5|I towed a 3000 lb. trailer from New Jersey to Colorado and the transmission temperature never exceeded 190 degrees. I was more than satisfied and have already recommended your products to my friends who also tow on occasion. I also installed the differential cover and was very pleased with its performance as well.
B009RWPUEI|5|Did the job
B000EW0KHW|5|This is for OBD1 cars up to 1995.  1996 and newer will not work with this.  I got this for my 1995 Mazda 626 4-cylinder automatic (with Ford EEC-IV).  It worked like a charm the first time!  You can also use this to clear continuous memory codes (Keep Alive Memory) which is nice.  You can also use this to run a cylinder balance test, KOEO test, and KOER tests if your car is capable of it. This thing has been the best $25 I spent for my 626.  There are video tutorials on YouTube for using it with your Mazda 626.<br /><br />If you're wondering if you should get the extension cord you should if you can afford it.  It does make things like ten times easier with the live test inputs you might have to do like turning your steering wheel, pressing the clutch, brake, or other inputs in order to run the KOER test.  In order to do those inputs you need to see the prompt code to do them.  That means running from the side of the engine bay into the car to perform those inputs (within 2 seconds of being prompted).  It's easier if you're sitting in the seat with the reader in your hand, not feeling like Wylie Coyote running around your car.  Get the extension cord if you plan on trying to run the more advanced diagnostics.<br /><br />The manual it comes with is thick (only because it's split into multiple languages) and might take you reading a couple times to digest all the info and procedures.  Out of the whole manual there's only about 10 pages that you have to read and the rest are code descriptions.  They have a long list of compatible cars and the Mazda 626 is not listed.  I even emailed Innova about it and they didn't seem too interested in adding my car to the list because it's only for specific years (1993-1995), specific engine (2.0L), and transmission (Automatic).<br /><br />If you currently have to count the check engine light flashes and your car is NOT OBD2... then you'll want to see if you can use this because it's a huge time and frustration saver.  Worth every penny.nny.
B004UP64E2|4|This is a good ramp. The build quality is good, the welding was done well. Its aluminium so its very light, easy to transport. The ramp is able to support the weight of my gsxr 1000. it comes with straps but there are not heavy duty.
B00M09WKYI|3|Nice jersey to wear when your not on the bike.
B00F4V4K60|5|used it on a 2008 to check airbag code and it worked flawlessly.
B001EP2904|5|fits good, looks good too!
B00G4FNG9W|5|these tial external wastegates are fantastic at controlling boost,i have this currently installed on my wrx running 21psi<br />i also use an electronic boost control solenoid,even with ebcs in cold weather i used to overboost like crazy<br />ever since i got my tial external wastegate it has ever happened again these are top notch when it comes to boost control<br /><br />fit and finish is also very nice plus its made in the usa!
B00DUN9QJK|5|The two sensor unit looks out and down for great sensitivity.<br />Batteries last a long time. Daylight sensitive ....if outside will not trigger<br />If there is ample daylight. Comes in a few colors (white, black, bronze) that I know of.
B006QH56GO|5|Great battery
B002R8HN1W|2|The seat cover itself is plush and very comfortable, and would be wonderful on any car that does not have side impact airbags.  It does however advertise that it is safe with side airbags, which we felt was not true.  The straps to hold the cover on the side go directly across the airbag on our Honda Civic, which could interfere with deployment.  When we requested a return of the cover, the seller stated that in their testing, the stitching on the straps was found to tear away from the cover on airbag deployment, allowing normal operation.  In our opinion, this causes a safety concern from the buckle and strap being possibly thrown into the car occupants at high speed.  The seller did accept our return, and was prompt with the refund.  I would rate this cover much higher if it was not advertised to be used with side airbags.
B000JFN9WC|5|This a great tool for bleeding brakes. highly recomend this tool.
B005VFWOOE|5|The day has arrived those permits in order and up to date the weapon type selected the blood hand on my car ,the zombie wont touch another car fight on
B0001XPC6S|5|GREAT SIZE TO KEEP IN MY CAR
B0051D3MP6|5|Excellent battery charger/tender.<br />No reason to spend more $$.<br />Does the job.
B007QBT0WA|2|didnt fit my car....
B009PF8EZE|5|Very quick to install, took longer to remove old part than install new, works very well absolutely no problem holding the hood open.  I waited on replacing the old shock and the hood closed on a tool at my mechanics shop and caused more headache than it was worth.  Replace before you get a dimple on your hood like we did.
B0013TM0Z0|2|Doesn't heat very well at all. Should have paid better attention to other reviews.
B000BYB2K2|2|They were awesome for 2 weeks... then they started streaking and after 5 weeks, I have to replace them.  Should have lasted way longer for the price.
B002HVGHIO|3|Here they can't even bother to specify the pressure range or what types of fluids (oil, air, water....) the unit is suitable for???  And the box is no better nor is the unit itself and the only paper in the box is the warranty slip.  Apparently SW isn't even proud enough of this product to print the part number on it let alone any other useful information.  It's probably a decent unit but you can't tell a 279A from a 279C!
B004VQMT6W|4|Bikes with accesories or ladies bike are difficult to mount, but doable. Otherwise it is stable and fits on most vehicles
B005JWCPC0|2|Material is weird feeling on your hands when trying to drive, not to mention the thing slips and you loose control over your steering wheel!!
B001O065FY|5|A must have for any enthusiast who tracks or changes wheels out frequently.
B0039YI894|3|Only Received 78' of loom, Not The 100 as advertized. I can't imagine that my shortage of 22' was just a mistake. Shortages go unnoticed by end users. a little here a little there add up to big profits. With countless amounts of these types of products being sold/used daily the measuring, cutting and packaging process is automated. This type of equipment just doesn't loose 22 feet, Settings are Changed. If this process is done by people.. and they can't measure & cut 100 feet Well, back to second grade for them!!
B007HFT034|4|Cant really tell from pictures of quality of an item, but this replacement is better than original. Would definitely recommend this
B002PUTC0M|5|WOW!  this is exactly what I was hoping it would be.  Quality everywhere you look.  The Large LCD readout is great!, I do not have to get out my readers to see it. The rubber housing and grip feels secure in your hand and if you drop it, no worries it is completely encapsulates the unit protecting it from damage.  Molded into the rubber housing is a loop so you can hang it easily from any hook keeping it off the floor.
B00CGFPW64|5|I work in a body shop and I use it everyday. Thank you!
B002MUY3KO|4|Does exactly what description indicates...  good value choice.  Right now I use one unit to keep multiple batteries charged.  Might buy another of the same unit to reduce cable switching.
B00OGN85UO|4|only been on for a short time...so far, so good
B000E300C6|5|Makes my seats look new and smell new also. Goes on shinny and dries to dull finish. Works great in my BMW.
B005M1AVFQ|3|This documentation provided on the accompanying disc is nearly unintelliglble.  Other than that, the product works okay when used with Torque Pro software.
B00GO6TRBW|1|Sent it to  Rocco vision systems.  Would  not sense  anything  till about  a foot away and sometimes  not at all. You could  put  your  hand over the sensor  sometimes  it might  make  a couple  of beeps then quits  or nothing at all. It's  been a week since  they  got it waiting  for a call . Would not sense  a pole  or mall box tried  a garbage continer  sense  it once about  a ft away  tried  it again and knocked  it over didn't  sense  it. Maybe  I got a bad one. Also hole  saw  a little  to big sensors fit lose  would need to put some  rubber  glue  to hold snug. There's  also two dots on the end of sensor  big dot goes down but there isn't  any mention  of them in the instructions. I have a another hard wired  sensor  on my other truck works  great will sense a telephone  pole at 4 ft. And cost 65.00 on ebay. Also will see how customer service  goes. Will up date when rosco  contracts  me back and the problem  is resolved.
B00NXRY5GW|5|excelente
B005GS3XA0|5|Well made and just looks great on the bike. Nice extra touch to complete your motorcycle. This is actually the second one I've got.
B000CMKEV6|5|Easy to install and good fit.  Looks good on car. Contours to body of the vehicle very well.  No issues.
B000GZV24M|5|Good stuff!!
B000BMIQ4O|5|This is the best gauge/inflator out there.  It is almost $40 but worth every penny.  This is a REAL gauge/inflator and not a toy like many others.
B002L9DHX0|1|The barometer does not work but it makes a greater looking paper weight.
B005KVBU1M|4|Very high quality construction.  I used the measuring chart and bought a large.  It came and was too small.  Almost ripped my ears when trying to take it off.  I would go one or 2 size larger.  It is very big and has excellent protection.<br />I have to test the noise and ventilation after I get my larger size next week.<br />The price here on Amazon is really the best out there.
B001XLG5FE|4|I like my sunshade. It took a little long to get here. But am pleased with it.Gives the car personality.
B004EKYB7U|5|Exact OEM replacement. I bought it because I lost the little metal clip on mine. I read a review which said that the reviewers knob came without that so I was a bit worried. Mine came with the clip and took about two seconds to replace. Fits and functions perfectly.
B0018N6L3S|5|My Z3 is 15 years old and definitely needed new floor mats.  These are wonderful!  Good quality, perfect fit.  The embroidery looks just like the originals.  They arrived very quickly.  Am thrilled with this purchase!
B0052QVKW4|5|This Monster lanyrd is really sweet. I drink Monster all the time, have a big Monster fridge in my garage and if you are a Monster fan or collector like me this is a cool thing to keep yo keys on!
B001HNLTBS|1|this is the third pair that i went through and still nothing, this is the last time i order kensun HIDS...
B0035YGLZG|5|This switch has made it easier to set up my dust collection system. I use it when I trim out new houses.
B00KCHTXBI|3|Top rubs leg. But otherwise great!
B001LHVOVK|5|I bought this to use on my 2005 Honda Civic LX, it worked great. I cleared a code after fixing a bad O2 sensor.
B003KH9FRY|5|Tha D!! Flinttown representer
B0049MGCOI|5|Product arrived as expected. Works great!
B0015YBYCS|4|Our RV is stored outside in a very hot and dry climate. We need something tough that will withstand 100+ degree summers. These are high quality (we have two sets) and easy to install. They fit our 26.4'' tires perfectly, and unlike other reviewers, we did not find them hard to install at all.
B007V1U2Q8|5|Works great
B005J6JRMM|5|My dog chewed my seat belt buckle, so each time I wanted to use it, I had to manually get the button to pop up. With this extender, I don't have to adjust the buckle each time I buckle up.
B004RV0BAC|5|sturdy, good colors, easy to install, and reasonably priced.
B002WBVYZU|5|Is wider than the deminsions listed which makes it even better. Great straps and materail.  Very efficeint and easy to use internal pole that can be raised to various hights to keep cover up and water and snow from not accumulating in a depression.  It is independent of the cover so can position it ware you like.  Ver happy with this cover!
B001GS99OS|5|Good quality product. Easy installation. Shipper did a great job getting it to me.
B004CM8YJ6|4|I'm a mechanic, so after 2 weeks of daily use the button is finicky. Needs to be a little brother for what I use it for.
B00EU7QCWE|5|The video quality is excellent, and is very light weight,<br />attachment is very good, holds solid to the windshield.<br />Had a little problem finding all of the configurations,<br />since there is two parts to the configuration screen,<br />cold weather affects the operation of the camera,<br />it will not start recording immediately, if the camera<br />is subjected to low temperatures.<br />At this time, I have used this camera for one month.<br />Overall, price and quality of the video, this camera seems<br />to be the best to be found.
B003COTFS4|4|works good so far
B002DUPTUQ|5|The packing worked out perfect for my Big Gun EVO-U exhaust.  The packing material was thick, which filled the voids in the slip on.  It did drop the decibels down where it is tolerable.
B00E7WEFQ2|5|Okay, I love these eyelashes! I get so many compliments on my little smart car!  I have also had several people as me where I got them because they liked the way they look. Now I just need some big red lips to attach to my grille and she will be complete! I have heads turning and people smiling everywhere I go.
B000ONZT5E|5|Exactly what I needed. Works great.
B000EQP0M8|5|Parts has been working great since installed.  Would purchase again.  Installation was easy.  Nice product.  Replaced at 100,000 miles in vehicle
B0002M9QJM|5|Installed on 2003 Jeep TJ,recommended!!
B00JBICJH4|4|Kinda hard install, not perfect fit, but looks good from few feet away.
B000HEBR3I|4|the price on Amazon is best I have found for these little pumps.  They are very very handy things to have around.  delivery was prompt and i ordered more than one as i have found several uses for them.  I especially got it for cleaning out my aquarium.  if you have little stones in the fish tank or what ever you are pumping little debris can stop the impeller. Usually I can clear it out easy enough but if there i a lot of debris i like ot put a little 'netting over the businesss end of the intake kinda like a piece of nylon hosiery or such material. that is the only problem other than they can break if abused. my cat has knocked a couple of them down from a shelf and broken them.
B009DJMVCY|1|Part was correctly put on my saturn l200 2001, didn't respond what so ever, I strongly recommend a more reliable part from a more prestigious company.
B00180MXDI|5|Outstanding  Muffler I have a 1988 Nissan D21 hard body , This muffler is a perfect exact fit all the flange points lineup perfectly. I have mounted mufflers before and most are a nightmare not with this one perfect fit 30 minute job.one other part you may need is the flange gasket manufactured by Walker P/N 31311.
B007C5L3ZW|4|Very good. Fit perfect. Very very good price. Would recommend.
B003TSMQWU|5|This little ratchet has to be one of my most used tools.  I had one made by Husky that I used for years.  I broke it using it in a cramped space on something that had to be way above the torque grade of the tool.  Unfortunately, it seems Husky no longer makes it.  This one from VIM tools is exactly the same -- exactly.  Very happy with the purchase, the tool works great.<br /><br />It is a really great thing to have in the tool box, because it is so low profile and has a very fine tooth mechanism.  It will accept drive bits into the 1/4&#34; side, so I can use it as a 90 degree Phillips screwdriver or put my socket adapters in there and use it as a mini ratchet in tight spaces.
B000BYGDU6|5|This fit my 71' aircooled VW just fine.
B007P2F786|2|Not very good . Did not mount tightly on my stock bars on my 2007 Rhrino had to add duct tape on bars. Could not adjust to see behind , only could see the ground behind me . This may work on others , but the vibration  is very bad .would never recommend  to anyone.<br />Thank you,
B000E6JI6W|5|Oh..this ones a keeper...a small tote-able generator..air hose...and I love it.<br /><br />Very easy to carry !!!<br /><br />I bought it to pump up my car and bike tires at home..and this does the job PERFECTLY !..but it also starts the car..will run a light or phone or computer during a black out...or traveling..and has an emergency light to boot.<br /><br />I did have to charge it for a couple of days...and then......I pumped up my bikes 80 pp tires and the truck too !!.you just set the weight put the hose on and push the button !<br /><br />Its GREAT and I love it...you will to !!!
B001NOXFEU|5|good
B000WK5W0Q|1|The changing of the lenses is simple enough, however frames very uncomfortable. Too thick on the side.  With helmet on its too tight a fit.  Got an awful headache.  Wish I could return them!  Do not recommend.
B00LPMMYEM|4|Helmets are great. Love the pattern. The one downside is the goggles, they let in quite a bit of dust over time. It's nice they breathe but not so nice how much sand they let in. But for getting all these products together in a bundle for cheaper then any store could get me just a helmet in town that looks decent, I don't mind too much.<br /><br />Just need to find some better goggles now...
B0017S0BIK|5|I put these on my truck almost a year ago, and they still look new.  The trick is keep your truck waxed and they will be protected as well as your paint.
B000A79I2O|5|Good light
B00230K848|5|I bought this xr 80 cable for my xr70 big bar kit. Fits perfectly with a couple inches to spare. Functions perfectly too.
B001G4Z5J0|5|Very nice cargo carrier.  I have yet to find a flaw in it.
B000B7TFIK|5|This is a great buy. You get ten of these spark plugs for a John Deere tractor mower for the price of one.
B00ATXEPQI|5|Thank you very much
B000CQRJTC|5|it fits perfectly on 2005 Toyota Corolla LE kicking noise is gone Thank you
B0013ET1FM|5|Just what you expect from MSD.
B000CB2SY8|2|The Beck Arnley 101-3554 Tie Rod Assembly seems well made and is listed by many automotive parts sites as being proper for a Peugeot 505, but it does not fit.  The inner rod is about an inch too short.  With a cut-off blade in a circular saw I was able to cut 2.5 inches off the end of an old inner rod, cut 1.5 inches of the new inner rod and cut the threaded part off an old outer joint.  I assembled these into a working inner tie rod.  I cut about 1/3 inch threads off the new outer joint, and then installed the now workable pieces.
B002SQTRXK|4|Works great.  Totally worth the money.  Makes the fine tune adjustments that are needed for good brake performance easy and reliable.
B00J52R3AE|5|Works very well
B004KDEWTS|1|I REPEAT DO NOT BUY. LISTEN! Please! The screwdriver does not fit into the screws!!!!!!!! I have prime so I didn't have to pay for shipping so I didn't lose money there! Buttttttt! The only thing that works is the suction cup thing and opening tool.
B00MJ401WW|5|Fits my 04 expidition great!
B00480GYSA|5|I cannot speak to how long these will last, but both my wife and I LOVE these headlights.  They are extremely white, and honestly I don't see any blue, so if blue is in there...it isn't much.  The roadway ahead of us is lit up perfectly.  No complaints whatsoever.
B000IG3QUM|5|I have looked for these for a while before it dawned on me to check for them on Amazon. I use them on the dash of my lawn mowers, a great way to keep up with the time without stopping to pull up bulky sleeves to see a watch or pull out a cell phone. The clock comes with velcro adhered to the back for mounting, about 1/2 x 1/2 in. I opted to pull this off and go for a piece that covers the entire back just to make sure the vibration didn't shake it loose. The clock comes with a pull tab that is removed to power up the unit giving you the confidence of a fresh battery.
B004I13M3E|4|I was well pleased with the quality and workmanship for the price. Not 'perfect' like the OEM lights, but a heck of a lot cheaper and performs easily as well.
B000Q0NQIC|1|I bought this tank to upgrade my 16-gallon tank to an 18-gallon while I was replacing my fuel pump.  After the installation, I put 2 gallons in and drove a few miles to the gas station to fill it up.  It only accepted 13-1/2 gallons (15-1/2 total), and 2 seconds after the pump clicked off, about 2 cups of gas belched out of the filler hole onto the ground.  Thinking there's no way the tank was that undersized, I waited a while for things to hopefully settle and tried it again, but the pump clicked off immediately and again more gas poured out of the filler hole onto the ground.    I'm sure the reason for the regurgitated gas (the first time) is a chintzy little spring-loaded metal flap \\"valve\\" that's on the inside of the tank at he filler inlet.  The OE tank has an elaborate valving mechanism that keeps the gas inside the tank when it becomes full.  I ended up returning this one and finding a nice junkyard tank for $50.    I'd like to say that this tank would be usable if you didn't mind the reduced capacity, but the gas spillage is such a problem, you'd never want to fill it up.
B008UX97JE|4|I purchased these initially to use as sweat towels for working out but quickly realized they were strictly shop towels.  I do a lot of work on my cars and yard equipment and so far they have proven to be excellent shop towels.  They are well made and look like they will stand up to regular washing.
B003XZ0M84|4|Not as opaque as it looks in the picture, but it does block some sun.  Installs easily, but makes a whistling noise while driving if you have the window down at all.  Overall, product is ok but basically made out of \\"screen\\" material.
B00C4Q379Y|5|Worked extremely well on my bike
B00BITHWYE|5|Great product
B004AIIF9Q|5|Put in my Honda Accord and it works like I had expected.  I am very pleased with it so far.
B000A3GTCK|5|Quality hoses, worked perfectly.  Photo is incorrect, but the description is accurate. 90 degree hose.  Great product for custom applications.
B001O2T43M|1|Cheep and broke on first use
B00JY8941U|5|Awesome alternative for the $30 ones from the dealer.
B000OV32M8|2|Purchased item as a gift for my husband.  It was obviously not quality controlled as one of the really strong glue positions was not correct.  The one magnet hangs over the side if the tray. The other magnet is perfectly centered.  It was impossible to correct and not worth returning.  Kind of ruined the gift, usable but disappointed.
B002CXAQ02|5|Put this on my stock d series radiator for my CRX SI and it fit like a glove!<br /><br />The real deal... NOT a fake!
B00ITNLD4W|1|Another piece of junk made in China.  Was ok until about the 4th use when the metal inside poked through a hole in the seam and scratched my wheel!
B00O2IN4JA|5|Best windshield wipers I've ever had.  Very quiet...no dragging.  Clears the windshield completely...no streaks. Love them!
B000BZ6YRM|3|the mechanic recommended to replace this auto parts to remove the unusual noise from under the chassis. After the work was done, it didn't solved the problem.
B001T9Z1A0|5|This unit is the oem replacement for the Audi 2.7T. It is 140 amps instead of 120. The unit bolts right onto the engine and fits exactly.  The unit operated flawlessly from day one. Great product!
B000E6Q0HM|3|I was told that this&#34; looked liked it came with an internal voltage regulator&#34;. There was a label attached over the electrical connection that stated this alternator requires an external voltage regulator.
B003KFQ2CM|5|Best funnel I ever bought. Holds the bottles well.
B00B1X55X2|5|great design
B00EVQHUWK|5|Ridiculously loud for their size - and with dual solenoid valves, they're as loud as they can possibly be! These are good for up to 150 PSI, and are the horns that they use in their GMTRK-2 system, that scare the bejeebus out of old ladies everywhere! Super easy to add onto your exisitng onboard air system with some air line, a splitter, wire and a button to honk them. Rock solid mounting bases too - incorporated right into the horn assembly.
B000BUOSGG|5|I purchased this dish drainer over 7 years ago.  A great value, stands up well to use, small and convenient for the RV.  The tray easily comes off the drainer for periodic cleaning, though you have to work at the nooks and crannies to avoid the slime which can occur in certain climates.  It will clean up like new.
B0041OP9O8|4|Installed on my 2006 impreza outback sport. Install will take a bit as you will have to remove the front bumper. if you have the tools to remove the plastic clips it wont be as bad. Also will be removing all the noise reduction boxes from the engine bay and front fairing. Instructions are included and are fairly easy to follow. Would recommend having some extra hose clamps available as they want you to reuse some of the old ring clamps that were previously on the car. The only issue I ran into was the rubber boot that connects the two halfs should be just a bit longer. But with some time was able to get the two halfs set in place and other lines hooked up. Combined this with a borla cat back exhaust and fairly happy with the results so far.
B000CM0W7C|1|No It Did Not Fit
B009MASYRA|5|Absolutely perfect fit on my 2014 C-Max Energi. Total sun protection with the only issue being it's a bit large when rolled up, but it's worth it to have the sun and heat protection. Ordered one for my Super Duty hoping it's just as good a fit.
B00C1YI2XA|4|Very Bright easy to install better than the other lights I got before
B001G7LB18|5|Was a perfect fit with no problem to replace.  Wish that other things were this easy to do.  Now the radio that could only get 1 or 2 strong stations, can now get many more than I need to listen to.  Thanks much.
B00CX7L1LA|5|Great product, I had no problem using the item and it is much safer since you hook it up from the triple tree and arrived on time.
B00PNKGL1O|1|The worst  thing I have ever gotten doesn't stick good and doesn't line up
B0007M1FNC|5|I put this on my hitch attached to my camper to get room past my spare tire when hauling bikes.  Highly reconned!!
B000J4NM7U|4|Good product!
B001HKZHIW|5|great product!
B000BXKZUG|5|I used this on my power windows in the creases and if made my slowing windows move like they should. Great stuff to keep in the garage for other little squeaks around the car or home. Last longer than something like WD40.
B0057RBWC6|1|Poor purchase on my part.  It does not stay in place, slides easily.Not wide enough to anchor it to the side hooks. Extremely disappointed! Don't waste your money if you think you are buying something of quality .
B00IXUTMWQ|5|Well made. Awesome price!
B00LTXC80W|5|Really soap up well and does a good job cleaning too.
B0002Z2MKO|3|Despite having full access to my evaporator coil, the product didn't eliminate the odors in my boat AC.  I'll try in my car
B00G1Y3DJ4|5|Bought these for my 2008 cbr600rr. They fit and work fun very pleased with the quality
B000BYELQY|5|Exactly what I needed.
B005KTC5WM|5|Sets apart from some others with 9V and C and D charging for regenerable batteries.<br /><br />Nice pop top and good fast charging. A little flimsy but so what for the price.
B00068OL1U|4|I've always been fond of the K&N air filters. Over time you save money. Where I live in Hawaii the air is heavy and not much dust or sand in the air. So the filter worm great for me. Even got 2 more MPG.
B009FUF6DM|2|Yes, the tag says to hang dry, no dryer. I was surprised but also didn't read the reviews. They are falling apart already. The construction is so bad that seams busted before first use. Unfortunately, you are supposed to wash before first use.<br /><br />If you put them into the dryer, the entire cloth would be found in the lint trap.<br /><br />Great price for the lot but you may consider that they are not much better than disposable shop towels.
B00DIP1120|2|I bought one of these at a shop and it worked perfectly. After about a week the power button stopped responding. I know that it is just the power button because the led background lights up when I press any other button.
B00BBJTEE2|4|Nice
B001S1IN72|1|To big to fit it the housing
B002U2O7EG|5|I love anchors, I even have a tattoo of one so I wanted to put on on my car... so I bought this one and it is a good size so people would be able to tell what it is. It also comes with detailed instructions of how to put it on your window. I LOVE IT and would highly recommned this car decal if you love anchors.
B003NS5NK8|4|Buffed out a scratch on my bumper. Worked great, but I used paper towels instead of microfiber cleaning cloths. It doesn't include those, so that is one 'ingredient' you need to get in addition to this kit. Using paper towels instead of microfiber cloth left little white flecks.
B00BJMQMXC|5|gooooooooooood perfect for mercedez
B007UHPSCG|5|Keeps the so much cooler!
B00BGI6SOW|5|Fit very nice good quality
B000CSD29Q|5|If you're going to get a coolant filtration system for your 6. 0 for diesel I recommend the sinister kit and go ahead and order a few of these filters they are not that easy to find.
B000261PI8|1|`I thought I was ordering a product , not a kit. As soon as I opened the box I realized my error. At 81 years of age I am not abouit to take up electric kit assembly. I have tried to find a school or organization to donate the kit. No luck,
B0009T8HRA|5|as described with a fast delivery
B000NCO6D2|5|I bought mi first MF-1052 Q-maxx Hi Volume Air compressor from Costco,  more than one year ago.  It was stolen from my car and I was determined to get a new one since in my opinion it is the best in the market in its type.  As usual, Costco was not selling it any more so I made a frantic search on line and I was able to get it through you, Amazon, being your  service also impecable.  Only four days after placing my order, my compressor was arriving to my home.  Thanks, Amazon, for your excellent  service; and please, don't remove this item from your  selling stock;  I have recommended it to a lot of people, since there is nothing better in its class.  Truly yours,                              Luis H. Santamaria.
B00CHFN0Q2|5|These were installed on my 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan.  Originally, I purchased 2 struts from my local auto parts store along with a coil spring compressor.  I found instructions online that were an immense help.  When removing the stabilizer link be certain not to turn the bolt when removing the nut.  Instructions said there were flats to keep the bolt from turning and although I had an 18mm wrench it needed to be thin but I used a torx bit to hold the bolt from turning and used the wrench to loosen and remove the nut.  There is a 10mm bolt that keeps a clamp for the ABS line in place.  The two lower bolts secure the clevis and are difficult to remove if you are not aware they get corroded and need some coaxing to get out.  I loosened the nuts with an impact wrench on one side but had to use a 1/2&#34; drive bar and socket on the other.  Don't take the nuts all the way off because you'll want to get the head of the nut level with the end of the bolt.  Then you can bang away.  The bolt has serrations next to the bolt head and you must not allow them to turn, otherwise you might strip the bore of the hole.  Once the bolts are out you simply remove the 3 nuts inside the engine compartment using a 12mm wrench.  After being given the wrong spring compressor twice I returned everything back to the store and checked Amazon for a replacement and found these Moogs.  I did a little research and bought these that were delivered in 2 days as a Prime member.<br /><br />The installation of the first strut took a little time because I fussed aligning the 3 studs on the top and was very careful not to turn any of the bolts mentioned above.  The 2 lower bolts have a funny torque setting.  After torquing the bolts to 60ft-lbs you must crank them another 90 degrees.<br /><br />Why 5 stars?  Because I could not give them 6 stars.  Compared to my OEM struts (at 82,000 miles) the Moog struts showed a much better quality to begin with and appears to have a better designed valving system.Up on the strut tower where the 3 studs are located Moog installed a taller stud to make it easier to line up and attach the nuts.  The nuts were brand new replacements included in the package.  The lower bolts were also new that were included and were coated for corrosion and had a light grease already applied to aid in installation.  You may not think of these small items as a big deal but the possibility of having a corroded or damaged connection is very real.  After installing the driver side taking my time I did the passenger side which took a little over 1/2 hour.  My wife and I took a short drive and she could feel the difference within 5 minutes, as a passenger.  I'm not sure but I believe my Caravan drives better than first out the door.  The best part was I paid nearly half what the auto parts store wanted for one of these assemblies.
B00IOLHBMM|4|It was great. I had it cut and programed.  No problem.  I gave it to my girl friend so she can have her own key and it works great.
B002E2J8CS|5|Works great, Great price!!!
B000TYQB14|5|Almost all the parts that I buy are OEM for fitment, quality, etc.  After I read the reviews on this brake light and it not being a \\"critical\\" part, I thought I'd take a chance and save over $120.  On our 2001 Tahoe, the Dorman light assembly itself fit perfectly in the seal.  The Dorman grommet fit tight on our vehicle, however, the outer lip is a little smaller than the OEM part.  I didn't believe it would be a problem, but I still put some Shoe Goo inside the lip just in case.  For you purists (I'm one on the old Chevy muscle cars), the only other difference I saw was that there are some raised plastic \\"DOT numbers\\" on this lens that are not on the original part.  Other than that it looks like \\"Genuine GM part.\\"  Even if this only lasts five years, it's still worth it since it's fairly inexpensive and the install only takes a few minutes.  I spent more time cleaning the seal and the body surface.  If all aftermarket parts were of this quality, I'd be buying a lot less OEM.
B00B1HRKIG|5|Just to be clear - THIS FITS PRIUS!<br /><br />After alllllmost giving up on finding a wheel cover that fits my Prius, I took a risk based off the one other review here claiming it fit.  Glad I did cause it works perfectly!  Nice and snug.<br /><br />Btw, the smell wasn't that bad.<br /><br />The only other option I've even seen for Prius required an hour of intensive sowing or something stupid like that.
B000CQFUQ6|4|Made in China unfortunately, but it works as intended and fits without issues.
B000GTTLFU|5|I purchased this for a 2000 CR250  the fit and finish were perfect, no issues installing it. Great product.
B0009IQXXG|3|Doesn't last long residue ends up on your rims and extra work to clean
B0068NY1O4|4|Shocks were the same but the grommets were not the same as the ones that I pulled off my Avalanche so I used the old ones again. Small detail but it would have been nice to use new rubber....
B0039L1ZBK|5|We use them for our customers brake cooling kit on many different cars... perfect solution, reliable and the price is just right
B00DFN6NTQ|5|Well made and I have them posted on my bikes and helmets. So far, no fade, cracks, or problems.
B0002Q7ZJ6|1|This will not work for the 03 TJ. This only comes with one T connector... you will need 2 T connectors. One in each brake light.<br />-Karson
B00KTJ9G0C|5|Fast and easy replacement for my remote control.
B008BX8GPY|4|I like it very much. So easy to install. Very good price.
B00KTZB0EQ|3|BMW 320i F30 2014, The good:  white functional beam, no flickering, and add some more light direct front in the car and a clear view when cornering.  The bad is that had an error warning, i think that is not possible that an expensive new kind of good leds do not be prepare to deal with canbus euro cars. I hope can fix the problem with a error decoder. Buy on your on risk.
B00BITLJG6|1|Wouldn't fit in the door... The snapring didn't fit in the car, so my car has a hole in the door where the lock should be
B002OUF3G0|3|one out of seven broke. I will say that customer service at Camco was outstanding. Just emailed my reciept and a picture of the damaged hose and they overnighted a replacement.
B003B2L79C|5|The regular squash smells like bubble gum. This one has a little bit of ocean smell and doesn't smell sweet like the regular squash. I like this one quite a bit while I'm indifferent about the regular squash.
B009RUCHWI|5|Great price , Perfect fit for Hyundai Sonata 2009 2.4L models
B0087ZTEBG|5|These relays work great, small size, small price.  Using them in a tractor to control directional motors for snow thrower.  They resist vibration, well sealed, and mount easily using the included relay socket.  Would highly recommend for numerous purposes.
B003GZJBQK|5|I can't tell you how many aftermarket radiators I have seen installed at my shop that just don't fit at all.  For my car, I upgraded to this radiator not because I need the performance of a higher flow radiator, although I enjoy knowing that part, but because I figured there would be more pride taken in the build quality and application specific design of this product.  Let me tell you, I am impressed.  There's no drilling of new holes, there's no bending, cutting, or straining to make the thing fit.  In my 06 WRX, this thing is a perfect fit.  Fans and coolant tubes transfer over perfectly.  No thread damage requiring tapping.  Nothing out of place.  Really high quality welds and construction.  Not a single fin out of place - awesome packaging keeps it totally protected.  Premium quality metal drain plug; I mean these guys take pride in their workmanship.  Oh, don't let me forget to mention that this thing looks awesome!!!  Beautifully polished tanks shine when you open the hood.  Add on some blue or red silicone radiator hoses, and you're on your way to cool-dom (no punn intended).  It's worth the frickin' money - don't do it, don't buy that piece of crap aftermarket plastic tank I'm gonna have to replace it in 4 1/2 months on the side of the freeway along with my head gasket crapiator; it's not worth it.  Cheers! :)
B001JT1FJ6|5|I run this in every tank !!  More power and most important....better mileage.  My mechanic tells me it will reduce the need for costly injector cleaning so its worth every penny
B009HL6O6C|4|This CVT belt is only for backup.  In a case if broken down in middle of desert.
B001PWFPE8|4|Easy to install and works good.Now I just pull the handle on my tail gate and just let it<br />gently fall to the open position.
B00MEP982K|5|Looks great on my Jeep.
B0002MAHK4|5|Good product
B000COS06U|5|Good looking and works perfectly.  The lock fits well and is solid and secure when loosening and tightening the lug.
B000BTK816|5|I've had this kit for about 4 years now and use it everyday. I love it! Well worth the money.
B00KTIUG5C|1|don't work
B00SZMHT8G|5|[[VIDEOID:a91943fd08b272a454368071af726098]] Please note: I received a free sample of each style for an evaluation and honest review.<br /><br />The video shows off an example of each style, but the main point of the video was to show the metal portion of the valve stem (at least on my tires) that isn't covered by these caps but that is covered by the stock plastic caps.  I got these for aesthetic reasons and wasn't expecting some of the metal portion of the stem (which is a different color from these) to be showing...so I wanted to point that out in case it matters to you.  They won't cover that unthreaded metal portion because, unlike my stock caps, these are threaded almost completely down to the base and do not have any overhang at the bottom.  That's not really a pro or a con, but something to consider.<br /><br />Overall, these are nicely made and not very expensive at all.  From what I can tell, all of the sets that I got have four consistent-looking caps per set, so there aren't any irregular caps in the lot.  Also, they look just like the photos, so what you see is what you get.  The aluminum work is good, and the knurling on the outside helps with grip without being sharp or uncomfortable.  They also have internal gaskets like other caps in order to provide a secondary seal for the valve.<br /><br />At the current &lt;$8 price for three sets of caps, these are a pretty good deal if you like the colors.  That's the one rub - not all colors are available in all styles.  I'd love to get some silver caps in the rounded Style 1, but at least right now, those aren't available.  However, at less than $1/cap, if you like the colors, these can make a nice add-on for your tires.  I'm using the silver ones (from Style 3) right now because they best match my rims, and I quite like the look.<br /><br />I've read some notes online that people have had issues with metal caps locking onto their valve stems (likely due to dissimilar metals).  I'm not knowledgeable about that, but I want to point it out in case you want to look into it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are definitely worth the price.  Had I paid full price for them, I wouldn't feel disappointed at all.  I quite like them.but I want to point it out in case you want to look into it.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say these are definitely worth the price.  Had I paid full price for them, I wouldn't feel disappointed at all.  I quite like them.
B002I0GYZU|5|My '01 Suburban calls for a .060 gap but the latest info says these plugs at .040(?) gap require no adjusting. They went in straight from the box and the 5.3L chevy runs so much better. Don't for get the Locite anti-seize and new spark plug wires.
B00LXKYA0C|2|The mirror itself looks great and has a wide view, but after having it in my car for less than 3 weeks, the clips (springs and plastic inside that squeezes the clips ons)broke that hold the new mirror onto the old mirror. I don't know if the parts melted in the 70 degree weather or what, but I guess you get what you pay for in the long run. I was lucky enough to be able to salvage the mirror by using some mousing wire.
B00860GH8A|4|The part I received was not the exact one in the picture. It was short the ground screw for a sensor. I did not need the for my particular application so not a big deal for my. Just might be for others though.
B008G32B1O|5|Fits exactly like the original OEM with no adjusting needed. I highly recommend this product!
B00AQFE47E|4|Solid mount capable of a variety of mounting options. Been working great so far.
B005LLL5HU|5|First wiper blade that I've found that has fit my 2010 Hyundai Veracruz Limited! I tried Valeo and it was not even close to fitting so I sent them back. These Trico's snapped on easily and wipe very well. On top of that they were half the price of the OEM wipers!
B004CPUM84|4|Very nice helmet, I will be getting the bluetooth for this helmet. What I like about this helmet is that I don't have to take my glasses off to put this on and off.
B0035QYU7K|3|I was impressed reading reviews on how these work for Dodge Durangos.  Durangos have quite a bit of sway when hitting bumps and pot holes, so I decided to purchase them.  Having having them installed I noticed a difference in the rigidness, however after hitting the first dip in the road, then pot hole, the vehicle still sways as much as before from side to side.  In general driving going around corners, they handle fine, but not as described with the sway from left to right when hitting uneven areas in a road.  Not overly impressed, but a step up from the stock ones.
B00CD2RMVI|1|Very nice, good price.
B00BMRRXSM|3|A little flimsy.
B000P910W8|4|does what I needed it for but I would buy the rolls of this at many stores if I had to do it again.
B00NLK7NGA|3|Works and is a of decent design and quality materials.  I did have a problem during assembly.  There three center horizontal tubes.  The side piece would not line up with the center piece.  Two pipes would align but the third would be off by an 1/8&#34;.  I ground the metal so there was a slit cut into the tube that goes on the inside, and then pounded it in a bit.  I prefer a welded rack for strength, but this is adjustable to I can put on different trucks.
B000C9XYWU|1|the amazon program determined this cabin air filter fit my 2006 grand vitara, but after i received it i realized this filter doesn't fit my car.  this filter is 2 pieces but my car only use one piece cabin air filter and the size is totally different.  I returned it and got the TYC cabin air filter from amazon.
B000KDYW6A|2|Great jacket to bad they didn't put a decent zipper on it! The main zipper wore out after 6 month's (worn maybe 12 times). The Expedition would be better way to go, XCR waste of money.
B000CQ4EN6|3|Product arrived on time. Product is well made, seems to be of high quality. There was a bolt missing from the parts list. Amazon issued a discount and the manufacturer quickly shipped the missing part.  The installation instructions were awful. I was installing this on an 04 Dodge Ram 1500 which has a fully boxed frame. Instructions said to pull the bolt through the boxed frame with a supplied \\"snake\\" wire. But there are obstructions inside the boxed frame that prevent this. I had to get creative and use a magnetic reacher to drop the bolt through an opening at the top side of the frame. Had to execute this while the truck was on a lift also, I could not have done it if I were laying on a crawler underneath. It's on there now, and towing fine - and I saved money ordering it online and installing it myself.
B004FFHJ14|5|I have a 2014 Prius.  I purchased the shade based on the other reviews.  Although it is a bit big when rolled up, it fits my windshield perfectly and does what it is supposed to!
B001B13E46|1|Showed up as wrong plug, but I looked it up and it was still compatible. I think it was a 12C that showed up. BUT more importantly the porcelain had a crack. I just threw it out and drove to the local hardware store because I wasn't interested in dealing with sending a 2 dollar item back and I needed to tune up my mower the day I opened this.
B000GPB3CI|5|This is a high quality 4way.
B006LJBMCY|5|I purchased this part for my 2006 BMW 325i rear passenger window. Watched a 3 minute YouTube video. Installed in 30 minutes. Works perfect!
B00192QBC4|5|This is also a no brainer part. If you're buying a new regulator do yourself a favor and buy new pig tails cause most of the time these little buggers have been in the old regulator so long that they have separation anxiety and will not come out or reseal properly. Once again the price is right for a major brand in trailer parts.
B00ODF7HXG|5|Very nice
B00EKS5EN6|4|The product worked pretty good on the  open areas of the wheels. I have a Camaro ZL1 and it has black wheels, they have some tight areas where the spokes curve together these two areas of the wheels BDP did not work well. At this time I would not recommend BDP to any one. I may buy another bottle in the future who knows I may be applying it wrong, but for now I am buying a different product.
B000BLNTQU|3|All good.
B009OEKUR6|5|love it
B00029JZYQ|5|excellent good product
B00AC6SAZE|4|A lot of truckers use the BlueParrot which looks like a $5 dollar headset from 1980 with universal remote control buttons on the side.  This RoadKing is more up to date.  I was worried about the sound amplification as a lot of Bluetooth headsets are quiet, but this one is so loud that I have to turn the volume down a little.  The only con is that it fits a little too tight on my head, but I am currently trying to stretch it out which seems to be helping so in time it may loosen up.  Also, when fully charged a blue light remains lit and it is the brightest light I have ever seen.  It is like a large blue laser, you can actually use it as a flashlight it is so bright. Two little things, but if they make the band a little larger and remove the Audi headlight that lights up the whole area when charged, it is great.<br /><br />UPDATE<br /><br />I managed to stretch out the band so now it fits comfortably on my head.  The bright blue light doesn't bother me in my truck, but when I charged it in my house it was extremely bright where the room is pitch black dark at night. I am happy with this purchase and will stick with this brand for bluetooth trucker headsets.
B006ODTR0G|5|Perfect fit! It really looks great with my 2013 CR-V. I really recommend it to everybody.
B003V57NUQ|5|Works great, fast shipping, told everyone about them
B00MRM046O|3|As much as you want to lock them to prevent theft when you need to put air in your tire they are annoying to take off but I still like them =)
B004SR88CI|4|The regulator fit perfectly.  All the pieces lined up fine.<br />The OEM regulator motor used a different method of attaching it to the door panel than this one but all I needed to buy was 3 nuts to get it to work.
B0067UE6H0|5|The part fit great in My Toyota Truck 1988 with Standard Transmission, fit like a original part but the difference in price it's considerable.
B00J5CRDZ4|4|Light output and installation was easy. A plug and play product. But one thing I have to say is that one of bulbs came packaged loose, which caused the bulb to be separated from the plug. I had to disassemble the product and secure the metal tabs. Overall its a great product.
B0002JM69W|5|My husband loved the retro look for his 57 Chevy Belair.
B001ADR6M6|5|This oiler is perfect for my uses.  This type of item was very hard to find.  I could not locate  in stores.  5 stars.
B000OCFC34|5|I have been using this to get rid of the brake dust and etc. off my wheels and it works great. I'm kind of scared to use them now because I plasti dipped my wheels and the metal parts might remove it but it worked fine before.
B00KTIUG5C|5|wow what a bargain. better than the ones that came with unit.
B007KOTJJ2|5|Very satisfied with this product. Simple and well made. Perfect for your Giraffe Lover to display on any suitable stick-to product.
B008HZKJ7O|5|They fit, they make the car stop, they dont rattle or squeek. I would say  if you need pads, Buy em
B002N4KHUY|3|These are decent blades for a year, but spend the extra money and get the gold 600 level series.  They will last for a few years.
B004I0WPBU|5|Works greater and are a very good direct replacement headlight for the 4runner.
B0009V1WS4|4|I am pleased with this product as it has 2 different size pieces for different size hitches!  My husband was pleased with his gift.
B0035YGLZG|5|This thing is GREAT!
B00BUTE3GC|5|yes it's a little different plastic and it's probably a cheaper built unit but it works fine, fit was identical to the factory, had adapters for tranny lines I didn't even need and had the hook ups for oil lines as well as tranny lines, my car has a separate oil cooler so they we not needed, all in all, it was a two hour job and wasn't that bad......good product, we'll see how it holds up....I'd buy again versus spending 3 times this for a more expensive model that does the same thing.....
B000EQR87S|5|The gas cap fit perfectly.  The gas cap looks exactly the same!  My son broke the original one which caused a light to come on on the dash.  It took about a day but the light went off with the new cap.
B000EQB6H6|5|so easy to replace yourself.  costs half as much compared to getting it replaced by when you get your oil changed.  with free shipping with prime, you can't go wrong
B00KGETCHW|4|They work it's a fioor mat
B008RMWKUQ|5|I had a faded sticker like this on my '07 Vibe. I just paid it off and wanted a fresh one for &#34;Bad Kitty Car&#34;. I received it the next day!
B004SMGAJ6|5|Very heavy duty adjustable mount.  I think the truck will break before this mount would.  Can't wait to give it a try. I am using on a Silverado 1500 and is likely more capacity than I will ever need, but at some point I will upgrade the vehicle.  I also bought the Trimax TH43 lock set to lock the ball to the mount and the mount to the truck.  Fits well (meaning the locks are long enough) and is also a available at a great price like this Curt mount.  With the Curt 45900 you will have a very heavy duty mount that will likely last forever, just don't drop it on your foot - it is a very heavy piece of steel (25-30 lbs)!
B006BDW0G2|5|Ordered two of these for $26 (w/ S & H), paid locksmith $3 per key to cut and it took me all of two minutes to program them both!
B007H2PY50|4|A bit straight backed. May be uncomfortable for some folks or the perfect fit for others. Materials , frame etc. are good value. Expect it will hold up for several years.
B009197TIM|5|Like that it is light and easy to work with even for a female.
B003OBUAZ2|5|The Scala Rider Q2 Multiset system was just what we needed.  It didn't take to long to install the sets into our closed face Icon Airframe helmets.  Honest to say, it took a little finesse to wiggle in the clamp, but once it was in, its in solid!  The clarity and range is outstanding between headset to headset and phone calls via bluetooth.  The radio is not all that great, which is great that the Q2 features a included cord for using you personal MP3 players.  Overall, I really enjoy using this kit everytime I cruise the roads.  Ride safe!
B0012TWXJE|4|Built well, good fabric, does not scratch my tank. A definite must have for anyone not wanting to wear a backpack...
B00DPO4F68|5|great
B00GDGRX8M|1|Does not fit properly
B001ECH9SE|1|This is as cheap a product as you can get.  Light says it is 1 million candlelight (I seriously doubt it).  Especially since I have a true 1 million candlelight and is far better.  I regret buying this product that did not last me more than a week.  The power outlet will break easy and feels very cheap. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP.  They say you get what you pay...well I think I paid way too much.
B000KE2BCQ|4|My older dog has pulled a few threads getting in, but I've been able to pull them back under.  They stay clean, too.
B007GI6RCY|4|I ordered this sticker because I am a new fan of the discontinued show, Firefly.  Sadly the show only ran for less than a season back in 2002 but a friend got me hooked on it.  Since, then, I have acquired all the episodes and the movie as well.  The sticker is cute and was super easy to apply.
B00Q57QF1K|5|Purely Amazing. Shipped to me faster then i thought. Only took 30 minutes to install. Best sound hands down. Worth every penny
B0015PJE0Q|1|Defective product, returned after talking to customer service. Poor quality product.
B007C7J02S|4|It's a very hard plastic and things slide around very easily.  But the fit is perfect.
B000CIQBJ4|5|High quality nitrous product! Could not be more pleased with this item and the brand in general! I would definitely buy this brand again!
B004HIIG0M|4|I cant speak much for the signal this produces due to my iPod, but I can comment on the looks. Fits like a charm and looks amazing. Would have given 5 stars if the black didn't fade to a metallic grey after 6mo.
B001D9FQT2|5|would buy again
B001RMT5Q0|5|Fit perfect in 2003 Ford Taurus, easy to install, bulbs were included! Very Happy
B001CJYBGW|3|I bought these oarlocks for 1.5&#34; shaft oars. Although it says 1 1/2&#34; in the title, these actually work with 2&#34;shaft oars. It says later in the description that they are 1/2&#34; by 2&#34;. I guess I should have read more carefully. They seem to be quality oarlocks, I might try looking for some kind of insert so these will work with my 1.4&#34; shaft oars.
B002TJ03QQ|5|After a season on my 4 cylinder Searay, all is good.  It is a delight to find comparable product at roughly half the price of the autopart store down the street.
B000V9FWSA|5|pits perfectly in my 07 crown vic police cruiser<br />this counsel made the car . it sits up high enough to<br />make a good arm rest.<br />cup holders work good for a regular coffee mug.<br />a taller starbuck &#34;to go &#34; cup is a little sloppy but it is<br />easy enough to make it work
B006QWUM5Y|3|What ever you do don't order because the picture shows your truck style.  I didn't realize I was ordering for a 6' ft bed it showed a picture of my truck with the 5'8&#34; bed so I orderd it after checking the passenger side front and rear first to see if it fits which it did I assembled all four flare, bolts and rubber in my living room. Then installed the two front flares easy install then started with the rear driver side  flare it didn't have the gas cap ares cut out.  EGR said return them and they will send new one I stated how I installed the rubber and bolts no comment from them I had to pay $132.00 send them back to EGR NOW EGR SAID THEY WERE USED AND WON'T REPLACE THEM so now I'm working with the seller he is giving me $100.00 refund and sending me the two rear I need for $190.00 so I'll be into this for $750.00 I could have bought two set for cheaper at amazon $345.95 so the moral of this is don't order from a picture
B001AY2WLU|5|work perfect i am very happy. the delivey was great. thank you very much.  i love it.  thanks again. claudio
B00UJF4EDK|5|Outstanding LED bulbs! I used a digital light meter to test before and after. Before, factory Subaru BU bulbs were 65 Lux max about 1.25 meters away. Installing these showed 110 Lux max at the same 1.25 meters away. They seem very, very well made. Nice heat sink. I can only hope they last. Application is backup lights in 2007 Subaru Imprezza.
B004QBX4O8|2|transmission kit shoul've came with the band shift solanoides and pump otherwise decent product
B00AZ4RMWA|4|arrived on time. A little trickey to install
B000CO96VI|4|I used this tool to replace the crank on my '97 Honda Civic.  It worked.  It took a few attempts to get it right, however.  I'd say it's worth the money.
B0002SR7TC|4|Forget the worthless directions, I created a diagram of the key things you need to do to make this work: [...]  Ignore the #s, I forgot to change them.    You will get a little oily, esp. when you start dealing with the hoses (post oil change).  I kind of laugh when I read that some people could change their oil in a suit.  So have some paper towels handy---and change into some work clothes.    One of the annoyances about this tool is that it sucks a little slower than you might expect.  So learn to walk away after a few minutes, pump it up a few more times (3-4), and then come back in a few minutes.    One thing that also is cumbersome is cleaning out the MV.  The instructions say to \\"rinse out the reservoir tank w/ clean solvent or engine degreaser\\".  So better have a lot of brake cleaner on hand.  It does drain well b/c/ of the slick inner surface, but again, its not a \\"do it in a tuxedo\\" job.    As for dispensing fluids, as the diagram says, make sure you have a tight seal.      Gripes aside, I think its a great tool.  Especially if you hate getting underneath, removing underbody materials to insulate from sound, etc.
B00FA4PFDI|3|Fast delivery, however my sticker a little crinkly and lots of bubbles under it. Worked out great for my brothers truck so he gave it a thumbs up!
B0002L6O1Q|5|I have ordered three sunshades made by Heatshield.  They are wonderful and they fit whatever car you need it for perfectly.  And they last forever, unlike the ones you can purchase in stores.  I highly recommend these.
B0013FMURM|5|I chose this item because the one in my car failed and was causing my computer to send an intermittent &#34;low coolant&#34; light in the dash. The total removal and replacement time was literally 3 minutes. No more warning light.
B002SZXWIC|5|product is good only problem I had with this supplier is that I ordered 4 shocks and received only 2
B00G8Y2XF2|5|Quick shipping. Perfect fit. Love the look! Thanks for making the light bar I was looking for! Looks great with some 36w Kawell LED's!
B00D0IA2RA|4|seems brighter than stock, off course its not HIDs, sadly these bulbs are brighter than the projector bulbs headlights on my car
B002RB8SJU|5|just worked great thanks
B000C7UQT6|5|Same as original and works great!
B00IXDGKTG|5|beautiful on my bike...love them!
B00C6KZZAC|5|Fit perfect and works as it should.
B0030EWWDQ|5|These VERY reflective stickers measure 1 1/2 inches tall and 2 inches wide. A little small to go on mudflaps ;) but great for other fun places.  I was wondering about the exact size when i bought mine, so i thought i'd help you out. enjoy!
B0080E6XT0|5|I like that i can have an extra amoint of oil in my crankcase due to the added capacity frombthis filter. It helps keep the oil cooler, even if nominally, and provides extra filtration surface over the oem sized filter.
B00BMU9C1K|2|Well made item however it kept coming off the rims while driving
B001DRLBZW|5|I had written a review on the mate ACDELCO 18J2849 to this hose [[ASIN:B001DRLBZW ACDelco 18J2848 Professional Durastop front Brake Hose Assembly]] Amazon has it listed as a rear brake hose but its a front hose.The installation was easy I recommend always using a flare nut wrench to loosen brake line WD40 helps to loosen flare nut.Leave frame clip attached until flare nut is loose then you can remove frame clip.Be careful when installing brake line into new brake hose. Make sure it threads in easy and it doesn't cross thread.I highly recommend this brake hose.
B001BDSUXE|5|I ordered this for my 1986 Ford Bronco EFI and while it says it will fit it will not fit the stock distributor.  This is a great cap/rotor but you MUST HAVE a \\"MSD Distributor\\" this will not fit the stock distributor.
B002807SF0|5|I have American Racing wheels, with a rather small hole surrounding the lug nut.  The Gorilla System did the trick.  Fit in perfectly, and I would say a thief's chances are almost nil to get these wheels.<br /><br />Only slight gripe I would have is I wish seller has 6 nut and 8 nut per wheel combinations, as not all after market wheels are 5 lug.  Still, I bought two sets, and have right hand and left hand locks, now, but the look is superb and the cost for two sets of Gorilla's was at least 20% below my other options.<br /><br />I highly recommend these!
B00DOI8A8E|5|Great product!!!
B000AR7KVA|5|I recently bought a new Range Rover to come out to my 80lb German Shepherd jumping up on it.  Sigh...  Her werewolf-like claws left tiny scratches on the side by the door handle.  My vehicle is bright red, so scratches are SUPER noticeable.  Anyway, the scratch remover I had at home did NOTHING to minimize the scratches.  I ordered this brand because it was recommended by a friend who had tree branch scratches on the side of his truck.  I am thankful he recommended this, because it works.  I used a small amount on a microfiber cloth and although it took quite a bit of rubbing, the scratches are now barely noticeable.  It did not make the scratches completely vanish, but now you only really notice them if the sun is beaming right on that spot, and you are standing at a really odd angle right next to the handle :)  Basically nobody will notice except for me since I know where they were.  Anyway, it is worth the money, just be prepared for a lot of rubbing.
B0065J3368|5|Product cheaply made, but works outstanding.
B002Q907QU|5|Bought this product for my new Hathorns which after about 90 hrs of wear showed not signs of softening up in the ankle. They had been made  about a year prior to my purchase of them but never worn and I was amazed at how readily they  soaked up the oil. I used it on the inside of the boot walls as well as the outside and now they feel almost as good as my go to pair.
B004KV4DN0|5|This is what I needed for work thanks will be looking for more products in the near future thanks again
B009FREAGO|5|Great item
B007P14NPU|1|Item worked fine for the first 2 weeks them stopped working after the cassing broke open at no fault of typical use. Order the higher quality ones on here instead!
B00CBQFE8E|4|On my 2007 Jeep GC Limited, the sensors started working with no programming. The calibration is a little off, so I may need to have some programming but otherwise, all good.
B00HZBE44A|2|I love this when I first applied it to my vehicle. Unfortunately, I have discovered that in the warmer summer weather, the paint on the decal is running and it is a huge mess on my window. I will have to remove, so am not happy. Looked great, but in the end, not so much.
B00OKK7YEQ|5|Works great and has my Mercedes 229.51 spec
B004VJMEEQ|2|Easy to hook up, But picture is very light, it is useless during the day, and not much better at night. I don't recommend it.
B004XOO6C2|5|Great kit, all the parts to do a complete install.
B00JH6LAAW|5|Bought this as a gift and no complaints
B006UKGBLQ|5|I wasn't sure how this would fit but it was no problem. I did needy use a little WD-40 to slide it over the shifter.
B000E4OMXI|4|Great product. Happy customer.
B001RM8JSK|5|Installed 4 of these plugs in my 2007 Yamaha FXHO Cruiser Waverunner. Runs and performs like a champ!!! Did the install myself.
B000CGD7KW|1|Was fixing the transfer case in my 2005 GMC 2500HD and figured while I had it apart I would put in a new transmission mount. The rubber in this part is so hard that it caused a vibration starting at 40 mph to about 63 mph. Slowing down from 60 to 50 the vibration got so bad I thought my truck was going to fall apart. Put the old mount back in and the truck is smooth as silk. Not the trucks fault...
B001DZONCW|5|I bought this controller to maintain a deep cycle battery that I have in my Volkswagen Vanagon camper. I am using a 100 watt solar panel. I've run my 12 volt Edgestar refrigerator, a 4000W inverter, and a big ipod tower at the same time with no problems.<br /><br />I haven't had time to mount the controller permanently, but the small size will allow me plenty of options. I'm happy with the purchase so far. Good product, great price and fast shipping. At this point, I'd recommend this to a friend. Time will tell if it holds up.
B008FBRRA2|5|My son is just waiting to get his car to show it off. great price for a Docto who product.
B0022ZOC4Q|1|It's cheap which is good but it also looks and feels cheap.It also doesn't float anything beyond the most extremely thin and small plastic sunglasses.
B007V2C2ZG|4|the shield is very sturdy, non flexible.  Maybe, a lesser priced one would have done it.
B0002MBKAA|3|Only complaint is a couple of seams have tiny flaps of vinyl that stick out.  Other than that it looks good and is comfortable.  Left it in the Florida sun for about an hour before I put it on so it stretched fairly easy.
B0060ZPC3E|5|Perfect fit on my 2000 Ford Explorer. Installation takes about five minutes. Just remove the clips on each end of the old units and push the new ones on. Simple. It is so nice now not having to prop up the hood with a piece of wood, or your arm, while performing the work.<br /><br />I placed the order with Amazon on Friday morning, it shipped two hours later from Kentucky on UPS Ground, and it arrived on Monday in Texas. If you want faster service than that, then see if they have it at your local auto supply store, and pay them 50% more.
B0049BV5ZK|4|This product is holding up just fine
B001U60T9U|2|these are very cheaply made.  I expect to have to purchase another set within the year.  Driver and passenger seats already ripping at the seems.  Head rest covers look like i just put a pillow case over them.
B00FRHOO9O|5|I am changing my review.  I trashed this item but then saw a review that warned about the cover and sure enough I had not removed it.  When I took it off I went back out into the rain I had no choice but to completely rewrite my review.  This blade is completely quiet and streak free.  Everything you would want in a wiper blade.  I would not hesitate to either recommend it or buy it again.  The killer is it's $2 less now then when I bought it.  Look no further.
B0010AN0SI|5|Great battery! Quality is high and good power
B009SSV26Q|2|I would not call them red. More of an orangish red. Not to satisfied.
B0031I8096|5|Arrived quick, put them on the car, brakes work fine.
B009M9YGGY|4|Exactly what i wanted, but it covers up the texas logo on the bottom if thats a priblem for anyone.
B005T688TK|2|I have had these for two years and the powder coating on the inside edge (closest to the body) is coming off and the metal is rusting.<br /><br />They looked great at initial installation and I do receive compliments, but I am a little concerned that the finish is coming off so quickly (IMHO) for the price.<br /><br />Where the rust is located, it is hard to get to in order to refinish, but I guess they are coming off to allow me to do this and have them last a couple more years...
B008G3A5F8|5|Great deal, these are the original design where the plastic will most likely break again, came fast, and the price was great
B00EQJ51D2|5|Just what I expected.. Pleased
B001BFS0PK|5|The brake pads were very easy to install and are completely quiet.  The original OEM pads were much noisier than these new pads.  You will not be disappointed.
B00008RW9U|5|Have had these for years, this one works well and keeps my 2 black cars looking good.
B000GVA8WS|5|Very good
B005NLQAHS|3|I purchased this for my 08 hyundai tucson. seems to work ok. when I pair it with the torque app it doesn't do much. Probably just the app though
B0010DV7P8|1|It was bad
B000GU7JGW|5|Bought this for my kids to hold on while riding the motorcycle.  This was a perfect solution.  It has comfortable grips and a wide area to support the handles. It is still lightweight enough to to not be a burden while riding. I can feel when the kids have to hold on so the rider input is enough to stay engaged but not a continuous tug or pull.
B0002NYDZ8|4|The one hand pump is a great improvement in my tool kit.  Made of good materials.  Only problem, as others have mentioned, is the coupler is too  tight.  When removing the grease gun I pulled the zert out of the mower wheel. Maybe the company will send out a redesigned coupler to its recent customers in the interest of happy campers and more referrals to their product[[ASIN:B0002NYDZ8 Lincoln Industrial 1134 16 Ounce Pistol Grease Gun with 18\\" Whip Hose and 6\\" Rigid Pipe]]? Just a fraction larger and it would be a perfect tool. TBS
B004O7DBM4|5|Easy to install using existing exterior light screw holes, bright, and the motion sensor works just as it should. Reasonable price for a quality product.
B00EHIOR3C|5|Easy to install. Great service.
B00A3EK25Q|5|I was painting my car myself and needed a full supply of funnels because I was doing custom stuff in between. These were the best and they can be used over and over if you add thinners to it right after straining the paint. I highly recommend this product and seller!!!
B0027AEZKW|4|I purchased these integrated tail lights (along with a R6 undertail from ebay) to retrofit onto my 92 XJ600.  As other reviewers have mentioned, the lens had shaken loose from the back frame/lightboard assembly.  I had expected this, and after looking at the 2 small areas where it was glued, I understand why this happens.  I perceieve this as something you'll get with China aftermarket parts, if you want dealer quality then expect to pay dealer prices.  Besides that, a pretty nice little unit.  I got some plastic appropriate glue and attached the lens and ready to go.<br /><br />Only other issue, no wiring information included at all.  Actually nothing included for directions at all.  Would be nice to have a simple wiring diagram at least.  Even if installed on a R6, the turn signals have to be cut and wired in.  Would save some time with a DVOM.
B00KRW5GE6|4|I want this erring
B001ABPKUS|5|They fit over mirrors as expected. They are lightweight but seem strong enough to do the job. The mirror is adjustable by hand, which requires adjustment before driving. (duh!) They are so simple to add on, I worry a little about theft. But they worked great at being able to see behind the trailer and they look nice. Better than some of the alternatives.
B00GYTEBPQ|5|Perfect fit for our 2011 Sorento. Kia dealer wanted $37.00 for this same item.
B003FN05HM|5|Well- designed product.
B004VOAC1S|5|real nice looks sharp on bike. easy to put on. others have said how they look great. the blue is sharp looking
B00CASDZKC|5|I just received my kick back mats and I love them. It embraces the seats nicely and it gives a nice protection against muddy shoes :-)<br />I would highly recommend it!
B000C5DZWI|4|Fixes the problem but the cause remains. This slipped right in to replace my broken knob. The wire appears to be the same thickness as the OEM equipment, and will likely break in the future just like the OEM. Use a bunch of silicon lube and hope for the best!
B00BB0FQLQ|5|Very good product
B00AQAQI6E|5|great.
B0074OL3EC|5|Perfect fit. Feels good. Must have for families with little ones. Little pricey. But they are made for your pilot to fit perfectly. Happy with the purchase.
B00AEY0LD8|5|Item was as described and I am very pleased with it.
B001AWLNY4|5|Works like it's supposed too!  Total ease of operation! Job done so much easier when you have the right tools!
B000CSGTKK|5|Good fuel filter. Used for a Kubota tractor service.
B000E81VN8|5|this handy little organizer will work great in any truckbed, it keeps my groceries from sliding around which increases the functionality of that space.  This organizer is very well designed and requires absolutely no installation so it has all those &#34;net&#34; style organizers beat.
B001TI5IIQ|5|Ok I didn't buy the Turtle Wax headlight kit from Amazon, I picked it up at Autozone.  But this product was excellent.  Great price, and very easy to apply.  The kit doesnt come with masking tape, so you'll probably want to pick some up so you dont risk scuffing your paint.  Took me about 20 mins to do both headlights, and they came out looking great.  Made a huge difference
B0018RBQ16|3|the wire connecter is smaller than the one i have in the car.
B001DRNNDK|5|great filter and price
B00BQWQN1Q|5|Best headlights made.
B001O0CC1U|5|these worked well and kept my tires on.  made my tires and rims look great.  great price too.  worth it
B008K6015U|5|Order was received as described. Easy to work with in forming bends as needed. Do not have the worry of rusting. Easy to bubble flare when cut to proper length.
B000WJERQW|5|my Grip felt Like It has cruise control.... my old sleeve was broke. This cured the problem and is a good bargain!
B0001XPC7C|5|Well made
B004INCV3Y|1|This was terrible.  It does not appear to be designed properly.  First the connectors were very poorly made and barely worked.  Had a hard time installing it because of miss alignment of the holes.  Finally, once I actually struggled and installed the Bugflector the hood would not close.  So, I removed it and returned it to Amazon without an issue.  For the record my vehicle is a 2013 Ford EDGE Limited.
B00C8YOQU6|5|Great product but it leans more to the pink then purple but looks as the picture shows without the purple surounding but it is what you pay for
B00EOB6K1Y|5|A+A+A+
B000C809T2|5|Fits like a glove.
B00GH88YZM|4|Very good scraper.  Hands down a huge improvement over every plastic scraper that I've ever owned.  The package was destroyed during delivery so one of the 3 I ordered was dented up.  I've deducted a star because of the very flimsy packaging and not because of the product quality itself.  All in all I'd definitely recommend this scraper and I'll buy again if I ever lose this one.
B00BLZ7PX8|5|very good
B000CRAXNK|5|Installed perfectly on my 2001 PT Cruiser
B00KQ81M94|5|We got this in the mail yesterday to review and my husband and I were excited to try. Its a good size cloth and it comes moist so its easier to start drying your car which is good. We washed our cars and use this cloth after and it left the cars looking nice, no streaks and no lint's. I really recommend this product.
B001EOV3FM|5|Good reciever at a good price. I have installed receivers on my vehicles over the past ten years. This reciever took a little more time to install, not due to any issue with the receiver, but the design of my vehicle. Only issue, instruction could be a little more detailed.  2 hour install time.
B00DD0ZE0K|5|Good product. Easily goes on steering wheel.
B0063GKHPI|5|Few years ago one of the headlights on my minivan was replaced with OEM part by the repair shop. Few few years down the line replaced headlight became very dull and cloudy that hardly any light was coming through it. I realized that it is too expensive to replace the headlight and came across the restoration kits.<br /><br />This kit is simple, and process is easy. No other tools required. Some other kits require power tools to sand. Instructions are OK, but they could have been more specific such as how long to sand (such as 2 minutes or 5 minutes, etc) etc to help inexperienced users. I was little paranoid about sanding with 400 and 1000 sandpapers, because 400 is bit course but tried tried anyway. No harm done with sanding. I was amazed while applying the liquid formula; headlight glass turning  clean like original as you apply the formula. Hope it lasts that way.<br /><br />I would suggest putting masking tape around the work area to avoid any paint damage during the process.
B000JFNAMQ|5|This unit came quickly and was protected adequately when shipped.<br /><br />This unit has a nice clean easy to read LCD display and respond quickly to changes.<br /><br />This works great for adjusting freon charges in a smaller refrigeration unit like farm equipt, home AC equipt etc. Small compact and I like that it has a case to protect it while stored.<br /><br />This is the same unit we used in HVAC class also.
B00JHEG7UW|1|Only one side works, needs to be turned on and off repeatedly to come on. Don't buy
B001GJ3FIS|1|This product leak in one week ,this produce suck
B002DLYR8A|5|have not welded with these... but, great for costume
B001TQMZWU|2|The chair is too unstable.  Upon getting up and out of it, it folds up rather than support my hand and self on the front of the arm.  Guests don't like it either.
B0071BS0XU|4|I was looking for a replacement mirror for my daughters vehicle which she broke hitting a pole. I only wish it was painted to the OEM color, but the black color isn't that noticeable. It took less than 20 min. To install. 3 simple screws and one plug, very easy.<br /><br />Great product!
B003CGUYB4|4|I am putting a LS1 in my old muscle car and Russell came to the rescue on my fuel line needs.  Works well.
B0007RDVH0|5|For the price, this is the best foaming wheel and tire cleaner.  I have tried Black Magic et al., but this product's cleaning properties last the longest.  Very highly recommended.
B00L2M73TQ|5|Would have loved to have done EGR delete and external cooler, but this was perfect for the funds available.  Was shipped and received promptly ahead of &#34;Amazon&#34; schedule.
B00AAHOXWE|5|Nice lock fit my old camper shell, arrived on time
B00JQ9B0QE|1|Cheap.  One of the GTI labels has already come off one of the caps, and the key ring is of no great quality.
B007KCZU4M|5|Nice and easy instalation, excelent product delivered just in time.
B000B6JPWW|5|just as advertised
B004FSEJZA|5|a favorite product brought to me at home. Awesome!
B00CB6QJEC|5|This is a no brainer... duh!
B002H13Q0G|3|It workd for that helmet. I have since bought a new helmet.
B004L730RI|5|It looks so cool and a good size I thought it would be smaller,but it was good to be wrong, it arrived sooner than i thought.
B006QH56GO|5|Greatest battery I've ever owned. My last Optima battery lasted over 7 years despite taking a beating. I will always buy Optima batteries.
B0002RNS8C|5|This was shipped fast and was better than I expected. I recommend this for all my friends and anyone that needs a top class plug.
B00J5O0XLS|4|Great
B000VKVXLE|4|Item delivered on time, was as described
B005DUN2NE|4|Super easy install, no slip, pretty comfy for the price.
B00DHQ782C|5|Extremely well made from initial inspection. Time will tell but this looks like it will last a long, long time.
B0015J6OK0|5|Best glass cleaner I've ever used.  I am a smoker (bad I know), and this cleaner really removes the grime.
B002PMOK0W|4|This windshield is what I expected but, the install brackets are for the rectangular frame cage. I needed the round tube brackets so, I had to manufacture them myself.
B000XP7MWG|5|I thought my husband was nuts for purchasing this but... it really makes the car look a little nicer.  The only thing was it took him forever to lace it, but well worth the time!
B0053SSSM6|5|This is the second time I have bought this item....My wife and I wore the first set out...dealing with this company is a pleasure....you got questions-they got answers...guy
B000BTO1UK|5|Works as advertised. Fit my truck and holds the bar flawlessly.
B0055DRCLW|3|Not buckhorn like pictured, more of an enduro styled bar.<br />Chrome is grainy, not a mirror finish.<br />I now need new mirrors as they do not clear rider no matter where you aim them.
B00488IRFU|2|I recently purchased this product and put it to work right away, unfortunately this product ripped the 3rd day of me using it.  Im not happy with the way it drapes over my headrest and just hangs it looks nothing like the picture and i drive a ford explorer, in which i thought the towel would be a little tighter around the seat and look even better..... I was wrong this is def not worth the money and it does not fit the headrest tight it will hang down and look trashy..
B003KLABUA|2|My husband and I both tried this product on our cars with nothing- the scratches are still there.  It's cold now so I packed it away and will make another attempt in the spring. We read and followed the instruction.  We both have Japanese cars.  Could the paint be different?
B000C5WD2Q|5|The most fair price that I have found. Thank you!
B007BL4ZUW|5|Straightforward installation. Factory fit.  Very clean look.  Impossible to know how long it will last.  Appearance is similar quality to factory piece that is delaminating after 8 years.  If this only lasts 2-3 years it would still be a good value for the price and I would just buy another.
B0007RDVGG|1|Dulls the finish. I used this on the interior of my truck and it made it look dull and worse than before I applied it. I was surprised too because of all the positive reviews. Maybe I just got a bad bottle but I'm going back to Meguiars.
B00AXLAM4A|5|Item as described, fit is perfect in M3, no issue with wiring.  Would buy unit again, but should never need to.
B00495UQT2|3|Its a little more low grade product than I thought but still works.
B000H6P55W|4|Used this last Christmas to carry suit cases on our SUV. Light-weight and easy to install. The attached straps work well, however we also used a few heavy duty bungee cords to secure it tighter. Only draw back: not completely waterproof. Heavy rain leaked in through the zipper. On our return trip we put the cases in plastic bags and positioned the cargo carrier with the zipper facing the rear of the vehicle. This seemed to prevent water from reaching the zipper.
B0000AY4YT|5|NOT CHITTY AT ALL. GREAT FOR REMOVING JIZ STAINZ
B00146C2SM|5|This Chrome Ford Frame looks very nice and adds a custom touch to my Mustang with the name Ford written in Script style letters on bottom of frame, wish I had this frame on the rear of the car but already purchased a frame earlier from Amazon.com for a previous car I had then transferred it to this car, they both are chrome, love the looks and quality of both frames.
B000V7W4E2|5|Great product and speedy delivery , thank you
B001WNKEY6|2|I'm the fuddy duddy wife of the purchaser. He bought this for our RV...really?! We live in a rural area and our &#34;neighbors&#34; can hear this from their house 1.3 miles away!  My thoughts when I heard it the first time were this HAS to be illegal! I can only invision my husabnd honking this horn and sending someone into cardiac arrest or scarring them so badly it causes an accident! My second thought was I never want to hear it again! This is so loud, it freaks out my animals and is truly a nuisance item!!!
B00116SGVM|5|I love this tire set the reemer and insertion tool both are very well made and they look like they will last a long time the only complaint I have is that the plugs that come with it are very skinny but I bought different plugs other than that this is an awesome kit
B00FX40C9C|5|Bosch typically makes expensive high end wiper blades.  The SteelTech line is a very affordable line newly released by Bosch.  They are 6 to 9 dollars per wiper blade depending on size.  I got one wiper to try out, but I need two for my front windshield.  When I told my husband that I wanted to get the other one so they match, he was all upset thinking that Bosch would be expensive and told me I should just have bought a pair of something else.  But then when he looked up the other wiper, he really excited to see this line and all excited that it was Bosch for a good price.  For me, personally, I don't really care about brand, and usually buy whatever is at Costco on the theory that Costco stocks good products. But, if you care about brand, then I guess Bosch is the best and now they are affordable.<br /><br />For wiping the windshield, this wiper blade was totally fine.  Like I said, I'm not a consieur and I usually get whatever is sold at Costco without even noticing what brand it is.<br /><br />Online shopping for a wiper blade was also an excellent experience and my first time getting wiper blades this way.  The Amazon page for these blades has a drop down bar to enter your make and model and year of car, and then it tells you what blades fit your car.  This was great, because I could get my car registration and then enter the info and then order.  I also double checked blade size on Toyota's website, because I am paranoid.  In store, I always take too long to pick out the size of wiper blades for my car because it's confusing.
B003IS3HV0|5|I have used many leather care products in the past, and none of them compare to this.  It is not runny, yet not too thick to gunk up.  It seeps into all the cracks of old leather at room temperature.  Some other product require you to use a hair drier to heat up the leather first, in order for the pasty material to be absorbed.  You do not need to do any of that with Leather Honey!  It works on synthetic \\"leather like\\" products as well.
B0067P09B2|5|Shipping, easy Installation, quality, sound, and great boost in power. What else could you ask for. Very Happy with the results of my purchase. &#34;Can hardly wait for Spring to start riding more.
B00GZ746Q6|5|Please note that the kit for the RSX requires the use of some HID adapters that you can also buy here on Amazon.<br />The kit does not come with them.  I installed in just a few minutes and the lights work just fine.  It's weird that one of the lights is noticeably darker than the other one.  A buddy of mine said the same thing.  Don't know much about HID's so maybe it will wear in and be the same in time.  Have been running them for about a week now.  I put these in the same stock housings that the old halogen lights were in.  Some people say you shouldn't do that because you don't get the effects of using projectors, but I must say, they are wrong.  These things are bright.  Easily three times brighter than the halogens I had.  I haven't had anyone flash there lights at me because mine were too bright.  Driving at night is so easy now cause these light up the road like it's day time.  The thing I really noticed was being able to read road signs from much further away than before.
B009T539KA|5|perfect fit
B001TAPLYA|5|These headlights have good light pattern-- my old, aftermarket, headlamps projected a spiked pattern that did a poor job of illuminating the road.  With these, I can see the road!  They came with new lamps, too.  Good price, fast shipping.
B000BPSW7C|4|I just had a chance to use Nu Finish on my red truck. I was hoping Nu Finish could bring back to life the luster of my truck. We all know that red looks great when the vehicle is new but tends to fade as time goes by. All in all the Nu Finish did a pretty good job. It took a lot of the oxidation off the paint. The places where the paint was in good shape looks new again. I found that wiping it off quickly after applying it gave me the best results. I strongly suggest you do small sections at a time. Nu Finish dries quickly and can be difficult to remove if left on too long. I have read other reviews about the bad smell. It does smell bad but not any worse than other polishes and wax's I have used in the past. If you keep your expectations realistic I think you will be happy with this product. It will not bring back a totally failed paint job to showroom condition, but it will make your car look better.
B00192NCSU|5|Fit well and has worked fine. I would rate this a skilled &#34;Do it yourself&#34; project, but if you are dilligent you can save a lot of money.
B000Q0VCC4|5|Looks and works as expected.
B0002SRGYI|5|Very good tool
B008RAPM7G|2|Not enough power
B0036GL2T8|5|Love this thing, I put it on in about 15 minutes and it works great!
B000O3PI6O|5|Course file works great, a medium would be nice. The fine is kinda worthless.
B005FL28YU|5|Great brakes. Very nice look and functions better than stock. The retaining clips for the rear pads were a bit larger than stock. Would have rubbed on the side of the rotor. Used the originals instead. The other reviewer is right about the noise with the drilled and slotted rotors. Not noticeable unless the windows are down, but worth it given the better performance.
B000MXTLPU|5|My friend/ roommate had air shocks with no air in them.  I had to but the low pressure gauge to show him why he was bottoming out all the time.  Its fixed now.
B0058WXNOK|1|Not very good. I followed the directions explicitly,  and the adhesive did not stick very well. The patched area is already cracking again.
B003JBPHN2|5|Our dogs ride in the car every day.  After their walks, they have a fine - or not so fine - coating of dirt.  The seat cover (and good floor mats) keep the car from becoming a 4-wheeled gravel pit.  Good product.
B004UG84OY|5|Purchased this item on account of the revues, I have a jetski. Jetskis bounce around a lot and this battery is designed to take it. Great price and fast shiping
B003WHBVDI|5|This fit perfectly inside my 2006 Nomad hard saddlebag. The bottle shape is such that it takes up much less space than I thought and gives me another 40 miles in range.<br />It's a fair price, quickly shipped and is better than I expected.
B002R1BK4U|5|Worked Great, Easy Install!!
B007L8OQ86|5|Excellent quality and worth the price. The frame is thick and heavy and the wording is carved into the frame. The letters are filled in with some sort of enamel or shiny epoxy.
B004SFKJIQ|5|Perfect
B00B6Z1LLK|3|The Jaguar &#34;cats&#34; are stickers...very heavy, very solid but stickers?? Came in a very nice box but they could of thrown it in a plastic bag and my the cats more solid.
B001MUN57W|5|works great
B001AXXV98|5|Reasonably priced and it was a perfect match!
B00394TEKG|5|Perfect OEM part. Works great.
B004XEQN9Q|5|Satisfied customers
B00CZEZNGU|5|I have ordered two of these, they are good lights. They have minimum draw on my RV batteries and good lighting for what I needed.<br /><br />One of the lights arrived with one of the lenses damaged and unusable. The CS at the other end responded to my email quickly. There were no arguments over the issue, in fact the representative didn't ask for specifics, just the order number it was shipped on. The new lens was shipped out from the retailer the same day I contacted customer service!
B004AIHKT2|5|I am so happy that other companies have made this replacement part. After researching the issue when I couldn't get out of park, I was floored to find out that the garage will charge $400 to replace a whole gear shift. I checked around and saw that there was another plastic replacement made, which I was leary of and then there are other pieces $65 and up. This part is affordable and durable. Fit perfectly. I was so happy that for $20 and 2 hours, I could do this myself.
B005GYBBNK|5|Great helmet! Looks good.It has great air flow in the heat when the vents are open and is comfortable. The one downfall is that it can fog up easily on very cold mornings. I even bought a second one because I know I can trust it. The best thing i can say about it is that I know it works and will do it's job well if needed. I crashed right about at 30mph when the bike hit the ground and the left side of my head hit the pavement Hard. All I had was a slight fat lip and a headache for a bit. I then rode home 40 miles with a broken shoulder. Without this helmet though, at the very least I would be missing lots of teeth and my face would be scarred up - probably worse considering the headache I had.
B0043YNNVC|5|Heavy duty material. Looks good
B002802OUE|5|love it<br />tells people just how it is<br />they pass me cut me off then Im stuck behind them at the red light<br />they just have to be first I guess
B001XQ7TWM|4|This muffler is now on an old 95 honda TRX200 and it fits pretty good after fabbing up a mount bracket and slotting the end for clamping it on. Its not the quietest muffler ive ever heard, but much much quieter than the rotten one it replaced. For the price this is a great deal. It looks like decent quality part and hoping it holds up.
B005BTL1DK|5|We use this soap at our Diesel - Heavy Equipment Repair shop, you can only imagine the grease & grime!<br />This is the best working soap out there and with an added bonus, it doesn't dry the hands out!!!<br />We've had many sales men stop in with their version of the &#34;greatest shop&#34; and nothing compares to the Gojo Cherry Gel Pumice Hand Cleaner, not even the other Gojo products.
B000V8VZ78|4|Not used to a leather cleaner in such a large bottle and one that is a liquid instead of a paste, but it did a really good job on the sofa.  Will definitely last a long, long time.
B00712VQWQ|3|This item do not fit Sequoia with headlight washer system. Which most of Sequoias has. Washer system mounts directly to the bottom of the headlight. This item is useless for this.Otherwise it is OK. I sold it to Tundra owner.
B007SVE2R6|5|Perfect!
B006R0HLVS|5|works perfectly. My wife who has trouble connecting her seat belt just loves the extenders.
B00KTI9UQ8|5|works perfect
B0041DX8JW|5|Finally found a replacement that sounds like it can do the job. Have replaced it before and the previous unit, from day one, sounded like it was trying to lift an elephant. It didn't last long.
B002UX7INM|5|I bought  a $60 dlls  light bulbs before these ones and one of them burned out  a few months later. They weren't enough  bright as  the nightawk platinum. finally. I decided to buy a pair of these light bulbs for my car. they are really bright . I can see the road clearly. They pass my expectation, I'll recommend to buy these bulbs. Get them and you'll be surprised how great they are.
B000C936WI|5|I was looking for a quite muffler that would allow me to hear my radio and install in the factory location. This fit perfectly and is very quite. Also I had no clearence issues. I hate exhaust work and the sooner I'm finished the better I feel. Great Product. Added 6-25-2015 Just noticed that my muffler is now rusted through and will need replacement with in the next year. Gives you an idea of how long this muffler is good to last. Purchased October 2011. So my estimate is a 4 to 5 year muffler. Also highway miles, no beaches or off road use.
B001U2DPUE|2|It may work for some people, but it didn't really help reception any for me.  I ended up buying a complete new antenna by a different manufacturer.
B010JRL2MS|5|I was a little skeptical purchasing these window visors as they were much cheaper than others I found online. But after placing these on my car I am very pleased at the quality and ease of installation of these! They have a nice design that follows the accents of the Honda Fit 2015 side! They work very well and allow for my window to remain 1&#34; open even in heavy rain (which has been tested). 3M adhesive is also well-known for retaining stickiness so there shouldn't be any issue with the window visors falling off. I would highly recommend purchasing these for any Honda Fit 2015 to keep your car significantly cooler during the summer months!
B001W4SSVQ|4|seems to work as it says.The modes  I installed made a big difference. wish I did this years ago. recommend this product.
B00MC7Y9HY|5|Fantastic
B003JO38EE|4|thumbs up
B000GVO7IO|1|Did not work on my Dodge Ram 2500.  Also, seems to be overpriced for what you get.  For the price it should be made of stainless steel.
B00347RX4W|5|I installed this on my 1988 Audi 5000. It was an exact replacement for the failed original sensor and fit perfectly. Remember when installing a knock sensor that the torque of the bolt holding it on is important! Consult your repair manual for the specifics of your car.
B005SG1SNY|5|Fit on my kx100.  Looks nice for the price!
B008KZJV3Y|5|Exactly what I expected.
B008427D88|4|good fit. long time needed for 2005 eiger 4x4 4 wheeler. installed good, thanks for the 40 pack. happy, thanks
B008XVTBTE|5|When all you need to take to work is a small laptop and a couple of cords, the Newt II is the best bag I've found - especially if you're riding to work.<br /><br />The sling is well padded and easy to adjust.  The little &#34;pocket&#34; at the end of the sling is perfect for the phone/mp3 player.  It's well padded for your laptop and the little padded bumps allow for a lot of air flow on your back while riding.  Like all Ogio products, this product is well constructed and should last many years.
B00JJ685VC|4|was good ties was not sowed very good had to redo
B002N4MAZO|2|These blades miss part of my windshield. The top 1 inch. They are not curved enough to cleanly sweep the windshield. I had the Bosch Evolution blades on before I bought these. They do a much better job. I wont buy Valeo blades ever again
B00KTHY6TU|4|Had to go on YouTube to figure out how to install. Pretty simple to install. Overall it works really well, no problems with it.
B001AM8JGO|1|I'm sure the shock kit works & functions just fine. But the whole transaction was/is a fiasco. Was lied about shipping & the part availability. Then the part is incorrect & Just Suspensions does not want to exchange them for the correct part. I did NOT want a refund. Gabriel Shocks have always been a quality product. Would not hesitate to buy a Gabriel product.
B00FAOVPFA|5|The perfect OEM solution to keep the cargo area of my Jeep Compass clean and &#34;non-skid&#34;! Looks good and custom fitted.
B0026M7VSE|5|From what I see made in USA.  This is same brand as the timing chain set I purchased.  Not yet installed, but quality looks good.
B00GHT8NM0|5|Thank u very much
B004004EWQ|5|I was searching for a big sun shade for my SUV car and I decided to get this one because of its large size - despite the fact that I am not a disney characters big fan :S  However, the sun shades look beautiful and the colours are so vibrant and the size fits perfectly big SUVs.  I live in Dubai where it is very very hot in the summer and a sun shade is essential. I am happy I got this one.  I would have been happier with a more 'adult' theme or colours but really, this one is so cute that it doesn't bother me :) I recommend it for people with big cars.
B002EC3PX6|5|As expected, i was the right fit and seems to be good quality.
B000C541OE|5|Cheap part, saved 20$ haven't had no problems driving on. 2010 dodge charger sxt
B00EAOIKVI|1|I would like to shoot the person that designed the cabin air filtration system in the Nissan Murano. I am not exactly pleased with Fram either. This filter is the same size, shape and design (as far as how it fits, not how it filters the air) as the factory filter. When I took my wife's car to get the oil changed the brought me two dirty filters and said they need to be changed. They wanted something like $40 for the engine filter and $80 for the cabin filter. The engine filter cost $7 and this cabin filter cost $15, so far so good.  The problem started when I opened the box for this filter and read the instructions. It says to remove the glovebox.  My first clue that this was wrong was probably where it said the only tool needed is a Phillips head screwdriver. I had to use my starhead driver.  I wondered if the place that did the oil change may have switched them so that I would bring it back to them. I used my starhead driver to remove all the screws but still could not get the glovebox out so I went to framfreshbreeze.com website where they say they have videos and more instructions.  I enter the year and make of her car 2012 Nissan and under model there is no Murano listed. In their FAQ there is a pertinent question and Fram's answer is that if the model is not listed then it probably doesn't have a factory installed cabin filter. I searched Google and found You Tube videos. The first one I watched showed someone removing Phillips head screws from the glovebox. It also said &#34;if you have an air filter behind the glovebox there will be a sticker in the glovebox telling you how often to change it. So I looked on google for more instructions and found a site that listed instructions for Nissan Murano models from 2009 to 2013. The cabin filter on these is behind the center console and there is a section of carpet on the passenger side of the tunnel that can be removed (not easily and not always without breaking something). The compartment for the filter is close to the firewall and while it is not hard to reach with your hand you can't stick your head in there and look inside, nor can you easily position a mirror to look inside. The factory filter I removed did not have an arrow indicating airflow, but even if it had or even if I based it on how much dirt and stuff was trapped on one side doesn't prove that the guy at the oil change shop put it back in facing the right way. The best instructions I found that told me the correct place to find the filter had conflicting instructions as to which way to face it. In text they said to point the arrow toward the rear of the vehicle but the yellow arrow they put on the picture was facing the front of the vehicle. I not only assume the text was more correct than the image but this filter has a tab attached on one side. If you put the other side in first (no matter which way you face the arrow) the tab would be impossible to reach.  If you put the opposite side in first so the tab is on the outside edge then with the air flow arrow facing same as the arrow in the picture it would be at the top, much harder to reach. With the tab at the bottom the air flow arrow is facing the rear which matches the text instruction. Getting the filter into the smaller hole was the cause of much cursing that was probably heard by many of my neighbors as well as my wife. I turned on the AC in hopes of cleaning out the compartment (which worked) and finding out for sure which direction the air flowed (which didn't work). Instead of air flowing from front to back like I suspect it is supposed to the air just flowed from inside the compartment to outside. I have no idea how much air flows around the filter because of the way it has to be crammed into the compartment that houses it. I bet it rarely, if ever, expands back out to its original square shape after being crammed in there. Attached is a photo of the one I pulled out after it had been put back in at the oil change place.  I wonder what the new oneI just put in looks like now.I just put in looks like now.
B004HB2ID0|5|it worked great it makes my riding alot easier now that it is on my helmet thanks for getting it here so quick  i needed it the next day for a ride i went on thanks
B007P746SS|4|very good price and everything needed to complete timing belt/water pump service
B005FKRKVC|5|Its a bargain and I noticed that my car stops better than original.
B00C0YKJ6E|5|I wanted an oil drain that wouldn't set me back a few hundred dollars and would be able to get pressurized to evacuate the oil.  I was looking at the Lincoln as I know their products well after being in the industry.  I saw another post comparing this to the Lincoln.  I am here to tell you it is basically the exact same without the sticker.  The product came damaged and they made good on it with an entire new one!  I give this 5 stars because if this.  The only thing that as damaged was the gauge.  If the company didn't make good on it you can still buy a gauge and an adaptor for about 15 dollars so it wouldn't have been a big deal.  In the box when I opened it was a warranty tag that said Lincoln on it.  Don't be fooled this and Lincoln's is the same without the sticker in my opinion.
B0068G18E2|3|Installed on my 2010 FLHTCU and for the part I'm happy.  The suspension is way sportier and handles exceptionally well in the corners.  That said, I've almost blacked out after hitting some pot holes and other road imperfections.  These things are tight and do not tollerate harsh changes nearly as well as the OEM shocks.  Trade-off for better handling I guess.  I'm 6ft, 210lbs and have the preload set to its lightest setting.
B004WO91V4|5|The ride is a little bit rough right now, but I'm hoping that it will soften up a little bit as they get worn in. Installation was very easy and straight forward. I just wish that it came with new hardware for the bottom bolts because my stock ones almost were too small to fit back in. I just went to the hardware store and bought more, so it wasn't a big deal and now it fits perfectly. Way way beefier and better than my stock shocks on my Cherokee.
B001AIZ5HY|3|Worked well, just need more of the sanding paper.  I restored lens on a 14 year old vehicle.  I needed more paper than what was included and it is difficult to find this grit in a store after I ran out mid project.  If your lens are bad use this product, it works great - just buy a kit for each lens.
B00PES5YOU|1|The part was wrong would not fit on my snowblower
B00HCVRPY4|1|it broke after one week
B005CGZ5HU|5|These are the perfect replacement for my 12V 7W deck lighting system.  Like many, I've grown tired of the expense and constant replacement of the small and overpriced 7W incandescent bulbs that I would have to buy every few months from Home Depot.  These LED lightbulbs are a spot on replacement in terms of the color and light emitted.  Technically the bulbs I was using were T5 bulbs, but I found these to fit perfectly.  I look forward to the money savings over time and should have upgraded to these years ago!
B0053P6BR8|5|Very nice hitch. Great service. Would recommend can't go wrong with curt hitch. Priced very affordable. Won't find a better hitch for the price
B000RNW5HQ|5|This hitch fit my 2004 Honda odessey perfect.  I went with the hitch with the heaviest shipping weight for heaviest duty. I could probably pull 10,000 lbs easily with this hitch.
B00DU0DFIG|4|It's great fast delivery great price great product but one thing just a stitch on the arm where the pieces meet kind of rubs my arm  funny.... Took a rubber mallet to it much better
B005HR29BO|5|Very comfortable. A big improvement over the stock grips. I used to suffer from hand fatigue but with these new grips and my Harley Davidson gloves my hands no longer get tired. I can ride for a long time now and I even added a grip boss to mine so it makes riding a more enjoyable experience. I recommend getting a boss if you get the grips. It's worth it.
B005N1PFSS|1|A light is supposed to be luminous and these things were only good for matching the color of my HID lights.  If they are on without any headlights you will not see any light if you are sitting in the car.  The worst part about my experience with them is that one of them is flickering now after less than 3 months of use.  Amazon should remove this product and I should get my money back!  I would have given this product no stars if possible.  Just plain shiesty!
B00DW91LX6|5|Love It
B007O0WZEI|5|Seems to be of sturdy construction and fits easily over the keyfob.  A recommended replacement part for a broken keyfob.
B003RV48ES|5|Loves this! Exactly what was advertised and it makes my car look sharp! Thanks!
B00B0C1VK0|5|Really was pleased even though I had to return first set . Didn't have to wait long at all for replacement. Look great on my car and also work great
B00ED3YVWS|1|These didn't fit my 2004 Suburban. If I held them in place, they'd light up but as soon as I let go the light would go out.
B003021HZ2|5|Thanks you for the light😃😎 1*light right lens no good😱
B00F5ZMZUS|5|My wife loves going on rides with me but hates when the sun glares into her eyes.  So I found her a tinted visor and now she's happy all the time.  And a happy wife is a happy ride.
B00K6D6TFQ|1|Does not light up well.
B00BQHF2FO|1|Was not compatible with my short shifter. Cannot blame them but at least be able to tell the customers what its compatible with before buying the product.
B001R91QN8|5|Excellent item.  Exactly as described.  Great price.  Looks great on my truck.  The only downside is that everyone is constantly asking what 26.2 means.  I can't wait until I earn my 140.6 sticker.
B00032K3RA|5|Sets off the plate by giving it a finished look without blocking any of it since the plate fits inside.
B004BT6N2K|5|This wiper took a few seconds to install.  It does an amazing job, cleans up snow and mud leaving my windshield streak free.  The lack of pressure points seems to help dramatically over conventional wipers.
B0030I7SW2|1|This is an adorable concept only mine were torn right out of the package. My kids are so disappointed. :(
B003N5IHHM|5|Love it.. reminds of happy times
B004I0WC9U|5|Arrived on time.  Easty to Install.  Virtually indistiguishable from OEM part.  One third the price as the OEM part and did not have to back order from the Ford dealer
B008JCW9GY|5|easy to install on truck .fit nicely looks good on truck.but still havent tryed it out on any thing to give it a good test
B002MYLB1Y|3|They do the job.  Wish they were a little longer.  They are short ones compared to the ones you would buy at a motorcycle shop.  But they perform as intended.  I will keep them.
B00R516D3K|5|It is the length I was looking for.  C<br />Clamps seem to be on well and good quality.  Highly recommended!
B007JEK29O|4|fit 1991 Nissan 300ZX with some tweeting, works good so far
B003N4DNY0|5|This decal speaks volumes from my bumper.  It looks great and was easy to apply.  I received it in a timely manner and received received a bonus peace decal with my order.
B002SWZMQ0|5|Just what I needed. Saved a ton of money fixing the problem myself. The control was a genuine Ford product. It took less than 60 seconds to install
B004I0H86C|5|It was great, fit just like the original ones. I did not follow the instruction, too much work. I just broke off the old ones and glued in the base of the new ones. Seems to be holding fine. Thank you
B000CITK8S|5|keeps my boat batteries fully charged. For the price you can not beat it
B00GRRFLOK|5|Firs great. Easy installation
B000WJ87PY|3|It looks nice...it does it job...but you can barely see the characters and some of the materials are poking out...not that well made.
B00F9RNIPI|5|They're as good as advertised and more....it includes the booster cables (very good quality) a bag to keep em and some gloves
B00G733U10|5|Good product timely shipping.
B0002SRCMO|5|Tool works great for removing the door clips and fender liners on cars and trucks. I have used this tool many times now with great results it does not bend and is a great value.
B00684TIVE|5|Been needing one of these for a long time. took me all of a minute and a half to program.
B00REDBJ56|1|Looks like cheap Christmas wrapping paper. Not even close to the picture. Junk.
B002R1OFGU|5|Over all, happy. Can find a bad thing to say. They look great.
B00CSWB5S4|5|Was a Christmas gift for my brother in law, he loved it!
B000HZWX2Q|5|Really works well. and keeps him organized.  snacks....drinks stay cold. Glad that I got this product.  He can get in and out of it easily.
B0074DE5FM|5|Took forever to find this, have had this on my 86 teg for around 6 months now, still holding up great.
B000C2SBPW|3|All in all it worked for what it's ment for but I had to take it oFf after partial install and trim about 3to 4 inches to fit both lower and upper  hose
B0017HVUZO|5|This is my second Champion cover in 15 years, offer coverage over your bike for sun and light rain. The last one was sold with my last Gold Wing. Brought a new one, so had to have another cover.
B00GQFR1TQ|5|This product is awesome.<br />The down side for me is we are having problems with it not working continuously on two of the three. Good customer service in the past. One was replaced without a problem. Have not sent notice of issues to company yet. This
B002UC1AYQ|5|We bought this to replace the one that busted in our camper. After research, I was able to find this online and it worked perfectly.
B00063L4GK|4|I mainly use meguiars chemical products as I prefer them over any other brand.  I needed a smaller polishing pad than the 8\\" for smaller tighter spaces and this allows me to do just that.  Other than that not much of a review here, its a piece of plastic with a hook and loop pad glued to it with a hole in the middle... Not much more to it than that.  $15.00 In my opinion still seems a bit steep for what it is but it sure beats the $23.00 the local auto parts store wanted for it. Thanks amazon.
B0009IQZH0|5|Perfect thing to purchase with the complete car care kit. works wonderfully.
B005D0JYRM|3|It was listed to fit a 2000 Tacoma.  No way did it fit.  The product itself looks sturdy at a good price.  Too bad its labeled wrong.
B00DSD79IM|5|sticks very well and very good quality, I used it on my metal tool box which really looks great
B000IZ5ZO8|5|Can get in the driver door again without having to open door from the back. It's great having everything working again. This was an exact replacement
B007OW5Z48|5|The filters fit my car and I thank the supplier of a great job of sending the right parts. O.K.
B00CE5U86K|5|I bought these for my 2008 G35 Infinity....These are excellent and as advertised !  I got all four for the price of less than one from the dealer !<br /><br />Had the local guy at the tire store install and program these for about $80<br /><br />Great deal would recommend to Family and Friends
B00DMEFH7W|5|Satisfied thanks
B00ZDNHCI2|5|I absolutely love them
B00B4XBQPU|5|Very nice quality frame. Goes well with my car. There was one problem though - the screws provided with the frame did not fit well on my Camry's rear. But I had spare screws so used them instead. The provided screws were good for the front plate.<br />Extremely happy with the quality of the frame. After the 2 bolts are screwed in tightly, you cant even move the bottom screwless part of it. Forget about rattling! Attached a picture just so that you guys know how it looks!<br /><br />Very neat and sturdy frame. Quite happy with it!
B0006302PE|5|Used it for my trailblazer  I didn't notice anything in the performance or MPG
B00L1K912G|5|We received our kit and were very impressed.  The bag is durable, it is full of everything you'd need in an emergency, and it is the perfect size for you car or closet.  I definitely feel my family is more prepared having it in our home.
B005XRH2YC|5|Excellent condition. The product was arrived as exactly described.
B003RYOWH8|3|Using on 2015 Mazda 3 isport hatchback<br />--The seat back (top of cover) fit fairly well but when the entire cover is secured, it raises off of the seat toward the steering wheel slightly.<br />--The bottom part of the cover is slightly larger than the seat<br />--The head rest covers are much wider than the head rest of the car.  The covers, even when pulled taught, end up being significantly baggy at the corners.<br /><br />For the price, these will do what I need them to do but they are certainly not as form fitting as images portray.
B003OFBWS2|5|Great little bell. Would recommend it to friends or buy it again no problem.
B000FGIBYQ|4|could have a better strap to hold it down but works ok
B0068ODC1Q|5|Remotes arrived quickly, the programming sheet that was included with the two remotes I bought was easy to follow, and I was able to reprogram the two new remotes as well as one old one to my 2004 Chevy Tahoe within 5 minutes.  I even had one remote which didn't synch on the first try, but the included instructions told me how to handle that contingency and everything worked perfectly.  Highly recommend this particular remote from this seller for anyone with a 2004 Chevy Tahoe.
B002Y0EP64|3|Functionality is as expected.  Acceptable.  However, on the face of the ammeter, 'amperes' is incorrectly spelled 'ampers'.  The issue was reported immediately to Schumacher.  What a waste of time.  They acknowedged the error but offer no solution whatsoever and have ignored follow-up.  Buy something else made by a more responsive manufacturer.  No point in paying top dollar and getting poor service for it.
B0000AXQPA|3|Have not installed because I don't really want to cut out the dash enough to mount it.  Looks good.
B00GLJYLKO|5|Pretty bright white light. Will see how it last
B004XG3R3O|3|I like tag holder and the way it works. Wish it was American made not Chinese made. If it had been American made I would have given it 5 stars.
B004HJJOZC|4|The helmet looks good and fits like I expected. The visor should be easier to open with one hand. It seems like a very good deal for the money, but I do not plan on trying it out to test the durability. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.
B00HCVRPY4|1|Didn't last one day!!  Broke apart.
B002A33S2W|5|Perfect!
B004SR7JVO|5|After I installed this I heard the clicking noise for a few miles and then it went away.  It was extremely easy to install.  You could probably change this out yourself blind folded with one hand behind your back.<br /><br />I was troubleshooting a 4 wheel drive issue on a 2004 F150.  If I were you I would go ahead and purchase this and see if it corrects your issue because it is a small expense and super easy to replace.
B00AZXBDY4|5|I've owned my Craftsman lawn mower for about 7 years and so far have not ever done any maintenance on it. I am not sure why, but I think it was because I was too lazy to find out the plug number and it was still running fine. THe oil looks clean still too, even though I've never changed it either. So when this kit came up, I thought, \\"why not?\\"<br /><br />Included in the kit is oil, a plug, a fuel stabilizer and a spark plug. The kit holder acts as a oil drain pan But the coolest thing? It actually includes all the right parts! I looked it up in my manual (finally) and it has all the right numbers for the air filter, plug and the right weight of oil. The oil drain pan and filler funnel being part of the packing is really neat.<br /><br />This makes the kit extremely convenient ... all the right part all in the same place. Everything, of course, works as expected. As long as you have a nice standard Briggs and Stratton engine on your mower, you're set.
B000EDOSSI|4|It was just as it was advertised at except the rings where in fact silver colored and not black as shown.  It could be a problem for some people..
B00JU65OP6|5|I bought it for my wife's  side of the car. She likes it. others would not fasten to the visor very well.
B000AMKUIA|4|Had lots of fun with this.
B00IO3D750|5|Arrived quickly, and met all expectations. Literally, a snap to install and worked perfectly on my 2006 Mercury Grand Marquis. Very good value.
B0046AOV8M|4|Use this in my tractor.. works good wish it held different sizes a little better but at least im not losing my coffee every time!
B000SOCTFW|5|I use this product to connect my laptop to speakers or a tv, it works great, and no signs of wear or tear yet.  Sound quality is really quite good for a converter like this.  Overall, I am very satisfied.
B00BEYDGPC|4|Bought these some time back (along with a Red Wings steering wheel cover) to decorate my wife's car with her favorite hockey team's logo. I've been pleased with the mats. Granted, my wife isn't exactly stomping on her car mats with mud-caked workboots every day... but they've held up to what little abuse they have faced.<br /><br />When she got a new car and we were switching the accessories over to the new car, it was hard not to notice that the mats were still in really good shape (even if they could stand a cleaning).
B001KQAAFS|3|Straight bolt on. Didn't work as well as factory. But not bad for price
B00WQOCLGY|5|This is a great product, the tape measurers have a rubbery type grip so they don't slip from your hand, they are easy to hold and beefy feeling. They are clearly marked and can be locked. I was very surprised at the quality of these. I am even using the small one to add to my supplies for sewing. I would definitely recommend these. They seem to be built to last.
B005212WTO|5|Great!! As described.
B007JSGR9Y|1|Called customer support and apparently these are copies not the real one and they are also outdated.The reason i called is because this scanner only worked on my 2005 ford focus not my 2000 hyundai or my 2003 f150.I also used it on my friends 2000 grand prix and it shut his computer down and we could not start the car.Autel head quarters in the USA notified amazon and they continue to allow these sellers to sell them.I blame amazon for allowing this to happen.This is just another chinese  dump  on the marked.Let the buyer beware!
B00G4FOM4A|5|these tial external wastegates are fantastic at controlling boost,i have this currently installed on my wrx running 21psi<br />i also use an electronic boost control solenoid,even with ebcs in cold weather i used to overboost like crazy<br />ever since i got my tial external wastegate it has ever happened again these are top notch when it comes to boost control<br /><br />fit and finish is also very nice plus its made in the usa!
B0065X5AY2|1|Just so you know, says it comes with clutch springs, actually only the clutch friction plates, no springs. Upset, leaving on a motorcycle trip in 2 days, counted on the springs to be in the kit as described, guess ill find them elsewhere.
B000HNCBX4|5|We ordered this for our granddaughter's power wheels jeep and it works like it is supposed to.  Make sure you are orderiing the right charger for the battery that you have or are buying.
B003BLSISG|5|makes my license plates look classically outstanding! Material sturdy - well made. fit is perfect! Great value that would last for years on end!
B000LG9C5C|2|It started out fine but then one day it just lost its programming.
B00NB2X060|4|cute-small it works
B000FCINUW|5|I like this adapter a lot. It cuts down on all of the things I need to have in my truck box to be ready to tow. and it works very well.
B002NC6GYW|5|Arrived quickly and was exactly what I was expecting.  Easy to apply and left no air bubbles.  Looks great!  Only problem was it got bent in the mailbox, despite the packaging saying not to.
B00AN5SGL2|5|Very reasonable priced.  Followed their installation and break in period and they have worked great.  Pleased so far,  just hoping they continue.
B002ZZ046S|4|Everything was good except they took the seat covers out of the boxes and folded the boxes on top .. it was a gift I am glad I checked before I gifted
B003CSP8GS|4|Item is totally adequate.  Can't beat the price and it performs the function. I would have liked to know the size before buying, but that most likely would not have stopped purchase.  It is a bit on the small side.
B003YL15V0|5|Works as expected.
B00CLFYW1K|4|Nice. I thought it would be matt black though.
B001RJN56Y|5|Wish theses where available at the local auto parts store. Squash is the Flavor to have. and it does last for while.
B007KP0J5O|1|after three replacements it still doesn't work.  ending up buying one from my local repair ship and now i have a good one
B00C0XCHKG|5|Good product for price. Stabilizer shocks are all valved 50/50 so you don't have to spend big bucks on big name stabilizers
B0036E9VB6|1|The screw-on ring that holds the fuse & spring or whatever is inside the lighter plug came undone, & whatever was inside was lost. I called Viair customer service to find out the specifics so i can buy the parts or have them send the repacements. I was told they're out of them, so i asked if he could tell me more about the spring - would a spring from inside a pen work, what size fuse do I need, etc. the idiot said i can't do that because it will void the warranty. Really? Do you mean the warrenty on the thing i can't return or use?<br /> I threatened to return the compressor - he said I can't do that, then he asked if i needed something else? I was so fustrated that I called back hoping to s/w a manager or @ least someone that walks upright. Apparently Einstein in customer service was smart enough to recognize ny caller ID, because no matter what department or extension I tried, he answered the phone.<br />I feel like spending $300 on air fare so I can throw a $40 POS through their window.<br />I literally couldn't tell you if this thing works - it was only used once.<br />If I can't get this thing to work, I'll buy another portable compressor - of a different kind. I know in the grand scale of things my $40 won't make or brake these guys, but maybe the dipstick I s/w will hear about this.<br />3 hrs later<br />I did call back & get the fuse size - the girl that helped me said \\"no problem, I'll send you the spring & fuse\\". Nothing about being out of them.<br />If I do receive what was promised, I'll upgrade my star rating. i will still have to \\"penalize\\" Viair for hiring a buffoon & giving him a customer service job.<br />DUDE! ....You're FIRED!
B00LBIUMI0|5|I recieved the 9006 HB4 Diamond White HID kit for my Scion tC and it totally changed the look of the car. You get way better lighting on the road at night and last longer. I feel like a jerk driving behind people using these but oh well can't beat them join them :)
B00DZ4GZUC|5|Perfect fit good stuff
B004X5Q9JE|3|Struts look real good but have a hard ride after installation. Maybe they will wear in but car rides like a truck now. It is a lot of work to remove and change to a different set so I will live with it.
B00HQP3PP4|5|Installation on my MB CLA250 was very quick. Just remove the tow hook access cover on the front bumper, screw in the tow hook adapter, secure the license mounting plate with the supplied screw to the tow hook adapter,and  then install the plate with supplied screws. All supplied pieces are well made and I would expect them to last the life of the car. The license mounting plate has an angled tang with a hole that the  screw goes through to secure it to the tow hook adapter. The angle of the tang to the main part of the mounting plate as received was not enough to keep the plate from rubbing on the bumper. However it was easy to slightly increase the angle between the tang and the plate so it now clears the bumper by about a 1/4 inch. I've had this setup on the car for a couple of weeks and have checked to insure it stays in position since either the mounting plate or the plate and tow hook adapter could possibly loosen from road vibrations and rotate, but so far everything has stayed very secure in position exactly as originally mounted.
B000COY3Z2|5|replaced original plugs 68800 miles with these and Bosch 09017 Premium Spark Plug Wire Set. starts quicker and gained 2 mpg average. very pleased
B000FQ01Q2|5|perfect fit
B000KK9SLW|5|Product Has<br />1. Instruction for jump starting an engine. Includes caution for using a Car or Truck to jump start a Motorcycle or similar sized vehicle.

B000BRJF76|3|I haven't installed this product as yet but it looks ver classy. The only problem I have with this product is that mine came with a sketchy side. Meaning on one side the is remnance of dried glue and is'nt stuck as well as the other side.
B001FAK342|5|Easy install looks great
B0022Y9PMQ|5|Feels great to wear them on. Warm and comfortable.
B001JT5PH4|3|I doing like how the adjustment bolts hol the bracket away from the mounting surface but it works fine and you could always put the bolts through everything to clamp together.
B005N53AM2|5|I bought this to match the seat covers I bought at a parts store. it fits good, not awkwardly big/puffy like many covers I looked at. the only thing is that those little annoying fuzz balls, that form on knitted blankets and such, form on the areas where your hand is usually affixed. looks great and it will protect your wheel from sun damage and normal wear.
B001AVSIOI|5|Works out well on my 2001 Dodge 2500 front and rear tow receivers, using them to secure D ring tow hitches for pulling.  The rubber seal looks like it may keep the water and salt out of the tumbler assembly.  Not concerned about the small O ring seal as it is an easy replacement at any hardware store for about 10 cents.  I have always trusted Master Locks !!
B0051D3MP6|5|Works well
B004GDETUO|4|Finally called bodyshop for genuine replacement.
B001KM5IZO|3|I installed this in my chevy express van. I used it to replace the carpet pad in the front of the van that got soaked from a water leak.  Even though it makes a little difference, I don't know if it was worth the money.  It was about $200 to do just the front cab area.
B006QH552E|5|I probably cranked for a solid 15 minutes without issue when I was having a fuel problem, or a carburetor issue, or maybe a blinker fluid problem, as you can see I'm not exactly a mechanic. But I know the battery kept cranking like the little engine that could. Also, the poles were on the front of the battery instead of the back and my car had zero slack in the cables, so it required extensions to be installed, if you try and flip it then you have the same issue trying to get to the far pole, something to keep in mind if you have a car with the battery posts in the (subjective) rear of the battery and no slack in them.  Update: A few months in and 0 issues, even after it sat unused for a month for unrelated mechanical problems.
B00NPIBLZW|2|These are very bright , cheaply made one light broke during installation.
B00D619OGQ|5|Best wire harness you will get from Amazon. I ordered this for my 54&#34; bar and a cheap harness for my 20&#34; bar. There is a significant quality difference in every piece of the product.
B002P8QWSO|3|Didn't come with an adapter for power mirrors adjustments.
B00EOGP4SY|4|Fits perfect. Just have different symbols on pad so I used original pad and new shell.
B000C7YLEW|5|So far has worked great and fixed the problem nicely.price was good as well
B00FOVQPRW|2|One arrived broken. I glued it.
B0000AX7ER|5|This little thing works pretty darn good!  Worth the money and didn't have to go to a body shop.  Needs a pretty flat surface to get good suction.  Otherwise a little patience and you can get a lot of dents out with it.
B000C17G5E|5|This product brought a 97 Grand Prix back from the dead. The EGR pipe heats the intake and floods the engine with water. This kit comes with everything including a redesigned EGR pipe. The shop wanted $500, save yourself some money and do it yourself. I needed to buy an inch pound torque wrench to tighten the manifold,don't skip this step. The manifold is plastic. Remember to change the spark plugs after you get the water out, they get glazed with water in the cylinder. I turned my engine over for awhile with the plugs out (remove the spark and fuel fuses) and cleaned all water from the head before installing the manifold.
B000CNJBPA|3|Fan would not fit application. Fan did look like a good piece of equipment. Disappointed by it not fitting.
B00RHCDPAQ|1|Color are way off, once you touch it up which you can easy to see the different.
B00EN34U9W|1|I was prepared to love this bumper sticker, however, when it arrived the print quality was really poor.  It is not glossy like most bumper stickers, so I'm worried about how it will hold up after a few rains. Also, it was sent in a plain letter envelope, but the shipping was $2!
B0064R9T0U|5|great
B0096GL09Y|5|Good condition
B0045VXQK6|2|I can't say enough good things about the system in general.  The case however needs some design changes.  I have had the case for about 1 month and the rubber is peeling from the corners revealing a hard shell underneath.  The contact point for the magnetic system is not centered, so using it in landscape mode is not an option.  The fit is not quite as good as I would expect from a case at that price point.  There is a gap at the top and the bottom which makes it look cheap.  Like I said, the system is excellent, the case is not.  I am using one of the metal contact buttons adhered to my old case and find that much better solution.  I bought the case because I thought the integrated metal contact would be better and not accidentally fall off, but the button is fairly adhered to my old case.  I am no longer worried the button will fall off<br /><br />Update: after a few months the outer coating on the case has almost completely peeled off.
B0006IX7UQ|5|Great size for my RV frig!  I also like the size in my glass!
B003UF3VQC|5|Fits right and very very warm
B001QVF7IM|5|This product works as advertised.  Works very good for covering up minor blemishes and scratches.  From my experience it lasts for six months or more.  Follow up with a good wax.
B003RAODMG|2|Very cheaply made. Not too impressed. Not actually a DOT helmet either.
B00INU19DQ|1|Lasted 2 miles
B007IQFJ5U|1|Don't waste your money. More Chinese Junk.
B000CCM3JC|3|got this, and it felt like it was empty, I used it to lock in my pegs on my Harley, i think I should have gone for something stronger, this didn't hold all that great.
B00IWNUMAA|5|What a life saver. Did the repair with intake on and only took about 1.5 hours.Saved hundreds of dollars and additional hours. Well made.
B007B6MXVA|5|I Love it and its Great to have it on my truck to Share The Word of God. Where ever I go Jesus Christ Is The Only One True God.  God Is Love
B003GD2LBE|4|Nice solar color changing light. It reads 1/2 threaded stem but is 1/4 with odd threads so you need their brand pole or pole adapter. I used a threaded sleeve and bushing for my aplication. I read nothing about UV inhibitors so don't know how the plastic globe will hold up to sunlight. Priced a little high and slow shipping, not Amazon
B004HE3WAU|5|Fit & working well.
B005P5DSW2|5|Nice cover. Fabric outside and a waterproof, fabric looking material outside. Fits snug over the original 32&#34; Goodyear RS-A tire that came on the Jeep Wrangler. Tight is right for tire covers. You don't want it blowing off. I recommend it.
B00II99ORU|5|Much better than conventional bulbs that just don't last
B007M5QH6C|5|I thought the product was absolutely excellent. I had it installed in less than five minutes. It is working like a charm and I couldn't be happier.
B000C9ILAA|5|strong gasket. new in package.
B001F11ZQQ|3|LED is kind of... way too bright.
B00480N0SC|4|Good, but not as big of a difference in brightness from OEM. I did not see any blue tint with these.
B004UQQSSI|5|Just follow the directions and add a few ounces of the micro fiber cleaner to your washing machine detergent and wash on hot. It will get those MF towels clean and ready for the next job.
B00681BDXI|5|This remote looks and works like the original one.  I haven't tested the range, but it works at least 50 feet away which is plenty for me.  It is easy to program, I just followed the instructions in my Ford 2002 Focus manual.  About the same as programming a garage door remote.  I am very happy with this purchase.
B008AY8E8S|5|I did a self install on my MB c230 sport after putting it off for quite a while. It was easy and saving a lot of money. The pins that come with the pads were just a little longer than the ones i had on before, but it fit no problem! The pads are ceramic Andalusia braking very responsive. I used rotors from centric also. I have to say I am very happy with the outcome and performance of the brambles and pad by centric. I'll be sure to buy from them again. Also I called centrics customer service and it was already 9pm est and they were still open and very helpful! Wonderful company and amazing products!<br /><br />-Elijah
B007RNXZOG|5|Perfect fit, conceals and blends well with material on C7.
B0050SFZBG|5|The tip is a little sharp so pay attention, have heard of people prying and popping holes in the hoses.  Extremely handy on most hoses and the corroded stuck hoses this thing is a time saver and must have.  Have been impressed over the last year of using it.  Only used it about a dozen times including an engine swap in the boat, but every time was quick and rather painless.  From small hoses to large - Won't go without one anymore.  The only time it can't help is where you can't get into a certain area and still work it in and around on the neck of the hose.  Like I had one hose behind a heat exchanger on the boat that you couldn't get behind and had to do the old fashioned screwdriver down onto - but just about every other hose - it is my weapon of choice.
B003VSJ4DC|4|Protects my back seat I have a 7year old and a 6month old, the cover takes all the juice and cookies not my car. Something got snagged on it and it ripped when I pulled on it but at least that was not my seat
B002G1PBW8|4|Like others have said, the tool doesn't quite fit...I used a file and filed down the tip and then hit it with some sandpaper to remove any burrs, then it worked fine, both valves fit just fine
B00936PB60|5|Great price and item
B00JHEG7UC|5|works great no flicker at all , output is good, been installed for 2 months now
B000C767O4|5|Easy to install and bleed.  Would buy them again.
B0085J4JQY|1|Very cheap quality, the glue is not very sticky and at the end i had to remove all the film from the taillights. Do not buy this!
B0002NIM7I|4|Surprisingly good quality for something that was so inexpensive. I've had this cover for a few months and I love it!
B00M8J4LTC|5|Good solid bumper, very impressed!!
B008VM0TLO|2|The product itself is made well. The installation is the issue. The nylon straps at the base do not have a bracket with teeth so do not stay in place easily. I had to tie them off on the anchor. The clips that go to the car ceiling are poorly constructed and do not stay in place. The shade kept pulling the clips off the ceiling and closing shot. I have to figure out another way to get them to stay. If these 2 things were replaced, the product would be acceptable.
B003BGYWUE|5|Together I used the VHT Real Orange Caliper Paint, VHT caliper cleaner, VHT high temp primer and VHT caliper clear coat.  I kept the calipers on the car, wheels off.  I used the spray cleaner and wire brush to knock off debris. Next I masked off the areas with painter tape.  After that I used the about four coats of primer, paint and clear coat each with about ten minutes in between each light coat.  I cured the paint by driving and braking hard for about a half hour.  it has been a couple of weeks, the calipers are still beautiful looking.  Would I do these again, absolutely.
B006E2PKN0|5|Bought a couple of these for my cabover camper to replace the hot reading lights in the sleeping area. They have a good bright white light for reading and are cool to the touch. They also save battery power.
B008I7R6U4|4|It looks very good and it was very simple to replace.
B001DRBYOA|5|Went on with ease. This unit takes two different size gaskets (not included), so be sure to order with that in consideration.
B00GO9UA8S|5|great product and fast delivery!
B002ZBPXGS|5|I use this on Audi, Mercedes, BMW (lol), Porsche, Mark Cross, LV, Dunhill, Montblanc, Coach, and wallets from Wal-Mart. It has never let me down. The applicators are nice to allow working the conditioner into the nooks and crannies.
B00JFOI2IY|5|Bought these to do some wiring and they worked perfectly!
B007LIB6AW|4|Loved this steering wheel cover and looked fabulous for the money.  The black and red color combination was quite striking.
B0071NAO28|5|This lower bumper grill insert is a nice way to make your truck one of a kind. Don't be that guy that drives by another dodge and thinks he doesn't have one, it looks fine without them. So nevertheless you never ordered it. Don't be that guy! Pick up this tube type lower grill insert, you'll start a trend in your town. Make your truck look as good as possible. If you have fog lights, it looks totally tubular! So turn some head and good luck.
B000C44C94|5|Great replacement for OEM 1997 Del Sol.
B001DCJ42E|5|Theses struts are simple to install and always fit perfectly.  I've used this brand on numerous vehicles trunk lids, hoods & liftgates with good results. No failures over several years. Amazon makes buying and receiving easy.  The Prime membership is worth way more than the cost.
B00877SL2M|4|used on 1989 and 2010 tag and corner lights. My brighter than regular bulb.
B005NLQAHS|2|need software
B00EAMBIU0|1|I was sent an item that did not fit my vehicle, thus if this coil is designed and supposed to fit my vehicle, 2003 Toyota Matrix XRS, it is a TERRIBLE product
B00OAJ5MT6|2|Not what I expected. I was hoping for a more heavy duty step
