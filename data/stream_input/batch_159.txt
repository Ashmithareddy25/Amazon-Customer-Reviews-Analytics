B005IUC60E|5|Great
B000BQQMPU|4|The notched cutout at the gas pedal is not really necessary and actually lets dirt get on the carpet at that spot.  The little spikes on the back that are supposed to hold the mat in place need to be more numerous, a bit longer and perhaps a bit stiffer to really be effective.  Have to readjust the mats every couple of days because they won't stay put on the carpet.  Still, for the price these are worth having.  Better than ruining your truck's floorboards with muddy boots.
B00KKUHWQA|3|I could have tweaked it but traded the truck out the same day... one of the retainer clips would not retain the connecting rod... but, that's not my problem now.
B000A8JNF0|5|Cleaned top really good but a few spots still remained. Happy with the product.
B001OBKL8U|5|After bedding in the old pads, my vehicle stops better than it ever has..
B000GOJW9A|5|Pleases with
B006O87UYQ|4|good product good delivery
B0000AZAQ5|5|Very sturdy. perfect for my jon boat.
B000221H08|5|This worked well. Have tested with excellent results.
B00IFWVGGM|2|Had purchased based on positive reviews and made in USA. Front floor mats work well but problem with large rear piece. Corners all started to curl up in the very back and around all the edges due to thin nature. Front mats started to do the same but took longer overall. Contacted seller and he stated that they all do that and he has had several vehicles with same issue. Offered to replace with same mats but did not see the point. While they have protected the carpeting, I am not a fan of how after 4 months, the ends started to curl and began to block rear floor vents and middle row captains chairs from sliding forward. Went back to regular carpeted floor mats this past weekend. Somewhat disappointing given cost. Would not buy again for that price.
B00PT18QAQ|5|Good compact gauge + good service from OdyseaCo & Amazon = Recommended
B000CO91FY|3|Worked perfect, but you may find it cheaper in local stores.
B003XUH4QM|5|As with all of the ARP bolts/studs I've purchased these fit my 02 Silverado 5.3/4L60E combination perfectly.
B00192JGA8|5|Works as advertised.  I do wish it were a bit smaller, so the 15 amp side would not cover both receptacles on my generator.
B000EBH1XE|5|Great quality!
B00H7LPKKU|4|The only complaint I have is it is too big to use in tight places.  Still worth having, I'd buy again!
B00OFPNE7M|1|These hoses do not fit correctly for an 94 F rx7. The bottom lower hose is too long which kinks at the bend and the top hose is too short. The product is not what it should be at all, I dont even recommend these to my enemies. I would like a refund for this item that i cannot use. Plus the shipping was horrifying the packaging was just tape and more tape around the hoses. I could not even get all the tape off. Not a happy customer at all. Dont waste your money on these cheap hoses. 8/5/2015
B00029WYVW|3|OK
B00DPIF2MU|5|Easy install perfect fit
B0002SRH5G|3|works great all pieces were in the kit
B002935IV2|3|Noisy
B005SB6RUI|5|sets up easily and does the job of making pulling easier
B00I1WD1M8|1|The total length of the fleece fabric is 38 inches (and I could not find the dimensions of this anywhere when I was looking to buy it), the canvas drop in addition is approx 8-10 inches so if your seat is 38 inches wide this will fit your car seat perfectly. My car seat is 50 inches so it does not work for me, while the concept of the hammock attached to the head rests as a pet seat cover is good, in reality it makes the whole cover slick and it slips back and forth which made it scary for the little dogs and my big dog can't grab onto it to get in. I will probably keep it and cut it up for a kennel floor mat but will not use it for seat cover in my 2015 Subaru Forester as intended. Also since this material is nice and thick it also grabs onto the wet dog odor and keeps it hanging in your car until you pull it out and wash it or just learn to live with it. Other than that it really looks nice
B00A05L40K|5|Great upgrade for your diesel.
B0016HZZ0Q|5|perfect fit, work great
B002MEUTCG|5|Great price, fit very well. Much brighter than my old dull lens headlights.
B00P2K08J6|1|In less than a week after installing, the bully hitch cover burned almost into.
B0031WGQBQ|4|Ive had this top for 5 years and loved it. Ive had broken zippers that rampage has replaced for free and I also got a replacement rear window for 80 along the way. (I pat the windows from the inside to get the snow off them, but it was about 0 degrees one morning, window was frozen solid and my glove went through it) I don't have a garage so the thing has been out in the elements for all the years and the other day one of the rear pull straps ripped on me. The top is still usable, but Im gonna order another one.  The customer service at rampage are a buncha gentlemen too.  This is the best top available for the TJs. The pockets are awesome for the windows and you can get the whole thing on and off in 5-10 mins.
B00COTK9GU|3|It installs easily and looks good but if you have a 2014 or 2015 Silverado they fail to tell you the key can't be coded like they advertise. Placed a call to Extang, they basically have no intention of fixing this issue.
B00GP1CLIM|5|Very comfortable. Makes riding on long trips more enjoyable
B00B7GC50Y|1|This product does not keep the charge on the battery.  Used it on a brand new wheel chair battery and the battery has been losing charge ever since.  The device continuously uses power to keep the led light on and when there is no sun it drains the battery.
B00IIWJLO8|5|Fast shipping and very nice product. Would definitely recommend.
B00H1NOGS6|4|There good but shipping way to long
B00DWVN08I|4|Just what I wanted
B000GTW41S|5|Just what I was in need of.
B007JMTNZA|1|Not the right size center to center bolt pattern as posted in ad on amazon.
B00TMCUL0G|4|really neat.
B004R3056U|5|I am a prime customer. Ordered it on 8-3-15 at about 10 AM CT. Was supposed to get it on 8-7-15. Received it on 8-4-15 at 4PM. Hefty piece of steel. Installed no sweat. Not actually towed trailer yet but don't foresee any problems due to simplicity of the tri-ball mount. Like installed label  telling load capacities. Item exactly as pictured.
B00MGXUGKS|1|This tool is no good and the seller don't make returns don't buy
B004KED7KW|5|This tool did the trick!
B00VXFKGE6|5|Nozzle works wonderfully! We use it to wash our dogs and the various settings are the perfect pressure to use on them. Company is also wonderful and checked in to make sure the product was perfect. Highly recommend!
B00HNKYD0I|4|Initially I thought these edge guards were perfect. They are thinner (cover less area) than the typical edge guards I have seen and that was what I wanted. They installed easy enough and I cut them to length. They have adhesive in the slot. They LOOKED good.<br />But after a few days of 100-deg weather the adhesive softened and they would slip off the edge when someone grabbed the door to close. The adhesive would get on your hands and make a mess along the guard. If you have thick truck doors like mine or plan to use this where you may rub it once installed you might want to consider a different type. These might be good for trunk edges since you may not grab the edge when opening closing, but most people grab the edge of the door when closing.<br />Good quality materials but just not the best for my install.
B0007TJ7GW|3|Good but needs to have a protective material on rounded bars by the windows. It has a tendency to shift and sit on the glass.
B00XPL88NC|5|Well made instrument. Gauge holds the reading after removal from tire. Able to reduce pressure by depressing a button. It's by far the best gauge I have ever used.
B00CP3A1WW|3|careful... peace may break during installation...other than that work great...
B00A6AR5H0|4|For the price it is good. But it didn't fit my D-rings very well. I ended up gluing the pads on. They look good.
B00171V1VS|5|These appear to be of the same quality as other brands purchased for twice the cost at auto zone and similar stores in the past.  I did have to have a friend with more strength in their fingers install them for me, but otherwise seem to be great and very affordable.
B001L9ZBXA|5|Just as described.
B000E7YP82|4|This product is one of the most useful products I've ever bought. Very versatile, easy to install and can carry an amazing amount of stuff. As noted - the Achiles heel of this product is the buckles which will break on you at some point. I tried calling Rola and they don't offer replacement buckles. That said, you can get replacements (metal even) on Amazon for a few $$ so don't sweat it.
B008R0JSFI|5|Bought as an open box on the cheap and arrived as a new as can be !!! A+++ all the way!
B00192JGDU|5|bought as a gift for my husband for camping...he loves it!
B00G6188EM|5|Love it. It looks exactly like how the picture say it looks.
B007Q1K6EQ|5|Part worked perfectly and I received it with no issues. Love it when it works like that.
B0089HHRDY|5|👍
B00VK4H7E2|5|Amazing! Some people complain about a whistle but seriously what do you expect they are mounted OUTSIDE and you can't hear it anyways once you turn the radio on. I would totally recommend 100% they are stable and keep you legal for a great price and the quality was awesome.
B0030IZQLC|5|good
B00QIFXKBM|5|So far, so good.. It fits my 2005 murano... easy to install.. Took all of 5 minutes. But then again it's a gas strut install ;not rocket science.
B00E9HWRK6|5|I bought it for my 1996 Toyota camry. it fits perfect ! I didn't have to trim to fit. I would recommend this company and product to anyone. also, the price was very reasonable !
B00062ZZ48|5|Really like them thanks
B00KYWF8ME|5|High quality film. Easy to manage and apply. Very happy
B00U6G76U0|2|I like the running boards but they had a dent in them and the install instructions sucked!
B00W4YA4DS|5|Very nice product. Excellent quality build and the ergonomics are outstanding.
B004XMBXRU|5|Delivered quickly. Very easy to install on my 05 f150.
B000JI6EDU|4|I just received my bag in the mail and after much anticipation and excitement for securing it to my motorcycle, I still have not found a way to attach it to my bike. The only thing I am lacking is a luggage rack but I had expected to be able to slip the other part right over the Sissy bar. This part was too big for mine no matter how tight I adjusted the Velcro. I will have to find a way to rig this in order for it to work. Otherwise, the workmanship of this bag seems to be very well made, durable, and has a nice look to it overall. I would recommend this product to others as long as you are positive that your bike has all the necessary equipment. Other wise be willing to make adjustments.
B004ZF39T0|5|Just awesome customer service and quality equipment
B00LOZC328|5|excellent
B00B3BKM1M|5|excellent
B008XP850Q|5|So nice not to have to add water or worry about spillage when charging.
B003848C4G|1|I Installed in May and was totally happy with the performance, The mono tube gas blew out in August and I dented my front fender, after tearing down the Ultra Classic to remove them, I personally drove to La Palma, Ca and was hoping for a quick replacement WHAT A JOKE said stories we are behind 2 weeks and still no replacement customer service sucks sorry I purchased.<br />I also have 944 on the rear so good customer bad vender.
B00DSMEL2A|5|works great! I dipped carburetor bowls for 3 days and came out great!
B000F6F99G|5|This was an inexpensive solution to a parking problem I was having.  After using it for a few months, it would hard for me to give it up.  It is a vital part of parking our vehicles in the garage.  It is a precise guide to park your vehicle in a very specific location to allow for things such as door openings, access around the vehicle, etc.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B000JFL8RK|4|does the job
B008FXNMIQ|1|Not the standard torque sizes and are fairly soft.
B00UBIMGSK|5|Great product for the car.
B001DLTIB2|3|Durable bug and rock deflector.  Looks on the truck too.  The installation is very easy AMD took me about 15 minutes tops.  This deflector uses existing factory holes in your hood.  Do not over tighten the mounting screws.  You will crack the plastic.<br />Here's the bad....  I rated this at three stars due tot the amount of windshear created from this product.  The hood of my truck and believe it or not my side mirrors shack pretty bad.  I can actually see the hood of my truck rippling from the windshear this deflector has created.  I noticed this the first time on the freeway at about 70 mph.  I was worried enough that I pulled over to make sure the deflector was not loose AMD also checked to make sure the hood of my truck was securely latched.  Bithe the deflector and hood were securely in place.<br />  I later checked my hood to ensure it was downand touching hood stops / numbers.  The hood against the bumpers as it should be.<br />  I have come to the conclusion this turbulence is caused by the deflector.  I'm considering permanelty removing it and returning becuae of the terrible amount of turbulence this deflector has created.  Yes, I could slow my speed down but I shouldn't be limited by a product that will or could damage other parts on my truck.<br />Hence, the three star rating.  I hope this helps someone decide.
B005GXNQHK|5|Nice
B00RC4FGGU|5|We love :) glad to see u r located in phoenix :)
B005FR443C|3|good unit
B00GSAUHB8|4|works great! Item arrived quickly and as described and is nice and compact.
B00CXW0VIY|2|Plenty of power when it worked! After several months, battery will not hold a charge.
B00IRBPCEI|5|This is a great multi-tool. The hinges seem sturdy after opening and closing them. They are not too tight to get them open and they are not loose enough that everything falls open. I keep this tool in the car. I don't have enough space for an entire tool box but this has just enough that between it and a roll of duct tape I should be okay in the face of a minor disaster.<br />It would be a great tool to carry in your pocket if you were going to be out and knew you might need some tools. It fits in the pockets of my jeans easily, even the stupidly small pockets they insist on putting on some women's jeans. They only downside is that it is a little heavy for carrying in my pocket on a daily basis.
B001NFVIKM|4|Great!!! Item as described. Had to do a little work to headlight brackets to fit but overall easy job
B0007WJQ6K|2|It doesn't fit correctly, Sides not tapered like ford body, hangs over at back corners like a pair of ears and only extends over tailgate by 3/4&#34;. the only reason I intend to keep it is because I need to protect  the truck as it is.
B00480GY0S|5|works as expected
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Was very happy to know that you can count on Amazon to have your back. And yes! It met all standards of expectation. Would recommend to all friends and family.
B00INTMG2A|5|We are very pleased with the steering wheel cover.
B000L7JQMU|4|This is a versatile, well made, solid tool with a plethora of uses, highly recommended.<br /><br />The dimensions ARE NOT 11x3.3.x1 inches as described- that is closer to the dimensions of the retail packaging.<br /><br />The tool itself is 7.5&#34; long by 1 inch wide by 7/8' tall at the widest end of the wedge.
B0002KKTH2|5|Fast delivery and as described
B004GCYPYU|5|This part arrived in only a couple of days - was in pristine condition and was a perfect match for our daughter's car. Installation was easy - remove two small screws; unhitch light wires from housing; remove damaged unit and then reattach lights; snap in place and tighten the two screws holding it in place. Looks like new...
B002UC8RN8|5|Product is great very easy to install
B00KTIDLGI|5|Take about a minute to sync with my vehicle.  Very easy instructions, even for the average Joe. Would buy another one in a heartbeat. And a lot cheaper than the auto parts store or the dealership who wanted $70.00 for the fob and $60.00 for programming it.
B002ZTK9B4|5|Perfect fit for my 2015 Ram 1500. Took maybe 10 minutes to complete installation. Would highly recommend this product !!
B005FL72GO|5|This brake package fit like a champ without any issues.  I have a'05 Toyota 4runner with the larger diameter front rotors. I had read a review on someone else who had a later model 4runner with the larger size front rotors.  He recommended the brake package for a'05 Lexus GX470, which turned out to be  exact brake package that fit my year!  Kudos to those, who submit their reviews of issues they encounter!
B008P73LAQ|5|Absolutely love the shirt. Perfect fit and on time delivery.
B0045L97GS|5|Great product
B0001CLFLA|5|It came ready to install.  In a few minutes it was up and running.  Good product.
B0087P916E|5|Used this to attach a bike rack on the back of our 5th wheel.  Works Perfect!  Easy to install.
B000668S9I|5|It was somewhat smaller than I expected, but worked great while on a road trip in a SEMI-Van! It was safe and stable.  Just like with any cooking, need to use some fluids (like tomato sauce or wine) to heat up product so it doesn't burn. It was easy enough to clean.  Use non-stick, non-scratch utensils and cleaning scrubbies. I froze my meals ahead of time, and used this to heat and serve.  It saved us a lot of money not having to eat out. Excellent product.  I'll probable add the crock-pot to my collection next time. Great for camping when you can't get a fire going.
B0096GGSSC|5|As advertised!  Fast shipping.
B00D3E1DA6|5|Fit exactly for Prius. It came with instruction how to install it in English, French and Spanish. It takes about 3 minutes to install it (yellow part on top)
B0018RAYEG|4|Seems good, looks good, love the black, and so far I haven't rear ended any trucks and died.<br /><br />Hard stops are only limited by my rubber, works great.  (Also got the Centric rears)
B001PI79L4|3|I wish the letters were in a darker print.. Real hard to read..
B002NUABUO|3|SEEMS TO WORK BUT WE WILL SEE.
B00DBEMGP4|1|didnt fit in my truck i put it on the trash because in the web says it fits on my truck and didnt
B00X7CC07E|5|Worked great on my 2012 street glide
B0009IQZH0|4|Towels offer a very soft material for shining or wiping clean vehicle surface.  Not meant as high absorbency towels so they are primarily for wiping smooth and shiny surfaces.  They wash ok, but they have become much thinner with only 3-5 washes a piece.  Not sure how long they will last.  But they do not scratch the surface of my 911 Porsche while waxing.
B000XPOL9I|5|The cover is what I expected and easy to install.
B00BFLW308|4|So far so good! The only thing about this battery is...there wasn't enough acid to completely fill all cells. The tops of a couple of cells were still exposed after filling. It's a good deal and so far no problems other than having to add a little acid from my old battery.
B001O0XLZG|1|A lot of noise and vibration from these brake pads on my Lexus. I'm not happy with the quality, I have to buy better quality pads and pay again for labor - big disappointment and waste of money.
B00K9BC18Y|5|Great!
B00CD58I8Q|5|I was missing this spring and needed it. They had it, got it quick, it fit. Good stuff.
B006WF5LH4|1|Horrible product, I couldn't even notice the difference in power and my fuel mileage went down. I would not recommend this to anyone, complete disappointment and waste of money!!!!
B00UFERZKO|5|Works as advertised.
B0002Z9M02|5|Excellent
B005IJIZEQ|5|Awesome fit dry as a bone I recommend them ..
B000GZDDRG|5|Nice
B007R4GKWY|1|Poor Quality, Color Fades to an ugly brown with little time worn in the sun.  Contacted seller after two with identical problem - No Response!
B00A3UNYW8|5|WORKED GREAT REALLY EASY TO USE AND QUICK
B000VPQ814|5|Product works great.  It even works well as a facial buff and wash!  Price is right. Just hope it comes with the lid intact.
B001F0IE7A|5|With the right saw blade and drill bit this was incredibly easy to install and gave us at least two more feet of garage space.
B01D42TYFC|4|What amazes me as it has only been a short time that these little “miracle” car battery jumpers have been on the market and yet they keep getting better. Of the several I have tried, this one shines.<br /><br />In principal all of these chargers are very similar.  They have a little battery with lots of stored power.  They can be used to charge computers, tablets, phones or start cars.  Yeah, that sound a little crazy considering it is the size of a large paperback book, but that’s technology for you.<br /><br />This unit does all the above, but so do others.  What I like about it is it is simple.  The jumper clips get put on the car battery and then connect to the unit.  You then turn it on and start your car.  I have a unit in one of my cars that self-checks the connection to be sure you are connected up  right. Good thought, however the problem is if the battery is totally dead, the unit will go into a safe mode and not start the car. DUMB!  To be sure this unit did not do that, I disconnected the battery cables from the car and started the car without the car battery in the circuit and it started right up.<br /><br />It also has USB connectors for phone and tablet charging and a set of cables for connecting a number of other devices.  I have yet to find a need for this or a device that works with it, but maybe someone does.<br /><br />I also really like the flash light options.  There is a white LED that will act as a flashlight, flashing light or SOS light.  it’s bright and should work well on the roadside warning cars.  This also goes one step above and gives you a series of flashing Red LED’s on the side.  NICE!<br /><br />As most of these units have a series of 4 lights showing charge levels, this has a digital read out; another nice feature.  It came to me 97% charged and after starting my car was still in the 90% charge range.<br /><br />The only things I have against this unit are I like simple switches and this, along with many units, uses a single switch for light functions. You have to figure out the pattern to get the lights on.  The only other ding I would give it is the instructions have small print and are over simplified and don’t tell you everything about the unit.  I had to play with it to get the red lights on.<br /><br />Again, so far this is one of the nicer units I have tried and will keep this in the car.  I feel I can trust it to do the job if needed.<br /><br />Product sample provided for review. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.”ngle switch for light functions.

B00180JT6C|5|This fit my car (2003 E320) like a glove, and it was very useful in eliminating the most common cause of the EVAP leak that caused my Check Engine light to pop up on my dash. It even came in a Mercedes bag inside of the box, so it's clearly something that's designed for the car, and the leash fit into the nut from the old one.<br /><br />Though it didn't address my evap leak (I had a bit of a hole in the filler neck), it is a good idea to replace these every couple of years on a car, and it turns much more easily and feels more solid than the old one did.<br /><br />Yeah, it's more expensive than a generic, but it's a small price premium to have this fit exactly and work with the lens leashing system built into the car. If you're uncertain about which fuel cap to use, Stant's website has a tool to figure out which model number fits your car.
B000S2QKFY|3|Searched for axle nut and this is what came up. Definitely not an axle nut though it's an ac condensor nut. Im sure it works fine for that purpose
B00YHWQTRU|1|Did not start up easily even though I tried all suggested methods.
B006HYACOC|3|Could use better lights but overall bumper looks good
B0022ZV1KE|5|Awesome button. It has been through creeks and mud and washboards on my motorcycle triple clamps and still works good as new. Also, it is hard enough to push that it won't be pushed on accident.
B004O9WC18|5|Solid piece fits nicely
B00IKIXKH4|5|work great, low price, great value!
B000C9NMUE|5|If your doing this on a 2.2 Ecotech be careful not to drop the bolt as it will fall behind the starter. Might be a good idea to have a magnetic grabber
B000HWO7QO|5|Nice spark plug wires.
B001G99OJM|5|as stated by the instruction tight down once ran it to normal temp a few trip and retighten done perfect seal for those imperfection in the headers
B00RE6KV48|5|Worked great on my Thomasville leather couch.  It's about 5 years old, but had been in storage all but 6 months of use.  The cushions look great and the leather is supple like the day it was delivered.
B002SB00QS|5|Works well. Love it. So easy to put on
B00FGGROKW|5|Good
B00U50RNBO|4|Arrived days before expected, came with clips and weather stripping, installed in minutes.....<br /><br />Pretty upset though that I paid $140 just for it to get here and the bottom right corner be busted off. Box was pretty flimsy. I hate sending anything back so I just used glue. Hopefully it won't break anytime soon..
B00XFS3OU2|4|It works
B00N48RUXA|5|Easy install on 2015 Sportsman 570 thanks to ATVGuru's custom front brush guard. Definite improvement over stock lighting. Wired switch into factory opening for choke (not used on fuel injected 570) and looks and works awesome.
B008VQ606I|4|So far it's working good. It fits good .
B0046I14RA|4|Did not realize they were burlap material when I purchased them, but they seem to do a good job.  No straps, which is nice.  They have a wire that loops around the back of the tire andhra out in place...very easy to install and take off.
B001KS2PYK|5|I have an 2007 X and this is the same as the OEM rear.  Save yourself the heartache and looking around and get the original!
B0042VVKGG|4|Great size. I've used the cutting tool- works great!
B0009JB7GI|1|Product died after about three months use. Went on a trip for about a month came back and hopped in my car and noticed my phone charger and other items were not working. I saw that the red led would not come on and knew that this product just died. I guess it is $10 for a reason.
B004LF15QI|1|Didn't fit not even close.
B00J8QH9YW|5|Great sticker great company
B00SNCYQL6|5|Great fit fast delivery great price
B00H1KTZZ8|5|Great tint

B007OX3CVU|1|This did not fit as expected. And once was on. Failed to operate. Ordered a new one from cat. Worked immediately. Very displeased

B000C1OWWE|5|So far no problems
B000W0KTMW|5|compact lock with case and extended cord,reminder to remove b4 riding.<br />awesome to use,delivered faster than expected.<br />plus the color is a deterent,because no one knows what it is.<br />and it's attached to front or rear disc.
B004J0V6A0|5|Perfect and fast delivery just what I needed
B0016HPUS8|5|Oem is brass so I hope this holds up. The part is a pain to get to on a 02 Chevy Tahoe 4.8 vortec so make sure you get the socket that fits it. It will make the job so much easier.
B00WFIMJQ8|5|awsome i got more power and better gas mileage
B003VASH2Y|5|great
B002XLHUQG|5|Work awesome
B004YJW95M|1|They tried to charge me twice
B004AMOGJA|5|Great Fit!
B008FZCXC0|5|Good
B0031I2SKS|5|Perfect fit on my wife's '12 Malibu
B00IB2NP0Q|3|Great, just wish the straps could be vertical
B0087WBIH2|5|Great product!
B000BRF3VS|5|Very nice unit. I would definitely recommend to a friend.
B00BFU9HWG|5|For what they are I was impressed.  Thought about super springs but glad I went this route.  Easy to put in and truck sits nice and no sway now.  I haul a 3000lb truck camper on a single rear wheel 2500hd.
B00EAJKMNC|5|Works fine,  does not leak.
B011F2N7LU|5|Love these images! Wish it were front and back, but it's so pretty I don't even mind! ☺️
B004C6TXMY|5|Worked great
B00D4522AY|1|It did not fit or work even.
B00EESQN2I|3|Was listed as a Medium, but received an XL. Didn't return it as I have been in and out of town. Looks great, comfortable but unfortunately is a little large :(
B000C2S6DY|5|Did the job and working fine some 8 months later.
B005N53AM2|4|When I bought this I didn't realize the diameter of it compared to my steering wheel. It was too large for it but I modified it to fit my '03 Saturn Ion and I absolutely love the look and feel of it. It does not slide around which is a problem I've had on other steering wheel covers before.
B00JVHLS3G|4|Good option if your emblem gets stolen frequently (in Argentina: 4 times already!) because it's plastic! Looks good, it's super light and, if they take it again, at least the wont be making any money out of it!
B00KTI9Z9U|5|Love it
B000BGHYJS|5|Works great
B00MEVO5U4|4|adds bling, looks really good, they dont lock on and worry someone might take them
B00MOR4D5U|5|Easy install , super bright .made a big difference while driving .
B0002NIJOO|5|These mats are nice and thick. Excellent quality and look amazing. They are large so they could fit ANY size vehicle and work perfectly. The quality is more than I could ever ask for. Buy these and you will not be disappointed. I may buy another set for our other car just because they make me smile.
B0068ERNNE|2|Seems like a good product, but their sizing chart is so messed up..  Going to have to return this one for a different size.  Ordered a large thinking I'd need the extra space to fit over my riding gear and was mistaken.  Apparently, the sizing takes into account riding gear under the rainsuit...  Wish the ad would've said that.
B00R6S0MEI|5|as advertised
B00A82A2ZS|5|Have used this replacement battery for only a month so can not comment on longevity but quality looks good and terminals exactly fit those on my appliance. Battery fit perfectly into existing case.
B0055EALW8|3|Fine for newer vehicles but decidedly NOT to put in older (1997 or Dexron III transmission fluid transmissions) cars and trucks.  In older ones you need to stick with Dexron III.  Use of Dexron VI or any other synthetic in the old units will produce shifts you won't like.
B00BSEJYCM|5|these batteries work great on my game feeder.
B00IKPFON0|5|After about 1 hour of labor and tryin to fit my hands in a small place this  part works perfect, I am very happy
B00EARCXXG|5|works better than most other pliers. works well on small push pins.
B000C544KU|3|Had to modify the part to fit my application
B00FBKS8ZI|4|Great
B0049L1EJM|5|THIS BRAKE LINE SOLVED THE PROBLEM WE WERE HAVING WITH THE BRAKE CALIPER LOCKING UP ON THE DRIVER SIDE OF MY WIFES 02 VUE
B005EIWNSK|5|fast shipping and it worked..very happy
B000IG5PZQ|1|Only lasted about 3 months exposed to weather
B00LXNGTTO|5|Brought my stereo to life good sound
B00JIAGBHY|4|Love the look the only hard thing to do is adjust them.
B0036E9VB6|4|Compressor is fairly quiet and fills tires quickly.  I've bought similarly priced compressors that have half the performance
B0041Q8JIY|4|Great price fast delivery
B000C2WFA4|2|Did not solve my check engine light problem like I had hoped
B00WHMVL84|5|Ok,on time good.thanks!!
B00UK5AKEQ|4|Lot better than the ones that came with the camper.
B000B8JULG|5|its good
B004PL4H0O|5|Excellent for strapping patio umbrellas down quickly, and a variety of other uses.
B0002SA442|4|Very nice material and well made. The only item to note is the 3rd velcro strap is right where the factory soundbar is so I don't use it.
B007OW6JEI|5|Whats to say...OEM....
B000IOO12G|5|fit perfectly
B009Y7MJVS|5|Great product. Excellent upgrade from those velcro stickies.
B002VDFA4A|5|Install them fast, work like new again!
B001O5RF1M|1|Installed as instructions were wrote.  All four windows will not fully close due to catching on the edge of the shade.
B000BQ088M|3|OK
B00D09FYTK|5|The covers fit extremely well. For the money they are a great solution.
B0000AXNMO|5|Quality product, best price.  Have used for over 10 years, and get a long time out of a bottle.  Would recommend.
B00EC105A8|5|Perfect fit.
B00X8SVVQI|5|What else to say?
B00KQ4ZO7O|4|Delivered as advertised. I have not installed them yet, but visually okay.
B007U93LRI|4|Easy to install, looks good too. I misread the ad or it's not very clear, because I was expecting a chrome decal, not white. Still, it looks classy on my yellow Ford and now I can show everyone that I've been touched by his noodly appendages.
B009FUF6DM|3|They are O K. I use them for dish and cleaning clothes.  Not thick like others that I have.
B001TXWNLQ|1|Terrible.  Didn't work when it arrived.
B00D8L2T2U|1|Causes parking malfunction warning to randomly appear on instrument panel in my 2003 745i. I tried two sets of these lights. Both sets start to flicker randomly after 45 minutes or so of use and cause the parking lamp malfunction message to appear.  Sometimes one side or the other will go out completely for a few seconds.  Amazon return policy is great but I’m out a lot if installation time and still have to find an alternate solution.
B00E1SL70E|1|Part was wrong for my vehicle even though I verified all numbers and model number. It was a pain to return due to the weight of the package.
B003FOBJ30|5|Great jacket. Bought for my son to help protect him while riding.<br /> Heavy, great for fall and spring riding.<br />Thick sturdy leather. Will last for years.<br />Too heavy for summer riding
B000SL4AA2|4|Good
B005JU5XOO|5|Looks great on the car and wipe well as they should. They don't leave anything behind, don't skip and are quiet.<br /><br />They are replacing a set purchased at Costco that lasted only 6 months. The previous wipers tore off during a rainy drive and thanks to Amazon's fast shipping, these arrived quick. I live in a Phoenix where it rains little and the car is parked in the garage so I expect my wipers to last a long time. I will revisit this review later.
B000WJD1RI|5|This was a perfect match to the OEM lever on my 2007 VTX.  It is heavy duty and polished nicely.
B00J3NPOI8|5|Can't beat it for the money just going to get muddy anyway!
B00KVQS6B8|5|Clean fit
B000CIT2UE|5|Great replacement for OE mufflers on Grand Prix GXP.  Sounds stock!
B008QDXPFK|5|works great
B00DMETTJO|4|The price is definitely right and the design is super cute. I love Disney and have a bit of a Minnie/ Mickey theme going on with my car (steering wheel cover, stickers, etc...) so this was a nice addition to my vehicle. My car is a Toyota Camry and the seat are a decent fit. The reason I am giving it four stars is because they are an absolute nightmare to put on. It took well over an hour to install these and I can't help but to feel like it should have been easier. The instructions weren't very clear and I had to do a lot of guessing. Thankfully they turned out okay.
B000FOKC9K|5|Note that the labeling changed this year but its the same formula
B002UC2SFQ|5|These work great on our RV sliding mirror closet door.
B002FY22GE|5|Worked perfectly..  Exactly what we needed.  Loved that it came with bulbs preinstalled.  Made installation fast!
B005CC3CF6|5|Awesome. No more jack lean!
B000Q906RM|3|My original one from Japan was better. I will probably put it back in.
B007J7DZH2|5|GOOD QUALITY GREAT PRICE !
B000M5QPSY|4|I can only give this product a four star ratting due to the fact only time will tell the long term effect this product is designed to help prevent and control. But can tell you just after using stanadyne for only three months now I have realized less smoke coming out of my exhaust and it seems to help with the initial startup. Although it would be nice to be able to keep it with your vehicle at all times like many petroleum products you DO NOT want to leave it inside a vehicle nor in the bed of a truck for too long the heat will not agree with it and cause it to leak.
B006YBBRME|5|Good fit, easy to clean.
B000N8KBRG|5|great
B00KLKL6ES|5|Perfect fit!!
B00K56K1W6|3|I like the product.  Just expected to receive enough for all 4 doors.  It only covered 2
B000CQPQFQ|5|Fantastic break pads. It couldn't be better! Noiseless, great grip, wears slowly, so slow it's unnoticeable. Still the way it was installed almost one year after. I will buy it again and again!
B00VUTXLII|5|Perfect!
B004A61MAC|5|Good price, fast shipping.
B000CLHOBA|5|Works as discribed.
B000C44C5S|5|Fit perfect and gave my car that new car ride. Was very surprised at how much these improved the ride and handling on my car.
B00BDEO2EM|4|Works great and smells decent!
B00LEBLI82|5|This worked great in my rv.  The lights are not to bright and using less energy which what I wanted to accomplish.  Easy to install and less expensive than stores.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These are perfect for my jeep and I really want this 21in. light bar it would look good on my jeep also
B003VX1DI6|5|This part fit my 2000 Chevrolet Silverado perfectly.  Although there is no instructions that accompany it, there are videos available on line that explain and demonstrate the instillation.  Total time to install the part was just under one hour.
B000CJ3Y0M|1|i had purchace this part , but i had to install it last week , guess what its a fraude its a garbage or trach its the same my mechanic said those spark were bad quiality , i need an imediate refund
B005598RS8|5|very surprised when I got these and it said made in the USA! for about half the price from the GM direct online store, part #s matched and I didnt hesitate, very happy with delivery and performance of pads and rotors.
B0045WBVUM|4|First the bad:<br /><br />I had this shipped to a friend's house halfway through a 2000+ mile bike trip.  During installation the elastic strap broke.  I wasn't putting a lot of tension on it; the slightest pull and it split at the stitching on the strap.  It's an elastic strap that hadn't even been pulled to full tension.  I was seriously disappointed.  Of course my initial impression was that this product is absolute garbage.  I'm considering getting a replacement, but I tied the clasp back on because I was mid-trip and couldn't deal with it at the time.  With the knot tied, the elastic strap held for the remainder of the trip.<br /><br />Now for the good:<br /><br />So I was able to go the first 1000 miles without the seat pad, and I definitely could have done the last 1000 miles without it, but I do have to say that, once I found the sweet spot for the air pressure, that trip went a lot more smoothly.  I don't have a lot of 'junk in my trunk' and without the pad I ended up having to take breaks just to deal with the saddle soreness pretty much every 100 miles.  With the seat pad on and adjusted to the right amount of pressure, I was able to press on down the road and stop only for fill ups (about every 220 miles).  My bike has highway pegs and I was able to keep moving with just a position change.  What a great quick fix!  I don't know how this compares to purchasing a touring saddle, but I have to say the ventilation was great and with the interconnected chambers a shifting of the hips would take the pressure off of sore areas immediately.  Good stuff and I'd recommend it for a temporary, quick, or less expensive fix.  Just like the reviews said, it's important to remember that the seat works best not fully inflated.  &#34;Sit IN it, not ON it&#34; was life saving advice from one reviewer here.<br /><br />With the 1000 mile road test under my belt, I'm upgrading it to 3 stars.  Good product with obvious QC issues.<br /><br />Side note: I have an 08 DL650 and thought I'd put this out there: this pad is wider than my seat by about 1&#34; so I have some overhang on either side.  Obviously NBD as when you sit on it presses down to the sides of the seat, just looks funny sticking up off the side and not following the seat's contour.  If you're one for preserving the lines of your bike, you might need to consider a small or the DS version.  In the end, I decided the overhang was actually an improvement over the existing saddle.  When I'd lean back on my backpack and sit straight up, the air would fill those chambers and offer a wider/softer base.<br /><br />5,000 mile update: Life saver.  Order it, you won't regret it.  Upgrading to 4 starsan my seat by about 1&#34; so I have some overhang on either side.

B0059XCVVO|4|Nice to work with, good adhesive, looks decent from a few feet but it's a fairly cheese carbon design when compared to leading brands. Not smooth, has ridges to form the carbon look (combed style). It's held up decently well on the top of my laptop in and out of my backpack etc, I don't expect it will last more than 2 years and I'll likely get a more accurate carbon look next time.
B0000AY3SR|5|I am really impressed with this stuff. I use it on my Honda Goldwing windshield and like it better then the sprays I was using.
B00PLGX9O2|5|Easy to install. Works as expected.
B001JEIHAG|1|This is NOT memory foam!!
B0060LHLFA|5|love it super cool of course my team is amazing. love my Redskins!
B000JWKE2I|5|I thought my other shocks were bad but had no idea these would make as big of a difference in ride and handling.
B006NYIKDG|5|Perfect fit
B00MVBP1QO|5|I was a little reluctant to buy these for fear that the quality would be poor. The picture doesn't give it justice. They are a deep beautiful black and fit great. I with I got these 2 years ago!!
B000FOIJXQ|5|This stuff works like a dream. I used a different plastic/rubber prep then what comes in the kit. I applied it to all the trim pieces that were faded and they look brand new and its been holding up for over a month now!
B0026VF4SO|5|Nice in solid short hub peace from NRG will be getting more NRG products.
B007P05FBW|5|Works very well. Tail gate doesn't slam down like a guillotine. Wish theyda come in a pair for the other side.<br />Only problem was trying to set bolt at the bottom. Still I'd buy it again
B007V2CD4Q|4|Fits well, works well. Easy to put up and take down. Do yourself a favor and keep the box it comes in so you can store it safely during winter.
B00ATZ3MXI|5|Bright enough and the lights all work!
B0082NET5E|5|Sweeeet!!  Love them.
B00LEBLI82|2|These were direct replacements for the 12V bulbs in my RV. When I first installed then, I was impressed. Bright white light that really brightened up the interior. After a couple days use it didn't seem the lights were as bright as before. I removed the cover to discover the LEDs on the diameter of bulbs were not illuminated. Out of 10 bulbs, four were not working. Of those the LEDs on the end were still working. Whatever the problem is it's consistent in the bad ones.<br />Update - within a month of occasional use all of the bulbs had most of the individual LEDs not working. Totally worthless product. DO NOT BUY.
B00GI822C2|4|A bit thin, for my sons car. So far they fit and are holding up
B00B5WROXS|5|Fit perfectly. What was needed for a FPR.
B00FFAX2A0|1|We installed this product and in less than a month, it has stopped working!!!!  Of course it is now outside the 30 day window to return....BUT we didn't install it immediately upon receipt due to illness; however that won't make a difference with the supplier I'm sure!!  SO beware of this product and don't make the mistake we did!!
B001QFH2RW|1|Get the green light that says ready to use. Only shows a blinking 7.4 never changes!!
B005BNP7YU|5|It worked great when I first got it  connected. I walked away from the install and drove off later in the day and lost the entire cover. I am sure it would have worked perfectly. LMAO
B00GUDH194|4|worked well it is the whole thing though button and all
B00YVQD4A2|5|Perfect, easy to use, shipped on time.
B00MV7J9Q6|5|Great
B00CBWL4Z0|4|Fit ok!!!
B00BMU9G5W|5|Snapped right on and look alot better than a dirty black rim!
B0007VANGS|5|Works really good, fast deliver
B004986WM4|2|The pump housing came assembled with the inside O ring pinched, I should have double checked it but I didn't.  It leaked right away after install, if you have changed a water pump on a duramax you know how much of a pain it is to completely redo the water pump again.  After redoing the o ring this pump continued to leak out of the weep hole.  I would recommend going with a higher quality part if you are going to spend the time doing this yourself. I gave it two stars because the housing did look good and maybe my pump was a fluke.
B0050E7B12|5|Great product and quick delivery
B000C16XL2|5|My window regulator jumped track and ate itself up. Bought this as a replacement and it is faster than oem. So far it's holding well 6 months later. This one has one less mounting screw than oem but is a perfect fit and it seemed like overkill from oem for that one anyways.
B000SBCHCA|5|cool
B00Z2CXQH0|5|Excellent. Worked perfectly on my 2005 GMC Yukon.
B009T53BQ2|5|So far no leaks!
B004XAX7FI|5|worked great
B008BVNMX2|5|Very nice fit for my dodge caravan
B006X8AMBU|4|Great grill
B00YML13OU|4|Works great for my son - we have lots of bad drivers in town and this really does keep others behaving better.  Wish it was a little bigger.  Put a couple holes at the top and affixed it to the bottom of the Prius's license plate with zip ties (the back of the Prius is all plastic!).  Can't take it off but works really well.
B0031ZDU62|5|Thank you!
B00G620ZVU|5|Couldn't be happier with these lights! Super bright! Don't have that bad blue tint to them, used in Florida. Definitely no moisture! Great product would recommend to family and anyone else Bought two sets.
B00P70YS2E|5|Good one
B00OC9HMTM|5|Would buy again! Used in Florida keeps moisture out, SUPER BRIGHT!!!!! Looks like daylight when it's on. Would buy again in a heartbeat. Love the low profile look, with the brightness of a double row.
B000KKB3G0|5|Works great.
B00CH3YHRA|5|Good
B004159RD6|4|Great product so far. Worked great. Saved us lots of money on eating store bought instead of restaurant bought!
B001Q4KZTK|4|I've had this pull start before it's durable, but the string came off the last one
B00S58ANDI|5|Perfect fit arrived in timely manor.
B000BGOCPM|5|This cap fit just like it was supposed to.
B00SBZRELY|1|Worked great out of the box. The first thing to go was the &#34;on&#34; button no longer stayed on by its self, so I had to hold it down while fueling.Then gas started coming out of vent holes on the nozzle. Today the pump has stopped working.  Would not recommend.
B009A6W5H6|5|Great fit and nice quality sweatshirt!
B00U7DQ6Y4|1|will not recognize any of my bluetooth devices...apple or android....glad it was only a few bucks....
B002HXSAZK|5|Very happy with product
B00B117TQA|5|Fit perfectly! So happy with my purchase
B004VKY70Y|5|fits perfect and priced right.
B000CNBCF2|1|Some of the pieces would not stay in place when window was rolled down.  Following installation instructions resulted in a broken piece.  Had to install opposite of what instructions said.
B00EHZ5FX6|5|Satisfied..Recommended...
B00G1Y3E84|5|These levers are awesome. Getting plenty of looks. Look and work great.
B004WMDVDU|5|Great fit! This is for the little one, which is what I needed, but I did see some negative reviews on how people &#34;thought&#34; this was the bigger sized one.  Make sure it's this size you need (the 2 smaller cup holders in the front)!!!
B000C9QCPG|5|great
B000C822X8|5|Works Nicely
B006XD6YNK|3|They hurt my hands after 30 minutes. I have blisters now. Stick to Pro Grips!
B00V30J86I|5|Works fine.
B00MVMRS6O|4|Extremely bright and very versitile. As a heads up to future buyers: the wires are very thin, so you might need smaller caps if you plan to crimp them; however, I would recommend soldering the connection.
B00CPGQ2DG|5|Larger than what I expected, which is a good thing!  Thick, heavy duty material with a large slot to fit your kickstand in.  This will be very handy on my motocamping trip.
B007Y8590M|4|everything worked out fine
B00LMICSIQ|5|good
B004TONZAA|5|Fit my heater like a glove and keeps it clean when the heater is not in use.
B0002U2V1Y|5|I use this to get may car ready for I use  P21S Carnuba wax.
B00W8LQFX0|4|I did not have a need for it and returned it.
B0002L6NAI|5|excellent product.
B00HWKL5GY|5|Perfect decoration for my jeep
B000C2UCU4|5|Perfect fit.
B00P8XAGLW|5|Brought my Chevy rims back from the dead
B005MVXTCI|1|Were not original BMW parts, missing labels.
B000VL9WIO|4|Awesome fit.
B0002KNZL4|4|It works fine
B006ZBOECS|5|these wirk great!  I need another set asap!
B008G35UHQ|1|Sueden inside
B00BTLEHSK|5|Very good thanks
B00TJAHZSW|4|Performs as advertised p
B000WE45K0|5|The exact lights that I wanted. The best thing is they were about half price. Look just like the OEM.
B000CB35ZE|5|Purchased for 1996 Infiniti G20 as part of a normal regular tuneup. Super high quality part, which worked great. Definately will buy again for my next tune up.
B000I14RY6|4|Works as expected. A bit pricey.
B000EQJVU0|5|fit like a glove on my 2000. Remember to order gaskets, they do not come with it
B000CSQJOG|5|This stuff works great!! I always use it before returning a rental car to get all the smoke smell out.
B00TAG8480|5|very helpful i little big put fit tank very durable and flexible....
B00XK4NXZM|5|Fit perfectly and look fantastic. The original handle snapped in twenty-some degrees below zero, South Dakota, weather and because I had difficulties finding the original grey I ordered these. They look good and were a breeze to replace.
B00U4P76ZS|5|Worked like a charm!
B005HIDU6G|5|Very Price but at least it's good quality
B000GZO1CC|5|This is a pretty nice product. Took about ten seconds to put on. They are bigger than you might expect though. You can definitely find it in the dark.
B001F9P04Q|5|No issues.
B00DZIB9GS|5|Great cleaning product for my car.
B004BFW0EO|5|I had some sprinkler spots on the glass of my relatively new car, have tried vinegar and every other remedy including commercial spot removers used with a DA buffer, with no success. This stuff took those 3 year old spots away in about 30 seconds! I used a glass cleaning micro fiber cloth, wiped the spot remover on fairly aggressively, then rinsed with a stream of water. No more spots. Finally!
B000JZHLYE|5|So very easy to install
B001XOVIQM|5|as advertised
B002PUM6NM|5|Worked as expected
B003L2ZQGW|5|as advertised
B00480FHIS|5|Exact replacement for our 2010 BMW 328xi daytime running lights (angel eyes).
B00DLMPJ8M|5|Very satisfied
B00HFE4K7I|5|Just as expected.
B0007N5758|5|Works as intended....
B00K5QVBCU|1|Received with NO manual. Contacted seller through Amazon w/ no timely response. Emailed manufacture & obtained a PDF manual. After this I correctly set emissivity & tested throughout a structure where all surface temps were known--All readings were 4 degrees lower than actual temp. Emissivity could not be adjusted above 1.00 to correct this. No other calibration methods available. DO NOT RECOMMEND
B00UNRUJ7E|5|Excellent.  Thick and really keep the vehicle clean and protected.
B00318V5AC|5|Replaced my Honda back window stop light. Much cheaper than the dealer wanted and it only took a few minutes.
B004FPABG4|5|Love this sticker.  Worked hard to earn it. Proudly displaying it!
B000C9CC14|5|I have a/c again. I cant be without air for health reasons and riding with the windows down wasn't an option in the 100 degree daily heat.
B0002UEMYS|5|This is the handiest brush I have ever used! I have used the brushes with the swivel head that were not bad but they break easily and swivel just when you don't want them to. On this one the head stays put but the curve of the soft bristles are just right to get to all of the tight places on the boat and my other vehicles. It is very well made and I expect to be using this for a long time.
B00S5ZXC7A|2|Instruction cd came broken. Absolutely no way to contact the company for another one. Couldn't get it to synch with my iPhone.
B000BRLCX6|5|These are the right mats to buy of you like thick and durable and free of exotic aromas. But If you prefer moldy, thin, and disposable with high Amazon reviews by offshore marketing bots, buy the $19-and-below mats.  Having gone through two bad experiences, a tube of silicone glue, and 2 cans of lysol, the lesson finally sunk in.
B004JO3RO4|5|Great mats, exactly as described. Fast Shipping!!
B00P2D4BPA|4|Works as promised. Cheaper than retail. Plug n play.
B00IKSKKZO|5|Fast delivery and as described
B00N8JZB4U|5|Perfect!!
B001KS0M5E|5|As the name describes, exact fit for a 2012 Kia Sorrento.  Easy to install.
B0009V1WS4|5|What we expected it to be.  Feels like a good quality and secure.
B00MBVAHOA|5|Does exactly what it is meant to do. Easy installation as well.
B00IPS4APU|1|Bought this because it was their best seller. Not a good product at all. Wish I would have got the Blue Star Windshield Repair Kit instead.
B00A14R1E8|4|Works but not 100
B00FMD30C0|4|did the job
B000X90YUO|3|Item works pretty much as advertised but the gauge that tells air pressure isn't even close. I'm wondering what happened to their quality control. Doesn't anybody check these products before they ship? Compressor itself is a nice little unit. We pumped up 2 vehicles one with 35&#34; tires and the unit never over heated or stopped. Only 3 stars because of the lousy gauge.
B008387OQE|4|fit's good look's good
B00079FOK0|5|Painted a boat and did not smell a fume on either color or clear. As always 3-m makes a good product. Now where do I buy the replacement cartridges?
B00JGBYKJQ|5|Just bought it as a spare belt to carry with us when we go riding.
B00Q754Y86|5|Delighted with this tire cover for our new Jeep Wrangler.<br /><br />The cover itself is made out of structurally strong, plastic covered fabric sewn with marine grade thread and appears to be very durable. This will allow the cover to repel our notorious Seattle rain as well as deal the hot summer sun ;)<br /><br />Because it was made to fit our Jeep's specific tire size, it fits like a glove and looks great :)
B00T6JP4D4|4|I have Unabikers on all 5 of my motorcycles, but these were the hardest to put on out of all the kits that I have gotten. Plus, if you want to run an aftermarket fan kit these will not work without taking out one of the support bars.
B00NOKPPK8|5|Quality product. Well built and a very bright light. We installed it on our rescue boat and it has suceed or expectations.
B000KSTFJO|5|Excellent guns
B00M9FDE5M|5|Great product!! There was a figment issue and the company already had a fix. When I called about the problem, they had a revised part in the post that same day.
B000C8R9BS|5|Very Plesed, Thanks
B000AP57U8|5|Great replacement for stock filter and its reusable. Easy to install and bike breathes better.
B000IG20RM|5|Works great!
B000GU7KB6|5|really good price on this item. New in the package.<br />The delivery was super fast.
B00B3UZUOM|5|This sprayed on really well and looks great!
B00GHT8NM0|5|Perfect fit!
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Very good! Easy to fold and cover the entire window.
B0052KI59Q|5|Worked great
B00B1VBQRS|5|Good price, shipped fast.
B00RK7FT2U|4|looks sharp but as gel cover it adds thickness to the remote ie: added space on keyring and/or in pocket..
B00ACR6QIG|5|cancer on USA and our Liberty's
B005Q87EI2|3|The information on Amazon about this item indicates that this adapter will work with incandescent and LED lights. However, Hopkins' own website claims this is only good for 2.1 amps per output! This is only 25 watts, which even a few marker lamps will exceed. It works just fine for LED lighting, but now I have to be sure any trailer I rent/use has LEDs.<br /><br />It is compatible with incandescent and LED lights on the tow-vehicle for the trigger wires. The output is too weak to drive incandescents.
B0040PPVTQ|5|Super price,fast delivery.Very pleased.
B0000AZ7EY|5|Product was purchased to use on the trailer of my new bass boat.  I believe in preventative maintenance, so I was most pleased with the quality of the Bearing Buddy... and the ease of installation.  I would strongly recommend that you purchase the covers or &#34;bras&#34; to keep the grease fitting clean and ready for use.
B0024E6W02|5|had to extend the reach on the sewer line. this is perfect. no leaks, easy to connect. glad I bought it on amazon. best price
B00G0PKEDC|4|OEM parts for the low, low gotta love it.
B00BBK89FQ|5|Product is as advertised, well made and works perfect.
B00QMWQK2M|5|I really love these car mats.  I have worn a hole through the driver's side mat with the heel of my foot on my last two sets of mats, so I really, really like that this set has a heel pad on the driver's mat.  They fit exactly into my 2007 Kia Spectra and the gray matches the interior perfectly.  They look really nice in my car and I think the nibbed backing will keep the driver's mat in place a lot better than my last set of car mats.  I can't wait to get more use out of them and may even have to get another set for my boyfriend's truck.  **I got these car mats at a discounted price for my honest review**
B005J1UL0E|5|This works great for our Glacier Peak.
B009OBVS2K|4|I like this and it works, but you really have to work it in to make sure the water spots go away completely.  I tried using this as a spot treatment, but it seemed like once it dried, the faint outline of the water spots remained.  But it definitely dissolves the buildup!
B004LEOXQS|5|Works great, delivered on time and as described. Thank You, Rick!
B004RBWV5K|5|What a different over my last Tilton style starter.  Unit came with test/spec sheet from vendor and spins my 355 CID with a mild cam like it was no big deal.  I wrapped it in a thermal blanket as I run headers and heat will kill even the best made unit.
B00WH1ZC80|5|Love the handy hooky!  It works exactly as advertised!
B000ALG86E|5|Fits my 2005 Subaru Outback
B0062IJOJ2|3|The metal screws weren't long enough so I had to find longer ones.
B00E9HCCSI|5|Very nice cover...highly recommend this.  Has straps and weights that allow you to throw the strap under the RV easily.  Very nice looking and so far it has held up.  If you are familiar with disposable surgical gowns, this is basically that material...but much more durable and thicker.  I think that material allows Rv to breathe and prevent mold.  I can put this thing on and take it off in less than 7 mins by myself with a ladder.
B005VXFBDW|1|I was preparing my car for a trade and it, was running prior to putting this in. The car started smoking black smoke and skipping. It now shuts off while trying to keep it running and, spewing BLACK SMOKE. I call the company and, the operator said they would call me back HMMM two hours before closing and have not heard from anyone as of yet!
B00WDZYFL0|4|Thanks
B00353M2P0|1|i had my local mechanic (40 years experience) install it and it leaked almost a quart of oil the following day.  very disappointed since i have used K&N products in the past and had been satisfied.  i'm not sure if i will ever try one of their wrench-off oil filters again
B000SL4A84|4|Very nice kit only a very few add on components and it is a very well stocked. As a plus it fits very nicely in the place where my stock kit goes in my Nissan Pathfinder.
B00M78820I|5|Bearded Garage is really friendly and easy to do business with. Product is a a tad bigger than what I expected for my car but still works wonders!
B005NLQAHS|5|Nice scan tool, used It many times. To retrieve codes and for performance wise.
B000182EUU|5|The ventshade fit perfectly and was easy to install.
B00BTS44G8|5|I love it. I had bought one for the back of the car and loved it so much I ordered another for the front.
B00I9IOME0|5|great fit for my truck
B005MZ1C6O|1|I have contacted seller about this faulty kit asking for a refund.<br />Cost me more money putting this junk into my car than if I would have just not tuned it up in the first place.<br />Left my car not running and me stranded for hours after 1 day of driving, less than 50 miles!!
B00SSS3JNG|5|This Egyptian Eye symbol is very attractive.
B00F47Z38I|5|Only had installed for 30 days now,Quality seems to be great for the purchase price. Super bright alot brighter than the old 80w halogens i had. 8000k color temp is right on the money. Loved the look so well,having to purchase headlights next
B006DZCXG0|5|Great price for pricey item.
B00546LAUO|4|Everything was almost perfect. The product was fine however the color was not the same as described. I was wanting this to match my custom trailer interior. Due to the weight of this product I don't want to pay for the return shipping costs and risk being sent the wrong color again.
B00D7FSFTS|5|Performs as advertized! Great product.
B00029WR8C|5|it works fine
B00R8L9XPM|5|Very nice and really cheap. Delivered on time and fits as i want.
B0081KAW18|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00VKM452Q|3|This product is a decent quality but it was to bog for my truck.  It also only had a few grommets so I had a shop add 12 more.  I also wish that the elastic sewn into the ends was longer and had more tension.
B000UVUAFO|1|Didn't do what is meant to be...
B00EP02L08|5|Works well and looks decent.
B00LV5XM94|4|Really look good on car.
B004F3SQZO|4|Have not had the cover long. So far the fit is good, almost too tight.  I would want to wait for a couple of months before giving this 5 stars.
B004XX5IEI|4|First of all, I'm not drill bit expert, but I use a lot of bits and these ones hold an edge very nicely. Much better than the generic HSS bits I had from multi packs and similar value packs from a variety of popular brands.<br /><br />My one concern is that the gold plating appears to be showing some wear. No rust though which beats many of the brass (I think) bits that I have.<br /><br />I'm going to try some more of CTD's bits.
B00AKA6O82|5|exactly as described.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I use 2-3 of this towels instead a stack load of towels from Home Depot. I wish I knew more about better quality microfiber towels before.<br /><br />My only problem is that I am running out of my supply because they mysteriously disappear every time hang dry them outside.
B003IOITIK|5|The device did everything it was advertised to do.  Navigating is a bit counter intuitive but just follow the instructions and it will be fine.  As an owner of several &#34;older&#34; cars this is a good tool.  Find the problem using the scanner, fix it, cancel the code, and off you go.  I think every car should come with one of these along with the jack and spare tire.
B000IYBGEC|5|The condenser fit great on my 1994 Toyota Landcruiser, 4.5l gas 1FZ-FE Truck. Granted this was an Australia Right hand drive, but it mounted like OEM and works great.
B002D3KR4Q|5|Easy to install, looks great.
B004RPJWHQ|3|Be careful when you use these valve stems.  Water can get under the cap and cause the cap to rust and stick tight to the valve stem.  They are cute - but be careful when using these over a long period of time
B003VC97N0|5|As advertized
B005S59HQU|5|Great product, plugged into 2002 Subaru Outback with no problem! Only complaint: instructions said I'd find port on driver's side, turned out was on passenger side. Not a big issue though. Works great, and would definitely buy again! 5 Stars!
B0058UUXGS|5|fits very well and looks great.grts rid of the ugly cracked dash at a great price
B000C59MNE|5|as advertised
B000BGJWF2|1|For parts like this I usually buy two in case I screw something up.  I intended to use in line to my air conditioner condensation pump to prevent it from siphoning. It worked for about one cycle, then water flows though in either direction.  So, I put in the second SHURflo I bought,  same thing.  Both valves bad?  I took them both out, sure enough a trickle of water from the faucet pours right through.  I can't imagine there's more than 100PSI pushing from the pump but given both valves are now just $16 ornamental tubes?<br /><br />Either way, can't recommend these.
B001F79API|5|Great price and good quality.
B007TS6FNW|2|I bought this item intending to use for the back seat of my car, on the floor. It does not work very well for that purpose though. The item has no firmness to it, so when it sits back there, it slouches.  That makes it difficult to lift the top off it and toss something in it when I need to.  Also, the top fits rather strangely. I doesn't exactly close up the bag.  If you have the time to mess with it- this might work for you. It does hold litter, as it is supposed to.  I did love the color of it and it is pretty true to what is pictured.
B007ZLOF8K|5|Work great and fit great.
B00M4FXZE2|5|as described, looks great
B00DY78RWY|4|The first one I received had a faulty switch but the second worked well.
B007P53BM2|5|Very useful.
B00KE668RO|1|it started my bike on fire do not buy cheap china pump for a harley
B0047DB9PQ|5|I made the best choice. same quality parts delivered to my door. Would have paid 3x more at local parts store, for cheap aftermarket parts. I told the parts store I much prefer the better quality Monroe, they said they would have to order it. It would have cost me 4x more for those. When they asked me if I would like to order them. &quot;I said no&quot;. It gave me the idea! to check online. Now I have new struts on my car, I'm rolling. Not a easy job for the average person. Yet if you have the right tools, a shade tree mechanic can do it, I did.  Just make sure you have your vehicle information correct when ordering. I'm more than 100% satisfied.  johni
B00BCRMAAS|1|They not for Toyota Venza that's for sure
B00JBIRDX4|5|Yes it did
B005ALD33K|5|Has worked and held up well in heavy brush. CB Range is about 3 miles for the Cobra 75 it's matched with
B006K8GFZK|5|fit my allstare jack perfect<br />Dosent roll on floor but is great at track
B001AY2WLU|5|I love this and wish it worked better as a keyring because I would instantly attach it to my keyring.<br /><br />It's very useful and has all the basic tools you need!
B000C9E0QE|5|This &#34;OE&#34; brake line matched up to my 2003 Chevy Silverado V6 2D LWB Work Truck.
B00OPXAHTM|5|very nice love it
B007Y8IKMG|5|This product was great
B008HZKP6E|5|Fit perfectly on my 2010 Rav4 V6
B00ARJO1TA|2|Bought this when I was rebuilding my sons car because iI stole his opti to use on on of my other sons car. After putting the car together (it was down for about 6 months) it would not fire. The optical sensor was sending an intermittent signal for a little while then just stopped all together. By the time the car was back together it was beyond the warranty period. Bought a new Cardone unit, Installed and everything is good. I don't want to rip on anybody, but be aware when buying. By the way I have been an ASE certified technician for 38 years (originally it was NIASE)
B00GGQGK9M|5|Excellent. Fast shipping.
B000CMFD7G|4|these fir my 1988 Chevy pickup  But are very wide and DO<br />block some of the mirror and I have big ones that stick out 4in from the cab<br />so i took my Minnie cutter and trimmed them down about 2in
B004LWTHP2|5|Quickly charges a car battery.
B00OA84ZEK|5|Had a local RV service dealer install.  Probably should have down myself, but I'm getting old and lazy.
B0055ALJGE|2|It's a decal flag. for the price and looks tough it was a  painted flag
B0013G040G|5|Got my truck shifting again ,product is exact replacement
B007LIBYMM|5|I love this tribal plate cover. Would recommend this for sure!!!!!!!
B000CSQEV4|5|very happy with it
B00LMK7ZYQ|5|I have bought 2 of these strobes for my service vehicle.  Excellent quality.  Nice and bright,  highly visible during the day.  This is the real thing and not a cheap knock off.  I get a kick out watching other drivers move over to avoid my vehicle parked on the shoulder.  A great value
B00FC22LZ8|2|First set i bought was perfect and lasted 2yrs. I recently bought another set to replace those which are in the same vehicle but the new ones  werent as bright and just disappointing.
B0083I5VJQ|5|Awesome sauce! I put it together and it fit like a glove. The color is exact. I'm not sure but I think it is oem made in japan. Awesome product. If you need one, buy it from this seller.
B00HNKYD0I|2|Product works great as long as the vehicle is not parked in hot climate, or direct sunlight. The glue began to run down vehicle, and became very difficult to remove. After two weeks I removed due to guard becoming undone. Became a nuisance opening/ closing doors. A month later the residue from the glue is still on my doors.
B000C06OKI|1|lucky I order all 4 ...both sets was misboxed... the front was in the rear boxes and the rear was in the front boxes
B00GMRM3KA|5|good
B0016IBRHK|5|Fits perfect.
B000C9GFSU|3|It was the correct OEM part, but the price was great compared to a dealership
B003E7L28A|5|Working like new offer 4years
B00G6188EM|5|Great product
B00CJ694I2|5|Second order
B000QUTQCC|5|Fits and works perfect on 2006 mustang.
B00BCRMAAS|3|Looks ok,
B002INP6QU|1|It's super hard to use. Very tough to crank the jack to get the car up. I had to use my friends stock jack from his car.
B00XKSJDRK|5|great parts and well designed. Fit perfect. Only issue took no Amazon prime, slow delivery, but price was right!
B0085IJXCU|5|First, find out what fan you need, that is, hole diameter and round or D.  Look at the fan and determine the direction of flow that you want. Carefully pull off the fan.  Put a little lubricant spray on the shaft and in the &#34;hole&#34; of the fan.  Carefully press the fan blade back on.  That's it.<br /><br />These are not expensive.  After years of UV rays, the fan blades get brittle.  I now keep a couple extra in my unit.  I suspect that these will last years but always good to have an extra whether for myself or a buddy in need.<br /><br />Again, they are inexpensive plastic.  But they work.<br /><br />Packing was very good.  No way that they would or should break during shipping.<br /><br />I did not experience any of the problems that others have stated.  Hole size was exact.  But I also knew what I needed as I calipered the shaft on my fan motor and it was 0.094 give or take a 0.001.
B004Y9YIU6|5|very good
B0069TND14|5|Preliminary review at this point, but so far, I'm happy.  I'm building a light bar for my hitch mounted bike rack with these.  With 4 bikes on there, the car's lights are hard to see.  I've been worried about it for a long time.  As soon as I get this made, I'll feel a lot better.<br /><br />I bought http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H9JFS2 to attach the lights to, and some appropriate size U bolts to attach to the arms of my bike rack.  I'll load the bike rack, then attach this assembly to the ends of the arms and plug in the wiring.  The lights and the aluminum bar are a good fit for each other.  I bought a trailer wiring extension cord about 8 feet long to do the wiring.  It was cheaper than a whole trailer harness and is long enough for my needs.  I just cut off the end with the single bare lead.<br /><br />The lights sit flush surface mounted.  I'm going to attach them with pop rivets.  You'll either have to have a hole under the lights for the wiring, or Dremel/file an area of the lip of the back for the wires to come out from under the lights.  If you use a hole, also use a grommet or wire loom to prevent chafing and a short.  Solder the wires and use shrink tubing for insulation for best results.  There is plenty of space under the lights to hide these connections for protection from the elements.<br /><br />The wiring is simple, and pretty much follows wire color conventions for trailers with 4 wire flat connectors.<br /><br />White is ground, and most trailers use that color for ground as well.<br /><br />Black is the positive lead for the parking/marker lower brightness lights.  The trailer wire this goes to is most likely brown.<br /><br />Green is the positive lead for the brake/turn higher brightness lights.  On most trailers, the yellow one is for the left side (driver side) and green is for the right side (passenger side).<br /><br />I haven't actually put everything together yet. I have wired everything up, just twisting the wires for now, to test it.  They work fine.  In full sinlight laying on the ground, I could easily see the lights were on with the parking lights on.  They seemed about as bright as the car's lights.  I turned the emergency flashers on, and the lights were quite bright, and easy to see even in direct sunlight.  They should be just fine for what I'm using these for.<br /><br />Update:  Forgot I never updated this with a picture after I got it put together.  The picture is only of the tail light mode.  The brake/turn mode is much brighter.  They compare favorably to the car's lights.  The picture is without bikes so you can see my car's lights for comparison.
B0066QS40A|1|Part was not the same as oe. Cheap rubber. Don't waste your money and time like I did.

B000Q8Z6QO|5|Worked great and reasonably priced.
B00802F244|5|This kit is very nice, easy to instal and good customer service ! I would recommend it to others looking for a good hid kit.

B00KNOS05A|5|It work out great  thank you<br />My grandson  thanks  you  also
B000MDZLQI|5|Works great to cover our spare motor home tire.
B000M5W25E|5|Put these into my 2010 tundra and constantly get flashed for my brights being on. They light up the road amazingly.
B000CCDLEI|4|fitted to my Jeep Wrangler TJ and confirms what is shown on the dash board gauge which is a bit suspect. Good piece of mind that I have good oil pressure.
B0099D8FFQ|5|This shift knob looks so good in my jeep!  Anyone who wants to add a little bling in their vehicle needs one of these.  I love it!!!<br />Andrew South Beloit IL
B00J3FMHN6|5|All was good. Thanks You!
B009KTDSH4|5|He loves it.
B000NVW1LM|4|Good quality product.
B00KOUV4O2|5|You are someone who cares! Well done!
B009IX6JGY|2|Very cheaply made and they have a horrible plastic smell that lasts for weeks. I would not recommend these.
B000EDUTOA|5|I just got this level today and put it on my 5th wheel replacing the old level. It looks great and is exactly what I wanted. 4 screws to mount with elongated holes to adjust level. The little bubble level on top is easily adjustable as well. Took me 5 minutes to install adjust and clean up.
B0055OG46U|5|Exact replacement for the original, damaged bumper cover. Installed easily in about one hour using common hand tools.
B00HVIGHI8|5|Fit perfect for my Dodge Durango 05
B003SS62PS|1|Only worked twice
B0059AADC6|5|It was exactly what we needed and expected! Love how compact and light it is yet very durable!
B0002SQU9K|3|Handy if it fits your car.  Used it fine on the front calipers of a Honda Oddessy, but wouldn't fit the rear calipers nor would it work on the front calipers of my mustang (a big c-clamp did the trick in both cases).
B00GZHEJCC|5|great
B00P2D471I|5|Why anyone would want anything else is a mystery to me.These are as good as OEM.There are all kinds of other replacements out there,blues and greens LEDs and other such trash for kids to waste their money on.
B00FALVU8A|5|I really like this stuff. It makes my car look awesome and it's really easy to apply.  Best car wax I have ever used.
B00QU6Y3GA|5|yes
B000GZIOJS|5|good price
B000A09MCM|5|Fram is awesome
B00HRMSU1K|5|Very nice and easy way to upgrade the look of the interior.
B003CJKBMS|5|This jet fits the carburetor on a Kawasaki FB460VB500 engine (John Deere Lawn Tractor) perfectly.  John Deere will not sell the jet, only the entire carburetor for $160.  This $6 part did the trick!  Take that big green!
B0068ERO1A|2|Way to hot.
B004CMDDOC|5|This stuff works great on my street glide fairing. As advertised. Recommended.
B0002SQYTG|5|functions perfectly...compared it to two other tire pressure gauges I had, and this one is the most precise one.
B000CNITBM|5|great
B00OZ1W42C|5|Worth the money. Great exhaust, great conpany!
B008FCD8DG|4|Great price for a genuine GM accessory
B0006304BQ|5|Worked
B000KSTFJO|4|The set is great and was shipped on time, very happy with it -thank you.
B0083KQNBO|1|These did not work.  Brand new, out of the package...needed them to work at the time and nothing.  We had to stop someone else who had jumper cables theirs worked great.  All the connections were made, they just didn't work. Do not buy because they won't be reliable when you need them.
B00DHQ9K6E|5|Works extremely well. Best that I have tried.
B000AMXT4W|5|Awsom and quick delivery thanks
B002QGZZV0|5|Nice filter, works fine!
B00RSOX5BC|5|YOu will like this if you get it. Well made.  HD chord.  High quality
B008LX7FXS|3|smaller then factory
B0006IX87S|5|Worked very well.
B0009IQXFO|5|Best car soap I've used to date. Foamy and gets everything off.
B005NLCGF8|4|Works excellent in my Mazda 3 2010, can not seem to get the same results in my fiancé's 2003 Dodge Neon, even using various apps on Android.
B000IYPS78|5|Installed on my 06 Infiniti G35x a week ago.  Its loud... when its working.  But its workin.  No temp spikes and the temp is satisfactory considering how hot its been.  Someone said its louder than their OEM.. I agree.  Its Loud.  but its working!!!  Seriously its a perfect fit and so far its doing its job just fine.  Decent part, so far...
B0060KDPR4|5|It was a good quality muffler but I had to return it as I ordered the wrong part
B00SIA58UG|5|good tuff product at a great price would recomend
B008CE06ZA|5|A little noisy but that is to be expected for something that has so many adjustments. I will trade noisy for versatile. If I go on a long trip, I will use a different hitch.
B00K8DAER8|5|Does the job nicely
B004KGEE5W|2|It tore before I could even apply it
B0046YMYCS|5|I bought the red flasher unit.  It is easy to install and the flashing brake light makes me feel that the cars behind me see me better.  Comments confirm that.  I chose not to use the running light feature, that is just too flashy.
B004RCP49O|5|worked great for caulking my pop up roof joints
B00CPYC9BC|4|Works great! great price on Amazon too
B00HT2Y7ZG|2|cannot tell a difference
B00JNEAQIA|5|Great product at a very good price.  These look GREAT on my Bullit wheels :)
B000P6UNKQ|5|Finally I don't have grease all over everything as the grease gun is neatly mounted to the side of my tool box.  I used to hang mine on the back of the box with its pistol grip, but it tended to fall over or off.  Now its on the side, out of the way, yet easily accessible when I need it.  I find no issues mounting the gun or getting it off this mount as others here have mentioned.  It works great and holds the gun secure.
B007CLM2JM|5|I installed the 8000K H7's on my 2013 kawasaki ZX-6R about a month ago and I love them! The color is perfect; ice cold white with just a hint of blue. Looks wicked without looking toolish or juvenile while lighting up the whole road. I was concerned about ballast size since there's limited space on the bike, but the two ballasts were less that 4x4 inches and about 1/2 an inch thick. Super easy to insall, and I'm no electrical engineer. Overall great price, great product, and great technical support from kensun.
B003VCCQSS|5|works well  2nd one
B000CD386S|5|Nice complete unit.My shocks pumped up after installation.Bought this as a 'just in case'.
B00QKE2M2E|5|This panel is a snap to wire and even includes fuses. Looks classy and the USB charger is very handy. Looks great in my 1980 van dashboard. Nice upgrade. I also like to be able to see my battery voltage at a glance. Clever those Chineese.
B00HSHW03I|4|Lights doesn't light up as bright as I expected but they're still a good look
B006N96KX8|5|very happy with it good service
B00YI3IGA6|5|The problem with many side window sunshades is their inability to block all the rays shining into your window. There’s always some light leaking in from some parts of the window that the shade fails to reach. Being a long-distance commuter that drives at least three hours a day, it is important for me to have a shade that  efficiently blocks pretty much all the sun’s rays while still having near-full visibility.<br /><br />This Universal Side Window Car Shade by ShadeSox is the next best thing to heavily tinting your car windows. The shade is made of a dark elastic material that you can stretch over the window of your car, fitting perfectly just like socks for your feet. It covers the whole window so there are no escaped annoying light beams hitting your face.<br /><br />This product comes with two ShadeSox shades which is a huge plus. It’s extremely simple to install, the material is stretchy and durable, and best of all, you can still roll down your windows!<br /><br />My only qualm is that this shade ends up touching the outside of your car. My car isn’t the cleanest since I park on the street, and the shade ends up sucking up all the dirt and dust from outside. It’s also not as visibly appealing as getting a tint-job on your windows, but it’s a lot more cost-efficient.<br /><br />As long as it makes my commute more pleasant, I don’t really care what it looks like. This is seriously the best shade for your windows. Just makes sure you take it off when you wash your car or leave it outside overnight. I’ll update again after I attempt to clean these to see how they hold up after washing. A sample was provided at a promotional discount for testing and review.
B00SH10OUA|5|Love the way the producted matches the running boards. Intall was a little tricky when it can down to fitting the screws in the drilled holes. Hands was to large had to use daughters hands/ fingers.
B00HQLZ6C8|5|Comes off and on very easily.
B000EQS0MA|5|Fixed my car's starting issues and was relatively easy to install for the DIY person.  Search Youtube to see if someone has uploaded a video of every step in the process of replacing this on your car.
B00062Z0VQ|5|Exactly as described.
B00EYVJUAW|3|Would be 5 stars if straight side of clip was slightly longer to help start into hole of pin.
B005CHT4W6|5|Only Oil I use in my Dodge Cummins.
B0031BHBAM|5|Great factory replacement quality Part.
B00UXSEL18|5|Rubber is not as thick as I thought it would be. Good quality though. It takes a little fitting and adjusting to make it fit right.
B0009IBJAS|3|ordered one and that one did not work , had to order another one, long delivery
B003XYNDC2|5|Great product and great vendor.
B00IS93ZJS|5|Great bumper love the look
B00230HT7C|5|Great
B00VK4H77E|5|Arrive in just a few days after ordering it. It only took 10 minutes to install. Very stable while driving, a little wind noise but nothing crazy. YOU Do need to tighten the 3 screws behind the mirror to avoid them from moving around as you drive. All in all, a great product and will definitely recommend it to other people.
B00NRLC8SQ|5|Love them. Looks great!
B0007TQWJM|5|Thank you.  So much easier to use than boards.  Will get lots of use.  I've already told two friends.  Super fast shipping!!!!
B00IKSWG56|5|Must have, feel safe knowing that the reflection will be very noticed. Worth the cash and time to install.
B00VAMXTE6|3|Good for picking up sand and dirt but as far as rocks and other types of debris it has a hard time picking up
B009V06W98|5|nice product pooch loves it
B009TB4UNO|5|Hadn't heard of the company.  Cost was approximately 20% less than the Weathertech.  Reviews were good to excellent, and I would agree.  Easy to clean. Took the car to the beach.  Good channeling of sand.  Simply vacuumed and wiped away the dirt.  I'll be ordering a set for my other car.
B00M5FMA9W|4|Thank you.  It works fine and was easy to install.
B002JBUY3G|5|thanks
B0002L6X2Q|5|Only shade I could find that fit my miata perfectly. It gets the job done. Glad I had purchased

B000FW7V50|5|Pleased with my purchase
B00AYI087S|1|Impossible to put on not made for compact cars.  Steering wheel cover extremely difficult to put on.
B002JAXU56|2|Rey weren't gray they are purple
B00FBKRQTM|4|Love it, it didn't connect well at first but after playing with the connectors a few times the lights fired right up. Need to know a little about electronics and a voltage tester to wire it up unless you have the harness wire diagram.
B009EPX7FM|5|Bought this for my 2010 silverado .... amazing quality .... nice low Rumble  .... perfect if you want great sounding exhaust that's not to loud ... absolutely no drone which I really love
B003CJQWWG|5|perfect fit
B00A36Q046|3|Sticker ripped while i was putting it on, i was able to apply it without being able to tell from the outside but inside my truck you can tell it ripped
B00HW7XL2S|1|Don't have the time for returns paper filling calling you get what you paid for you want cheap you get cheap not recommended if your are serious on your business even if you are just starting one spend a little more money and get something worth of it.
B00CFH5CWC|5|Good
B00JL6MWIW|5|fit great
B00KGGTF9U|5|Product is great and super affordable! Customer service is awesome - they personally emailed me to make sure I had received the product and emailed me back a few weeks later to make sure I was satisfied with the product.<br />Installing and folding the shade can be a bit of a challenge at first, but it's easy to get used to it after a while. I personally prefer this particular type over the hard ones because it's compact and does not take any space when folded. highly recommended!
B001DRNAV0|5|when i went to GM direct online the price was, well a little high! as you could imagine. for roughly half the price these were a little easier on the wallet and to my surprise these and the rotors where made in the U S A!!!. very good buy, don't go and buy sum china made rotors or pads cause these was actually cheaper(price wise) than what you would buy at your local autozone or oreilys.
B00AR3817Y|5|Installation was a snap. Twenty minutes. Started right up. Solved my problem!
B00D73177C|5|Good ones
B00NOA1V42|5|Adds personality to my ride.Can never find a better deal. Great transaction
B005YSRIQM|5|So far so good... fit as expected
B0044FCIHU|4|Rug was perfect for our camper.  Love the idea that it was super light weight.  Only suggestion I have is that it comes with the stakes to hold it down. whether people or need them or not it would have been nice to include them.  Overall very satisified.
B00LAEE28Q|5|Used this for my teenage son while learning to drive! People would actually slow down once they saw the sign!
B004T4U3NM|5|Great helmet for the money might be sized slightly small to there scale but did not need to return. would buy again
B0085IKAQS|4|Looked nice , easy to instal .
B006G3YNB2|4|love it
B00Z23J3QW|1|Shipping was quick and no damage from the seller but the VEI Systems gauge did not work i wont be buy this model again
B003X93N40|3|The engine Lift Plate may be Universal, but it will not fit a Chevy TBI.  The three hole intake manifold type.
B00H1IBH6K|5|Great product at an even better price.
B000BW8VUI|5|this is a nice set.  hopefully the material will hold up better than the advance auto parts.
B003YKTNOM|5|Fit on my 2014 Ram 1500 fantastic. Tough to get in, but they fit great, look great and work as expected.
B00DD1020Q|2|Not the color I expected
B00PCPO4Y6|3|The bottom cup doesn't stay on the windshield very well, but the top one is strong enough to hold it up.
B00BI3Q9ZI|5|I INSTALLED  BOTH FRONT BEARINGS WENT ON A 100 MILE ROAD TEST, ALL IS WELL
B00JLX9F5I|3|Don't fit good
B000LC87V6|5|nice
B006U3MTSM|5|I bought this for my Wife's 2009 Mercury Mariner and it installed and works perfectly.  The original blower started sticking and we'd have to peck on it to get it turning again.  The removal of the old fan and install of this new one took between 5 and 10 minutes.  Another reviewer mentioned that this blower makes a noise at the low fan setting, but mine sounds no different from the OEM blower I replaced.  At this point, I would definitely recommend this blower fan.
B00LDRA2O8|3|let
B00O5NX0J6|5|I have been buffing on cars and boats for over 20 years and have tried every tool, gimmick, polish and spray on the market. Surprisingly to me Meguiar's makes products in almost every category and this is no exception. (Their buffer is not the best but their liquid products are hands down the best)<br /><br />I have the Porter Cable 7424XP and have been using it for a few years. I have to say no matter what foam pad I try they are never even close to being able to remove oxidation from paint or fiberglass efficiently. I have burned up at least 15 of the yellow and orange pads trying to buff out paint so I decided to try the wool.<br /><br />I got the 6&#34; backing plate and some cheap wool pads from Amazon and they were okay but loaded up and turned into a hard clump in no time. I decided to give it one more try and ordered this pad when I was ordering some stuff online.<br /><br />At first it was a plume of wool everywhere what a mess! There was wool all in the wax, all over the car, my clothes, even in my mouth! I thought this was a huge mistake but I kept at it.<br /><br />WOW Okay so once the excess wool flies off the first thing I noticed is that the product does no build up in the wool. It disperses almost completely and the pad does not clump up. The second thing I noticed was IT WORKS REALLY WELL!!!<br /><br />Yes it works like a champ on my 05 black expedition which was pretty bad ...my reflection was almost non existent when I started. It was like a dream - I used the Meguiar's Ultimate Compound and the deep scratches were filled in, the water spots gone, and most of all it was a mirror image looking back at me.<br /><br />Cleaning - First of all there is NO build up you can just run it through with soapy water and rinse out no problem. I expect to get quite a few uses out of this one for once!<br /><br />PROS: Works Really Well!! Does bot build up on the pad and to clean it just rinse it off with some soapy water with your hands.<br /><br />CONS: A lot of wool flies everywhere when you first use it. I would not recommend using inside a garage until the pad is broken in.f wool flies everywhere when you first use it. I would not recommend using inside a garage until the pad is broken in.

B00062ZJ4O|5|Funny - I bought a 2008, CRV from my niece; used this product on it and she could not believe it was the same car when she visited a month later!  They wish they would have used this product prior to selling the car to us!
B000RG5UMA|5|very helpfull

B000P7O5DG|5|Charges great.
B003E3OFNI|1|They looked good but they would not fit my 2006 Toyota because the lug pattern was off even though they said they would fit,but the return was easy.
B005E0NE22|5|Delivered as promised. Thanks.
B00400EWVO|4|I give 4 only for the poor instructions not clear enough but over roll 5 good stars

B00QXDF3LE|5|All is well
B00D2HTIIS|5|i love the service they offer , and a great product .any problems they stand behind their product with no problems, I will order again if I need something else
B000CACMMM|1|Was fine all the way on our trip to Myrtle Beach.  Everything kept dry.  Folded it up after we got there and kept in the car.  When we went to load it up for the return trip the zippers would not zip on either side.  They just pulled apart after the zipper.  We put less inside on the way home because we did not want to put our luggage in with the beach stuff and get sand on it, so there was no reason for it to break.  It was not over stuffed.  There was no strain on the zipper at all.
B004YID164|5|This is the second one I've bought from DeeZee and installed on two of my trucks a Toyota Tacoma and a Chevy Tahoe. They are durable and well made.
B00KY98S3I|5|Great key fob cover!
B00U5VOBOU|1|Rip off! Thought it came with a steering wheel cover that's the whole reason I bought it.
B000F10LO4|5|Fit perfect!!!! Very well made!
B001O0XLOW|1|A lot of noise and vibration from these brake pads on my Lexus. I'm not happy with the quality, I have to buy better quality pads and pay again for labor - big disappointment and waste of money.
B00MXFHDDW|1|Listed as compatible with fusuion hybrid but doesn't fit at all
B00WISYCUQ|5|Five stars
B00OU67Z80|5|This is the brightest light I've ever used.  It easily shines over 100 yards out my back yard.  Amazing brightness.
B00M26XD7C|5|Fit perfect.  Works great.  Received quickly.
B003CX62IQ|5|Excellent car cover.
B004NSI3YA|1|No cooresponde
B006H34AE6|4|This brush is very effective for getting fur off the cloth upholstery and floor (anything fabric, not mats) of your car's floor.<br /><br />I had struggled with vacuuming and roller tape products to get dog hair out of my car, and this brush has proven the most effective for removing fur from my car.<br /><br />Its cons are that the hair does not stick to the brush.  The brush functions sort of like a sweeper to extract fur from cloth/floor services so while you brush, you still need to pick up clump of fur with your hands.<br /><br />An additional con is that if the fur goes into a tight crevice, e.g. the space between your car seat and the door,  it is not small enough to go into such tiny spaces so you're still stuck with trying to finding another option for that area of dog removal.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied since as mentioned, it has given me greater success than my Dyson vacuum or a roller tape product in removing stubborn dog fur/hair.<br /><br />I think this brush is car specific.  I don't think its the appropriate tool for inside furniture or clothes.
B002LCFDKC|5|I have a silver Honda CRV and this silver (mirrored) decal complements my car perfectly.  Great size, not too big or too small.
B000PCZZ6C|5|ok
B001DBTVGE|4|all good... make sure you get a good ammount of extra trans fluid for this sucker....
B00HEZ2GJM|5|perfect tool for what I need to do
B0002RNTSG|5|Works well to get down to the edge of the windshield to the inspection sticker.  Good enough
B005LD2ONC|5|I bought 4-5 of these. Use for work lights, LED's, testor rigs, off grid solar lighting.
B00CIVARYS|3|This is actually a REIN brand hose which is Continental's lower end &#34;value line&#34;.
B002MQCYO0|5|Bought this from a recommendation on a forum concerning the plastic window on my convertible getting yellow/hazy/cloudy.  I simply sprayed it on and wiped it in with a circular motion on the window section at a time. Huge difference and I didn't have to use too much for it to work. I know its not going to make the plastic window crystal clear and like new again but it did make a significant difference. In the photo, I did the passenger side first and then I worked my way inward with the drivers side on the second photo. I would definitely buy again.
B00FB6EOE6|5|Easy and bright WHITE right out of the fitted box.  Great so far.  Time will tell but I'm optimistic and pleased.
B0084UJGIA|5|These weather tech floor liners fit great.  It seems they will be easy to take care of.
B000CMDCKQ|5|Nice !
B00PXNC7K0|4|Awesome rack.  Easily carries four bikes, can be used to carry other items as well.  Had to return the first one as there was a defective part but Amazon quickly sent out a replacement.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00074Q29W|4|Exactly the same as the one I had before & lost it works great
B0060BELNA|5|Came in as promise, when promised.  Works well.
B00EA4JCGA|1|They don't fit all vehicle seats, don't stay in place, and the elastic straps broke the second time the seat was sat on.
B00ACOB4QI|1|Dont like it. Moister still gets in leaving the car wet.
B00404WDUC|4|Appears to be a good air gauge, but hard to fit on our Ford Escape. Air wants to leak and no where on product does it say made in the USA except on the tube, so hope the gauge is made here as it is advertised to be.
B007Y5745S|5|Second one I've purchased fits perfect, heavy duty works great
B0011FLODA|5|Good product

B00GG9FB8U|5|Absolutely fantastic product. I will buy again!
B00H3TQIWU|5|Great!
B00EIRAB78|4|These work pretty well. Once in a while they twist when trying to fold them up, but I can usually convince them to fold. I'm glad we bought these because they're light and small once folded.
B000C2UCMM|5|Correct hose for my Buick
B000FZ1TVY|5|Can't go wrong with these.
B000E28N7G|5|Great
B000CP8EYW|5|The best you can buy if you have added a big bore high compression or live in the desert. I have been using this for years and will spend the extra $ for what i think is the best.
B00CLV4YYE|4|Excellent
B000630JY8|5|Excellent fit and quality!

B00RV83UUG|5|Just right for my Polaris UTV.
B00BDVIU48|1|These seat covers do NOT properly fit my Toyota. Total waste of money.
B00RF0E47I|5|works perfect
B00AIJY2ZM|5|The previous owner of my Scion xA changed the license plate bulbs with cheap LEDs that didn't last long so i went ahead and bought these. So far they feel way nicer in terms of build quality and the lighting is a lot brighter. I'll update this review when these die on me.
B005DXNL0A|4|Kolpin Outfitter Box - The box is large and sturdy.  It is a good fit on a Polaris 400 HO rear rack.  Remove the rear rack for mounting the box so as to align the holes.  I mounted mine with 1/4 x 20 bolts through large washers under the rear rack into the center of the box and made up 4 compression fittings for the 4 Polaris attachment points on the sides of the box. Metal flat bars were used between the outside bolts inside the box and a 5&#34;x 5&#34; square of 1/2 plywood and aluminum bar were used in the center of the box and all were secured with knobs for hand tightening.  The two center mounting bolts were there are no Polaris mounting points were epoxied in place under the rack.  With the box removed the knobs can be reinstalled over the bolts so the protruding bolts are covered.  Aluminum bars were painted to match the box and installed outside to support wooden strips inside with eye bolts for attaching bungee cords to hold items in place,  The latches are the weak point - the latches pop open every trip, so I use a bungee cord to keep the box closed.  I am looking for something more permanent than bungee cords to hold it shut.
B00EMHTB5W|5|excellent .
B00BCRMC3I|4|I love this! Perfect fit for my car! Love the yellow! Will be purchasing for my other car! Perfect!
B001PYCQPW|5|Great product
B00KL0OTDS|5|Perfect fit, works great
B009DK80LY|5|Perfect
B000IJNM1C|5|Wonderful brake pads.  Will definitely buy these again.
B000GRS2G6|5|Great cover fits perfectly
B003B32UXI|5|If you have a stock fuel pump this will work but if its been replaced it won't. I was able to change out the components to use the old body with the new electronics. Otherwise this is the correct sensor. Good luck!
B005CQTHUG|5|Adds a nice touch of class to my car's front vanity plate.  The problem I have with the front mounted plate and frame is that they do not last.  This one seems sturdy.  We'll see how well it lasts.
B00AZ4PBVE|5|For the price, this is just what i wanted. The window visors made my volvo s 60 turbo look like Darth Vador!!! the visor kit also keeps my car that much cooler in the parking lot. slightly inhibits visibility with the dark smoke tint, but you will get used to it. just look both ways thrice, and look at the sidewalk too. yes look for folks on the sidewalk, people still use those things!<br />Pedestrian Awareness People!!! Get these, be cool be safe!
B009XS1ZY0|5|Worked great on my boat trolling motor battery.
B004YLU362|5|I absolutely love it
B00ML7G5X6|5|Very bright red LEDs.<br />I replaced another set of LEDs just because these were brighter.<br />For the previous LEDs, I had to instal a blocking diode on the running light circuit to keep the turn signal circuit from flashing the running lights.<br />If these are like the Aaron Amber 3157 LEDs, then a blocking diode may no longer be necessary.<br />Do check length.  They are long.
B00389UT3I|5|Really starting to like there product.
B002ULHJRY|2|I tried it on 2 different vehicle dents, both with no success. It was most likely the severity of the damage.  It was still worth the purchase, and an easy gamble for the price.  I am not upset I purchased it.
B000EDOSMO|4|Works as advertised.
B00UZL27KK|3|The cleaner seems to be great. However, the protectant seems to be very, very messy. According to the documentation, it's a pain to clean the protectant off the paint or glass so I had to take precautions before applying. I still had to clean up spillage because the nozzle didn't work properly. I'll probably try something different next time, I've heard the 303 High-Tech Fabric Cleaner is good. The car is a black 2003 Porsche Boxster S.
B00D8XCMMA|5|good product, works as advertised
B00DJBQ1SW|4|I have not used them yet but I like the fact that I can walk on them without slipping.
B00EKTJEW2|5|Perfect. Thank you. Fits my 2013 silverado perfectly.
B0064FC3W8|5|Great company great sticker!
B006D9W1JK|5|Solid quality materials. Mounted up just right. No complaints

B006MK5RNC|5|Nice tire cover on a black Jeep Wrangler Sahara
B00D931ZR2|5|Love it
B004K9JQXO|5|Trim gauge malfunctioned and did not show when the motor was down on the gauge. The old cam was a nylon ring that went around the tilt shaft. This looks like a better part made out of metal. Hope it stays on.
B01147QPP6|5|Order on Thursday evening had them Monday afternoon. dealership was quoting me 270-280$ installed for ONE light BULB!  Ordered from carID for a EVO brand for 65$. Continued my search and found these for a much lower price 18$ I believe for a pair. I ordered what I believe to be the 6000k. Box came in was plain white. The bulbs no labels or markings so I have no idea if they are the 6000k other than they do not match the picture for the 6000k. Instead they have a brown tube not like the pink one. The installation was very very simple took ten minutes to install both. So far they look great have not driven with them no reason to yet. Expecting to see a light blue tint eventually but happy with them if they are not just wish there was some way to tell.  Highly recommend at this moment, but like anything time will tell.
B00NWQ88MQ|5|I love the sticker - it shows how I feel about religion.
B0067UJDPU|1|Don't buy these!!!<br />These OEM coils are NOT Original Equipment Manufacturer it says Original Engine Management which for me is fraud. I wanted original parts.<br />However these parts are also poor quality and defective, after installing it I had cylinder miss fire and all kinds of error code. These coils burned through 2 sets of sparkplugs until I went to go to a shop and pay to diagnose them because I still assumed there is something wrong somewhere else.<br />Of course now I cannot return these parts since I have exceeded the 30 day return policy.<br />Amazon should not allow a vendor to use OEM if it is NOT Original Equipment Manufacturer but a cheap Chinese knockoff!
B00EWPVYMW|5|fixed the bike right up.  Don't forget to get the other brushes you will need beside this one.
B00I3RCKAU|5|Detroit Axle produces some great products.  The hubs were about $70 cheaper than the local retailer.  Detroit Axle sent me a different part number than ordered.  After doing some research, it was determined that the part number was a substitute for the original.  I called Detroit Axle and they were very helpful.  Steve informed me that the part numbers were compatible with my vehicle. &#34;Which I already knew&#34;  If I need hubs for another vehicle,  I will purchase from Detroit Axle.
B000C2WEIC|4|Good Price, came almost as quick as going to the parts store. Probably cheaper too.
B000C57LAA|4|Great price
B001N87K7O|5|Works well but too rigid for EPDM rubber seams. It tends to wrinkle during expansion and contraction.  My fault not the product.
B003YOXUT2|5|Received the item quickly and was an easy replacement for the stock unit.
B00EN4FZ0E|5|Looks good and came in a reasonable time. I haven't used it yet but we got another site cut too and it works fine thanks
B002RW244Y|4|They install quickly, we lost one on our first trip, so had to purchase a second, I recomend installing little Blind Spot Mirrors also for extra safety.
B00B2PZFWA|5|Very nice, fits prefect
B0027UO7PU|4|Worked great.  good prooduct.
B005JS2Z24|1|I received this item today to find the package already opened with a whole in the bottom. The springs had been taken out of the kit before the package got to me. In addition to the missing springs, the kit came with 7 clutch plates instead of 6. I bought this for my 1983 Honda Magna v45 and amazon says this fits my bike. After taking my clutch apart on my bike, I saw that I only have 6 clutch plates. (Which makes sense because its a 6 speed). But the kit came with 7. Overall terrible purchase. Wrong kit and missing parts. I'm currently in the process of returning it. Very pissed off because I took the bike apart today expecting to be able to put this kit in it. Now I have to wait with it all torn apart until the package gets returned and until the new one gets here.
B00V7RLSUQ|5|The product arrived as described, and the customer service was amazing!
B00MVMRS6O|5|Great deal for nice lights.
B00HFRQH1C|5|All Good
B00DRE5QGO|1|Very difficult to find anything.<br />Never will use it again.
B005XRPI3O|5|Well made and sturdy, I can't wait to install them when I get back home on R&R.
B00ZH00RTW|5|Great quality for the price.  All the tools feel solid and the light board has a long cord.
B00FB6EOE6|1|Poor quality, led burnt out in less then 2 months. Also caused my lights to flicker.
B0006N5RYK|5|fit perfectly - came with attachment cords
B000EALHH6|5|Amazing product. Took scuff marks right off sneakers whereas washing and scrubbing with warm soapy water couldn't. They look like new again.
B00BNFVQ6I|5|Very well made and looks great on my 53 bel air
B00EIIH6PC|5|- GOOD DEAL -
B008OIH5IK|5|very nice.  best price ever.  easy install. great performance. and best customer service ever.
B0089D9FDS|5|Fit just like the original. If you install this, get a transmission thermostat, cause it will likely break when you remove the old tank. It sits under the tank on top of the transmission cooler.
B0022XTZO0|4|Exactly as advertised great battery for the price
B00JE71W9I|3|Key different than oem but better in that it doesn't need to be glued.<br />however finding good a laser cutting business almost impossible.
B00NPPNJDC|5|works great
B00WIUB6FS|5|Great frame! It looks very nice on my car! The only thing I don't like is the writing on the bottom of it but other then that it's great!<br /><br />I was given this at a discounted price!
B0012S61IO|5|very very easy
B007FGGSX0|1|am returning --product not as described
B007NNZ9OO|5|the only bulb that would fit my 02 ram 1500 dash lights, fast shipping
B00CLUYFNA|3|They did not fit into the 2015 Chevy Silverado  hole as easily as it should have.
B009DJVY54|5|Purchased this to replace my dented bumper.  I called a local junk yard and they wanted $500 for a bumper.  I couldn't believe the low price on Amazon and I wasn't expecting the quality of this bumper compared to what the junk yard was charging.  When it came in I was surprised to see the high quality and that it came with tag light bulbs, light housings, and new connectors with wiring.  I didn't use the wiring it came with I used what was still on my truck.  But, I did used the light housings and bulbs.  Looks real good on the truck.  Made just like the original Ford part and I would definitely purchase again.
B00LEQBPHG|5|Right on time and product hasn't given me any problems
B004L04TD4|4|Pros: Fairly heavy duty. Shouldn't tip over in the wind/traffic going by. Came with a case to store it.<br />Cons: Case has two cheap snaps which don't really work well.
B0082365AQ|4|Everyone is correct about the tire smell. A bit LOUD! Otherwise a really decent carrier that I can fold down and carry on my Pungo kayak. I use my kayak for photography and I like being able to load it completely and not have to return to the vehicle.
B005OTF63I|5|These were genuine coil packs! They came super quick. Perfect for my MKIV.
B007Y867DA|1|I ordered this starter for my 98 firebird it started right up after instal worked great for about three startups... Now the solenoid is already weak causing the gear to grind into the flywheel instead of engaging it ... Very upset about this ... I have messaged the seller and am waiting to here back if I don't I will update telling everyone what a crap product and company your dealing with if they make it right you will here the outcome I hope it to be good
B001FZNDLW|2|Stem that goes into receiver rusted after 1 winter.
B000JNOLVC|4|Pros: Seems sturdy, instructions are adequate, reasonable price, and it fits well enough.<br /><br />Cons: Installation takes about 3 hours if its your first time.<br /><br />Background: I installed this hitch on my 2006 Mazda 6 Sedan last night. For my vehicle drilling was required but was not difficult. You won't need to lower the mufflers or trim the fascia. Some of the bolts were very tedious to tighten/loosen because of the tight spaces around the rear bumper (and would take hours without a ratcheting wrench). A floor jack would be helpful but you could manage without one if necessary.<br /><br />Tips: 1. Take a few measurements or line up the hitch to verify where each bolt will end up first, then get the hitch out of the way and make all the preparations.<br />  2. Once you're confident on where each bolt goes, read all the tips and steps on the instructions sheet.<br />  3. It is possible to get the hitch in place without lowering muffler but it takes some finesse. Lift one side up into place above the exhaust pipe then slide the other around the muffler by sliding it over the rear end up the exhaust pipe (bending the fascia/ plastic bumper cover slightly).
B008UOLOB2|5|Exellente
B0052SF0LO|1|does not work<br /><br />sensors for motion and light senor has stopped workimg<br /><br />ON 3 of these save your money<br /><br />fry digital one!! mkne is stay workkng
B004EKYB7U|5|Wish I'd ordered it first instead of trying to locate it at a brick and mortar store.
B00L7XCHZ0|5|These tail lights are styled very similar to the OEM Tahoe tails, such as the back up lights are in the middle, blinker on the bottom stop on the top, and they don't look cheap at all. They shine bright at night and very visible during the day. No need to add resistors to trick the sensors that a bulb is present due to the power consumption change, already installed with a small fan which is great cause those resistors get super hot. I was surprised at the low price cause these are damn good quality. Recommend for looks and functionality. Legit
B00IT6VJRA|5|Too Loose.
B000BRFGGA|4|Good quality!
B005JFW8VU|5|Great price even versus some local places.  Thank you again!
B000C5DU14|5|OEM product fits as factory replacement.
B003XNGLJU|3|ok
B000JZY61U|5|Excellent product.
B00APOFQYQ|4|It is perfect for my car.
B008Q5J7DC|4|Works fine, strong magnets, it seems the curved shape however wastes space.
B005CLMRCG|5|Perfect fit.  Looks very nice.  Am replacing the other handles to match.
B00HE673C6|1|Not worth it! Don't waste your $
B00BC3727S|5|This helmet fit exactly how i wanted to really low on my head looks great and is super light excellent buy for the money
B008Z262ZW|5|could not find rebuild kit and this is only $20. Worked great
B00NOAPW7E|5|Good product
B00499WWC2|2|The ONLY reason why this product is getting two stars is because it saved me a ton of money. I would have spent around $1,800 for the OEM part. Now to the review: 3 1/2 months after installation by Honda-certified mechanics, the weld at the front of the converter (next to the integrated heat shield where the pipe meets the converter) developed a large crack. (This is a direct-fit converter and does not require welding for installation.) The crack was large enough (encircling half of the pipe) to create a noticeable sound difference when idling. Upon inspection, the mechanic determined that the original, factory welds were made with some kind of sub-par alloy, which probably contributed to the break. Now I have to un-install the entire part and have all welds re-done to ensure I won't have this problem again. (Glad this didn't happen before I had to pass inspection.) To summarize: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT (OR ANY MAGNAFLOW DIRECT-FIT CONVERTER) UNLESS YOU KNOW HOW TO WELD, OR HAVE THE MONEY TO HAVE IT RE-WELDED. Now lets see how long this crappy part will last before it goes bad...
B0023E59IY|5|They weren't easy to put on had to be a little creative with gas pedal but once installed they looked great
B000E7YP7I|5|This is incredible. It's easily adjustable and moveable and anything you put in it won't move around or slide.
B002PYBZJO|5|I have had this about two years. It's very good product and an excellent value.  I have fixed about 6 or 7 problems on four family vehicles and also used it to accurately diagnose a transmission control module failure that I had the dealer fix. Nice to know what you are up against before you get there.
B00YHEIIQ8|5|Love this tool made the job easy.
B00MXFTOHU|5|Does this fit my 2013 dodge ram
B00FQ0RH8W|5|Fixed a trouble code issue. Easy to install on a 2007 Hyundai Elantra. Good value compared to other parts dealers.
B0080L2NOW|5|Nice look
B000N5Q2B8|5|I got this for my daughter she likes collecting certain key chains . She has just pass away last THURSDAY EVENING, she had that kidney problem. I will keep this chain in the memory of one of many things to remember her.
B007Y86FDC|5|good
B0002KR88A|5|Fits perfect but the quality of rubber isn't good.
B001QVAKHK|5|A bit small but I guess they worked my husband used them on a grand Marquis
B00JPVJ0KG|5|Looks great. Quality looks amazing as well for price paid. Overall very pleased.
B00XZ78W3C|4|Great product for the price
B00K4Q43ZS|3|It is what I purchased, but the quality was not as I expected or like others that I purchased
B001S80ZHG|5|Worked fine. Too about 45 minutes to install in my driveway while it sprinkled.
B000IG12PI|5|Loved them on my car seat
B0024E6W02|5|excellent
B00LG07MZE|5|Great value.  Fantastic customer service.  Will definitely buy again if and when needed.
B007X39P7G|2|I feel ripped off, for about a dollar more I could have got the 3.4oz size.......guess I should have paid closer attention.
B00ELHT5JU|5|got rid of a lot of lower end noise in my wheeler
B00LSTLVEG|4|Works just fine on B6 Passat Wagon.
B006JRLIVS|5|Exactly what I was needing.  Perfect fit.  Original  equipment quality.
B00N5UBQHS|5|Works great. Small and convenient.
B00CQ1Z2C2|5|Bought it for our golf cart. Gets a lot of smiles and comments as our boxer sits proud!
B0014KQJ1E|5|it worked
B005S47YRK|5|I have struggled trying to find seat covers online. Most of the problem is that they are made with a scratchy material that I really dislike. These seat covers are soft and durable and look great in my car. I love the seat pockets on the back of the bucket seats, I wasn't expecting that but it was a nice surprise! The only strange thing about these seat covers is all the zippers on the bench piece for the backseat. I'm sure there is a reason they are there, but there are so many of them it looks odd to me. I was worried about the comfort of passengers sitting back there, but everyone has said that you don't even feel them when you're sitting.
B00QL6PIZ4|2|I will never know how good this product is because it came without any install instructions or suggestions of any kind.  It would be so easy to include some type of instruction but they don't so I would never recommend this product
B007LIBO7W|5|Item received on time and works as advertised.
B0089D9FDS|5|It works for my bmw
B00O80Y39C|4|It wasn't want I expected, the fabric and letters are cheap, but it keeps my keys in place so it's alright.
B00L4NHW7Q|2|Hubby used for a trip to CO in the LX but they honestly did not fit. I am referring to the cargo as well as mats for front and back seat manufactured by same co. They stink like cheap Chinese plastic and did not really fit. Went directly to the trash after the trip. Hoping to buy from weathertech like the ones we have in the GX. Those are amazing!!!
B00FJ5LBOA|4|It works good thank you
B00OA9TWKQ|5|Item was a make-fit item for a different make of RV, and the small nipple broke when applied to my RV in an unorthodox way.  When I mentioned this in earlier feedback, I was immediately contacted by Winnebago representative who went out of her way to try to provide something that would work and a replacement for the adapter with the broken part.  I could not be more impressed with the Winnebago organization for their handling of this issue.
B008G2306U|5|Fast shipping looks way better than the factory ones that get clouded over time
B000BZLESQ|5|Fits 99cl 3.0.
B00KGMJ7LK|2|never got blue one and it cost 20.00 to ship one way so we had 2 of the same color for our twin grandsons Birthday.One kid was very upset and we showed him the order sheet and that zox made the mistake.
B000EQ2KTE|5|My cruise control and horn would only work when they wanted to, after checking the fuses, connections, and the usual stuff, I ordered this. Not knowing if it would do any good or not, but it was worth a try. I was a little nervous with the air bag, so after talking to a Ford mechanic, he reassured me it was not really much trouble to change. I got the tools and pulled the truck apart. Removed the steering wheel and unwound the old one just to see what had gone wrong. It appeared there was grease or some substance shorting out the circuit board. Anyway, I put the new one in. It was an exact fir, all plugs fir snugly. Put the truck back together and tried it out. The horn works perfectly, as does the cruise control. Just wish I'd have tried this before changing relays, horns , tracing wiring and stuff. Cured all my problems so far.
B001V8U12M|5|Works well, as advertized.
B00S5MSH6O|1|Uses proprietary nonstick velcro
B001UROU1M|5|Great for occasional passenger or spare backup summer motorcycle gloves. Also can double as weight lifting gloves. Not protective enough to be my main gloves, but great for what I purchased them for.
B00IV805NK|5|Excellent product, very well made. Perfect for my application.
B003YKC74A|4|Fit perfectly on my 2015 Polaris Sportsman ETX and easy to install.
B000MDZLR2|4|Package arrive intact and well packed. Fit right on the spare tire. It seems pretty durable and looks good. Sizing was exactly as described. Just measure your tire before you order!
B0009IK5YO|1|Did not fit my 63 Nova
B001DDW05Q|5|AWESOME! If you're looking for a set of adjustable foot pegs, the Kuryakyn Dually ISO Offset Pegs ARE IT! They look great and can be customized to find your perfect riding, foot position. I have mine set where I can either stretch out or place my heal on the floor boards while still maintaining contact with the pegs; it's like having them up on an ottoman. Why settle for a set of non-adjustable pegs, when you can ride in comfort in a position of your choosing
B00M063RC0|5|Purchased this with the appropriate mount for my street glide, intsalls quick, and seems to hold  down my note 4 really well. Also its roomy enough to hold an even bigger  phone or whatever you decide to  put in it so long as it contacts  the rubber inside the arms your device won't move.
B0000YOGXI|5|awesome
B000P6VMEC|5|An added sense of security for my motorcycle to deter thieves/vandals.
B000JFHNQA|5|Only booster PAC that ever works.. Buy one if you want quality that last
B000O0J0L6|5|As described
B000E2CVT2|4|It is an oil filter.  What else can I say
B00553L91G|5|Excellent
B0023RU8HS|4|Good
B004DRPOU2|5|Very good thanks
B00407WNE0|5|Easy install went on u-tube was very easy to install......looks much cleaner with door
B0013AV9B0|5|It lives up to reviews . Used it on vacation to keep  drinks and medicine cold
B00NRLCP7U|5|The items are of very good quality and arrived safely and quickly!  Thank you!
B000GUZ5LS|4|OK
B000I4UE2W|5|Bolted right on my 1987 f150 4.9 inline 6
B00GJKXW8M|5|Excellent value much better quality than I expected
B001PYTNUS|1|This was not a direct fit in my truck. I did use it but had to modify my brake lines and fittings.
B008B5X5GC|5|Perfect replacement for OEM sensors. 2010 Chevy Silverado 1500.
B00YE5Q132|5|I review dashcam products on youtube and had bought the allpower portable rechargeable car jump starter and had done a review on my channel. DBPower saw my review and reached out to me to send me this product for review.  Overall I really like this one more than my allpower because they function basically the same, but this one came with a nice carrying case plus it has the flashing red and blue lights which could be a very effective hazard light in the event of an emergency on the side of the road.  I have had to use one of these jump starters in the past when my car battery was dead, and after connecting it, the engine rolled for about 20 or so seconds and started up just fine. It could be very useful on the side of the road especially if you have nobody to contact to come help jump your car.  Besides that it is also a decent phone/tablet/laptop charger. it is a little bulky to carry around in a small bag but if you have a messenger bag or back pack, tossing just the battery and your usb charging cable isn't too much extra weight for a 12,000maH battery.  I have used this, the allpower, a t power plus (which is more for dashcams but can also jump start a car), and my stepdad had another brand (which is what got me interested) and this one is my favorite for all those features I listed. the ONE thing I was not a huge fan of was the aesthetic design. I liked allpower's battery aesthetic design much more as it looked more &#34;classy&#34; while this one looks a bit tacky with its fake chrome and patterned design. But this one is also cheaper while packing more features and accessories so I would take function/accessories over aesthetics.  check out my video review   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Z_1C-pqAiQ  I also used the air compressor, sent to me for review.  i love how small it is and I am going to replace my current air compressor with it. it is much more portable and the fact that with the dbpower battery it is cordless ( besides the cord between them) it makes it really convenient to use. I used it do fill my civics tire from 23 psi to 32psi in a few minutes.  check out my video review here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_vi8_FJFm4
B007PENKI8|5|great unit works well so far
B0032FOZRO|5|Worked perfectly on my town's Fire truck. No issues.
B00BX8SF14|5|Delivered on time.  Easy to install and looks great!  The fit is very good and the material seems very durable.
B0000AY2Z6|5|it helps when its hot and not near AC hook up
B00873J0YY|5|Really good price and look exactly the same as some a friend bought for twice as much. These are a better deal
B00AYHZLHG|5|Very strong mats
B007ECE1FM|5|This thing is great. Did a head gasket job on my diesel and put this thing through some abuse. It held up great and was a knee & lower back saver. Never once did it feel unsecure or wobbly. A true must have if you own a 6.0!
B00KX0P35Y|1|Very low quality
B00BMRRXSM|5|Keeps those beverages in the can, not all over the ground. Gave them to friend for his Bean Bag tournament, they were a huge hit.
B0037R6ZUC|5|Pads arrived on time.  The ceramic pads are definitely an upgrade from the OEM ones.  You can bet I'll be ordering ceramic pads for the the fronts when the time comes.
B0095D34YM|5|Great product. Exact match. Easy swap. Strong fluid pressure now. Came with replacement grommet too.
B00Y75QZD0|5|I picked this up to use in the car for when I go out for the day. It easily works for charging phones or tablets. I love the fact that it has a higher output than most of the ones I've seen for this price point. You can use a regular usb in the two ports are plug in another charger also. I also have a GPS and I liked that I was able to have that plugged in while I also had my phone charging. I have an Android phone and it charged perfectly, I also used this with my Kindle Fire as well as an IPad and it worked perfectly for them all It feels like a high-quality product, and it works as I hoped it would. I have been please with this product and would recommend it. I received this product at a discounted price in exchange for a review but this is my honest opinion of this product.
B005BTBI4W|5|good price
B001H1I7ZG|5|Great!
B00464GNBQ|4|Now in opposition to what some have stated about this silicone wiper blade I believe that if properly installed and prepped these blades work awesome. Prior to use you need to clean your windshield with alcohol and then let the Silblades operate dry for about 10 to 15 minutes. This puts a coating of silicone on the glass. I also use silicone based window washer liquid in the windshield washer reservoir like Rainx.  I have had a set off  these on my 4 Runner for over a year now and the blades have functioned wonderfully. I am installing a set on the wife’s BMW at next replacement interval.
B00SF8QDZ0|5|Bought this for my 1946 Chevy truck.  Nice look and layout for multiple fused circuit.  Has one positive feed connection that feeds each fuse.  Has the ability to fuse 10 circuits.
B00T8HPH36|1|The first thing it did not fit The second thing customer service was no help at all spend that kind of money for a worthless idem would not buy any of there products Fancy box and that's all , would nor recommend this product to anyone
B00BN5XVZW|5|The helmet is built to be sturdy and looks great. I actively use the helmet while race karting on the track.
B00B87L5U8|4|Turn black after 2 wks
B00ABZSC7M|3|not to great for me
B000C53R6M|5|Great shock easy install Monroe has great products
B006DZ2V1W|5|Works like it was engineered!  Expensive lesson learned.  Initially bought an aftermarket remanufactered alternator from O'Reilly ' s and it worked fine but my F150 ECM hated it.  Only put out 13.7 volts and kept popping p0620 diagnostic codes.  Took back to O'Reilly 's only to be told the alternator tests perfect and I had to live with the battery light and constant alarms.  Well.... that isn't the answer I wanted, so I purchased this Motorcraft from Amazon, installed it in 30 minutes and .......no more battery lights no more alarms or diagnostic codes.  This alternator puts out 14.2 volts and works perfectly.  Lesson learned.  Words to the wise,  only put OEM parts back in you vehicle.
B0049L5FWY|4|Parts came in a timely fashion. Very satisfied
B006X8B9U8|4|Easy 2 install....just bolt onto the original grill...love it..makes my vehicle sporty n expensive
B002J8RSLK|5|Very powerful. Will start most anything!
B0008F68BM|5|nice
B00D6YHKDM|3|The look good but it was not well fitted for my 2010 honda insight. You will need to trim it a bit because at the time of installation you only have one chance or else water will come inside your car
B00HZTKLL2|1|Totally misleading, they ship only one and it doesn't fit!<br />Look elsewhere
B000N3F7WA|5|It's a key...better then paying 80.00 for a hole new ignition switch the dealer was trying to sell me ...
B0068G0U50|4|OK
B0006SU3QW|5|I used this on my wife's BMW wheels and it worked great! It has held up for two months without any issues.<br /><br />I read that I'd need almost a full can for each wheel, but only ended up using two of the four cans that I purchased.<br /><br />Be sure to purchase the Can-Gun1 2012 Premium Can Tool. It will save your fingers and wrists from a lot of pain.
B009ES0U9A|1|Amazon was great but product was not so good. You wait in anticipation for it to come and it's defective
B00AC6X428|5|To this point in time, the brakes are great. It took a few miles to get them &#34;groomed&#34; to the disc but having accomplished that they are all I hoped for. I am making more use of the front brake. The Vegas has a great rear brake which I found myself using it more than I did on my 81 Goldwing. Normally, one uses the rear to transfer the bike weight to the front then use the front  brake the most. Anyway, the new pads are definitely worth the price!
B006R5C0G4|4|good product
B00I57VTWS|1|Does not fit Lexus IS300 (2004). Looks great but the thread does not fit.
B002DRAO36|5|has more jump than the original
B00171Q3HU|5|The washer was a  perfect fit for my truck.  It was easy to replace and hook up and worked great the first time I used it.
B00FBKSDDA|1|Got the package but there was an issue with one of the bulbs when it arrived I went to install it n found out that the bulb was no good so if there is any chance that I can get another pair or refund my money it would be greatly appreciated
B0032J1KAK|5|These are great put them on all 3 cars we own
B00G9BYDQ6|1|Very high price for what is mostly plastic. Returned it without even trying it out.
B004VRLGU6|2|Life the way it smell, fragrance just don't last long at all
B0095Y5OKI|5|well what can I say It works , i got it fast , not much else really to say .
B00D2QL0DU|2|Just did not work well.
B000NOO798|1|Followed directions to the letter except let rig run for 1:30 hours instead of the called for 50min. Didn't do a thing to help me with my head gasket leak but did waist my time and money. Seen all the hipe on You Tube and on line, had such high hopes. Claimed to be guarantied but no such luck if you buy it from online unauthorized distributer like you find here.
B000SXCLIS|4|Works great.. fit is good and priced right. A little confusing as to which is the front vs back. Mine came with a quarter size flaw in the fabric which makes me think its a factory second. It is still functional and is water proof. I would buy it again.
B00GUNXYMC|5|Great value for the price. I do not notice any fuel savings but it's great to have a washable filter that does not require oil.
B00C4ON3OU|2|Poor quality
B00FQ0ROZS|5|These 4 will light up your night! Killer lights

B008G38DL6|5|Thank you
B000AMXQDG|3|It works fine, but they have another tire shine gloss tire product that works much better. Thats what I thought I was buying.<br />The other Meguiar's is called INSANE SHINE. Now that product is the bomb!
B00QQYXI1C|5|Great product! Great customer service!
B009YY3TT2|5|PERFECT FOR MY BAR
B006L7OY76|4|Perfect for the horse lover in your life. It is a little thin material but it was packaged very nice and I think it should last a long time. Not the best quality but definately a good price for just a little gift
B009WEUZ3C|5|Love it
B00E1SL574|5|Product arrived sooner than expected. Great product.
B00HHGRMG0|5|Works perfect so far.
B00CEX5C9K|5|Haven't used them yet but, look compatible for the job. Well made
B005NLQAHS|5|Works well enough.
B00Q3JTQMU|5|Excellent did the job just make sure you measure the diameter of your steering wheel so you get the right size
B000W3RU9Y|5|These will get used eventually and are of excellent quality.
B007PUVYDK|5|Nice and small, not as long as the original and works great
B002J858HQ|3|It smells like leather but does not last very long.
B00XV7PXHO|5|A little goes a long way.  I used a small microfiber cloth.  It leaves a great shine and soft. Great product.
B004RNR9QY|5|Great quality hoses.
B00MB86KZI|5|Very Satisfied
B002P45NWE|3|Replaced our old ones in our RV with these as they looked the same. The color was spot on but they would not hold our drinks securely.
B00IWO4K8O|1|It did not fit my 1991 Cadillac or my 2005 Cadillac CTS. It said it would fit 95% of cars. So I then asked if my cars were part of that 95% and did not receive a reply. I went ahead and took the chance and lost !
B0002LJQKW|2|I purchased Connolly Hide Care at the recommendation of another website and I'm terribly disappointed!<br />Supposedly Connolly has been in the leather business since 1878 so I figured that it would be an excellent product... well I was wrong!<br />After cleaning my 2015 Jaguar XF Sport with the Coonolly leather cleaner which performed as well as was expected, I started applying the Hide Care with the same expectation but with very little success.<br />The only instructions Connolly provides is &#34;use sparingly&#34; and regardless of how much I tried to apply it would not spread on the leather and it left many smudges, although once the applying rag was saturated, it was well absorbed in a few areas but it still left a blotchy appearance unlike a similar product from Germany.<br />I remember someone suggesting to warm it up before applying so I tried that also without succes.<br />You would think that after 137 years and all the thecnical advances (we send probes to Pluto) that Connolly would develop a spray or something of that nature to apply their product. Very Disappointed so I would not recommend it!
B000IG20RW|5|It's grease, so performance is difficult to determine unless you can isolate it as THE variable that caused part failure. I use Lucas Oil 10301 on the universals and chassis points on all of my vehicles and equipment.  The biggest test for me-- a 35 year old Gravely tractor that gets pumped full of 10301 four or five times per cutting season.  This is an old, &#34;worn-out&#34; machine with thousands of hours on it.  Seals, bearings, bushings, and most other rotating/sliding pieces have had hard lives.  Even the slop from wear and tear, the metal-to-metal interfaces perform beautifully- no chatter, whining, or grinding.  Before I converted to the 10301 (about 6 years ago), the spindles chattered horribly. They operate much more quietly (assuming with reduced friction) when packed with Lucas. The X-Tra Heavy Duty grease flows nicely out of the gun and it stays put really well- even where seals are direly worn (or holistically nonexistent).  Other greases I tried in the past (natural and synthetic) were stringy and tended to sling everywhere. When they got warm, they got thin and migrated all over the place. The 10301 provides a really good blend of slippery and sticky that, at least for moderate RPM parts, even at higher temperatures, stays put.
B000TYMY9M|3|The product itself looks great. However the description makes it appear as though there is a gasket that comes with. And I received no such thing. So my car is out of commission until I can find a gasket that I can afford.
B00KVO63P6|1|Bought this ratchet to avoid spending money on a Snap On 3/8&#34; XL ratchet.  I thought that the locking head would be a plus for storage and for getting the ratchet into weird angles.  The ratchet mechanism itself seems well made but the locking feature on the angle head broke after 3 days.  Had E-Z Red replace the product under warranty, this time it lasted only a day.  Too bad, could have been a very useful tool!!  Save the money and buy a Snap On.  Lesson learned!
B00LG07MZE|1|to small for my titan
B002G5DLMQ|5|Decal came quickly.  Good quality.  Went on without a hitch.
B001D25Z18|4|I only know it fits and looks OK.  Have not installed yet.
B005C5F04E|5|Fit perfectly on our Waverunner 3 GP
B00L1RUUZQ|5|Much less expensive than OEM and work just as well. Good find.
B000CO88JY|5|What can I say? it's a socket and it works like it should
B0012XIV82|5|Love these! I will be adding more to the collection in the near future.
B001DCEXUC|5|Works perfectly in my 2001 Dakota

B00ZW65D5Y|5|Used them love them.
B0067UFOYO|1|This does not fit a 2002 toyota tundra. I had to send this back and end up buying one from autozone that did fit.
B001W0FSMM|5|perfect
B0018S1XRC|5|This roll bar extinguisher holder performs as advertised. After a couple months of daily driving and a few off road scenic trails the extinguisher is still snug and the red shows no signs of fading under the Arizona summer sun. I would say this Rugged Ridge product is a good value especially for those traveling remote backroads and desert trails.
B000N5U7BY|1|They send me other pre filter the picture is not the same i fell busted, not work on the raptor 700 se. 1 star cos cant send less
B00MOUBQ70|5|Perfect match
B005JCRFSO|5|good
B000E302FQ|5|The mirrors are what I expected, They are made of good materials and look good as well. They were shipped in a timely manner and were packaged as expected when they arrived on time.
B006GLEBIO|1|Junk!  Comes with no instructions,  no mounting hardware,  arrived at my house cracked,  brand new out of the box doesn't work correctly,  led steps are not the advertised length,  and each strip contains only about 20 leds. Literally these are going straight to the trash can and I will be disputing the charge.  I wouldn't pay 5 bucks for this kit.  False advertising at its finest.  Amazon should be ashamed for carrying this poor of a product.  EXTREMELY UNHAPPY.
B000182EZA|5|Discretely allows me to slightly leave windows open when parked in hot sun for hours.
B00M6RNQNI|3|it stop working after one week did like it when they worked
B001HJR9XE|4|Good item!
B000COCXA4|5|yes universal
B00BVB7XK2|2|The service that indicated that it would fit our truck was wrong.  The product may have been okay, but it was simply the wrong one.
B0006MRQYU|3|Seemed to do the job in our RV refrigerator first try. But this product is overpriced for how extremely cheaply it is made. Will not take much to break this unit.
B005OLPENI|5|I purchase first a blower from auto zone but it did a whistling noise<br />This one is fit for Honda cars

B004I6PYQC|5|does what I needed it to! Love it
B0042Z0XWY|5|excellent
B00K7U4CDE|5|Plenty of material.  Matched perfectly.  Figuring out how to get the console lid apart took some time but the actual product and ultimate installation turned out great.
B00L4FP2Q2|5|Received this as a trial product. On the first use the car dashboard looks new. I used it on all parts except glass in the front area of the car and it definitely looks/feels like new.
B004GF6MHU|5|The dealership wanted to charge me $450 to get this part replaced. Got this part for $140 and had it installed by a mechanic for another $40, so I saved a cool $270 in the process. The part is beautifully built and looks exactly like the OEM part on the other side. It also arrived days before I expected it. It's been on my SUV for a few weeks now and I've had no problems with it. I highly recommend it!
B000CD5Q72|5|this is the original part and it work excellent
B00GI2IJTI|5|C'mon its a panda with guns. Its a no brainer.
B00YV478P6|5|As published...my local locksmith cut it for me and programming was a dream!!

B00HMZEUV6|1|Misleading description. All washers in the package are aluminum. The sizes and qty are correct. Just all of them are made of aluminum.
B001AMH80C|3|Works as represented
B0002NIKFC|5|there r so nice i love them very good
B0026H81CO|5|Using this in my 07 BMW F800S.  My last battery was installed last July and died before the winter was over -- I think it shorted.  That was a Chinese-made battery I was sold by my dealer.  I paid less than what the dealer charged me for this Deka.<br /><br />When I received this battery I immediately noticed a quality difference.  It comes with a spacer if needed, was easy to install, and fired right up as soon as I turned the key.  So far it's been doing great.  Fingers crossed, I'll hopefully have this one about 10 times longer than my last.
B00K7HEI4K|5|Was fairly easy to install. Thanks!
B00HS1HOFI|4|Still having a bit of a light issue but overall the part works fine.

B007XE5LTG|5|works like it should at a nice price
B004RCP49O|5|Repaired a slide out seal on the fiver and so far, this product works great.  Used mineral spirits to help clean up and no problems.
B0089T0T46|5|Worked flawlessly and fixed my car's AC that would not work on setting 1 or 2 but did work on 3 and 4.
B00OTG4UT8|4|I've had this on my Surface since January (pictures are from August). I must admit I'm surprised how well it's held up. I'm a teacher, so this thing is constantly in and out of bags and cases, handled by students, etc. all the time. Sure, it's peeling in a few corners, but considering what I put it through and how little it cost, I'm pretty happy with it. Plus, it's really pretty to look at!<br /><br />I didn't have any installation issues. My decals were about as precisely cut as they could be, and I was able to lift them off if I needed to realign - didn't seem to mess with the adhesive much. I will definitely get another when this set is finally done for.
B000BZG8ZU|5|Product was as desceibed arived early. No complaints; can't wait to wire it. Thank You
B001TWD5KU|5|2nd set, first set lasted 15 years until someone backed into them.  I love these lights

B005DSOB5E|5|Very satisfied.
B00913FW0K|5|Worked fine for my 97 Grand Prix gt... As it should. It is a GM part.
